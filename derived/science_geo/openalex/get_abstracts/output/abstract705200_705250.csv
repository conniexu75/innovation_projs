https://openalex.org/W4310500669,"Background Cardiac rehabilitation improves prognosis and symptoms in cardiac patients. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cardiac rehabilitation services were temporarily suspended between April and August. We aimed to investigate the effect of cardiac rehabilitation suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic on patients’ exercise capacity and metabolic parameters. Methods Included were patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation following hospital admission for ACS. Exercise capacity, weight and body fat percentage were compared between baseline, pre- and post-lockdown visits. Results A total of 281 patients participated in the cardiac rehabilitation program prior to its suspension. Of them, only 198 (70%) patients returned to the program on its renewal and were included in the analysis. Exercise capacity improved significantly in the pre-lockdown stress test compared to baseline. However, there was a significant decrease in exercise capacity in the post compared to pre-lockdown test (8.1±6.3 and 7.1±2.1 METs in pre- and post-lockdown measurements, respectively, p&lt;0.001). Of the 99 (50%) of patients that demonstrated at least 10% improvement in exercise capacity in the pre-lockdown test, 48(48.5%) patients returned to their baseline values in the post-lockdown test. Post-lockdown assessment demonstrated a significant weight gain (80.3 and 81.1kg, in pre- and post-lockdown measurements, respectively, p&lt;0.001) as well as an increase in visceral fat level and body fat percentage. Conclusions Cardiac rehabilitation suspension for 4 months during COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant reduction in exercise capacity and increased weight and body fat percent. These findings highlight the importance of remote cardiac rehabilitation services that can continue uninterrupted in times of pandemic."

Twenty-one participants were randomly assigned to SAQ group (n = 11) or SSG group (n = 10). They were tested pre and post interventions on physical (5 m sprint, 20 m sprint and sprint with turns of 90°) and cognitive (inhibitory control by means of the Flanker task and perceptual speed by means of the visual search task) performances. Although no significant time x group interactions were observed, the main effect of time was significant for cognitive performance and 5 m and 20 m sprint, showing improvements after both SAQ and SSG. These findings highlight that 4 weeks of SAQ training programme induced comparable improvements in cognitive and physical performance with respect to a soccer-specific training programme based on SSG in preadolescent soccer players. Non-sport-specific activities targeting speed, agility and quickness combined with cognitive engagement (i.e., SAQ) should be useful strategies as soccer-specific activities to be included within a soccer training programme for promoting both physical and cognitive domain in preadolescent individuals."

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and investigate risk factors for the visual prognosis of the different types of endophthalmitis. Methods This retrospective study included 239 eyes diagnosed with endophthalmitis at the Pusan National University Hospital between January 2006 and December 2020. All patients were classified into six groups based on the etiology of endophthalmitis: post-cataract surgery, post-vitrectomy, post-glaucoma surgery, post-intravitreal injection, endogenous, and post-trauma. Demographics and clinical characteristics such as age, sex, laterality, initial symptoms, the interval between the primary causable event and diagnosis of endophthalmitis, initial and final visual acuity, management, and culture results were reviewed and statistically analyzed. Risk factors for poor visual prognosis were also analyzed according to the type of endophthalmitis. Results Of the 239 cases of endophthalmitis, the most common cause was post-cataract surgery, that occurs within two weeks post-surgery. Gram-positive Staphylococcus was cultured most frequently. Fusarium was characteristically cultured from delayed post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis (14 days–6 weeks post-surgery). Post-vitrectomy endophthalmitis occurred within 3.3 days post-surgery, but post-glaucoma surgery endophthalmitis developed a long period after surgery, averaging 2,742 days. Post-intravitreal injection endophthalmitis occurred most frequently following bevacizumab injection, and Staphylococcus was most commonly isolated. For endogenous endophthalmitis, the pyogenic liver abscess was the most common underlying disease, and Klebsiella was isolated most frequently. Post-traumatic endophthalmitis mostly occurred in young men. Advanced age and poor initial visual acuity were risk factors for poor visual prognosis ( P = 0.041, odds ratio = 1.024 and P &lt; 0.001, odds ratio = 3.904, respectively, using logistic regression analysis). Conclusion Advanced age and initial visual acuity were risk factors for poor visual prognosis in cases of endophthalmitis caused by various etiologies. Early diagnosis and treatment of endophthalmitis are required, especially in older patients."
https://openalex.org/W4310530534,"Key behaviours, physiologies and gene expressions in Anopheles mosquitoes impact the transmission of Plasmodium . Such mosquito factors are rhythmic to closely follow diel rhythms. Here, we set to explore the impact of the mosquito circadian rhythm on the tripartite interaction between the vector, the parasite and the midgut microbiota, and investigate how this may affect the parasite infection outcomes. We assess Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence and intensity, as a proxy for gametocyte infectivity, in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes that received a gametocyte-containing bloodfeed and measure the abundance of the midgut microbiota at different times of the mosquito rearing light-dark cycle. Gametocyte infectivity is also compared in mosquitoes reared and maintained under a reversed light-dark regime. The effect of the circadian clock on the infection outcome is also investigated through silencing of the CLOCK gene that is central in the regulation of animal circadian rhythms. The results reveal that the A . gambiae circadian cycle plays a key role in the intensity of infection of P . falciparum gametocytes. We show that parasite gametocytes are more infectious during the night-time, where standard membrane feeding assays (SMFAs) at different time points in the mosquito natural circadian rhythm demonstrate that gametocytes are more infectious when ingested at midnight than midday. When mosquitoes were cultured under a reversed light/dark regime, disrupting their natural physiological homeostasis, and infected with P . falciparum at evening hours, the infection intensity and prevalence were significantly decreased. Similar results were obtained in mosquitoes reared under the standard light/dark regime upon silencing of CLOCK , a key regulator of the circadian rhythm, highlighting the importance of the circadian rhythm for the mosquito vectorial capacity. At that time, the mosquito midgut microbiota load is significantly reduced, while the expression of lysozyme C-1 ( LYSC -1) is elevated, which is involved in both the immune response and microbiota digestion. We conclude that the tripartite interactions between the mosquito vector, the malaria parasite and the mosquito gut microbiota are finely tuned to support and maintain malaria transmission. Our data add to the knowledge framework required for designing appropriate and biologically relevant SMFA protocols."
https://openalex.org/W4310500583,"Customer churn is one of the most critical issues faced by the telecommunication industry (TCI). Researchers and analysts leverage customer relationship management (CRM) data through the use of various machine learning models and data transformation methods to identify the customers who are likely to churn. While several studies have been conducted in the customer churn prediction (CCP) context in TCI, a review of performance of the various models stemming from these studies show a clear room for improvement. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of customer churn prediction in the telecommunication industry, we have investigated several machine learning models, as well as, data transformation methods. To optimize the prediction models, feature selection has been performed using univariate technique and the best hyperparameters have been selected using the grid search method. Subsequently, experiments have been conducted on several publicly available TCI datasets to assess the performance of our models in terms of the widely used evaluation metrics, such as AUC, precision, recall, and F-measure. Through a rigorous experimental study, we have demonstrated the benefit of applying data transformation methods as well as feature selection while training an optimized CCP model. Our proposed technique improved the prediction performance by up to 26.2% and 17% in terms of AUC and F-measure, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4310500663,"Bioactive compounds are major reasons for the value of Eleutherococcus senticosus , which can be modified by different lighting spectra. Light-emitting diode (LED) provides lights with specific spectra which can interact with other treatments to impact plant bioactive production. Chitosan nanoparticle (CN) is a biopolymer derived from marine creatures. It’s usage may be a practical approach to cope with uncertainties in secondary metabolites induced by illumination. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cyclings link plant eco-physiological performance and bioactive substance; hence their associations may reveal the mechanism of joint light-CN interaction. In this study, E . senticosus seedlings were raised under artificial lighting spectra from high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps (44% red, 55% green, 1% blue) and white (44% red, 47% green, 8% blue) and red colored (73% red, 13% green, 14% blue) LED panels. Half of the seedlings received CN and the other half received distilled water as the control. Compared to the HPS spectrum, the red-light induced stronger shoot growth with greater biomass accumulation and higher water uptake but resulted in lower N concentration and biomass ratio in the root. The white light caused more biomass allocated to the root and strengthened stem C concentration. Stem eleutheroside B increased with shoot growth, while root eleutheroside B had a positive association with leaf C and stem protocatechuic acid had a negative association with leaf N. Having the CN treatment in white and red LED lights is recommended for increasing accumulation of bioactive compounds in the shoots and roots of E . senticosus seedlings, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4310522410,"Infrastructure construction related to the new generation of information technology and 5G technology is an important measure taken by the Chinese government to promote regional economic development. Large-scale infrastructure investment is being carried out simultaneously in China’s core and peripheral regions. The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a severe blow to China’s tourism industry, and the application of new technologies seems to blur the spatial boundaries of the tourism industry. Therefore, it is debatable whether the zealous development of large investment projects can really improve the competitiveness of the regional tourism industry. This paper discusses this topical issue by empirically analyzing data from 31 Chinese provinces and cities from 2008–2019 and draws the following conclusions (1) The continuous expansion of new infrastructure investment in China indeed has a positive effect on improving China’s overall tourism competitiveness. However, the inverted U-shaped relationship between the two shows that China should not blindly expand the scale of infrastructure construction and make appropriate investment according to the regional industrial development level. (2) Although convergent infrastructure plays an important role in regional industrial competitiveness, the marginal effect has begun to weaken, so the problem of scale inefficiency needs to be addressed. In contrast, the input of innovation infrastructure is insufficient to enhance industrial competitiveness and can be moderately increased to achieve better results. (3) China’s core economic areas have a good driving effect on new infrastructure investment, but the original technological innovation and transformation-type facilities are still the key to limiting the improvement of industrial competitiveness. Peripheral areas are more passive recipients with strong demand. Therefore, investment in various types of infrastructure can drive regional development."
https://openalex.org/W4310530028,"The correlation between personality traits and health outcomes of primary prevention has been examined. However, there is a lack of evidence on the association between the assessment of personality traits and medication adherence for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Thus, this study aimed to explore the association between personality traits and medication adherence, including compliance to prescribed medications and attitudes toward taking medications among patients with cardiovascular disease. This cross-sectional study included patients hospitalized for cardiovascular disease. We assessed the Big Five personality traits (conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, extraversion, and agreeableness) of each patient at discharge using the Ten-Item Personality Inventory. In addition, we evaluated four aspects of medication adherence using a 12-item version of the medication adherence scale: medication compliance, collaboration with health care providers, willingness to access and use information on medication, and acceptance to take medication. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the correlation between the level of each medication adherence domain and each personality trait. The data of 128 patients with cardiovascular disease were analyzed. Higher conscientiousness score was significantly associated with a high compliance score (odds ratio per 1 point increase, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-2.79; p = 0.001), high collaboration score (1.90; 1.31-2.76; p = 0.001), and high willingness score (1.74; 1.19-2.54; p = 0.004) after adjustment for potential confounders. Other combinations of personality traits and medication adherence showed no statistically significant correlations in multivariate analyses. The findings of this study suggest that assessment of personality traits, especially conscientiousness, may facilitate patient-medical staff communication for the improvement of medication adherence in patients with cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W4310500581,"The field of science communication has grown considerably over the past decade, and so have the number of scientific writings on what science communication is and how it should be practiced. The multitude of theoretisations and models has led to a lack of clarity in defining science communication, and to a highly popularised—and theorised—rhetorical shift from deficit to dialogue and participation. With this study, we aim to remediate the absence of research into what science communication is, for scientists themselves. We also investigate whether the transition towards dialogue and participation is reflected in the goals scientists identify as important to their science communication efforts, both in a general and a social media context. For this, we analyse survey data collected from scientists in the Netherlands using thematic qualitative analysis and statistical analysis. Our results reveal six main dimensions of science communication as defined by our respondents. The 584 definitions we analyse demonstrate a focus on a one-way process of transmission and translation of scientific results and their impacts towards a lay audience, via mostly traditional media channels, with the goals of making science more accessible, of educating audiences, and of raising awareness about science. In terms of the goals identified as most important by scientists in the Netherlands, we find goals aligned with the deficit and dialogue models of science communication to be the most important. Overall, our findings suggest we should be cautious in the face of recent claims that we live in a new era of dialogue, transparency, and participation in the realm of science communication."
https://openalex.org/W4310500592,"The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally is well over 400 million, however, the number of cases is showing a downward trend especially in developed countries largely as a result of effective vaccination against COVID-19. In developing countries, vaccination coverage is still very low as a result of vaccine hesitancy, which could be attributed to misconceptions about COVID-19 itself and its newly developed vaccines. This study assessed COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and perception amongst the adult population in Sokoto state, Nigeria. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Sokoto state among 854 respondents selected via a multi-stage sampling technique. Data was collected electronically using a set of structured questionnaire and analysis was done using IBM SPSS version 25. Respondents’ perception was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). Respondents having a score of 3 and below were graded as having poor perception and those having scores above 3 were graded as having good perception. Respondents’ ages ranged from 17 to 76 years, with a mean of 34.8±12.07; more than half [474(53.7%)] of the respondents were males, 667(75.5%) were married and 539(61.0%) had formal education. The majority [839(95.0%)] of the respondents had a good perception of COVID -19 vaccine; 49.9% agreed enough research would be required on the safety of the vaccine. The majority, (72.4%) expressed their willingness to accept the COVID- 19 vaccine (male 38.4% vs. female 34.0%); 410(47.4%) said they can spend more than one hour to get the vaccine. Significant predictors of willingness to accept COVID 19 vaccine include age (p = 0.006; aOR = 0.223; 95% CI = 0.077–0.645), education (p&lt;0.001; aOR = 1.720; 95% CI = 1.274–2.321) and perception of COVID 19 vaccine (p&lt;0.001; aOR = 0.020; 95% CI = 0.009–0.044). The majority of the respondents had a good perception of COVID- 19 vaccine and more than two-thirds were willing to be vaccinated with the vaccine.

https://openalex.org/W4310500608,"Cervical cancer is highly preventable with regular screening, yet over 4,000 women die from it annually in the United States. Over half of new cervical cancer cases in the U.S. are attributable to insufficient screening.Participants were 23 low-income, uninsured or Medicaid-insured women in North Carolina who were overdue for cervical cancer screening according to national guidelines. Semi-structured interviews examined perspectives on barriers to cervical cancer screening and on interventions to reduce these barriers. We also elicited feedback on three proposed evidence-based interventions: one-on-one education, coupons to reduce out-of-pocket costs, and self-collection of samples for detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the primary cause of cervical cancer.Reported barriers included high cost, inconvenient clinic hours, lack of provider recommendation, poor transportation, difficulty finding a provider, fear of pain, and low perceived need. Participants suggested interventions including reducing cost, improving convenience through community-based screening or extended clinic hours, strengthening provider recommendations, and providing one-on-one counseling and education outreach. HPV self-collection was most frequently selected as the ""most helpful"" of 3 proposed interventions (n = 11), followed by reducing out-of-pocket costs (n = 7) and one-on-one education (n = 5).Cost was the most reported barrier to cervical cancer screening, although women experience multiple simultaneous barriers. Novel interventions such as HPV self-collection promise to reduce some, but not all, barriers to primary screening. Interventions that work on reducing multiple barriers, including obstacles to receiving follow-up care, may be most effective to prevent cervical cancer among these high-risk women."
https://openalex.org/W4310500611,"Evaluating practice design is an important component of supporting skill acquisition and improving team-sport performance. Constraint manipulations, including creating a numerical advantage or disadvantage during training, may be implemented by coaches to influence aspects of player or team behaviour. This study presents methods to evaluate the interaction between technical, tactical and physical behaviours of professional Australian Football players during numerical advantage and disadvantage conditions within a small-sided game. During each repetition of the game, team behaviour was manually annotated to determine: repetition duration, disposal speed, total disposals, efficiency, and disposal type. Global Positioning System devices were used to quantify tactical (surface area) and physical (velocity and high intensity running) variables. A rule association and classification tree analysis were undertaken. The top five rules for each constraint manipulation had confidence levels between 73.3% and 100%, which identified the most frequent behaviour interactions. Specifically, four advantage rules involved high surface area and medium high intensity running indicating the attacking team's frequent movement solution within this constraint. The classification tree included three behaviour metrics: surface area, velocity 1SD and repetition duration, and identified two unique movement solutions for each constraint manipulation. These results may inform if player behaviour is achieving the desired outcomes of a constraint manipulation, which could help practitioners determine the efficacy of a training task. Further, critical constraint values provided by the models may guide practitioners in their ongoing constraint manipulations to facilitate skill acquisition. Sport practitioners can adapt these methods to evaluate constraint manipulations and inform practice design."

The participants were selected from the general population and outpatient departments. Kessler-10 (K-10) was used to assess psychological distress.The magnitude of psychological distress among people living with chronic medical illness and those from the general population was 62.0% and 35.1%, respectively. The odds of psychological distress in people living with chronic medical illness was three times more than the one in the general population. Divorced marital status, family history of chronic medical illness, and low social support were statistically significantly associated with psychological distress in both groups.The magnitude of psychological distress was significantly higher among people living with chronic medical illness. Routine screening of such cases for psychological distress during their visits for their medical illness helps take appropriate therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4310500656,"Aging is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease which is often accompanied by a decline in vascular health and function. Current evidence suggests that berries may have a potential role in the modulation of vascular function, but dietary interventions are still needed to confirm findings, especially in older subjects. In the context of the MIND FoodS HUB project, this study aims to investigate the effect of a single serving of blueberry (250 g of blueberry versus a control product) in a group of older subjects (≥ 60y) through a randomized, controlled, cross-over dietary intervention trial. Specifically, the study evaluates the absorption kinetics of bioactives following the blueberries intake and the effects on markers related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular function analyzed at different time points. By considering a drop-out rate estimate of 25%, at least 20 subjects will be recruited in the study. The study will provide evidence to support the potential beneficial effects of blueberry and its bioactive compounds on vascular function in a group of population more susceptible to vascular dysfunction and to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, the study will contribute the analysis of several metabolic and functional markers that can support the biological plausibility of the results obtained. Finally, the trial will provide data on the absorption and metabolism of blueberry bioactives which will be used to study their association with the different markers under study.

https://openalex.org/W4310500659,"A non-contrast cranial computer tomography (ncCT) is often employed for the diagnosis of the early stage of the ischemic stroke. However, the number of false negatives is high. More accurate results are obtained by an MRI. However, the MRI is not available in every hospital. Moreover, even if it is available in the clinic for the routine tests, emergency often does not have it. Therefore, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework for detection and segmentation of the brain infarct on the ncCT. The computer tomography perfusion (CTp) is used as the ground truth. The proposed ensemble model employs three deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) to process three end-to-end feature maps and a hand-craft features characterized by specific contra-lateral features. To improve the accuracy of the detected infarct area, the spatial dependencies between neighboring slices are employed at the postprocessing step. The numerical experiments have been performed on 18 ncCT-CTp paired stroke cases (804 image-pairs). The leave-one-out approach is applied for evaluating the proposed method. The model achieves 91.16% accuracy, 65.15% precision, 77.44% recall, 69.97% F1 score, and 0.4536 IoU."

Separation of naproxen and its main metabolite 6-O-desmethylnaproxen was performed in a Shim-Pack XR-ODS 75Lx2.0 column and C18 pre-column at 40°C using a mixture of methanol and ammonium acetate 10 mM (70:30, v/v) with an injection rate of 0.3 ml/min. The total analytical run time for each sample was 5 min. The association of naproxen with esomeprazole take considerably longer time to reach the maximum concentration [Tmax 0.17 h (interquartile range, 0.13-1.95) for naproxen alone and 13.18*h (interquartile range, 10.12-27.15) for naproxen with esomeprazole, p = 0.002], also to be eliminated [T1/2 0.12 h (interquartile range, 0.09-1.35) for naproxen alone and 9.16*h (interquartile range, 7.16-41.40) for naproxen with esomeprazole, p = 0.002] and lower maximum concentrations (Cmax 4.6 ± 2.5 ug/mL for naproxen alone and 2.04 ± 0.78* μg/mL, p = 0.038). The association of naproxen with esomeprazole showed increased values of AUC0-t [82.06* h*μg/mL (interquartile range, 51.90-157.00) with esomeprazole and 2.97 h*μg/mL (interquartile range, 1.82-7.84) naproxen alone, p = 0.002] in drug concentrations in relation to the naproxen tablet alone, probably, such differences are due to the delay in the absorption of naproxen when it is associated with the drug proton pump inhibitor, esomeprazole. As well as reduced values of full clearance when naproxen is combined with esomeprazole (0.07* μg/h (interquartile range, 0.005-0.01) with esomeprazole and 7.29 μg/h (interquartile range, 3.17-16.23) in naproxen alone, p = 0.002).

https://openalex.org/W4310500752,"Pregnancy loss, including miscarriage and stillbirth, affects 15–20% of pregnancies in the United States (US) annually. Accumulating evidence suggests that pregnancy loss is associated with a greater cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden later in life. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of pregnancy loss on CVD risk factors in early adulthood (age &lt;35 years). The aim of this study was to examine associations between pregnancy loss and CVD risk factors (body mass index, blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, diabetes status) in early adulthood. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using the public-use dataset for Wave IV (2007–2009) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Our sample consisted of women, ages 24–32 years, with a previous pregnancy who completed biological data collection (n = 2,968). Pregnancy loss was assessed as any history of miscarriage or stillbirth; and quantified as none, one, or recurrent (≥2) pregnancy loss. Associations between pregnancy loss and each CVD risk factor were tested using linear and logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographic factors, parity, health behaviors during pregnancy, and depression. We tested for interactions with race/ethnicity. A total of 670 women reported a pregnancy loss, of which 28% reported recurrent pregnancy loss. A prior pregnancy loss was related to a 3.79 (kg/mm 2 ) higher BMI in non-Hispanic Black women, but not white women. Women with recurrent pregnancy loss were more likely to have prediabetes (AOR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.10–3.37, p&lt;0.05) than women with all live births. Findings suggest that pregnancy loss may be associated with a more adverse CVD risk profile in early adulthood, particularly for women who experience recurrent pregnancy loss. This highlights the need for CVD risk assessment in young women with a prior pregnancy loss. Further research is necessary to identify underlying risk factors of pregnancy loss that may predispose women to CVD."

Objective This study aims to compare the efficacy of 6-week isokinetic strength training and Thera-Band strength training on improving ankle strength, dynamic balance ability, and function in individuals with FAI. Methods Fifty-two FAI patients were randomized into two treatment groups: an isokinetic strength training (IST, n = 26) group and a Thera-Band resistance training (TBT, n = 26) group. The IST group engaged in isokinetic concentric strength training with inversion, eversion, dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion, whereas the TBT group engaged in progressive resistance training with Thera-Band three times per week for six weeks. Before and after the training, an isokinetic concentric strength test of the involved ankle joint, Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) function assessment were performed. Results After six weeks of intervention, the strength of inversion and eversion was significantly improved in both the IST and TBT groups ( p &lt; 0.05), with the IST group exhibiting a significant ( p &lt; 0.05) improvement when compared to the TBT group. The SEBT and CAIT results were significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) improved in the IST group compared to the TBT group. Conclusions The six-week of isokinetic strength training is more effective than the Thera-Band progressive resistance training in improving the physical function of FAI patients.

https://openalex.org/W4310507036,"While malaria morbidity has sharply declined in several areas in Senegal, it remains an important problem in the southern part of the country, particularly among adolescents. Understanding adolescents' knowledge, attitudes, prevention and care-seeking practices is important to inform more targeted interventions aimed at optimizing adolescents' uptake of malaria prevention and control measures. This study assessed malaria-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among adolescents living in a highly persistent transmission area in Senegal.A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 391 adolescents living in the Saraya health district. A multistage random sampling technique was used to select households. An electronic questionnaire developed on Open Data Kit (ODK), was used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, household assets, adolescents' knowledge of malaria, as well as their attitudes with regards to malaria prevention, and care-seeking behaviors. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess factors associated with adolescents' KAP towards malaria.Nearly, one-third of the participants had good knowledge of malaria (34.4%) and good practice in regards to malaria preventive measures (32.8%) while 59.0% had a positive attitude and 73.8% had good care-seeking behavior regarding malaria. Multivariate analysis revealed that a primary (aOR = 5.43, p = 0.002) or secondary level of education (aOR = 10.41, p = 0.000) was associated with good knowledge of malaria transmission, signs, and prevention measures. Male individuals had lower knowledge compared to female ones (aOR = 0.40, p = 0.001). Individuals belonging to households from the highest wealth quintile were more likely to have a positive attitude towards malaria compared to those from households in the lowest wealth quintile (aOR = 3.49, p = 0.004). The odds of positive attitude towards malaria decreased among participants with koranic and primary education level, respectively (aOR = 0.14, p = 0.005) and (aOR = 0.24, p = 0.019). A positive attitude was 1.89 more likely to be (aOR = 1.89, p = 0.026) associated with good practice of prevention measures compared to adolescents who demonstrated negative attitudes. Individuals from households in the fourth (aOR = 0.42, p = 0.024), middle (aOR = 0.34, P = 0.005), and second (aOR = 0.42, p = 0.027) wealth quintiles were less likely to use malaria prevention measures compared to those from households in the highest wealth quintile.The study revealed that adolescents, generally have poor levels of malaria knowledge and low uptake of malaria prevention and control interventions. Targeted interventions for high-risk adolescents are needed, that focus on improving their knowledge of the disease and effective preventive measures, and on increasing their access to health care services and LLINs."
https://openalex.org/W4310522154,"Pseudogymnoascus destructans is a fungal pathogen responsible for a deadly disease among North American bats known as white-nose syndrome (WNS). Since detection of WNS in the United States in 2006, its rapid spread and high mortality has challenged development of treatment and prevention methods, a significant objective for wildlife management agencies. In an effort to mitigate precipitous declines in bat populations due to WNS, we have developed and implemented a multi-year mitigation strategy at Black Diamond Tunnel (BDT), Georgia, singly known as one of the most substantial winter colony sites for tricolored bats (Perimyotis subflavus), with pre-WNS abundance exceeding 5000 individuals. Our mitigation approach involved in situ treatment of bats at the colony level through aerosol distribution of antifungal volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that demonstrated an in vitro ability to inhibit P. destructans conidia germination and mycelial growth through contact-independent exposure. The VOCs evaluated have been identified from microbes inhabiting naturally-occurring fungistatic soils and endophytic fungi. These VOCs are of low toxicity to mammals and have been observed to elicit antagonism of P. destructans at low gaseous concentrations. Cumulatively, our observations resolved no detrimental impact on bat behavior or health, yet indicated a potential for attenuation of WNS related declines at BDT and demonstrated the feasibility of this novel disease management approach."
https://openalex.org/W4310529895,"Background Promoting physical activity (PA) for university students is essential as PA levels decrease during the transition from secondary to higher education. Providing technology-supported university courses targeting students’ PA levels may be a viable option to combat the problem. However, it is still unclear how and what technologies should be implemented in university courses to promote PA. This study aims to create a series of design principles for technology-supported physical education courses that aim to increase university students’ PA knowledge, motivation and levels. Method The proposed methodology underpinning the research program is a seven-phase design-based research (DBR) approach, with the seven phases encompassed in four sequential studies. These four studies are a systematic review, a qualitative focus group study, a pilot study, and a randomised controlled trial (RCT) study. The protocol paper aims to detail the plan for conducting the four studies in a comprehensive and transparent manner, thus contributing to the methodological evidence base in this field. Discussion Design principles generated from this project will contribute to the growing evidence focusing on effective design and implementation features. Future practitioners can also use these to develop physical education courses that aim to promote university students’ physical activity levels, knowledge, and motivation.

https://openalex.org/W4310530015,"Body condition for reproduction in capital breeders such as the red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) is mostly determined by their stored energy reserves. Thus, environmental conditions and resource availability may affect reproductive performance and breeding success. In warm Mediterranean regions, current climate change is driving to a hotter and drier scenario that is expected to affect the biology and dynamics of many populations. We examined the impact of these local climate variations on red deer body condition and the relationship with female reproductive phenology and breeding success. We used satellite information of landscape vegetation along with a 22-year data series of direct field behavioural observations during the rutting season in Doñana National Park (SW Spain). We analyzed faecal nitrogen content (FN) from faeces collected during the rut. We found that poor vegetation availability in drier years was related to worse body condition of deer (measured by FN) and a delay in the rutting season, which associated with lower reproductive rates (measured by the proportion of females with calves observed the next year). We also evidenced an interesting interaction between environmental conditions in consecutive years on the timing of breeding season, with timing of breeding being more delayed when previous year resource availability was high and many females bred, and the consecutive one was poor, so females hardly recovered condition and the rut occurred later. These findings highlight the carry-over effect of reproduction in capital breeders and the potential impact of climate-change conditions on red deer breeding."
https://openalex.org/W4311068685,"Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2I (LGMDR9) is one of the most common LGMD characterized by defects in glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (matriglycan) resulting from mutations of Fukutin-related protein (FKRP). There is no effective therapy currently available. We recently demonstrated that ribitol supplement increases levels of matriglycan in cells in vitro and in FKRP-P448L ( P448L ) mutant mouse model through drinking water administration. To be clinically relevant, we have now conducted a dose-escalating efficacy study by gavage in P448L mutant mice. Six months of ribitol treatment daily significantly rescued functions of skeletal, respiratory, and cardiac muscles dose-dependently. This was associated with a dose dependent increase in matriglycan and improvement in muscle pathology with reductions in muscle degeneration, inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis. Importantly, ribitol significantly increased life span and muscle functions of the female animals receiving treatment from 10 months of age. The only observed side effect was gastrointestinal tract bloating with loose stool and this effect is also dose dependent. The results validate the mechanism that ribitol as a pre-substrate of glycosyltransferase is able to compensate for the decreased function of mutant FKRP with restoration of matriglycan expression and provide a guidance for future clinical trial design."
https://openalex.org/W4311068687,"The skills and knowledge needed to recognize and classify taxa are becoming increasingly scarce in the scientific community. At the same time, it is clear that these skills are strongly needed in biodiversity monitoring for management and conservation, especially when carried out by citizen scientists. Formalizing the required knowledge in the form of digital identification keys is one way of making such knowledge more available for professional and amateur observers of biodiversity. In this paper we describe Clavis, an open and versatile data format for capturing the knowledge required for taxon identification through digital keys, allowing for a level of detail beyond that of any current key format. We present the format independently from any particular implementation, as our aim is for Clavis to serve as a basis for interoperable tools and interfaces serving different needs and actors."
https://openalex.org/W4311068755,"There are currently no preventive or disease-modifying therapies for Parkinson's Disease (PD). Failures in clinical trials necessitate a re-evaluation of existing pre-clinical models in order to adopt systems that better recapitulate underlying disease mechanisms and better predict clinical outcomes. In recent years, models utilizing patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have emerged as attractive models to recapitulate disease-relevant neuropathology in vitro without exogenous overexpression of disease-related pathologic proteins. Here, we utilized iPSC derived from patients with early-onset PD and dementia phenotypes that harbored either a point mutation (A53T) or multiplication at the α-synuclein/SNCA gene locus. We generated a three-dimensional (3D) cortical neurosphere culture model to better mimic the tissue microenvironment of the brain. We extensively characterized the differentiation process using quantitative PCR, Western immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining. Differentiated and aged neurospheres revealed alterations in fatty acid profiles and elevated total and pathogenic phospho-α-synuclein levels in both A53T and the triplication lines compared to their isogenic control lines. Furthermore, treatment of the neurospheres with a small molecule inhibitor of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) attenuated the protein accumulation and aberrant fatty acid profile phenotypes. Our findings suggest that the 3D cortical neurosphere model is a useful tool to interrogate targets for PD and amenable to test small molecule therapeutics."

This study explored the social construction of genomics in ocular diseases in the blind community in Ibadan, Nigeria, through two focus group discussions and twelve in-depth interview sessions conducted among people living with ocular disorders. The data were thematic and content-analysed. Although the participants had limited knowledge about ocular diseases, genomics, and their nexus, they maintained a positive attitude toward its potential benefits. This informed their willingness to participate in genomics testing for ocular diseases. The participants preferred saliva-based sample collection over blood-based, and expressed concern for the procedure and accrued benefits of genomics studies. Thus, public sensitisation about ocular diseases and client-centred genomics testing procedures should be engendered."
https://openalex.org/W4311069073,"The aim of this study was to assess two patient-based outcomes of complete denture (CD) wearers who continued or discontinued using denture adhesive (DA) after one-month run-in period of DA use.This quasi-experimental study comprised 76 CD wearers. The two patient-based outcomes were oral health-related quality of life and masticatory performance, determined by the Thai-version of oral impacts on daily performances index and multiple sieve method of 20-stroke peanut mastication. Denture retention and stability were evaluated using the CU-modified Kapur criteria to classify the CD into acceptable or unacceptable quality. The outcomes were collected at 3 time points: 1) at baseline (T0), 2) after a 1-month run-in period of DA use (T1), at which time the participants decided whether to continue using DA, and 3) 1-month after continuing or discontinuing using DA (T2). Changes in the percentages of having an oral impact from T0 to T2 were evaluated using the McNemar's test. The effect of denture quality and the decision to use DA on peanut particle size across time points were assessed using repeated measures ANOVA. The peanut particle size changes in each group between time points were evaluated using the one-way repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc comparison test.The participants who continued using DA at T2 had greater oral impact reduction after the 1-month run-in period of DA use, whereas cleaning and emotional impacts emerged in those who discontinued using DA. At T1 and T2, the peanut particle size of the participants who continued and discontinued using DA was not significantly changed from T0, except for the acceptable CD wearers who discontinued using DA at T2, whose peanut particle size decreased from T0 to T2.Baseline oral impacts and their change influenced CD wearers' decision whether to continue using DA. However, masticatory performance did not affect the patients' decision."
https://openalex.org/W4310500571,"Cloning in software is generally perceived as a threat to its maintenance and that is why it needs to be managed properly. Understanding clones from a historical perspective is essential for effective clone management. Analysis of code refactorings performed on clones in previous releases will help developers in taking decisions about clone refactoring in future releases. In this paper we perform a longitudinal study on the evolution of clone refactorings in various versions of five software systems. To perform a systematic study on clone refactoring evolution, we define clone evolution patterns for studying refactorings in a formal notation. Our results show that only a small proportion of code clones are refactored between the versions and most of the refactorings are inconsistent within clone classes. Moreover, clone refactorings may cause clone removal. Analysis of the source code of refactored clones reveals similar reasons of inconsistent refactorings and clone removal for five Java systems. This analysis will help in devising appropriate strategies for managing clone refactorings in software and hence provide foundation for devising better clone management tools."
https://openalex.org/W4310500582,"In karst regions, the majority of studies have focused on ecosystem carbon sequestration in the same lithology, but no studies in different lithologies. In this study, actual measurements were used to reveal carbon sequestration characteristics of two plantation forest ecosystems (Bodinieri cinnamon and Cupressus funebris) with different lithologies of karst. The results showed that the tree layer showed the highest vegetation biomass, carbon content, carbon density, and ratio of aboveground biomass to belowground biomass. The carbon density of B. cinnamon plantation and C. funebris plantation was high in dolomite and in limestone respectively. The soil quality and carbon density of bare ground and plantation varied across different lithologies. The carbon density of various ecosystem components was in the order of vegetation>soil>litterfall. The carbon density and net carbon density of plantation varied across different lithologies. In B. cinnamon plantation, the carbon sequestration rate of vegetation and ecosystem was high in dolomite, moderate in limestone, and low in dolomitic sandstone. In Cupressus funebris plantation, the carbon sequestration rate was in the order of limestone>dolomite>dolomitic sandstone. These findings revealed that lithology is an important factor affecting ecosystem carbon pools, and plantation ecosystems have low biomass and low carbon density in karst areas."
https://openalex.org/W4310500603,"Background Initiation of anti-osteoporosis medications after hip fracture lowers the risk of subsequent fragility fractures. Historical biases of targeting secondary fracture prevention towards certain groups may result in treatment disparities. We examined associations of patient age, sex and race with anti-osteoporosis medication prescription following hip fracture. Methods A cohort of patients with a hip fracture between 2016–2018 was assembled from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program registry. Patients on anti-osteoporosis medications prior to admission were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine adjusted associations between patient age, sex and race and their interactions with prescription of anti-osteoporosis medications within 30 days of surgery. Results In total, 12,249 patients with a hip fracture were identified with a median age of 82 years (IQR: 73–87), and 67% were female (n = 8,218). Thirty days postoperatively, 26% (n = 3146) of patients had been prescribed anti-osteoporosis medication. A significant interaction between age and sex with medication prescription was observed (p = 0.04). Male patients in their 50s (OR:0.75, 95%CI:0.60–0.92), 60s (OR:0.81, 95%CI:0.70–0.94) and 70s (OR:0.89, 95%CI:0.81–0.97) were less likely to be prescribed anti-osteoporosis medication compared to female patients of the same age. Patients who belonged to minority racial groups were not less likely to receive anti-osteoporosis medications than patients of white race. Interpretation Only 26% of patients were prescribed anti-osteoporosis medications following hip fracture, despite consensus guidelines urging early initiation of secondary prevention treatments. Given that prescription varied by age and sex, strategies to prevent disparities in secondary fracture prevention are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4310500662,"Climate change brings an increase in temperatures and a higher frequency of heatwaves. Both have been linked to a rise in suicide rates and violent crime on a population level. However, little is known about the link between mental health and ambient temperatures on an individual level and for particular subgroups. Overheating poses health risks to children and disturbs sleep; leading to the expectation that parents are more worried about their homes getting too hot than non-parents. Two online survey studies (N = 1000 each) were conducted in the UK and the US to understand to what extent parents and an age-matched comparison group without children are worried about overheating and how they differ in their mitigation actions. Findings did not support the main hypotheses around greater overheating worry amongst parents in general, mothers or those with very young children. However, parents indicated a greater likelihood to upgrade or install air-conditioning (US) and to get electric fans (UK). Parents in the UK indicated using more mitigation options to cope with overheating than non-parents. Parents in the US, whilst not reporting doing more actions, were more likely to use air-conditioning to deal with overheating than non-parents. Finally, those parents who mentioned health impacts on children as a reason for worry about overheating, were more concerned about overheating than parents who had other reasons than children’s health as a reason for being concerned about overheating. In summary, parental status might have implications for cooling energy use and concern for children’s health might increase overheating worry; however, many open questions remain."
https://openalex.org/W4310500686,"Background and aims Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to bile duct strictures, cholestasis, and biliary cirrhosis. PNPLA3 (patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3), regulates cellular lipid synthesis by converting lysophosphatidic acid into phosphatidic acid. Isoleucine mutation to methionine at position 148 (I148M) causes a loss of this function. Only two studies, with contradictory results, have evaluated the role of PNPLA3 in PSC. The rs738409(G) variant of PNPLA3 has been associated with an increased risk for transplantation in male patients with dominant strictures (DS). The study aimed to evaluate the PNPLA3 allele frequency effect on the clinical outcomes, progression, and prognosis of PSC. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of PNPLA3 on phospholipid and bile acid composition to evaluate the effect of the PNPLA3 status on UDCA response. Patients and methods We recruited 560 patients prospectively and collected clinical and laboratory data as well as liver histology and imaging findings. PNPLA3 (CC, CG, GG) alleles were analyzed with TaqManTM. We also analyzed bile acids (BA), cholesterol and phospholipids and individual BA from a sample aspirated during endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC). Results Among the recruited patients, 58.4%, 35.7% and 5.9% had the wild (CC), heterozygous (CG) and homozygous (GG) alleles, respectively. The PNPLA3 haplotype did not impact bile composition or individual BA. In addition, we found no differences in age at diagnosis, disease progression, liver fibrosis or survival between the cohorts. Conclusions The PNPLA3 I148M variant had no significant impact on on bile composition, including UDCA content, clinical outcomes, progression of liver fibrosis, hepatobiliary cancer risk, liver transplantation, or overall survival."
https://openalex.org/W4310500700,"This prospective cohort study examined the impact of high anxiety levels on psychological state and gait performance during recovery in runners with lower body injuries. Recreational runners diagnosed with lower body injuries who had reduced running volume (N = 41) were stratified into groups using State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores: high anxiety (H-Anx; STAI ≥40 points) and low anxiety (L-Anx; STAI <40 points). Runners were followed through rehabilitation to return-to-run using monthly surveys. Main outcome measures included kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, TSK-11), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Positive and negative scores), Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS), running recovery (University of Wisconsin Running Injury and Recovery Index [UWRI]) and CDC Healthy Days modules for general health, days of anxiety/tension, disrupted sleep and work/usual activities. Running biomechanics were assessed at baseline and the final visit using 3D motion capture and a force-plated treadmill. The time to return-to-running for was 5.0±3.1 and 7.9±4.1 months for L-Anx and H-Anx, respectively and participants who withdrew (n = 15) did so at 7.7±6.2 months. L-Anx maintained low anxiety and H-Anx reduced anxiety from baseline to final visit (STAI = 31.5 to 28.4 points, 50.4 to 37.8 points, respectively), whereas the withdrawn runners remained clinically anxious at their final survey (41.5 to 40.3 points; p < .05). Group by time interactions were found for PANAS positive, LEFS UWRI, general health scores, and days feeling worry, tension and anxiety (all p < .05). Final running performance in L-Anx compared to H-Anx was most improved with cadence (8.6% vs 3.5%; p = .044), impact loading rate [-1.9% vs +8.9%] and lower body stiffness [+14.1% vs +3.2%; all p < .05). High anxiety may identify runners who will experience a longer recovery process, health-related functional disruptions, and less optimization of gait biomechanics during rehabilitation after a lower extremity injury."
https://openalex.org/W4310506502,"Background In Kenya, harm reduction organizations have adopted evidence-based peer educator (PE) programs, where former people who inject drugs (PWID) serve as community health liaisons to engage PWID in HIV, HCV and harm reduction services. While PEs play an integral role in healthcare delivery, little data exists on their roles, risks and experiences working with PWID, which may be used to inform local harm reduction policy. Methods PE’s from two harm reduction sites in Nairobi were randomly and purposively selected to participate in semi-structured in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was conducted to characterize the expected versus actual roles that PEs employ while serving PWID, personal motivation and/or challenges and occupational health risks. Data was analyzed using Atlas.ti software. Results Twenty PEs participated in the study. On average, PEs were 37 years of age, with 3 years of service. Female representation was 30%. Expected responsibilities included locating clients, establishing rapport, educating and escorting clients to addiction care facilities. Additional roles included attending to clients outside of work hours, escorting clients to medical appointments and facilitating patient-provider discussions. Occupational health risks included harassment by police and drug dealers, needle sticks, and close proximity to drug use environments that could prompt drug relapse. Despite these challenges and risks, PEs are motivated by their personal experiences of overcoming addiction with help from harm reduction programs. Conclusions/Recommendations PEs play a vital role in HIV, HCV and harm reduction service delivery in Kenya, often exceeding their job descriptions by offering additional support to PWID. Recommendations include (1) advocating for PEs to provide patient navigation services, (2) promoting the use of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), (3) providing occupational mental health services to prevent drug relapse, and (4) collaborating with law enforcement to address harassment, with the ultimate goal of reducing HIV and HCV incidence among PWID."
https://openalex.org/W4310506510,"Background Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) education requires that learners practice key skills to promote mastery. Our aim in this study was to evaluate differences in post-education performance and class participation during CPR training between face-to- face (FF) and non-face-to-face (NFF) learning formats. Methods This was a randomized controlled study of third-year medical students from two university hospital, allocated to either the FF or NFF format for CPR education. The learning scenario addressed single-person CPR, consisting of chest compression only, and excluded breathing. The Kahoot! application was used for NFF. Between-group comparisons for class participation and CPR skills were based on video recordings. Results Seventy students participated in our study, with 35 randomly allocated to the FF and NFF groups. There were no between-group differences in terms of age, sex, previous basic life support training, and willingness and confidence in performing CPR. Compared to the FF group, the NFF group demonstrated significant differences during CPR, including fewer calling for assistance and using of defibrillator (p = 0.006), as well as fewer checking for breathing (p = 0.007), and fewer counting during chest compression (p = 0.006). Additionally, &lt; 30% of learners in the NFF group completed rhythm analysis after the last defibrillator shock delivery and resumed immediate chest compression (p &lt; 0.001). All students in both groups passed the post-training assessment. Conclusion Class participation in NFF learning was lower than that in FF learning. Although the post-education evaluation in the NFF group was not inferior, efforts on promoting active participation in NFF learning are required."

In this paper we aim to determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and the association with HIV risk behaviours in adolescents aged 15–19 years in Zambia and SA. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey from August-November 2017 in seven control communities of HPTN 071 (PopART) trial (a community-randomised trial of universal HIV testing and treatment), enrolling approximately 1400 eligible adolescents. HIV-status was self-reported. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), with a positive screen if adolescents scored ≥12. We fitted a logistic regression model to identify correlates of depressive symptoms with subgroup analyses among those who self-reported ever having had sex, by gender and country. Results Out of 6997 households approached, 6057 (86.6%) were enumerated. 2546 adolescents were enumerated of whom 2120 (83.3%) consented to participate and were administered the SMFQ. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 584/2120 (27.6%) [95%CI: 25.7%-29.5%]. Adolescents in SA were less likely to experience depressive symptoms (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 0.63 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.79), p-value&lt;0.0001). Female adolescents (AOR = 1.46 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.81), p-value&lt;0.0001); those who reported ever having sex and being forced into sex (AOR = 1.80 (95% CI: 1.45, 2.23), p-value&lt;0.001) and AOR = 1.67 (95% CI: 0.99, 2.84); p-value = 0.057 respectively) were more likely to experience depressive symptoms. Among 850 (40.1%) adolescents who self-reported to ever having had sex; those who used alcohol/drugs during their last sexual encounter were more likely to experience depressive symptoms (AOR = 2.18 (95% CI: 1.37, 3.47); p-value = 0.001), whereas those who reported using a condom were less likely to experience depressive symptoms (AOR = 0.74 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.00); p-value = 0.053). Conclusion The prevalence of depressive symptoms among adolescents ranged from 25–30% and was associated with increased HIV-risk behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W4310507015,"Monitoring and investigating temporal trends in antimicrobial data is a high priority for human and animal health authorities. Timely detection of temporal changes in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) can rely not only on monitoring and analyzing the proportion of resistant isolates based on the use of a clinical or epidemiological cut-off value, but also on more subtle changes and trends in the full distribution of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. The nature of the MIC distribution is categorical and ordinal (discrete). In this contribution, we developed a particular family of multicategory logit models for estimating and modelling MIC distributions over time. It allows the detection of a multitude of temporal trends in the full discrete distribution, without any assumption on the underlying continuous distribution for the MIC values. The experimental ranges of the serial dilution experiments may vary across laboratories and over time. The proposed categorical model allows to estimate the MIC distribution over the maximal range of the observed experiments, and allows the observed ranges to vary across labs and over time. The use and performance of the model is illustrated with two datasets on AMR in Salmonella."
https://openalex.org/W4310522097,"The overall impact of physician prescribers on population-level adherence rates are unknown. We aimed to quantify the influence of general practitioner (GP) physician prescribers on the outcome of optimal statin medication adherence.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using health administrative databases from Saskatchewan, Canada. Participants included physician prescribers and their patients beginning a new statin medication between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2017. We grouped prescribers based on the prevalence of optimal adherence (i.e., proportion of days covered ≥ 80%) within their patient group. Also, we constructed multivariable logistic regression analyses on optimal statin adherence using two-level non-linear mixed-effects models containing patient and prescriber-level characteristics. An intraclass correlation coefficient was used to estimate the physician effect.We identified 1,562 GPs prescribing to 51,874 new statin users. The median percentage of optimal statin adherence across GPs was 52.4% (inter-quartile range: 35.7% to 65.5%). GP prescribers with the highest patient adherence (versus the lowest) had patients who were older (median age 61.0 vs 55.0, p<0.0001) and sicker (prior hospitalization 39.4% vs 16.4%, p<0.001). After accounting for patient-level factors, only 6.4% of the observed variance in optimal adherence between patients could be attributed to GP prescribers (p<0.001). The majority of GP prescriber influence (5.2% out of 6.4%) was attributed to the variance unexplained by patient and prescriber variables.The overall impact of GP prescribers on statin adherence appears to be very limited. Even ""high-performing"" physicians face significant levels of sub-optimal adherence among their patients."
https://openalex.org/W4310522246,"Bangladesh has experienced tremendous change in child nutrition over the past few decades, but there are large differences between different regions in progress made. The question is whether continuation of current policies will bring the progress needed to reach national and international targets on child nutrition security.Using national data BDHS 1996/97, 2014, and 2017, this study attempts to map such reductions across Bangladesh and to explore the distribution of covariate effects (joint effects) that are associated with childhood stunting over these two periods, overall and by region. The main contribution of this paper is to link observed stunting scores to a household profile. This implies that different variables are evaluated jointly with stunting to assess the likelihood of being associated with stunting.Overall, the covariates: 'Parental levels of education', 'children older than one year old', 'children live in rural area', 'children born at home' formed the country winning profile in 1996/97, whereas parental levels of education disappear in the winning profile for children stunted in 2014. This implies that over the years, Bangladesh has been successful in addressing parental education for long-term reductions in child undernutrition. In addition, the diversity of profiles of households with stunted children increases over time, pointing at successful targeting of policies to increase food security among children over the period. However, in areas where improvements have been insignificant, also the profiles remain stable, indicating a failure of policies to reach the target populations. The analysis for 2017 confirms this picture: the diversity of profiles remains high, with little change in the dominant profiles.Further decline in stunting is possible through region specific multipronged interventions, targeting children older than one year among vulnerable groups, in addition with strengthening family planning programs as larger families also have a higher risk to have stunted children. In general, the profiles in 2014 and 2017/18 are much more diverse than in 1996, which can be explained by the relative success of specific targeted policies in some divisions, while being much less successful in other regions. In sum, our results suggest that the challenge lies in the implementation of policies, rather than in the generic approach and assumed theory of change."
https://openalex.org/W4310522251,"Pregnant women with psychosocial vulnerabilities should be offered perinatal interventions that include a parenting component to ameliorate the potential negative effects of maternal mental health problems and/or poor social network on parenting. One such intervention program is the Circle of Security–Parenting intervention (COS-P). The COS-P is a manualized video-based intervention that based on attachment theory seek to enhance maternal sensitivity and decrease the risk on insecure and disorganized attachment. We carried out a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of a perinatal adapted version of COS-P for women with psychosocial vulnerabilities (e.g. histories of mental health problems and/or poor social networks). Eligible participants ( N = 78) were recruited to the study by midwives during regular prenatal sessions. Interventions were delivered individually at home by trained health nurses both pre and post birth. The primary outcome was maternal sensitivity assessed with the Coding Interactive Behavior Manual by blinded coders from video-recordings of mother-infant free play interactions. Secondary outcomes were mother-reported depressive symptoms, parental reflective functioning, parental stress, infant socio-emotional functioning, and maternal wellbeing. All outcomes were assessed at nine months infant age. We did not find an effect of the intervention on the primary outcome of maternal sensitivity ( β = -0.08; 95% CI [-0.41, 0.26], p = .66). Neither did we find intervention effects on the secondary outcomes of depressive symptoms, parental reflective functioning, maternal well-being, or infant socio-emotional functioning. We did however find that the intervention decreased parental stress ( β = -8.51; 95% CI [-16.6;-0.41], p = .04). The results are discussed in light of existing findings on the effect of COS-P and sample heterogeneity. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges of adapting the COS-P for pregnant women, some without prior experiences with caregiving. Future research with larger at-risk samples examining moderation factors (e.g. adult attachment, depression maternal-fetal attachment) are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4310522415,"Background Axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) is one of the most important prognostic factors for breast cancer patients, and DNA methylation is involved in ALNM of breast cancer. However, the methylation profile of breast cancer ALNM remains unknown. Methods Breast cancer tissues were collected from patients with and without ALNM. We investigated the genome-wide DNA methylation profile in breast cancer with and without ALNM using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Then, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were verified by targeted bisulfite sequencing. Results A total of 21491 DMRs were identified between the lymph node positive group and negative group. Compared to the LN-negative breast cancer, LN-positive breast cancer had 10,920 hypermethylated DMRs and 10,571 hypomethylated DMRs. Then, 10 DMRs in the gene promoter region were detected by targeted bisulfite sequencing, these gene included HOXA5, PTOV1-AS1, RHOF, PAX6, GSTP1, RASGRF2, AKR1B1, BNIP3, CRMP1, ING5. Compared with negative lymph node, the promoter methylation levels of RASGRF2, AKR1B1 and CRMP1 increased in positive lymph node, while the promoter methylation level of RHOF decreased in positive lymph node. In addition, Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data showed that RASGRF2, AKR1B1 and CRMP1 were low expressed in breast Cancer tissues, while RHOF was high expressed in breast Cancer tissues. Furthermore, in addition to highly methylated AKR1B1, RASGRF2 and CRMP1 gene promoters, BNIP3, GSTP1, HOXA5 and PAX6 gene promoters were also methylated in ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer with ALNM. Conclusions When compared to negative lymph node breast cancer, the positive lymph node breast cancer has a differential methylation status. Promoter methylation of RASGRF2, AKR1B1, CRMP1 and RHOF in lymph node positive breast cancer tissues was significantly different from that in lymph node negative breast cancer tissues. AKR1B1, RASGRF2, CRMP1, BNIP3, GSTP1, HOXA5 and PAX6 genes were methylated in ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer with ALNM. The study provides an important biological base for understanding breast cancer with ALNM and developing therapeutic targets for breast cancer with ALNM."
https://openalex.org/W4310529906,"In this study, the relationship between two types of feedback task difficulties and feedback-related brain potentials, such as feedback-related negativity (FRN), reward positivity (RewP), and P300, was investigated in social situations where participants performed a task simultaneously by a pair. The electroencephalogram activity was measured while participants answered four-choice questions with their partners. Participants were informed about the general accuracy rate of the question (objective task difficulty) before responding to the questionnaire. The feedback outcome was definitely correct when the participants had the knowledge to answer the questions correctly. Therefore, the subjective task difficulty depended on the knowledge of the participant and differed from the objective task difficulty. In the task, the participants selected the choice they deemed correct. Before checking the answers, participants responded to the preceding question’s subjective task difficulty. As one of the social factors, the task consisted of two types of conditions: one, in which one’s response affected partner’s reward, and another, in which it did not. The second social factor was the order of feedback outcomes; in our experiment, these outcomes were presented sequentially to pairs of participants. The effects of subjective and objective task difficulties and social factors on feedback-related brain potentials were comprehensively analyzed. The study showed that subjective task difficulty sensitively modulated the amplitude of gain-related P300, suggesting that it is sensitive to modulation in the allocation of attentional resources to own feedback outcome. The objective task difficulty sensitively modulated the amplitude of RewP after receiving the partner’s incorrect feedback outcome. RewP was more sensitive to positive affective valence, such as feelings of superiority over the partner, than to task-dependent rewards received by the participants themselves. In contrast, FRN was more negative in the joint condition than in the individual condition, suggesting sensitivity to social responsibility felt by participants toward their partners."
https://openalex.org/W4310530313,"Background Between October 2018, and February 2020, the United States saw an unprecedented increase in the number of asylum seekers and refugees arriving unexpectedly at international crossings along the US-Mexico Border. Many of these migrants needed proper medical attention, and consequently created significant pressure on local health systems. In El Paso, Texas, volunteer clinicians, collaborating closely with religious organizations and non-governmental organizations, provided outpatient medical care for the new arrivals; the county hospital provided in-patient care at local tax payers’ expense. The objective of this study was to estimate costs of healthcare services offered by these volunteers in order to formulate sustainable and appropriate healthcare policies to address the needs of refugees and asylum seekers in the United States. Methods A mixed methods approach was used including personal interviews with stakeholders, and follow up surveys with volunteer clinicians. The cost analysis was done from the payer perspective using Medicaid reimbursement rates. Results Total costs of care provided to asylum seekers and refugees varied between $1.9MM to $4.4MM during the study period. The number of patient visits was estimated at 15,736 to 19,236, and cost per patient ranged between $99 and $281. Most common conditions treated by volunteer providers were abdominal pain, dermatological conditions, headaches, dehydration and hypertension. Conclusions This is the first study looking at the cost of healthcare for refugees and asylum seekers provided by volunteer clinicians, in a binational context. The resources invested by volunteer providers were significant, and essential to meet medical needs of migrant populations. Without appropriate financial support, a strategy relying on volunteer and local community resources will prove unsustainable in the long term. Findings from this study will help formulate federal and local policies to support local health systems along the US-Mexico Border in providing care to future migrations into the United States."
https://openalex.org/W4310530378,"Adolescence is a developmental stage with high risks in terms of psychological challenges and adjustments related to subjective well-being. Thus far, the findings reported a general decrease in school-related well-being over time. We considered well-being a multidimensional and latent construct that included both feeling good and functioning well at the individual level, and focused on the interplay between hedonic and eudemonic factors. Data of N = 377 high school students in Switzerland were used by conducting an online longitudinal study with two waves. Baseline data was gathered in autumn 2019 and the subsequent time point occurred 1 year later (2020; grades seven and eight). By applying a person-oriented analytical approach via latent class and latent transition analyses, we were able to identify and compare longitudinally three distinct well-being patterns and the respective trajectories. Regarding the distribution of the well-being patterns for both waves, significant changes over time were identified: particularly from wave 1 to wave 2, where there was an increase for the low and high well-being patterns, yet a decrease for the middle pattern. Comparing the stability of the respective patterns over time, the high well-being level showed the highest stability of all identified patterns. Multinomial logistic regression of covariates to the identified latent status membership established for both waves showed low but significant effects of socio-demographic variables. At wave 1, having a migration background was associated with a significant increase of being in a low versus high well-being level pattern. At wave 2, being female was associated with a significant increase of being in a low versus high and in a middle versus high well-being pattern."
https://openalex.org/W4310530426,"Health care workers' (HCWs) lived experiences and perceptions of the pandemic can prove to be a valuable resource in the face of a seemingly persistent Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-to inform ongoing efforts, as well as identify components essential to a crisis preparedness plan and the issues pertinent to supporting relevant, immediate change. We employed a phenomenological approach and, using purposive sampling, conducted 39 semi-structured interviews with senior healthcare professionals who were employed at a designated COVID-19 facility in New South Wales (NSW), Australia during the height of the pandemic in 2020. Participants comprised administrators, heads of department and senior clinicians. We obtained these HCWs' (i) perspectives of their lived experience on what was done well and what could have been done differently and (ii) recommendations on actions for current and future crisis response. Four themes emerged: minimise the spread of disease at all times; maintain a sense of collegiality and informed decision-making; plan for future crises; and promote corporate and clinical agility. These themes encapsulated respondents' insights that should inform our capacity to meet current needs, direct meaningful and in situ change, and prepare us for future crises. Respondents' observations and recommendations are informative for decision-makers tasked with mobilising an efficacious approach to the next health crisis and, in the interim, would aid the governance of a more robust workforce to effect high quality patient care in a safe environment."
https://openalex.org/W4311068688,"Objective To compare patterns in use of different antiemetics during pregnancy in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, between 2002 and 2014. Methods We constructed population-based cohorts of pregnant women using administrative healthcare data from five Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan), the Clinical Practice Research Datalink from the United Kingdom, and the IBM MarketScan Research Databases from the United States. We included pregnancies ending in live births, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, or induced abortion. We determined maternal use of antiemetics from pharmacy claims in Canada and the United States and from prescriptions in the United Kingdom. Results The most common outcome of 3 848 734 included pregnancies (started 2002–2014) was live birth (66.7% of all pregnancies) followed by spontaneous abortion (20.2%). Use of antiemetics during pregnancy increased over time in all three countries. Canada had the highest prevalence of use of prescription antiemetics during pregnancy (17.7% of pregnancies overall, 13.2% of pregnancies in 2002, and 18.9% in 2014), followed by the United States (14.0% overall, 8.9% in 2007, and 18.1% in 2014), and the United Kingdom (5.0% overall, 4.2% in 2002, and 6.5% in 2014). Besides use of antiemetic drugs being considerably lower in the United Kingdom, the increase in its use over time was more modest. The most commonly used antiemetic was combination doxylamine/pyridoxine in Canada (95.2% of pregnancies treated with antiemetics), ondansetron in the United States (72.2%), and prochlorperazine in the United Kingdom (63.5%). Conclusions In this large cohort study, we observed an overall increase in antiemetic use during pregnancy, and patterns of use varied across jurisdictions. Continued monitoring of antiemetic use and further research are warranted to better understand the reasons for differences in use of these medications and to assess their benefit-risk profile in this population."
https://openalex.org/W4311068750,"Background While many countries including Kenya transitioned from sentinel surveillance to the use of routine antenatal care (ANC) data to estimate the burden of HIV, countries in Sub Saharan Africa reported several challenges of this transition, including low uptake of HIV testing and sub national / site-level differences in HIV prevalence estimates. In Kenya voluntary HIV testing is offered to all 1 st ANC clients. However, some women may decline testing. We aim to predict the HIV positivity (as a proxy of prevalence) at ANC assuming 100% uptake of HIV testing and compare this to the observed positivity. Methods Using a cross sectional study design, we examine routine data on HIV testing among all women attending ANC in Kwale County, Kenya, for the period January 2015 to December 2019.We used a generalized estimating equation with binomial distribution to model the observed HIV prevalence as explained by HIV status ascertainment. We then used marginal standardization to predict the HIV prevalence at 100% HIV status ascertainment and make recommendations to improve the utility of ANC routine data for HIV surveillance. Results HIV testing at ANC was at 91.3%, slightly above the global target of 90%. If there was 100% HIV status ascertainment at ANC, the HIV prevalence would be 2.7% (95% CI 2.3–3.2). This was 0.3% lower than the observed prevalence. Across the yearly predictions, there was no difference between the observed and predicted values except for 2018 where the HIV prevalence was underestimated with an absolute bias of -0.2 percent. This implies missed opportunities for identifying new HIV infections in the year 2018. Conclusions Imperfect HIV status ascertainment at ANC overestimates HIV prevalence among women attending ANC in Kwale County. However, the use of ANC routine data may underestimate the true population prevalence. There is need to address both community level and health facility level barriers to the uptake of ANC services."
https://openalex.org/W4311068760,"In young adults, overweight and hypertension possibly already trigger cardiac remodeling as seen in mature adults, potentially overlapping non-ischemic cardiomyopathy findings. To this end, in young overweight and hypertensive adults, we aimed to investigate changes in left ventricular mass (LVM) and cardiac volumes, and the impact of different body scales for indexation. We also aimed to explore the presence of myocardial fibrosis, fat and edema, and changes in cellular mass with extracellular volume (ECV), T1 and T2 tissue characteristics. We prospectively recruited 126 asymptomatic subjects (51% male) aged 27-41 years for 3T cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: 40 controls, 40 overweight, 17 hypertensive and 29 hypertensive overweight. Myocyte mass was calculated as (100%-ECV) * height2.7-indexed LVM. Absolute LVM was significantly increased in overweight, hypertensive and hypertensive overweight groups (104 ± 23, 109 ± 27, 112 ± 26 g) versus controls (87 ± 21 g), with similar volumes. Body surface area (BSA) indexation resulted in LVM normalization in overweights (48 ± 8 g/m2) versus controls (47 ± 9 g/m2), but not in hypertensives (55 ± 9 g/m2) and hypertensive overweights (52 ± 9 g/m2). BSA-indexation overly decreased volumes in overweight versus normal-weight (LV end-diastolic volume; 80 ± 14 versus 92 ± 13 ml/m2), where height2.7-indexation did not. All risk groups had lower ECV (23 ± 2%, 23 ± 2%, 23 ± 3%) than controls (25 ± 2%) (P = 0.006, P = 0.113, P = 0.039), indicating increased myocyte mass (16.9 ± 2.7, 16.5 ± 2.3, 18.1 ± 3.5 versus 14.0 ± 2.9 g/m2.7). Native T1 values were similar. Lower T2 values in the hypertensive overweight group related to heart rate. In conclusion, BSA-indexation masks hypertrophy and causes volume overcorrection in overweight subjects compared to controls, height2.7-indexation therefore seems advisable."
