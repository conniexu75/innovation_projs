https://openalex.org/W2040268514,"Evolution of resistance by insect pests can reduce the benefits of insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that are used extensively in sprays and transgenic crops. Despite considerable knowledge of the genes conferring insect resistance to Bt toxins in laboratory-selected strains and in field populations exposed to Bt sprays, understanding of the genetic basis of field-evolved resistance to Bt crops remains limited. In particular, previous work has not identified the genes conferring resistance in any cases where field-evolved resistance has reduced the efficacy of a Bt crop. Here we report that mutations in a gene encoding a cadherin protein that binds Bt toxin Cry1Ac are associated with field-evolved resistance of pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella) in India to Cry1Ac produced by transgenic cotton. We conducted laboratory bioassays that confirmed previously reported resistance to Cry1Ac in pink bollworm from the state of Gujarat, where Bt cotton producing Cry1Ac has been grown extensively. Analysis of DNA from 436 pink bollworm from seven populations in India detected none of the four cadherin resistance alleles previously reported to be linked with resistance to Cry1Ac in laboratory-selected strains of pink bollworm from Arizona. However, DNA sequencing of pink bollworm derived from resistant and susceptible field populations in India revealed eight novel, severely disrupted cadherin alleles associated with resistance to Cry1Ac. For these eight alleles, analysis of complementary DNA (cDNA) revealed a total of 19 transcript isoforms, each containing a premature stop codon, a deletion of at least 99 base pairs, or both. Seven of the eight disrupted alleles each produced two or more different transcript isoforms, which implicates alternative splicing of messenger RNA (mRNA). This represents the first example of alternative splicing associated with field-evolved resistance that reduced the efficacy of a Bt crop."
https://openalex.org/W1980046478,"Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing PYD-3 (NLRP3) is a pattern recognition receptor that is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation and chronic diseases. Although much is known regarding the NLRP3 inflammasome that regulates proinflammatory cytokine production in innate immune cells, the role of NLRP3 in non-professional immune cells is unclear. Here we report that NLRP3 is expressed in cardiac fibroblasts and increased during TGFβ stimulation. NLRP3-deficient cardiac fibroblasts displayed impaired differentiation and R-Smad activation in response to TGFβ. Only the central nucleotide binding domain of NLRP3 was required to augment R-Smad signaling because the N-terminal Pyrin or C-terminal leucine-rich repeat domains were dispensable. Interestingly, NLRP3 regulation of myofibroblast differentiation proceeded independently from the inflammasome, IL-1β/IL-18, or caspase 1. Instead, mitochondrially localized NLRP3 potentiated reactive oxygen species to augment R-Smad activation. In vivo, NLRP3-deficient mice were protected against angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis with preserved cardiac architecture and reduced collagen 1. Together, these results support a distinct role for NLRP3 in non-professional immune cells independent from the inflammasome to regulate differential aspects of wound healing and chronic disease."

Understanding the dynamics in community structure and function across freshwater environments will help us to predict how these ecosystems will change in response to human land-use practices. Here we present a spatiotemporal study of sediments in the Tongue River (Montana, USA), comprising six sites along 134 km of river sampled in both spring and fall for two years. Sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons and shotgun metagenomes revealed that these sediments are the richest (∼ 65,000 microbial 'species' identified) and most novel (93% of OTUs do not match known microbial diversity) ecosystems analyzed by the Earth Microbiome Project to date, and display more functional diversity than was detected in a recent review of global soil metagenomes. Community structure and functional potential have been significantly altered by anthropogenic drivers, including increased pathogenicity and antibiotic metabolism markers near towns and metabolic signatures of coal and coalbed methane extraction byproducts. The core (OTUs shared across all samples) and the overall microbial community exhibited highly similar structure, and phylogeny was weakly coupled with functional potential. Together, these results suggest that microbial community structure is shaped by environmental drivers and niche filtering, though stochastic assembly processes likely play a role as well. These results indicate that sediment microbial communities are highly complex and sensitive to changes in land use practices."
https://openalex.org/W2163492758,"Nutrient balance is a strong determinant of animal fitness and demography. It is therefore important to understand how the compositions of available foods relate to required balance of nutrients and habitat suitability for animals in the wild. These relationships are, however, complex, particularly for omnivores that often need to compose balanced diets by combining their intake from diverse nutritionally complementary foods. Here we apply geometric models to understand how the nutritional compositions of foods available to an omnivorous member of the order Carnivora, the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos L.), relate to optimal macronutrient intake, and assess the seasonal nutritional constraints on the study population in west-central Alberta, Canada. The models examined the proportion of macronutrients that bears could consume by mixing their diet from food available in each season, and assessed the extent to which bears could consume the ratio of protein to non-protein energy previously demonstrated using captive bears to optimize mass gain. We found that non-selective feeding on ungulate carcasses provided a non-optimal macronutrient balance with surplus protein relative to fat and carbohydrate, reflecting adaptation to an omnivorous lifestyle, and that optimization through feeding selectively on different tissues of ungulate carcasses is unlikely. Bears were, however, able to dilute protein intake to an optimal ratio by mixing their otherwise high-protein diet with carbohydrate-rich fruit. Some individual food items were close to optimally balanced in protein to non-protein energy (e.g. Hedysarum alpinum roots), which may help explain their dietary prevalence. Ants may be consumed particularly as a source of lipids. Overall, our analysis showed that most food available to bears in the study area were high in protein relative to lipid or carbohydrate, suggesting the lack of non-protein energy limits the fitness (e.g. body size and reproduction) and population density of grizzly bears in this ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2118268017,"Secreted Wnt lipoproteins are cysteine-rich and lipid-modified morphogens that bind to the Frizzled (FZD) receptor and LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). Wnt engages FZD through protruding thumb and index finger domains, which are each assembled from paired β strands secured by disulfide bonds and grasp two sides of the FZD ectodomain. The importance of Wnt disulfide bonds has been assumed but uncharacterized. We systematically analyzed cysteines and associated disulfide bonds in the prototypic Wnt3a. Our data show that mutation of any individual cysteine of Wnt3a results in covalent Wnt oligomers through ectopic intermolecular disulfide bond formation and diminishes/abolishes Wnt signaling. Although individual cysteine mutations in the amino part of the saposin-like domain and in the base of the index finger are better tolerated and permit residual Wnt3a secretion/activity, those in the amino terminus, the thumb, and at the tip of the index finger are incompatible with secretion and/or activity. A few select double cysteine mutants based on the disulfide bond pattern restore Wnt secretion/activity. Further, a double cysteine mutation at the index finger tip results in a Wnt3a with normal secretion but minimal FZD binding and dominant negative properties. Our results experimentally validate predictions from the Wnt crystal structure and highlight critical but different roles of the saposin-like and cytokine-like domains, including the thumb and the index finger in Wnt folding/secretion and FZD binding. Finally, we modified existing expression vectors for 19 epitope-tagged human WNT proteins by removal of a tag-supplied ectopic cysteine, thereby generating tagged WNT ligands active in canonical and non-canonical signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1985020940,"Marijuana is one of the most abused drugs due to its psychotropic effects. Interestingly, it is also used for medicinal purposes. The main psychotropic component in marijuana, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has also been shown to mediate potent anti-inflammatory properties. Whether the immunomodulatory activity of THC is mediated by epigenetic regulation has not been investigated previously. In this study, we employed ChIP-Seq technology to examine the in vivo effect of THC on global histone methylation in lymph node cells of mice immunized with a superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B. We compared genome-wide histone H3 Lys-4, Lys-27, Lys-9, and Lys-36 trimethylation and histone H3 Lys-9 acetylation patterns in such cells exposed to THC or vehicle. Our results showed that THC treatment leads to the association of active histone modification signals to Th2 cytokine genes and suppressive modification signals to Th1 cytokine genes, indicating that such a mechanism may play a critical role in the THC-mediated switch from Th1 to Th2. At the global level, a significant portion of histone methylation and acetylation regions were altered by THC. However, the overall distribution of these histone methylation signals among the genomic features was not altered significantly by THC, suggesting that THC activates the expression of a subset of genes while suppressing the expression of another subset of genes through histone modification. Functional classification of these histone marker-associated genes showed that these differentially associated genes were involved in various cellular functions, from cell cycle regulation to metabolism, suggesting that THC had a pleiotropic effect on gene expression in immune cells. Altogether, the current study demonstrates for the first time that THC may modulate immune response through epigenetic regulation involving histone modifications.

https://openalex.org/W2071901668,"The benefits of visual exposure to natural environments for human well-being in areas of stress reduction, mood improvement, and attention restoration are well documented, but the effects of natural environments on impulsive decision-making remain unknown. Impulsive decision-making in delay discounting offers generality, predictive validity, and insight into decision-making related to unhealthy behaviors. The present experiment evaluated differences in such decision-making in humans experiencing visual exposure to one of the following conditions: natural (e.g., mountains), built (e.g., buildings), or control (e.g., triangles) using a delay discounting task that required participants to choose between immediate and delayed hypothetical monetary outcomes. Participants viewed the images before and during the delay discounting task. Participants were less impulsive in the condition providing visual exposure to natural scenes compared to built and geometric scenes. Results suggest that exposure to natural environments results in decreased impulsive decision-making relative to built environments."
https://openalex.org/W2131545113,"Clinical studies suggest that the injectable contraceptive medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) increases susceptibility to infections such as HIV-1, unlike the injectable contraceptive norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN). We investigated the differential effects, molecular mechanism of action and steroid receptor involvement in gene expression by MPA as compared to NET and progesterone (P4) in the End1/E6E7 cell line model for the endocervical epithelium, a key point of entry for pathogens in the female genital mucosa. MPA, unlike NET-acetate (NET-A) and P4, increases mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory GILZ and IκBα genes. Similarly, MPA unlike NET-A, decreases mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory IL-6, IL-8 and RANTES genes, and IL-6 and IL-8 protein levels. The predominant steroid receptor expressed in the End1/E6E7 and primary endocervical epithelial cells is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and GR knockdown experiments show that the anti-inflammatory effects of MPA are mediated by the GR. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation results suggest that MPA, unlike NET-A and P4, represses pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in cervical epithelial cells via a mechanism involving recruitment of the GR to cytokine gene promoters, like the GR agonist dexamethasone. This is at least in part consistent with direct effects on transcription, without a requirement for new protein synthesis. Dose response analysis shows that MPA has a potency of ∼ 24 nM for transactivation of the anti-inflammatory GILZ gene and ∼ 4-20 nM for repression of the pro-inflammatory genes, suggesting that these effects are likely to be relevant at injectable contraceptive doses of MPA. These findings suggest that in the context of the genital mucosa, these GR-mediated glucocorticoid-like effects of MPA in cervical epithelial cells are likely to play a critical role in discriminating between the effects on inflammation caused by different progestins and P4 and hence susceptibility to genital infections, given the predominant expression of the GR in primary endocervical epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2083538232,"MicroRNA-200b (miR-200b) is a member of miR-200 family that has been found to inhibit cell migration and cancer metastasis; however, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. We previously reported that miR-200 expression is depleted in arsenic-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells with highly migratory and invasive characteristics, whereas stably re-expressing miR-200b strongly suppresses arsenic-transformed cell migration. This study was performed to investigate how miR-200b inhibits arsenic-transformed cell migration. We found that protein kinase Cα (PKCα) is significantly up-regulated in arsenic-transformed cells. Combining bioinformatics analysis with PKCα 3'-untranslated region vector luciferase reporter assays, we showed that PKCα is a direct target of miR-200b. Inhibiting PKCα activity or knocking down PKCα expression drastically reduced cell migration, phenocoping the inhibitory effect of overexpressing miR-200b. In contrast, forced expression of PKCα in miR-200b overexpressing cells impaired the inhibitory effect of miR-200b on cell migration. In addition, we also found a positive feedback loop between Wnt5b and PKCα in arsenic-transformed cells. Knocking down Wnt5b expression reduced phospho-PKC levels and cell migration; and knocking down PKCα expression decreased Wnt5b level and cell migration. Moreover, forced expression of PKCα increased Wnt5b and phospho-PKC levels and cell migration. Further mechanistic studies revealed that Rac1 is highly activated in arsenic-transformed cells and stably expressing miR-200b abolishes Rac1 activation changing actin cytoskeleton organization. Manipulating PKCα or Wnt5b expression levels significantly altered the level of active Rac1. Together, these findings indicate that miR-200b suppresses arsenic-transformed cell migration by targeting PKCα and Wnt5b-PKCα positive feedback loop and subsequently inhibiting Rac1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2066567528,"Background & Aims Many signals governing liver regeneration (LR) following 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) are recognized, but the primary signal(s) remains unknown. The aim of the study was to confirm that the remnant liver after PH lacks capacity to secrete the BA pool returning via the enterohepatic ciruculation (EHC), which may in turn stimulate LR. Methods After standard PH, BA flux was documented and BA signaling (Fgf15) and synthesis (Cyp7a) determined by qPCR. Rat biliary fistula (BF) and Asbt knockout mouse models interrupted the EHC prior to PH, and standard assays for LR employed along with complete RNA sequencing. CCl4 intoxication after BF tested the hypothesis in an alternate injury model. Results BA rise in systemic blood immediately following PH, confirming that the remnant liver cannot handle the BA returning via portal circulation. When the BA pool is drained prior to PH in the rat BF model, LR is markedly attenuated, a phenomenon reversed with duodenal BA replacement. Hepatocyte proliferation is similarly attenuated after PH in the Asbt knockout mouse as well as after CCl44 intoxication in rats with BF. Complete RNA sequencing in the rat PH model shows that early c-jun and AP-1 gene expression pathways are down regulated in the absence of BA, coincident with attenuated LR. Conclusions Absent BA return to the liver after PH or CCl4 injury markedly attenuates LR, though hepatocyte proliferation still occurs, inferring that BA flux and signaling are not the sole signals governing LR. Transcriptional networks involving c-jun and AP-1 are involved in the BA-specific effects on hepatocyte proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2023888949,"Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic pathogen threatening patients with cystic fibrosis. Flagella are required for biofilm formation, as well as adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells. Recognition of flagellin via the Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) contributes to exacerbate B. cenocepacia-induced lung epithelial inflammatory responses. In this study, we report that B. cenocepacia flagellin is glycosylated on at least 10 different sites with a single sugar, 4,6-dideoxy-4-(3-hydroxybutanoylamino)-d-glucose. We have identified key genes that are required for flagellin glycosylation, including a predicted glycosyltransferase gene that is linked to the flagellin biosynthesis cluster and a putative acetyltransferase gene located within the O-antigen lipopolysaccharide cluster. Another O-antigen cluster gene, rmlB, which is required for flagellin glycan and O-antigen biosynthesis, was essential for bacterial viability, uncovering a novel target against Burkholderia infections. Using glycosylated and nonglycosylated purified flagellin and a cell reporter system to assess TLR5-mediated responses, we also show that the presence of glycan in flagellin significantly impairs the inflammatory response of epithelial cells. We therefore suggest that flagellin glycosylation reduces recognition of flagellin by host TLR5, providing an evasive strategy to infecting bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2065924618,"Azospirillum brasilense is a nitrogen fixing bacterium that has been shown to have various beneficial effects on plant growth and yield. Under normal conditions A. brasilense exists in a motile flagellated form, which, under starvation or stress conditions, can undergo differentiation into an encapsulated, cyst-like form. Quantitative RT-PCR can be used to analyse changes in gene expression during this differentiation process. The accuracy of quantification of mRNA levels by qRT-PCR relies on the normalisation of data against stably expressed reference genes. No suitable set of reference genes has yet been described for A. brasilense. Here we evaluated the expression of ten candidate reference genes (16S rRNA, gapB, glyA, gyrA, proC, pykA, recA, recF, rpoD, and tpiA) in wild-type and mutant A. brasilense strains under different culture conditions, including conditions that induce differentiation. Analysis with the software programs BestKeeper, NormFinder and GeNorm indicated that gyrA, glyA and recA are the most stably expressed reference genes in A. brasilense. The results also suggested that the use of two reference genes (gyrA and glyA) is sufficient for effective normalisation of qRT-PCR data."
https://openalex.org/W1981111994,"Sound symbolism is the systematic and non-arbitrary link between word and meaning. Although a number of behavioral studies demonstrate that both children and adults are universally sensitive to sound symbolism in mimetic words, the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not yet been extensively investigated. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how Japanese mimetic words are processed in the brain. In Experiment 1, we compared processing for motion mimetic words with that for non-sound symbolic motion verbs and adverbs. Mimetic words uniquely activated the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). In Experiment 2, we further examined the generalizability of the findings from Experiment 1 by testing another domain: shape mimetics. Our results show that the right posterior STS was active when subjects processed both motion and shape mimetic words, thus suggesting that this area may be the primary structure for processing sound symbolism. Increased activity in the right posterior STS may also reflect how sound symbolic words function as both linguistic and non-linguistic iconic symbols."
https://openalex.org/W2003630280,"In the present study, we have developed a novel one-arm single chain Fab heterodimeric bispecific IgG (OAscFab-IgG) antibody format targeting the insulin-like growth factor receptor type I (IGF-1R) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with one binding site for each target antigen. The bispecific antibody XGFR is based on the “knob-into-hole” technology for heavy chain heterodimerization with one heavy chain consisting of a single chain Fab to prevent wrong pairing of light chains. XGFR was produced with high expression yields and showed simultaneous binding to IGF-1R and EGFR with high affinity. Due to monovalent binding of XGFR to IGF-1R, IGF-1R internalization was strongly reduced compared with the bivalent parental antibody, leading to enhanced Fc-mediated cellular cytotoxicity. To further increase immune effector functions triggered by XGFR, the Fc portion of the bispecific antibody was glycoengineered, which resulted in strong antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity. XGFR-mediated inhibition of IGF-1R and EGFR phosphorylation as well as A549 tumor cell proliferation was highly effective and was comparable with a combined treatment with EGFR (GA201) and IGF-1R (R1507) antibodies. XGFR also demonstrated potent anti-tumor efficacy in multiple mouse xenograft tumor models with a complete growth inhibition of AsPC1 human pancreatic tumors and improved survival of SCID beige mice carrying A549 human lung tumors compared with treatment with antibodies targeting either IGF-1R or EGFR.

Targeting EGFR and IGF-1R using bispecific antibodies to induce inhibition of tumor growth has been described in several publications; however, the applied bispecific antibody formats suffered from low production yields, inherent stability problems, or lack of important anti-tumor effector mechanisms, such as ADCC or inferior tumor cell proliferation inhibition, compared with the parental antibodies. One example is a di-diabody with fusion of IFG-1R and EGFR targeting crossover scFvs directly to the Fc domain, which showed a significantly reduced antiproliferative activity compared with the respective monospecific EGFR antibody (26Lu D.

Another molecule lacking ADCC activity is a bispecific EGFR-IGF-1R inhibitor based on a human fibronectin scaffold, which has been PEGylated to increase serum half-life (30Emanuel S.L. Engle L.J.

However, upon expression in HEK293 cells, the formation of large amounts of oligomers was observed (32Schirrmann T. Menzel C. Hust M. Prilop J. Jostock T. Dübel S.

In the present study, we rationally designed a bispecific heterodimeric and bivalent one-arm scFab IgG (OAscFab-IgG) antibody format based on the “knob-into-hole” technology (34Ridgway J.B.

This novel antibody format combines robust expression and overcomes the light chain association issue in bispecific heterodimeric IgG antibodies (35Klein C. Sustmann C. Thomas M. Stubenrauch K.

Furthermore, it combines potent signaling inhibition as well as reduced IGF-1R internalization with effective ADCC induction through glycoengineering of the Fc region. We also compared the OAscFab-IgG XGFR with two other tetravalent bispecific antibodies in vitro and were able to improve impaired ligand binding and reduced Fc receptor activation of these formats. In several ADCC-competent mouse xenograft models, antibody XGFR demonstrated highly effective antitumoral activity. All antibody gene segments were generated by gene synthesis and cloned by unique restriction sites into pUC expression vectors. Bispecific and control antibodies were expressed by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells growing in suspension. HEK cell culture supernatants were harvested 7 days after transfection and purified in two steps by affinity chromatography using protein A-SepharoseTM (GE Healthcare) and Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography. Glycoengineered antibodies were produced by co-transfection of the cells with two plasmids coding for the carbohydrate-modifying enzymes β-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase III and Golgi α-mannosidase II. XGFR was also expressed from stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cell lines engineered to constitutively overexpress the GA201 “knob” heavy and light chain and the R1507 OAscFAb “hole” heavy chain as well as recombinant β-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase III and Golgi α-mannosidase II using the glutamine synthetase expression system (Lonza Biologics). The XGFR bispecific antibody was produced in a fed batch fermentation process with the engineered CHO cells in a chemically defined animal component-free medium and was subsequently purified by protein A and ion-exchange chromatographic techniques. Fractions containing purified antibodies with less than 5% high molecular weight aggregates were pooled and stored in 6.0 mg/ml aliquots at −80 °C. The protein concentration of purified protein samples was determined by measuring the optical density (OD) at 280 nm, using the molar extinction coefficient calculated on the basis of the amino acid sequence. Purity, antibody integrity, and molecular weight of bispecific and control antibodies were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and CE-SDS using microfluidic Labchip technology (Caliper Life Sciences). Aggregation of bispecific antibody samples was analyzed by high-performance size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 analytical size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) in 200 mm KH2PO4, 250 mm KCl, pH 7.0, running buffer at 25 °C. The integrity of the amino acid backbone and the molecular weight of reduced bispecific antibody light and heavy chains was verified by electrospray Q-TOF mass spectrometry after removal of N-glycans by enzymatic treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science). Oligosaccharides were enzymatically released from the antibodies by peptide-N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science). A fraction of the peptide-N-glycosidase F-treated sample was subsequently digested with endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science). The released oligosaccharides were incubated in 150 mm acetic acid prior to purification through a cation exchange resin and analyzed using an Autoflex MALDI-TOF (Bruker Daltonics) in positive ion mode. All SPR experiments were performed using a Biacore T200 instrument with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v). Standard amine coupling to N-ethyl-N(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated chip surfaces was performed as recommended by the provider (GE Healthcare). Antibodies were captured via anti-human IgG-Fc antibody. A CM5 chip was used for detection of EGFR binding with a ligand density of capture molecule of ∼1000 response units and capture levels of ∼40–46 response units of the tested antibodies. A C1-Chip with low ligand density (∼200 response units, capture levels of antibody ∼6–10 response units) was used to achieve monovalent binding of the IGF-1R dimer. Five increasing concentrations of the receptors were injected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min for a 180-s association time and a dissociation time of 1200 s for EGFR and 1600 s for IGF-1R at 37 °C. Final regeneration was performed after each cycle using 10 mm glycine, pH 1.75, contact time 60 s, and a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Kinetic constants were evaluated by fitting the association and dissociation phase of the analyzed interaction with a Langmuir 1:1 binding model (refractive index = 0) using usual double referencing (flow cell 1 reference surface with capture molecule and concentration = 0 nm) by Biacore Evaluation software. A549 (ATCC), AsPC1 (ATCC), LS174T (ATCC), and NCI-H322M cells (NCI, National Institutes of Health) were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% fetal"

We performed a double-blind, two-part, dose-escalation study, in subjects with ALS, assessing safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and functional effects of ozanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against Nogo-A. In Part 1, 40 subjects were randomized (3∶1) to receive single dose intravenous ozanezumab (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, or 15 mg/kg) or placebo. In Part 2, 36 subjects were randomized (3∶1) to receive two repeat doses of intravenous ozanezumab (0.5, 2.5, or 15 mg/kg) or placebo, approximately 4 weeks apart. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability (adverse events [AEs], vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests). Secondary endpoints included PK, immunogenicity, functional endpoints (clinical and electrophysiological), and biomarker parameters. Overall, ozanezumab treatment (0.01-15 mg/kg) was well tolerated. The overall incidence of AEs in the repeat dose 2.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg ozanezumab groups was higher than in the repeat dose placebo group and repeat dose 0.5 mg/kg ozanezumab group. The majority were considered not related to study drug by the investigators. Six serious AEs were reported in three subjects receiving ozanezumab; none were considered related to study drug. No study drug-related patterns were identified for ECG, laboratory, or vital signs parameters. One subject (repeat dose 15 mg/kg ozanezumab) showed a weak, positive anti-ozanezumab-antibody result. PK results were generally consistent with monoclonal antibody treatments. No apparent treatment effects were observed for functional endpoints or muscle biomarkers. Immunohistochemical staining showed dose-dependent co-localization of ozanezumab with Nogo-A in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, single and repeat dose ozanezumab treatment was well tolerated and demonstrated co-localization at the site of action. These findings support future studies with ozanezumab in ALS.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00875446 GSK-ClinicalStudyRegister.com GSK ID 111330."
https://openalex.org/W2017412950,"We investigated the cardiovascular effects of lead exposure, emphasising its direct action on myocardial contractility. Male Wistar rats were sorted randomly into two groups: control (Ct) and treatment with 100 ppm of lead (Pb) in the drinking water. Blood pressure (BP) was measured weekly. At the end of the treatment period, the animals were anaesthetised and haemodynamic parameters and contractility of the left ventricular papillary muscles were recorded. Blood and tissue samples were properly stored for further biochemical investigations. Statistical analyses were considered to be significant at p<0.05. The lead concentrations in the blood reached approximately 13 µg/dL, while the bone was the site of the highest deposition of this metal. BP in the Pb-treated group was higher from the first week of lead exposure and remained at the same level over the next four weeks. Haemodynamic evaluations revealed increases in systolic (Ct: 96±3.79 vs. Pb: 116±1.37 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (Ct: 60±2.93 vs. Pb: 70±3.38 mmHg), left ventricular systolic pressure (Ct: 104±5.85 vs. Pb: 120±2.51 mmHg) and heart rate (Ct: 307±10 vs. Pb: 348±16 bpm). Lead treatment did not alter the force and time derivatives of the force of left ventricular papillary muscles that were contracting isometrically. However, our results are suggestive of changes in the kinetics of calcium (Ca++) in cardiomyocytes increased transarcolemmal Ca++ influx, low Ca++ uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and high extrusion by the sarcolemma. Altogether, these results show that despite the increased Ca++ influx that was induced by lead exposure, the myocytes had regulatory mechanisms that prevented increases in force, as evidenced in vivo by the increased systolic ventricular pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2057263190,"Radiotherapy is an important treatment modality for oral cancer. However, development of radioresistance is a major hurdle in the efficacy of radiotherapy in oral cancer patients. Identifying predictors of radioresistance is a challenging task and has met with little success. The aim of the present study was to explore the differential spectral profiles of the established radioresistant sublines and parental oral cancer cell lines by Raman spectroscopy. We have established radioresistant sublines namely, 50Gy-UPCI:SCC029B and 70Gy-UPCI:SCC029B from its parental UPCI:SCC029B cell line, by using clinically admissible 2Gy fractionated ionizing radiation (FIR). The developed radioresistant character was validated by clonogenic cell survival assay and known radioresistance-related protein markers like Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Cox-2 and Survivin. Altered cellular morphology with significant increase (p<0.001) in the number of filopodia in radioresistant cells with respect to parental cells was observed. The Raman spectra of parental UPCI:SCC029B, 50Gy-UPCI:SCC029B and 70Gy-UPCI:SCC029B cells were acquired and spectral features indicate possible differences in biomolecules like proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Principal component analysis (PCA) provided three clusters corresponding to radioresistant 50Gy, 70Gy-UPCI:SCC029B sublines and parental UPCI:SCC029B cell line with minor overlap, which suggest altered molecular profile acquired by the radioresistant cells due to multiple doses of irradiation. The findings of this study support the potential of Raman spectroscopy in prediction of radioresistance and possibly contribute to better prognosis of oral cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2022763219,"Background Organizational downsizing has become highly common during the global recession of the late 2000s with severe repercussions on employment. We examine whether the severity of the downsizing process is associated with a greater likelihood of depressive symptoms among displaced workers, internally redeployed workers and lay-off survivors. Methods A cross-sectional survey involving telephone interviews was carried out in France, Hungary, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The study analyzes data from 758 workers affected by medium- and large-scale downsizing, using multiple logistic regression. Main Results Both unemployment and surviving layoffs were significantly associated with depressive symptoms, as compared to reemployment, but the perceived procedural justice of a socially responsible downsizing process considerably mitigated the odds of symptoms. Perception of high versus low justice was assessed along several downsizing dimensions. In the overall sample, chances to have depressive symptoms were significantly reduced if respondents perceived the process as transparent and understandable, fair and unbiased, well planned and democratic; if they trusted the employer’s veracity and agreed with the necessity for downsizing. The burden of symptoms was significantly greater if the process was perceived to be chaotic. We further tested whether perceived justice differently affects the likelihood of depressive symptoms among distinct groups of workers. Findings were that the odds of symptoms largely followed the same patterns of effects across all groups of workers. Redeploying and supporting surplus employees through the career change process–rather than forcing them to become unemployed–makes a substantial difference as to whether they will suffer from depressive symptoms. Conclusions While depressive symptoms affect both unemployed and survivors, a just and socially responsible downsizing process is important for the emotional health of workers."
https://openalex.org/W2079810070,"Fish consumption is considered health beneficial as it decreases cardiovascular disease (CVD)-risk through effects on plasma lipids and inflammation. We investigated a salmon protein hydrolysate (SPH) that is hypothesized to influence lipid metabolism and to have anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory properties. 24 female apolipoprotein (apo) E−/− mice were divided into two groups and fed a high-fat diet with or without 5% (w/w) SPH for 12 weeks. The atherosclerotic plaque area in aortic sinus and arch, plasma lipid profile, fatty acid composition, hepatic enzyme activities and gene expression were determined. A significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque area in the aortic arch and aortic sinus was found in the 12 apoE−/− mice fed 5% SPH for 12 weeks compared to the 12 casein-fed control mice. Immunohistochemical characterization of atherosclerotic lesions in aortic sinus displayed no differences in plaque composition between mice fed SPH compared to controls. However, reduced mRNA level of Icam1 in the aortic arch was found. The plasma content of arachidonic acid (C20∶4n-6) and oleic acid (C18∶1n-9) were increased and decreased, respectively. SPH-feeding decreased the plasma concentration of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and GM-CSF, whereas plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerols (TAG) were unchanged, accompanied by unchanged mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)-activity. These data show that a 5% (w/w) SPH diet reduces atherosclerosis in apoE−/− mice and attenuate risk factors related to atherosclerotic disorders by acting both at vascular and systemic levels, and not directly related to changes in plasma lipids or fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2082352053,"Nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing family proteins function as intracellular immune sensors in both plants and animals. In plants, the downstream components activated by NLR family proteins and the immune response mechanisms induced by these downstream molecules are largely unknown. We have previously found that the small GTPase OsRac1, which acts as a molecular switch in rice immunity, is activated by Pit, an NLR-type resistance (R) protein to rice blast fungus, and this activation plays critical roles in Pit-mediated immunity. However, the sites and mechanisms of activation of Pit in vivo remain unknown. To clarify the mechanisms involved in the localization of Pit, we searched for consensus sequences in Pit that specify membrane localization and found a pair of potential palmitoylation sites in the N-terminal coiled-coil region. Although wild-type Pit was localized mainly to the plasma membrane, this membrane localization was compromised in a palmitoylation-deficient mutant of Pit. The palmitoylation-deficient Pit displayed significantly lower affinity for OsRac1 on the plasma membrane, thereby resulting in failures of the Pit-mediated cell death, the production of reactive oxygen species, and disease resistance to rice blast fungus. These results indicate that palmitoylation-dependent membrane localization of Pit is required for the interaction with and the activation of OsRac1 and that OsRac1 activation by Pit is vital for Pit-mediated disease resistance to rice blast fungus.

The palmitoylation-deficient Pit displayed significantly lower affinity for OsRac1 on the plasma membrane, thereby resulting in failures of the Pit-mediated cell death, the production of reactive oxygen species, and disease resistance to rice blast fungus. These results indicate that palmitoylation-dependent membrane localization of Pit is required for the interaction with and the activation of OsRac1 and that OsRac1 activation by Pit is vital for Pit-mediated disease resistance to rice blast fungus."
https://openalex.org/W1977134442,"Clostridium difficile is the main agent responsible for hospital acquired antibiotic associated diarrhoea. In recent years, epidemic strains have emerged causing more severe infections. Whilst C. difficile has two major virulence factors, toxins TcdA and TcdB, it is generally accepted that other virulence components of the bacterium contribute to disease. Previously, it has been suggested that flagella expression from pathogenic bacteria might be implicated in virulence. In a recent study, we observed an increased mortality in a gnotobiotic mouse model when animals were colonized with an isogenic fliC mutant constructed in the PCR-ribotype 027 (B1/NAP1) strain R20291, while animals survived when colonized by the parental strain or after colonization by other high-toxin-producing C. difficile strains. To understand the reasons for this increased virulence, we compared the global gene expression profiles between the fliC-R20291 mutant and its parental strain using an in vitro and in vivo transcriptomic approach. The latter made use of the gnotobiotic mouse model. Interestingly, in the fliC mutant, we observed considerable up-regulation of genes involved in mobility, membrane transport systems (PTS, ABC transporters), carbon metabolism, known virulence factors and sporulation. A smaller but significant up-regulation of genes involved in cell growth, fermentation, metabolism, stress and antibiotic resistance was also apparent. All of these genes may be associated with the increased virulence of the fliC-R20921 mutant. We confirmed that the fliC mutation is solely responsible for the observed changes in gene expression in the mutant strain since expression profiles were restored to that of the wild-type strain in the fliC-complemented strain. Thus, the absence of FliC is directly or indirectly involved in the high mortality observed in the fliC mutant infected animals. Therefore, we provide the first evidence that when the major structural component of the flagellum is neutralized, deregulation of gene expression can occur during infection."

For bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas), habitat use has been widely examined in the eastern and western Gulf of Mexico; however, knowledge of their movements and the factors influencing them is lacking for populations in the more temperate north-central Gulf of Mexico. To examine how changes in hydrographic conditions affected the presence of young bull sharks in Mobile Bay, Alabama, thirty-five sharks were fitted with internal acoustic transmitters and monitored with an acoustic monitoring array consisting of thirty-three receivers between June 2009 and December 2010. Tagged sharks ranged in size from 60 to 114 cm fork length and were detected between the upper and lower portions of Mobile Bay. Despite a variety of freshwater sources associated with this highly productive estuary, sharks were most consistently detected at the largest input to the system--the Mobile and Tensaw Rivers. Our findings suggest a combination of hydrographic factors interact to influence the distribution of juvenile bull sharks in Mobile Bay. The factors affecting the probability of detecting at least one bull shark varied both temporally (2009 vs 2010) and spatially (upper vs lower bay). Electivity analysis demonstrated that bull sharks showed highest affinity for warm water (29-32 °C), moderate salinities (10-11 psu) and normoxic waters (5-7 mg/l), although these patterns were not consistent between regions or across years. We suggest future studies coupling telemetry and hydrographic variables should, when possible, consider the interactions of multiple environmental parameters when defining the dynamic factors explaining the spatial distribution of coastal sharks."
https://openalex.org/W1997197779,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) causes immunosuppression in pigs. One causative factor is an imbalance in cytokine levels in the blood and lymphoid tissues. Many studies have reported changes in cytokine production, but the regulatory mechanisms involved have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we investigated alteration and regulation of IL-4 and IL-12 production in lymphocytes following incubation with PCV2 in vitro. The levels of IL-4 decreased and levels of IL-12 increased in lymphocyte supernatants, and the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB and the expression of p65 in the nucleus and p-IκB in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes increased after incubation with PCV2. However, these effects were reversed when lymphocytes were coincubated with PCV2 and the NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082. In addition, the expression of MyD88 protein increased and the expression of mRNA for the toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR9 was upregulated when lymphocytes were incubated with PCV2. However, no change was seen in TLR7 and TLR8 mRNA expression. In conclusion, this study showed that PCV2 induced a decrease in IL-4 and an increase in IL-12 production in lymphocytes, and these changes were regulated by the TLR-MyD88-NF-κB signal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1995106185,"RNA interference (RNAi) has become an essential technology for functional gene analysis. Its success, however, depends on the effective expression of RNAi-inducing small double-stranded interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) in target cells. In many cell types, RNAi can be achieved by transfection of chemically synthesised siRNAs, which results in transient knockdown of protein expression. Expression of double-stranded short hairpin RNA (shRNA) provides another means to induce RNAi in cells that are hard to transfect. To facilitate the generation of stable, conditional RNAi cell lines, we have developed novel one- and two-component vector GATEWAY-compatible lentiviral tetracycline-regulated RNAi (GLTR) systems. The combination of a modified RNA-polymerase-III-dependent H1 RNA promoter (designated 'THT') for conditional shRNA expression with different lentiviral delivery vectors allows (1) the use of fluorescent proteins for colour-coded combinatorial RNAi or for monitoring RNAi induction (pGLTR-FP), (2) selection of transduced cells (pGLTR-S), and (3) the generation of conditional cell lines using a one vector system (pGLTR-X). All three systems were found to be suitable for the analysis of essential genes, such as CDC27, a component of the mitotic ubiquitin ligase APC/C, in cell lines and primary human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026867156,"Proteolytic activation is a unique feature of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the physiologically relevant proteases remain to be identified. The serine protease trypsin I can activate ENaC in vitro but is unlikely to be the physiologically relevant activating protease in ENaC-expressing tissues in vivo. Herein, we investigated whether human trypsin IV, a form of trypsin that is co-expressed in several extrapancreatic epithelial cells with ENaC, can activate human ENaC. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, we monitored proteolytic activation of ENaC currents and the appearance of γENaC cleavage products at the cell surface. We demonstrated that trypsin IV and trypsin I can stimulate ENaC heterologously expressed in oocytes. ENaC cleavage and activation by trypsin IV but not by trypsin I required a critical cleavage site (Lys-189) in the extracellular domain of the γ-subunit. In contrast, channel activation by trypsin I was prevented by mutating three putative cleavage sites (Lys-168, Lys-170, and Arg-172) in addition to mutating previously described prostasin (RKRK(178)), plasmin (Lys-189), and neutrophil elastase (Val-182 and Val-193) sites. Moreover, we found that trypsin IV is expressed in human renal epithelial cells and can increase ENaC-mediated sodium transport in cultured human airway epithelial cells. Thus, trypsin IV may regulate ENaC function in epithelial tissues. Our results show, for the first time, that trypsin IV can stimulate ENaC and that trypsin IV and trypsin I activate ENaC by cleavage at distinct sites. The presence of distinct cleavage sites may be important for ENaC regulation by tissue-specific proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2099234236,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is thought to adhere to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelium prior to causing meningitis. The platelet activating factor receptor (PAFR) has been implicated in this adhesion but there is a paucity of data demonstrating direct binding of the bacteria to PAFR. Additionally, studies that inhibit PAFR strongly suggest that alternative receptors for pneumococci are present on the endothelium. Therefore, we studied the roles of PAFR and pIgR, an established epithelial pneumococcal receptor, in pneumococcal adhesion to brain endothelial cells in vivo. Mice were intravenously infected with pneumococci and sacrificed at various time points before meningitis onset. Co-localization of bacteria with PAFR and pIgR was investigated using immunofluorescent analysis of the brain tissue. In vitro blocking with antibodies and incubation of pneumococci with endothelial cell lysates were used to further probe bacteria-receptor interaction. In vivo as well as in vitro pneumococci did not co-localize with PAFR. On the other hand the majority of S. pneumoniae co-localized with endothelial pIgR and pIgR blocking reduced pneumococcal adhesion to endothelial cells. Pneumococci physically interacted with pIgR in endothelial cell lysates. In conclusion, bacteria did not associate with PAFR, indicating an indirect role of PAFR in pneumococcal adhesion to endothelial cells. In contrast, pIgR on the BBB endothelium may represent a novel pneumococcal adhesion receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2027656055,"Background Excessive mucus production is typical in various upper airway diseases. In sinusitis, the expression of MUC5AC, a major respiratory mucin gene, increases. However, the mechanisms leading to mucus hypersecretion in sinusitis have not been characterized. Hypoxia due to occlusion of the sinus ostium is one of the major pathologic mechanisms of sinusitis, but there have been no reports regarding the mechanism of hypoxia-induced mucus hypersecretion. Methods and Findings This study aims to identify whether hypoxia may induce mucus hypersecretion and elucidate its mechanism. Normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells and human lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line (NCI-H292) were used. Sinus mucosa from patients was also tested. Anoxic condition was in an anaerobic chamber with a 95% N2/5% CO2 atmosphere. The regulatory mechanism of MUC5AC by anoxia was investigated using RT-PCR, real-time PCR, western blot, ChIP, electrophoretic mobility shift, and luciferase assay. We show that levels of MUC5AC mRNA and the corresponding secreted protein increase in anoxic cultured NHNE cells. The major transcription factor for hypoxia-related signaling, HIF-1α, is induced during hypoxia, and transfection of a mammalian expression vector encoding HIF-1α results in increased MUC5AC mRNA levels under normoxic conditions. Moreover, hypoxia-induced expression of MUC5AC mRNA is down-regulated by transfected HIF-1α siRNA. We found increased MUC5AC promoter activity under anoxic conditions, as indicated by a luciferase reporter assay, and mutation of the putative hypoxia-response element in MUC5AC promoter attenuated this activity. Binding of over-expressed HIF-1α to the hypoxia-response element in the MUC5AC promoter was confirmed. In human sinusitis mucosa, which is supposed to be hypoxic, expression of MUC5AC and HIF-1α is higher than in control mucosa. Conclusion The results indicate that anoxia up-regulates MUC5AC by the HIF-1α signaling pathway in human nasal epithelia and suggest that hypoxia might be a pathogenic mechanism of mucus hypersecretion in sinusitis."
https://openalex.org/W2091760751,"Objective To investigate the modulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) upon the neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through targeting RE-1 Silencing Factor (REST), a mature neuronal gene suppressor in neuronal and un-neuronal cells. Methods Rat bone marrow derived–MSCs were induced into neuron-like cells (MSC-NCs) by DMSO and BHA in vitro. The expression of neuron specific enolase (NSE), microtubule-associated protein tau (Tau), REST and its target genes, including synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and L1 cell adhesion molecular (L1CAM), were detected in MSCs and MSC-NCs. miRNA array analysis was conducted to screen for the upregulated miRNAs after neuronal differentiation. TargetScan was used to predict the relationship between these miRNAs and REST gene, and dual luciferase reporter assay was applied to validate it. Gain and loss of function experiments were used to study the role of miR-29a upon neuronal differentiation of MSCs. The knockdown of REST was conducted to show that miR-29a affected this process through targeting REST. Results MSCs were induced into neuron-like cells which presented neuronal cell shape and expressed NSE and Tau. The expression of REST declined and the expression of SNAP25 and L1CAM increased upon the neuronal differentiation of MSCs. Among 14 upregulated miRNAs, miR-29a was validated to target REST gene. During the neuronal differentiation of MSCs, miR-29a inhibition blocked the downregulation of REST, as well as the upregulation of SNAP25, L1CAM, NSE and Tau. REST knockdown rescued the effect of miR-29a inhibition on the expression of NSE and Tau. Meanwhile, miR-29a knockin significantly decreased the expression of REST and increased the expression of SNAP25 and L1CMA in MSCs, but did not significantly affect the expression of NSE and Tau. Conclusion miR-29a regulates neurogenic markers through targeting REST in mesenchymal stem cells, which provides advances in neuronal differentiation research and stem cell therapy for neurodegenerative diseases."

Here, antibody binding and mass spectrometry characterization of acid glycosphingolipids isolated from a large number (1 × 10(9) cells) of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines allowed identification of several novel acid glycosphingolipids, like the gangliosides sialyl-lactotetraosylceramide and sialyl-globotetraosylceramide, and the sulfated glycosphingolipids sulfatide, sulf-lactosylceramide, and sulf-globopentaosylceramide. A high cell surface expression of sialyl-lactotetra on hESC and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) was demonstrated by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, whereas sulfated glycosphingolipids were only found in intracellular compartments. Immunohistochemistry showed distinct cell surface anti-sialyl-lactotetra staining on all seven hESC lines and three hiPSC lines analyzed, whereas no staining of hESC-derived hepatocyte-like or cardiomyocyte-like cells was obtained. Upon differentiation of hiPSC into hepatocyte-like cells, the sialyl-lactotetra epitope was rapidly down-regulated and not detectable after 14 days. These findings identify sialyl-lactotetra as a promising marker of undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells."

Specimens consisting of liquid vesicle dried on filter papers or crusted scabs from healing patients were sampled by first responders. A field analytical facility was deployed nearby in order to carry out a real-time PCR (qPCR) assay using genus consensus primers, consensus orthopoxvirus (OPV) and smallpox-specific probes spanning over the 14 kD fusion protein encoding gene. A PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used on-site as backup method to confirm the presence of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in samples. To complete the differential diagnosis of skin rash, chickenpox was tested in parallel using a commercial qPCR assay. In a post-deployment step, a MPXV-specific pyrosequencing was carried out on all biotinylated amplicons generated on-site in order to confirm the on-site results.Whereas MPXV proved to be the agent causing the rash illness outbreak in the Bena Tshiadi, VZV was the causative agent of the disease in Yangala and Ndesha districts. In addition, each on-site result was later confirmed by MPXV-specific pyrosequencing analysis without any discrepancy.This experience of rapid on-site dual use DNA-based differential diagnosis of rash illnesses demonstrates the potential of combining tests specifically identifying bioterrorism agents and agents causing natural outbreaks. This opens the way to rapid on-site DNA-based identification of a broad spectrum of causative agents in remote areas."

In order to characterize the molecular features of human ETEC isolates from Korea, we investigated the profiles of enterotoxin and colonization factor (CF) genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and performed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) with a total of 291 ETEC strains. The specimens comprised 258 domestic strains isolated from patients who had diarrhea and were from widely separated geographic regions in Korea and 33 inflow strains isolated from travelers visiting other Asian countries. Heat-stable toxin (STh)-possessing ETEC strains were more frequent than heat-labile toxin (LT)-possessing ETEC strains in the domestic isolates, while the detection rates of both enterotoxin genes were similar in the inflow isolates. The profile of CF genes of domestic isolates was similar to that of inflow isolates and the major CF types of the strains were CS3-CS21-CS1/PCF071 and CS2-CS3-CS21. Most of these 2 CF types were detected in ETEC strains that possess both lt and sth genes. The major MLSTST types of domestic isolates were ST171 and ST955. Moreover, the 2 major CF types were usually found concomitantly with the 2 major MLST STs, ST171 and ST955. In conclusion, our genotyping results may provide useful information for guiding the development of geographically specific vaccines against human ETEC isolates."

However, the current knowledge of the importance of cardiovascular health on resting brain perfusion is limited. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the relation between brain perfusion variability and risk factors of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in healthy aged subjects. Methods Thirty-eight healthy subjects aged 50–75 years old were included. Mean global brain perfusion was measured using magnetic resonance phase contrast mapping and regional brain perfusion by use of arterial spin labeling. Results Mean global brain perfusion was inversely correlated with caffeine and hematocrit, and positively with end-tidal PCO2. Furthermore, the mean global brain perfusion was inversely correlated with circulating homocysteine, but not with asymmetric dimethylarginine, dyslipidemia or the carotid intima-media thickness. The relative regional brain perfusion was associated with circulating homocysteine, with a relative parietal hypoperfusion and a frontal hyperperfusion. No effect on regional brain perfusion was observed for any of the other risk factors. A multiple regression model including homocysteine, caffeine, hematocrit and end-tidal PCO2, explained nearly half of the observed variability. Conclusion Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors influenced global cerebral perfusion variation between subjects. Further, the results suggest that the inverse relation between homocysteine and brain perfusion is owing to other mechanisms, than reflected by asymmetric dimethylarginine, and that homocysteine may be a marker of cerebral perfusion in aging brains."
https://openalex.org/W2053478348,"Osteoporosis is a common bone disease that has a strong genetic component. Genome-wide linkage studies have identified the chromosomal region 3p14-p22 as a quantitative trait locus for bone mineral density (BMD). We have previously identified associations between variation in two related genes located in 3p14-p22, ARHGEF3 and RHOA, and BMD in women. In this study we performed knockdown of these genes using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in human osteoblast-like and osteoclast-like cells in culture, with subsequent microarray analysis to identify genes differentially regulated from a list of 264 candidate genes. Validation of selected findings was then carried out in additional human cell lines/cultures using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The qRT-PCR results showed significant down-regulation of the ACTA2 gene, encoding the cytoskeletal protein alpha 2 actin, in response to RHOA knockdown in both osteoblast-like (P<0.001) and osteoclast-like cells (P = 0.002). RHOA knockdown also caused up-regulation of the PTH1R gene, encoding the parathyroid hormone 1 receptor, in Saos-2 osteoblast-like cells (P<0.001). Other findings included down-regulation of the TNFRSF11B gene, encoding osteoprotegerin, in response to ARHGEF3 knockdown in the Saos-2 and hFOB 1.19 osteoblast-like cells (P = 0.003-0.02), and down-regulation of ARHGDIA, encoding the Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha, in response to RHOA knockdown in osteoclast-like cells (P<0.001). These studies identify ARHGEF3 and RHOA as potential regulators of a number of genes in bone cells, including TNFRSF11B, ARHGDIA, PTH1R and ACTA2, with influences on the latter evident in both osteoblast-like and osteoclast-like cells. This adds further evidence to previous studies suggesting a role for the ARHGEF3 and RHOA genes in bone metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2067105463,"DNase colicins E2 and E7, both of which appropriate the BtuB/Tol translocation machinery to cross the outer membrane, undergo a processing step as they enter the cytoplasm. This endoproteolytic cleavage is essential for their killing action. A processed form of the same size, 18.5 kDa, which corresponds to the C-terminal catalytic domain, was detected in the cytoplasm of bacteria treated with either of the two DNase colicins. The inner-membrane protease FtsH is necessary for the processing that allows the translocation of the colicin DNase domain into the cytoplasm. The processing occurs near residue D420, at the same position as the FtsH-dependent cleavage in RNase colicins E3 and D. The cleavage site is located 30 amino acids upstream of the DNase domain. In contrast, the previously reported periplasm-dependent colicin cleavage, located at R452 in colicin E2, was shown to be generated by the outer-membrane protease OmpT and we show that this cleavage is not physiologically relevant for colicin import. Residue R452, whose mutated derivatives led to toxicity defect, was shown to have no role in colicin processing and translocation, but it plays a key role in the catalytic activity, as previously reported for other DNase colicins. Membrane associated forms of colicins E2 and E7 were detected on target cells as proteinase K resistant peptides, which include both the receptor-binding and DNase domains. A similar, but much less proteinase K-resistant form was also detected with RNase colicin E3. These colicin forms are not relevant for colicin import, but their detection on the cell surface indicates that whole nuclease-colicin molecules are found in a stable association with the outer-membrane receptor BtuB of the target cells."
https://openalex.org/W2032146089,"Mechanical stimulation of the skeleton promotes bone gain and suppresses bone loss, ultimately resulting in improved bone strength and fracture resistance. The molecular mechanisms directing anabolic and/or anti-catabolic actions on the skeleton during loading are not fully understood. Identifying molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction (MTD) signaling cascades could identify new therapeutic targets. Most research into MTD mechanisms is typically focused on understanding the signaling pathways that stimulate new bone formation in response to load. However, we investigated the structural, signaling and transcriptional molecules that suppress the stimulatory effects of loading. The high bone mass phenotype of mice with global deletion of either Pyk2 or Src suggests a role for these tyrosine kinases in repression of bone formation. We used fluid shear stress as a MTD stimulus to identify a novel Pyk2/Src-mediated MTD pathway that represses mechanically-induced bone formation. Our results suggest Pyk2 and Src function as molecular switches that inhibit MTD in our mechanically stimulated osteocyte culture experiments. Once activated by oscillatory fluid shear stress (OFSS), Pyk2 and Src translocate to and accumulate in the nucleus, where they associate with a protein involved in DNA methylation and the interpretation of DNA methylation patterns –methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2). OFSS-induced Cox-2 and osteopontin expression was enhanced in Pyk2 KO osteoblasts, while inhibition of Src enhanced osteocalcin expression in response to OFSS. We found that Src kinase activity increased in the nucleus of osteocytes in response to OFSS and an interaction activated between Src (Y418) and Pyk2 (Y402) increased in response to OFSS. Thus, as a mechanism to prevent an over-reaction to physical stimulation, mechanical loading may induce the formation of a Src/Pyk2/MBD2 complex in the nucleus that functions to suppress anabolic gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2069446998,"Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) is an evolutionarily conserved characteristic of animal tissues marked by coordinated polarization of cells or structures in the plane of a tissue. In insect wing epithelium, for instance, PCP is characterized by en masse orientation of hairs orthogonal to its apical-basal axis and pointing along the proximal-distal axis of the organ. Directional cue for PCP has been proposed to be generated by complex sets of interactions amongst three proteins - Fat (Ft), Dachsous (Ds) and Four-jointed (Fj). Ft and Ds are two atypical cadherins, which are phosphorylated by Fj, a Golgi kinase. Ft and Ds from adjacent cells bind heterophilically via their tandem cadherin repeats, and their binding affinities are regulated by Fj. Further, in the wing epithelium, sub-cellular levels of Ft-Ds heterodimers are seen to be elevated at the distal edges of individual cells, prefiguring their PCP. Mechanisms generating this sub-cellular asymmetry of Ft-Ds heterodimer in proximal and distal edges of cells, however, have not been resolved yet. Using a mathematical modeling approach, here we provide a framework for generation of this sub-cellular asymmetry of Ft-Ds heterodimer. First, we explain how the known interactions within Ft-Ds-Fj system translate into sub-cellular asymmetry of Ft-Ds heterodimer. Second, we show that this asymmetric localization of Ft-Ds heterodimer is lost when tissue-level gradient of Fj is flattened, or when phosphorylation of Ft by Fj is abolished, but not when tissue-level gradient of Ds is flattened or when phosphorylation of Ds is abrogated. Finally, we show that distal enrichment of Ds also amplifies Ft-Ds asymmetry. These observations reveal that gradient of Fj expression, phosphorylation of Ft by Fj and sub-cellular distal accumulation of Ds are three critical elements required for generating sub-cellular asymmetry of Ft-Ds heterodimer. Our model integrates the known experimental data and presents testable predictions for future studies."

Moreover, the reduced state of cytochrome c has a remarkable dynamic sensitivity to nutrient secretagogues, whereas this metabolic factor is tightly maintained in the absence of changes in levels of nutrient secretagogues (12Sweet I.R. Gilbert M. Contribution of calcium influx in mediating glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption in pancreatic islets.Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This intrinsic attribute of islets allows cytochrome c reduction to function as a signal that relegates control of ISR to extracellular nutrient levels unaffected by the energetic needs of the cells. In addition, cytochrome c is unique among the electron transport chain components that manifest this behavior. Finally, the metabolic factor must directly or indirectly interact with exocytotic machinery in the cytosol. Cytochrome c is the only mobile protein in the electron transport chain, and it translocates to the cytosol in response to nutrient secretagogues (13Hüttemann M. Pecina P. Rainbolt M. Sanderson T.H. Kagan V.E. Samavati L. Doan J.W. Lee I. The multiple functions of cytochrome c and their regulation in life and death decisions of the mammalian cell: from respiration to apoptosis.Mitochondrion. 2011; 11: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), thus providing the opportunity for direct action on downstream processes of exocytosis. The pathway of KATP-independent insulin secretion has been conceptualized as a system that increases the efficacy of Ca2+ to stimulate ISR (14Henquin J.C. Ravier M.A. Nenquin M. Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Hierarchy of the β-cell signals controlling insulin secretion.Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 33: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The fact that both Ca2+ and a metabolic factor need to be increased suggested to us a model where these two signals interact downstream, presumably via a regulatory protein complex. We have previously delineated this scenario by defining a process (the Ca2+/metabolic coupling process (CMCP)) that is activated only when both Ca2+ influx is stimulated and cytochrome c is reduced and perhaps translocated (11Jung S.R. Kuok I.T. Couron D. Rizzo N. Margineantu D.H. Hockenbery D.M. Kim F. Sweet I.R. Reduced cytochrome c is an essential regulator of sustained insulin secretion by pancreatic islets.J. Biol.

A highly energetic process couples calcium influx through L-type calcium channels to insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 297: E717-E727Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The proteins comprising the CMCP have not been identified, but its activity can be measured as Ca2+-sensitive oxygen consumption rate (OCR), a parameter representing the work carried out by the regulatory process. Functionally, cytochrome c reduction and Ca2+ influx both have to increase to activate the CMCP and ISR. Although it is known that islets initially compensate for insulin resistance, impairment of glucose metabolism in islets is associated with long standing diabetes (16Doliba N.M. Fenner D. Zelent B.

Functional and molecular defects of pancreatic islets in human type 2 diabetes.Diabetes. 2005; 54: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We therefore strove to determine the relative control of ISR by Ca2+ and cytochrome c signaling in islets that have lower metabolic activity. We reasoned that the loss of metabolic response would differentially affect Ca2+ influx versus cytochrome c reduction allowing evaluation of the relative importance of these two signals in governing ISR. To do this, two islet models with impaired metabolic response were used. The first model was induced by culturing islets in the presence of low glucose, which causes the loss of glucokinase (GK) activity, thereby decreasing the metabolic response to glucose (19Liang Y. Najafi H. Smith R.M. Zimmerman E.C. Magnuson M.A. Tal M. Matschinsky F.M.

Cluster analysis of rat pancreatic islet gene mRNA levels after culture in low-, intermediate- and high-glucose concentrations.Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The second model of impaired metabolism was generated by fasting rats prior to islet isolation (21Burch P.T. Trus M.D. Berner D.K. Leontire A. Zawalich K.C. Matschinsky F.M. Adaptation of glycolytic enzymes: glucose use and insulin release in rat pancreatic islets during fasting and refeeding.Diabetes. 1981; 30: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The major findings of the study from both islet models were that although glucose-stimulated Ca2+ influx remained robust in the islets, OCR, cytochrome c reduction, and ISR were all decreased. The implication is that when islet metabolism is moderately compromised, there is still enough production of energy to promote stimulatory levels of Ca2+ influx, but the impairment of cytochrome c signaling results in decreased ISR. Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate was used for the perifusion analyses as described (12Sweet I.R. Gilbert M.

All procedures were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Islets were prepared and purified as described (23Sweet I.R. Cook D.L. DeJulio E. Wallen A.R.

Islets were also harvested from a novel mouse model in which we induced the conditional double knock-out (DKO) of islet Bax and Bak, as recently described (25Luciani D.S. White S.A. Widenmaier S.B.

A flow culture system was used that concomitantly measured OCR and cytochrome c reduction while collecting outflow fractions for subsequent measurement of insulin (described previously (23Sweet I.R.

Reduced cytochrome c was measured as absorbance at 550 nm by the layer of intact islets in the perifusion chamber (23Sweet I.R. Cook D.L. DeJulio E. Wallen A.R. Khalil G. Callis J. Reems J. Regulation of ATP/ADP in pancreatic islets.Diabetes. 2004; 53: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Insulin in the outflow fractions was measured using an RIA kit (Linco Research Inc., Billerica, MA). Cytosolic Ca2+ was measured by fluorescent imaging of islets after loading them with Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen) as described previously (28Jung S.R. Reed B.J. Sweet I.R. PMCID: PMC2739700) A highly energetic process couples calcium influx through L-type calcium channels to insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 297: E717-E727Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Dyed islets were pipetted into a temperature-controlled perifusion dish as a monolayer (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) that was mounted onto the stage of a Nikon Eclipse TE-200 inverted microscope, and fluorescent emission was detected at 510 nm during alternating excitation at either 340 nm or 380 nm. Flow rate was 120 μl/min, and the perifusion chamber volume was 40 μl. Islets were preincubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate containing 3 mm glucose for 60 min at 37 °C/5% CO2. Subsequently, islets were picked into 12 × 75 test tubes containing 90 μl of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (with 0.5 mm Ca2+) and incubated for 30 min. Ten μl of 45Ca2+ (1 μCi) were then added followed by the addition of the indicated reagents. The free and cell-associated radioactivity were separated at exactly 15 min by centrifuging the islets through an oil layer and measuring the radioactivity (29Sweet I.R. Cook D.L. Lernmark A. Greenbaum C.J. Wallen A.R. Marcum E.S. Stekhova S.A. Krohn K.A. Systematic screening of potential β-cell imaging agents.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 976-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). ATP was measured using an ATP Lite kit (PerkinElmer), where luminescence was measured using a Synergy4 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). Insulin content per islet was determined after adding islets (5/sample) to 1 ml of a hydrochloric acid, 95% ethanol mixture (2% v/v) and incubating for 60 min. The supernatant was collected and assayed for insulin. To avoid mitochondrial contamination, extraction of cytosol was accomplished by permeabilization of the islet plasma membrane (30Wolf B.A. Comens P.G. Ackermann K.E. Sherman W.R. McDaniel M.L. The digitonin-permeabilized pancreatic islet model: effect of myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate on Ca2+ mobilization.Biochem.

Analyzing mitochondrial changes during apoptosis.Methods. 2002; 26: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Islets were incubated in 24-well plates (500/well) containing 500 μl of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate under various conditions. To extract cytosol, 480 μl of supernatant were removed (leaving 20 μl), and 1 ml of ice-cold PBS was added. After the islets settled, the wash buffer was replaced with 70 μl of ice-cold permeabilization buffer (20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.5, with 50 μg/ml digitonin, and protease inhibitors (Clontech)). After 5 min on ice, islets were centrifuged (13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was analyzed for presence of cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (antibodies from Clontech) and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) by Western blot. Bands were quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Lack of appearance of cytochrome c oxidase in the cytosolic fraction demonstrated a lack of contamination by mitochondria (data not shown). Statistical significance was determined using either Student's t tests or analysis of variance with a Bonferroni's post hoc test (as indicated) using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). To establish the premise of the model system that islets cultured in 3 mm glucose have decreased glycolytic response relative to islets cultured optimally (i.e. at 11 mm glucose), we compared the effect of glucose and a mitochondrial fuel (KIC) that would bypass GK on ISR (Fig. 1). ISR by islets cultured at 11 mm glucose responded similarly to 20 mm glucose or 10 mm KIC. In contrast, ISR by islets cultured at 3 mm glucose increased only slightly (about 10% of the control response to 20 mm glucose). Secretory response of these islets to 10 mm KIC was still intact, although somewhat reduced (about 50% of the 11 mm glucose control), indicating that intrinsic mechanisms of secretion were still operational. This appeared to be the case despite diminished insulin content (0.44 ± 0.19 versus 0.64 ± 0.27 ng/10 islets, n = 8, although not statistically significant) and ATP (21 ± 1.5 versus 33 ± 1.7 pmol/10 islets, n = 12, p < 0.05) in the islets cultured in 3 mm glucose. Note that no first phase response of ISR was seen when glucose or KIC was increased due to the low flow rates needed to resolve OCR relative to the dead space volume of the perifusion chamber and tubing (80 μl/min versus 800-μl chamber). As a result, changes in fuels resemble a ramp, a waveform that does not induce first phase insulin secretion (32Sweet I.R. Li G. Najafi H. Berner D. Matschinsky F.M. Effect of a glucokinase inhibitor on energy production and insulin release in pancreatic islets.Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E606-E625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in OCR observed in response to KIC was similar in islets cultured in either 3 mm or 11 mm glucose (Fig. 2), although the baseline OCR was lower in the islets culture in 3 mm glucose. Glucose response, however, in islets cultured in 3 mm glucose was about 50% of control, consistent with decreased glycolytic capacity. We have previously observed that Ca2+ entering the cell via L-type Ca2+ channels activates a highly energetic process that couples Ca2+ and metabolic factors to the secretion of insulin (termed the CMCP (15Jung S.R. Reed B.J. Sweet I.R. A highly energetic process couples calcium influx through L-type calcium channels to insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 297: E717-E727Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar)). If the process is blocked, then the islet does not generate the ATP needed to drive the process, and OCR decreases. This can be quantified as the decrement in OCR in response to a blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels (nimodipine) (Fig. 2), which in control islets is typically about 30% of glucose-stimulated OCR (12Sweet I.R. Gilbert M. Contribution of calcium influx in mediating glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption in pancreatic islets.Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Remarkably, in islets cultured at 3 mm glucose, the decrement was almost completely absent. We also tested whether the loss of glucose-stimulated OCR was due to decreased glucose transport or a switch to utilization of fatty acids as a fuel. However, glucose transport (measured as uptake of 3-O-methylglucose uptake) was not decreased, and palmitate had little effect on OCR by islets cultured in either 3 mm or 11 mm glucose (data not shown). Thus, it appears that culturing islets in 3 mm glucose reduces their capacity to generate factors needed to stimulate the CMCP and ISR. Our initial hypothesis was that a loss of glycolytic capacity due to culture at low glucose would impair Ca2+ influx in response to glucose, which would explain the loss of glucose-stimulated ISR. To test this, cytosolic Ca2+ was imaged after loading islets with a Ca2+-sensitive dye. Responses to KIC were nearly identical in islets cultured at 3 or 11 mm glucose (Fig. 3, A and B); consistent with the decrease in oxidative response to glucose, Ca2+ increment was less in the 3 mm glucose culture islets, but only by about 20% (similar to results obtained by Jonas and co-workers (20Bensellam M. Van Lommel L. Overbergh L. Schuit F.C. Jonas J.C. Cluster analysis of rat pancreatic islet gene mRNA levels after culture in low-, intermediate- and high-glucose concentrations.Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), although our data did not achieve statistical significance). Results were also calculated after converting the fluorescence ratios to Ca2+ concentrations using equations provided by (33Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. A new generation of Ca2+ indicators with greatly improved fluorescence properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but the results differed by only a few percentage points. The contribution of L-type Ca2+ channels to glucose-induced changes in cytosolic Ca2+, about 50%, was similar in islets cultured in either glucose concentration (and consistent with previous studies (34Gilbert M. Jung S.R. Reed B.J. Sweet I.R. Islet oxygen consumption and insulin secretion tightly coupled to calcium derived from L-type calcium channels but not from the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24334-24342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). Measured increases of cytosolic Ca2+ response to glucose reflect activation of L-type Ca2+ channels, but also reflect activation by influx through other plasma membrane channels and exchange between intracellular compartments such as efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum. We therefore used a second approach, one that is based on the uptake of 45Ca2+ from extracellular buffer (Fig. 3C). In contrast to the results obtained by cytosolic imaging, however, Ca2+ influx in response to glucose was actually bigger in islets cultured in low versus high glucose, and Ca2+ influx in response to glucose was totally suppressed by nimodipine. Thus, it appeared that Ca2+ entry into the islets through L-type Ca2+ channels remains intact in low glucose-cultured islets, despite the diminished metabolic response to glucose, suggesting that the impaired ISR in low glucose-cultured islets was not caused by a decrease in Ca2+ influx. To further test this interpretation, Ca2+ and ISR were measured in response to a direct activator of L-type Ca2+ channels. Past studies have shown that in islets cultured at 11 mm glucose, BayK8644 increases both Ca2+ influx and glucose-stimulated ISR (11Jung S.R. Kuok I.T. Couron D. Rizzo N. Margineantu D.H.

The glucose-induced Ca2+ response to the BayK compound in islets cultured in 3 mm glucose (Fig. 4A) was much larger than that stimulated by glucose in islets cultured at 11 mm glucose (Fig. 3A). However, ISR increased only marginally (Fig. 4B), indicating that Ca2+ influx stimulated by 20 mm glucose was nearly at maximally effective levels with respect to ISR. Moreover, the impairment of ISR in the low glucose-cultured islets was not mediated by a loss of Ca2+ response.FIGURE 3KIC- and glucose-stimulated cytosolic Ca2+ or 45Ca2+ influx by islets cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing either 11 mm or 3 mm glucose for 40 h.

https://openalex.org/W2055528253,"Accurately quantifying soil organic carbon (SOC) is considered fundamental to studying soil quality, modeling the global carbon cycle, and assessing global climate change. This study evaluated the uncertainties caused by up-scaling of soil properties from the county scale to the provincial scale and from lower-level classification of Soil Species to Soil Group, using four methods: the mean, median, Soil Profile Statistics (SPS), and pedological professional knowledge based (PKB) methods. For the SPS method, SOC stock is calculated at the county scale by multiplying the mean SOC density value of each soil type in a county by its corresponding area. For the mean or median method, SOC density value of each soil type is calculated using provincial arithmetic mean or median. For the PKB method, SOC density value of each soil type is calculated at the county scale considering soil parent materials and spatial locations of all soil profiles. A newly constructed 1∶50,000 soil survey geographic database of Zhejiang Province, China, was used for evaluation. Results indicated that with soil classification levels up-scaling from Soil Species to Soil Group, the variation of estimated SOC stocks among different soil classification levels was obviously lower than that among different methods. The difference in the estimated SOC stocks among the four methods was lowest at the Soil Species level. The differences in SOC stocks among the mean, median, and PKB methods for different Soil Groups resulted from the differences in the procedure of aggregating soil profile properties to represent the attributes of one soil type. Compared with the other three estimation methods (i.e., the SPS, mean and median methods), the PKB method holds significant promise for characterizing spatial differences in SOC distribution because spatial locations of all soil profiles are considered during the aggregation procedure."

Following the idea that functional relationships can be informed by the timing of gene expression, we devised a strategy to identify the core set of apicomplexan cell division cycling genes with important roles in parasite division, which includes many uncharacterized proteins. We assembled an expanded list of orthologs from the T. gondii and P. falciparum genome sequences (2781 putative orthologs), compared their mRNA profiles during synchronous replication, and sorted the resulting set of dual cell cycle regulated orthologs (744 total) into protein pairs conserved across many eukaryotic families versus those unique to the Apicomplexa. The analysis identified more than 100 ortholog gene pairs with unknown function in T. gondii and P. falciparum that displayed co-conserved mRNA abundance, dynamics of cyclical expression and similar peak timing that spanned the complete division cycle in each parasite. The unknown cyclical mRNAs encoded a diverse set of proteins with a wide range of mass and showed a remarkable conservation in the internal organization of ordered versus disordered structural domains. A representative sample of cyclical unknown genes (16 total) was epitope tagged in T. gondii tachyzoites yielding the discovery of new protein constituents of the parasite inner membrane complex, key mitotic structures and invasion organelles. These results demonstrate the utility of using gene expression timing and dynamic profile to identify proteins with unique roles in Apicomplexa biology."

R. rubrum strains were bioengineered to overexpress individually or in various combinations, six PHA biosynthetic genes (phaC1, phaA, phaB, phaC2, phaC3, and phaJ), and the resulting nine over-expressing strains were evaluated to assess the effect on PHA content, and the effect on growth. These experiments were designed to genetically evaluate: 1) the role of each apparently redundant PHA polymerase in determining PHA productivity; 2) identify the key gene(s) within the pha biosynthetic operon that determines PHA productivity; and 3) the role of phaJ to support PHA productivity. The result of overexpressing each PHA polymerase-encoding gene indicates that phaC1 and phaC2 are significant contributors to PHA productivity, whereas phaC3 has little effect. Similarly, over-expressing individually or in combination the three PHA biosynthesis genes located in the pha operon indicates that phaB is the key determinant of PHA productivity. Finally, analogous experiments indicate that phaJ does not contribute significantly to PHA productivity. These bioengineering strains achieved PHA productivity of up to 30% of dry biomass, which is approximately 2.5-fold higher than the non-engineered control strain, indicating the feasibility of using this approach to produce value added bio-based products."
https://openalex.org/W1985703720,"Dilatation of the ascending aorta (AAD) is a prevalent aortopathy that occurs frequently associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), the most common human congenital cardiac malformation. The molecular mechanisms leading to AAD associated with BAV are still poorly understood. The search for differentially expressed genes in diseased tissue by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is an invaluable tool to fill this gap. However, studies dedicated to identify reference genes necessary for normalization of mRNA expression in aortic tissue are scarce. In this report, we evaluate the qPCR expression of six candidate reference genes in tissue from the ascending aorta of 52 patients with a variety of clinical and demographic characteristics, normal and dilated aortas, and different morphologies of the aortic valve (normal aorta and normal valve n = 30; dilated aorta and normal valve n = 10; normal aorta and BAV n = 4; dilated aorta and BAV n = 8). The expression stability of the candidate reference genes was determined with three statistical algorithms, GeNorm, NormFinder and Bestkeeper. The expression analyses showed that the most stable genes for the three algorithms employed were CDKN1β, POLR2A and CASC3, independently of the structure of the aorta and the valve morphology. In conclusion, we propose the use of these three genes as reference genes for mRNA expression analysis in human ascending aorta. However, we suggest searching for specific reference genes when conducting qPCR experiments with new cohort of samples."

In this capacity,SIK2 attenuates the association of the PP2A repressor, the protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1), thus preserving the methylation status of the PP2A catalytic subunit. Furthermore, the SIK2-PP2A holoenzyme complex dephosphorylates and inactivates Ca2(+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI), an upstream kinase for phosphorylating PME-1/Ser(15). The functionally antagonistic SIK2-PP2A and CaMKI and PME-1 networks thus constitute a negative feedback loop that modulates the phosphatase activity of PP2A. Depletion of SIK2 led to disruption of the SIK2-PP2A complex, activation of CaMKI, and downstream effects, including phosphorylation of HDAC5/Ser(259), sequestration of HDAC5 in the cytoplasm, and activation of myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C)-mediated gene expression. These results suggest that the SIK2-PP2A complex functions in the regulation of MEF2C-dependent transcription. Furthermore, this study suggests that the tightly linked regulatory loop comprised of the SIK2-PP2A and CaMKI and PME-1 networks may function in fine-tuning cell proliferation and stress response."

Depletion of γδT cells has been found to abrogate ischemia reperfusion injury in murine stroke. However, the role of γδT cells in human ischemic stroke is unknown. We aimed to determine γδT cell counts and γδT cell interleukin 17A (IL-17A) production in the clinical setting of ischemic stroke. We also aimed to determine the associations of γδT cell counts with ischemic lesion volume, measures of clinical severity and with major stroke risk factors. Peripheral blood samples from 43 acute ischemic stroke patients and 26 control subjects matched on race and gender were used for flow cytometry and complete blood count analyses. Subsequently, cytokine levels and gene expression were measured in γδT cells. The number of circulating γδT cells was decreased by almost 50% (p = 0.005) in the stroke patients. γδT cell counts did not correlate with lesion volume on magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging or with clinical severity in the stroke patients, but γδT cells showed elevated levels of IL-17A (p = 0.048). Decreased γδT cell counts were also associated with older age (p = 0.004), pre-existing hypertension (p = 0.0005) and prevalent coronary artery disease (p = 0.03), with pre-existing hypertension being the most significant predictor of γδT cell counts in a multivariable analysis. γδT cells in human ischemic stroke are reduced in number and show elevated levels of IL-17A. A major reduction in γδT lymphocytes also occurs in hypertension and may contribute to the development of hypertension-mediated stroke and vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W1966983242,"Song control nuclei have distinct sexual differences and thus are an ideal model to address how brain areas are sexually differentiated. Through a combination of histological analysis and electrical lesions, we first identified the ventricle site for HVC progenitor cells. We then found that there were significant sex differences in the cellular proliferation activity in the ventricular zone of the HVC, the number of migrating cells along the radial cells (positive immunoreactions to vimentin) and differentiation towards neurons. Through co-culturing of male and female slices containing the developing HVC in the same well, we found that the male slices could produce diffusible substances to masculinize the female HVC. By adding estrogen, an estrogen antagonist, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or its antibody into the culture medium, separately or in combination, we found that these diffusible substances may include estrogen and BDNF. Finally, we found that 1) estrogen-induced BDNF upregulation could be detected 48 hr after estrogen treatment and could not be blocked by a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor and 2) the amount of VEGF mRNA expressed in the developing HVC and its adjacent area did not display any significant sex differences, as did the distribution of VEGF and laminin-expressing endothelial cells in the developing HVC. Because these findings are largely different from previous reports on the adult female HVC, it is suggested that our estrogen-induced BDNF up-regulation and the resultant sexual differentiation might not be mediated by VEGF and endothelial cells, but instead, may result from the direct effects of estrogen on BDNF."
https://openalex.org/W1995421605,"Understanding how dietary intake changes over time is important for studies of diet and disease and may inform interventions to improve dietary intakes. We investigated how a dietary pattern (DP) tracked over 10-years in the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study control group. Dietary intake was assessed at multiple time-points in 2037 severely obese individuals (BMI 41±4 kg/m2). Reduced rank regression was used to derive a dietary pattern using dietary energy density (kJ/g), saturated fat (%) and fibre density (mg/kJ) as response variables and score respondents at each follow-up. Tracking coefficients for the DP, its key foods and macronutrient response variables and corrected for time-dependent and time-independent covariates were calculated using generalised estimating equations to take into account all available data. The DP tracking coefficient was moderate for women (0.40; 95% CI: 0.38–0.42) and men (0.38; 95% CI: 0.35–0.41). Of the eleven foods key to this DP, fruit and vegetable intakes had the strongest tracking coefficient for both sexes. Fast food and candy had the lowest tracking coefficients for women and men respectively. Scores for an energy dense, high saturated fat, low fibre density DP appear moderately stable over a 10-year period in this severely obese population. Furthermore, some food groups appear more amenable to change while others, often the most healthful, appear more stable and may require intervention before adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W1996443695,"Around the fifth week after birth, the vaginal cavity in female mouse pups opens to the overlaying skin. This postnatal tissue remodeling of the genital tract occurs during puberty, and it largely depends upon hormonally induced apoptosis that mainly occurs in the epithelium at the lower part of the mouse vaginal cavity. Previously, we showed that most BALB/c mice lacking the class IV Semaphorin (Sema4D) develop imperforate vagina and hydrometrocolpos; therefore, we reasoned that the absence of Sema4D-induced apoptosis in vaginal epithelial cells may cause the imperforate vagina. Sema4D signals via the Plexin-B1 receptor; nevertheless detailed mechanisms mediating this hormonally triggered apoptosis are not fully documented. To investigate the estrogen-dependent control of Sema4D signaling during the apoptosis responsible for mouse vaginal opening, we examined structural and functional modulation of Sema4D, Plexin-B1, and signaling molecules by analyzing both wild-type and Sema4D−/− mice with or without ovariectomy. Both the release of soluble Sema4D and the conversion of Plexin-B1 by proteolytic processing in vaginal tissue peaked 5 weeks after birth of wild-type BALB/c mice at the time of vaginal opening. Estrogen supplementation of ovariectomized wild-type mice revealed that both the release of soluble Sema4D and the conversion of Plexin-B1 into an active form were estrogen-dependent and concordant with apoptosis. Estrogen supplementation of ovariectomized Sema4D−/− mice did not induce massive vaginal apoptosis in 5-week-old mice; therefore, Sema4D may be an essential apoptosis-inducing ligand that acts downstream of estrogen action in vaginal epithelium during this postnatal tissue remodeling. Analysis of ovariectomized mice also indicated that Sema4D contributed to estrogen-dependent dephosphorylation of Akt and ERK at the time of vaginal opening. Based on our results, we propose that apoptosis in vaginal epithelium during postnatal vaginal opening is induced by enhanced Sema4D signaling that is caused by estrogen-dependent structural changes of Sema4D and Plexin-B1."
https://openalex.org/W2012869470,"Resident human lamina propria immune cells serve as powerful effectors in host defense. Molecular events associated with the initiation of an intestinal inflammatory response in these cells are largely unknown. Here, we aimed to characterize phenotypic and functional changes induced in these cells at the onset of intestinal inflammation using a human intestinal organ culture model. In this model, healthy human colonic mucosa was depleted of epithelial cells by EDTA treatment. Following loss of the epithelial layer, expression of the inflammatory mediators IL1B, IL6, IL8, IL23A, TNFA, CXCL2, and the surface receptors CD14, TLR2, CD86, CD54 was rapidly induced in resident lamina propria cells in situ as determined by qRT-PCR and immunohistology. Gene microarray analysis of lamina propria cells obtained by laser-capture microdissection provided an overview of global changes in gene expression occurring during the initiation of an intestinal inflammatory response in these cells. Bioinformatic analysis gave insight into signalling pathways mediating this inflammatory response. Furthermore, comparison with published microarray datasets of inflamed mucosa in vivo (ulcerative colitis) revealed a significant overlap of differentially regulated genes underlining the in vivo relevance of the organ culture model. Furthermore, genes never been previously associated with intestinal inflammation were identified using this model. The organ culture model characterized may be useful to study molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of an intestinal inflammatory response in normal mucosa as well as potential alterations of this response in inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2082396276,"Objectives Pericardial fat (PCF) may induce local inflammation and subsequent structural remodeling of the left atrium (LA). However, the adverse effects of PCF on LA are difficult to be evaluated and quantified. The atrial electromechanical interval determined by transthoracic echocardiogram was shown to be a convenient parameter which can reflect the process of LA remodeling. The goal of the present study was to investigate the association between the electromechanical interval and PCF. Methods and Results A total of 337 patients with mean age of 51.9±9.0 years were enrolled. The electromechanical interval (PA-PDI) defined as the time interval from the initiation of the P wave deflection to the peak of the mitral inflow A wave on the pulse wave Doppler imaging was measured for every patient. The amount of PCF was determined by multi-detector computed tomography. The PA-PDI interval was significantly correlated with the amount of PCF (r = 0.641, p value <0.001). Graded prolongation of PA-PDI interval was observed across 3 groups of patients divided according to the tertile values of PCF. The AUC for the PA-PDI interval in predicting an increased amount of PCF (third tertile) was 0.796. At a cutoff value of 130 ms identified by the ROC curve, the sensitivity and specificity of PA-PDI interval in identifying patients with a highest tertile of PCF were 63.4% and 85.3%, respectively. Conclusions The PA-PDI intervals were longer in patients with an increased amount of PCF. It may be a useful parameter to represent the degree of PCF-related atrial remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2084390051,"Microrefugia at high altitudes or high latitudes are thought to play an important role in the post-glacial colonization of species. However, how populations in such microrefugia have responded to climate changes in alternating cold glacial and warm interglacial stages remain unclear. Here we present evidence to indicate the Rongbuk Valley of the Mt. Qomolangma (Mt. Everest) area, the highest region on earth, had microrefugia for Hippophae tibetana and discuss how this low shrub was adapted to the extreme climate fluctuations of the last 25,000 years by shifts. By integrating geological, glaciological, meteorological, and genetic information, we found that the Rongbuk Valley was not only a glacial microrefugium but also an interglacial microrefugium for H. tibetana: the former was located on the riverbank below 4800 m above sea level (asl) or lower area and the latter at ∼ 5000 m asl. Our results show that after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), H. tibetana in the valley has undergone upward and downward migrations around ∼ 5000 m driven by climate fluctuations and the population in the glacial microrefugium has suffered extinction or extreme contraction. Moreover, with the rise of temperature in the last four decades, the upper limit of H. tibetana has shifted at least 30 m upward. Combining population history and recent range shift of this species is important in predicting the fate of this endemic species to future climate changes."
https://openalex.org/W2018648230,"Although a number of previous research studies have focused on the long-term analysis of the health and health behaviour of the elderly, there is still a shortage of information in relation to the long-term trends regarding health or risk and preventive behaviour in the elderly population taking into account gender differences and differences in educational level.The database comprised subsamples of the Austrian Micro-Census, including individuals aged 65 years and older, for the years 1983, 1991, 1999, and subsamples of the ATHIS (Austrian Health Interview Survey) 2007. A trend analysis was conducted for four health-related variables with the year of the survey and education as predictors. The analysis was stratified by sex.We found a general trend towards better self-rated health, better preventive and less risk behaviour among the elderly, while the body mass index has been increasing over the years. There are indeed gender differences regarding the trend in smoking behaviour. While the prevalence of male smoking has been steadily decreasing, female smoking prevalence has not changed. At all points in time, individuals with higher education had significantly better self-rated health than those with lower education but the association between education and preventive behaviour significantly decreased over the years.We agree with previous research in concluding that preventive action and health promotion should aim in particular to support older women and men with lower education."
