https://openalex.org/W2011919513,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions and mutations have been reported to occur with aging in various tissues. To determine the functional impact of these changes, we measured mtDNA copy number, mitochondria-encoded cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit I and III transcript levels, and COX enzyme activity in skeletal muscles (medial and lateral gastrocnemius and soleus), liver, and heart in 6- and 27-month-old rats. Substantial age-related reductions of mtDNA copy number occurred in skeletal muscle groups (−23–40%,p < 0.03) and liver (−50%, p < 0.01) but not in the heart. The decline in mtDNA was not associated with reduced COX transcript levels in tissues with high oxidative capacities such as red soleus muscle or liver, while transcript levels were reduced with aging in the less oxidative mixed fiber gastrocnemius muscle (−17–22%, p < 0.05). Consistent with transcript levels, COX activity also remained unchanged in aging liver and heart but declined with age in the lateral gastrocnemius (−32%,p < 0.05). Thus, the effects of aging on mitochondrial gene expression are tissue-specific. A substantial age-related decline in mtDNA copy number proportional to tissue oxidative capacities is demonstrated in skeletal muscle and liver. mtDNA levels are in contrast preserved in the aging heart muscle, presumably due to its incessant aerobic activity. Reduced mtDNA copy number has no major effects on mitochondrial encoded transcript levels and enzyme activities in various tissues under these base-line study conditions. In contrast, maintenance of mitochondrial transcript levels that may be linked to oxidative metabolism and energy demand appears to be the main determinant of mitochondrial oxidative capacity in aging tissues.

Science. 1992; 256: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) because of their potential negative impact on mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative capacity. However, whether, to what extent, and in which tissues age-related oxidative alterations affect mitochondrial gene expression remains largely to be defined. In highly oxidative organs such as liver and heart, the effects of aging on specific steps of mitochondrial gene expression and respiratory chain activity are indeed controversial (6.Stocco D.M.

Sci. 1996; 93: 15364-15369Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) are associated with reduced muscle mass and endurance capacity in aging skeletal muscle (14.Holloszy J.O. Coyle E.F. J. Appl. Physiol. 1984; 56: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 15.Dutta C. Hadley E.C. J. Geront. 1996; 50A: 1-4Crossref Google Scholar, 16.Dutta C. Hadley E.C. Lexell J. Muscle Nerve. 1997; 5 (suppl.): 5-9Crossref Google Scholar), but the molecular level at which these changes occur is not known. Moreover, skeletal muscle groups are highly heterogeneous with respect to oxidative metabolism and function (17.Armstrong R.B. Phelps R.O. Am. J. Anat. 1984; 171: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). In particular muscle fiber composition and oxidative metabolism have been shown to influence skeletal muscle mitochondrial gene expression in adult animal models (18.Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12390-12394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However the impact of these variables on aging mitochondrial gene expression has not been previously investigated. To address these issues, we measured mitochondrial DNA copy number and mitochondrial DNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunits I and III mRNA expression as well as COX enzyme activity in tissues of young and old rats. Cytochrome c oxidase was selected because of its key role as a flux-generating enzyme in the electron transfer chain (19.Newsholme E.A. Start C. Regulation in Metabolism. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1973Google Scholar). Furthermore, its transcript levels reflect other mitochondria-encoded genes in that all information on mitochondrial DNA is transcribed into single policystrionic products (20.Aloni Y. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1757-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21.Ojala D. Montoya J. Attardi G. Nature. 1981; 290: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle as well as liver and heart muscle were studied in order to include tissues with a wide range of oxidative capacities and therefore different potential for age-related mitochondrial oxidative damage (1.Harman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1981; 78: 7124-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar, 2.Wallace D.C. Science. 1992; 256: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 3.Hsin-Chen L.

Ageing Dev. 1994; 76: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Finally, the role of different functional and metabolic characteristics in different skeletal muscle groups was further addressed by studying the lateral and medial portions of the moderately oxidative gastrocnemius with mixed type I-II fiber content as compared with the highly oxidative type I soleus muscle (17.Armstrong R.B. Phelps R.O. Am. J. Anat. 1984; 171: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Young (n= 7, age 6 months) and old (n = 9, age 27 months) Fischer 344 male rats were purchased from the NIA, National Institutes of Health. All animals were fed a standard commercial chow diet, and animal care as well as all experiments were carried out in keeping with institutional guidelines. On the study day, rats were injected with an intraperitoneal overdose of sodium pentobarbital. The medial and lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle, the soleus muscle, liver, and heart were then quickly removed in this order. Tissues were immediately frozen in isopentane, cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. To measure mtDNA copy number, cDNA probes for mtDNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX I) and nucleus-encoded 28 S rRNA genes were generated by reverse transcription-PCR amplification from skeletal muscle total RNA. Primers for the COX I probe corresponded to nucleotides 6255–6274 (forward) and 6615–6635 (reverse; PCR product of 381 base pairs) of the rat mitochondrial genome (GenBankTM accession no. X14848). The amplified 28 S rRNA cDNA probe (330 base pairs) was a generous gift of Dr. B. McIver. Amplification products were cloned into the TA-plasmid vector (TA Cloning KIT, Invitrogen, CA) used to transfect competent bacteria (TA Cloning KIT, Invitrogen, CA), isolated (Endo Free Plasmid Maxi Kit, Qiagen, Germany), and sequenced before use. Total DNA was extracted from 30–50 mg of each tissue using the Wizard Genomic DNA Isolation kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Heart specimens for all analyses were taken from the left ventricle. For each tissue, 8 μg of DNA from each animal was digested with the EcoRI restriction endonuclease (Promega), separated on one 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred overnight to nylon membranes (HyBond N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Blots were subsequently hybridized to the COX I, and the 28 S rRNA probes were radiolabeled with [32P]CTP (Decaprime KIT; Ambion, Austin, TX) as follows. All membranes were prehybridized at 68 °C for 30 min (ExpressHyb Hybridization Solution; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), hybridized to the radioactive probe for 1 h at 68 °C, and then washed at room temperature three times for 10 min in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS and at 50 °C two times for 20 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Membranes were then exposed to films at −80 °C for 3–16 h (Kodak Biomax MR; Eastman Kodak Co.). The resulting images were quantitated by laser densitometry (Ultroscan; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated from 30–50 mg of each tissue by the guanidinium method (Tri Reagent; MRC, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). For each tissue, 15 μg of total RNA from each animal were separated on one 1.5% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel, transferred overnight to nylon membranes (HyBond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and hybridized as reported above with COX I, COX III, and 28 S rRNA radioactive probes in this order. The COX I probe was the same used for DNA analysis, whereas different cDNA probes were generated as reported above for COX III and 28 S rRNA. Primers for reverse transcription-PCR amplification of the COX III probe corresponded to nucleotides 8836–8856 (forward) and 9174–9190 (reverse; PCR product of 355 base pairs) of the rat mitochondrial genome (GenBankTM accession no. X14848). Primers for the 28 S rRNA probe corresponded to nucleotides 4203–4222 (forward) and 4370–4389 (reverse; PCR product of 186 base pairs) of the rat ribosomal RNA genome (GenBankTM accession no. V01270). Signal detection and quantification following hybridization were carried out as described for DNA analysis. COX enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically from tissue homogenates as previously reported (13.Rooyakers O. Adey D.B. Ades P.A. Nair K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 15364-15369Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). This measurement was not performed in the soleus muscle due to insufficient tissue availability. In both Southern and Northern blots, COX I and COX III bands in each tissue were normalized to the corresponding 28 S rRNA band, and individual results were expressed as a percentage of the average value for young animals. mtDNA levels were thus normalized to nuclear DNA content as expressed by the abundance of the 28 S rRNA gene. Although it is theoretically possible that variations in nuclear DNA levels may have contributed to the current results, we consider it unlikely for several reasons. In particular, no studies have shown increased amounts of total DNA from young adult to old age. Several studies have in turn reported stable DNA content in aging skeletal muscle (23.Welle S. Bhatt K. Thornton C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E224-E229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as heart (24.Adler C.P. Friedburg H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1986; 18: 39-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and liver (25.Bohman R. Tamura C.T. Doolittle M.H. Cascarano J. J. Exp. Zool. 1985; 233: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Changes in liver ploidy also appear to be complete by 2 months of age in rats, and nuclear content is substantially unchanged thereafter in this tissue (25.Bohman R. Tamura C.T. Doolittle M.H. Cascarano J. J. Exp. Zool. 1985; 233: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Results in young and old rats were compared using Student's t test for unpaired data. Linear regression analysis was used to study the relationship between different variables. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. mtDNA copy number was significantly reduced in old animals in all skeletal muscle groups and in the liver but not in the heart (Fig.1). The mtDNA decline was similar in the red and white portions of the gastrocnemius (by 23–25%), whereas it was higher in the more oxidative soleus muscle (−40%) and highest in the liver (approximately −50%). In contrast to mtDNA, COX I and III transcript levels were not reduced by aging in the soleus muscle and liver (Figs. 2 and3), while a significant decline was observed in the gastrocnemius muscle (−17–22%, Fig. 2). COX transcript levels relative to mtDNA were comparable in young and old animals in both portions of the gastrocnemius, while they were markedly increased in the soleus and liver (+70–240%; Fig. Figure 2, Figure 3). At variance with the other tissues, both cardiac COX mRNA levels and mRNA:mtDNA ratios were unchanged by aging in old animals (Fig.3).Figure 2Effects of aging on COX I and COX III mRNA levels and their ratios to mtDNA in skeletal muscle groups.

In the medial gastrocnemius as well as liver and heart tissues, COX activities were unaltered in old as compared with young rats. A positive correlation was observed in the lateral and medial portions of the gastrocnemius muscle between COX I (r = 0.36, p = 0.05) and III (r = 0.39, p = 0.04) mRNA and COX enzyme activity. A similar correlation was also found in all tissues between COX I (r = 0.29,p = 0.02) and III (r = 0.24,p = 0.06) mRNA and COX enzyme activity when expressed as percentages of average values in young animals in each tissue.Table ICytochrome c oxidase enzyme activity (average ± S.E.) in young and old rats in skeletal muscles, liver, and heartCytochrome c oxidase activity (μmol/min · g protein)YoungOldGastrocnemius medial187 ± 62162 ± 13Gastrocnemius lateral232 ± 22166 ± 6ap < 0.05 versus young.Liver455 ± 18444 ± 11Heart1136 ± 601194 ± 61a p < 0.05 versus young. Open table in a new tab The current data demonstrate that a substantial mitochondrial DNA depletion occurs with aging in skeletal muscle and liver. Furthermore, such a decline is proportional to tissue oxidative capacities as indicated by cytochrome c enzyme activities. Therefore, the present results indicate that reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number may be a major result of cumulative oxidative damage in aging tissues along with previously reported mutations and deletions (1.Harman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1981; 78: 7124-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar, 2.Wallace D.C. Science. 1992; 256: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 3.Hsin-Chen L.

Ageing Dev. 1994; 76: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the preserved mitochondrial DNA as well as COX transcript levels and enzyme activity in the highly oxidative aging heart muscle are intriguing in their implication that template depletion is not an inevitable result of age-associated oxidative alterations. The mechanisms determining the preserved cardiac mitochondrial DNA levels as well as gene expression in old animals are likely to include the unique incessant myocardial contractile activity. Previous studies have indeed shown that long term aerobic exercise in skeletal muscles may increase mitochondrial density in humans (14.Holloszy J.O. Coyle E.F. J. Appl. Physiol. 1984; 56: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar) as well as mitochondrial DNA content in animal models (18.Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12390-12394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Williams R.S. Garcia-Moll M. Mellor J. Salmons S. Harlan W. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1994; 267: E388-E395PubMed Google Scholar). Left ventricular hypertrophy is also a common feature of the aging myocardium in both humans and rodents (28.Lakatta E.G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 413-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), and experimentally induced hypertrophy increased cardiac mitochondrial DNA content in adult rats (29.Meerson F.Z. Pomoinitsky V.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1972; 4: 571-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30.Rajamanickam C. Merten S. Kwiatkowska-Patzer B. Chuang C. Zak R. Rabinowitz M. Circ. Res. 1979; 45: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Differential effects of aging on mitochondrial antioxidant defense systems should also be taken into account. Mitochondrial manganese-superoxide dismutase activity indeed appears to be higher in the heart than in skeletal muscle (31.Ji L.L. Dillon D. Wu E. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: R918-R923PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Ji L.L. Dillon D. Wu E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R386-R392PubMed Google Scholar), and this difference is enhanced in aging rats by larger age-related increments in heart (31.Ji L.L. Dillon D. Wu E. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: R918-R923PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Ji L.L. Dillon D. Wu E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R386-R392PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the high manganese-superoxide dismutase activity in the liver does not increase with age (32.Ji L.L. Dillon D. Wu E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R386-R392PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that a relative deficiency of mitochondrial antioxidants may contribute to the substantial age-associated decline in mitochondrial DNA in this tissue. Of note, the findings in this paper are supported by reports of reduced mitochondrial density in aging skeletal muscle (14.Holloszy J.O. Coyle E.F. J. Appl. Physiol. 1984; 56: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar) and liver (33.Scotto A.W. Rineheart R.W. Beattie D.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with unchanged mitochondrial number in the aging heart (34.Tomanek R.J. Karlsson U.L. J. Ultrastr. Res. 1973; 42: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast with the age effect on mitochondrial DNA copy number, the effects of aging on mitochondrial transcript levels were limited to the mixed gastrocnemius muscle, with more pronounced changes observed in the lateral than in the medial less oxidative portion (17.Armstrong R.B. Phelps R.O. Am. J. Anat. 1984; 171: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Most importantly, no changes were detected in the aging soleus muscle and liver despite marked reductions of mitochondrial template availability. Moreover, transcript levels relative to mitochondrial DNA were either preserved or markedly increased in all aging tissues. Finally, transcript levels were positively related to oxidative capacities in all tissues as well as in the two portions of the gastrocnemius. The above observations support several important conclusions. First, the impact of template depletion on mitochondrial gene expression may vary in different organs and in skeletal muscle groups with different fiber composition. Furthermore, transcript levels can be maintained despite reduced template availability in aging skeletal muscle and liver, thereby implying compensatory age-related changes of transcription efficiency, transcript stability, or both. Finally, the maintenance of transcript levels appears to be the most important step in regulating mitochondrial oxidative capacity in aging rat tissues. The current findings in skeletal muscle indicate that different molecular mechanisms may regulate mitochondrial gene expression in type I and mixed type II-type I muscle groups in aging animals, and this conclusion is consistent with previous studies in growing or adult animal models (18.Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12390-12394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Williams R.S. Garcia-Moll M. Mellor J. Salmons S. Harlan W. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1994; 267: E388-E395PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, increased oxidative capacities following exercise training or chronic electrical stimulation were primarily associated at the molecular level with increased mitochondrial DNA content in moderately oxidative type II (18.Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12390-12394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Williams R.S. Garcia-Moll M. Mellor J. Salmons S. Harlan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2764-2767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but with increased mitochondrial transcripts in highly oxidative type I muscle groups (27.Murakami T. Shimomura T. Fujitsuka N. Nakai N. Sugiyama S. Ozawa T. Sokabe M. Horai S. Tokuyama K. Suzuki M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E388-E395PubMed Google Scholar). These differential results are likely to be due at least in part to the different mitochondrial density (17.Armstrong R.B. Phelps R.O. Am. J. Anat. 1984; 171: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) as well as mitochondrial DNA content (18.Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12390-12394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in different fiber types. More importantly, they suggest that reduced mitochondrial DNA availability may be a limiting factor of mitochondrial gene expression in type II but not in type I fibers as indeed confirmed by the current investigation. In the presence of reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number, the transcript:template ratios were higher in the more oxidative tissues in this study. Both the COX I (r = 0.69; p< 0.001) and COX III (r = 0.59; p = 0.001) mRNA:mtDNA ratios were positively related with oxidative capacity COX activity in skeletal muscles and liver in old animals. These observations suggest that oxidative metabolism itself might enhance mitochondrial transcript levels in aging tissues in the presence of reduced mitochondrial DNA. Oxygen consumption and organ perfusion are highest in the liver and heart, and they are also substantially higher in type I postural compared with type II exercise-related skeletal muscles (35.Delp M.A. Evans M.V. Duan C. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 85: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A stimulatory drive of energy demand on mitochondrial transcription and respiratory activity could be therefore mediated by oxidative substrate availability. In vitro studies have indeed shown that fatty acid supply is directly related to its mitochondrial oxidation rate (36.Schultz H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and increased mitochondrial transcript:template ratio was recently reported in diabetic human skeletal muscle in which glucose and fat availability are substantially enhanced (37.Antonetti D.A. Reynet C. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The measurement of COX activities may reflect mitochondrial oxidative capacities and is therefore an important index of mitochondrial function. Consistent with changes in mitochondrial transcript levels, this was not affected by aging in the liver and heart, while it was reduced in the lateral but not in the medial portion of the gastrocnemius muscle. The current data therefore indicate that reduced mitochondrial function may contribute to the age-related dysfunction (12.Trounce I. Byrne E. Marzuki S. Lancet. 1989; 1: 637-638Abstract PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 13.Rooyakers O. Adey D.B. Ades P.A. Nair K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Muscle Nerve. 1997; 5 (suppl.): 5-9Crossref Google Scholar) of exercise-related mixed fiber muscles with particular regard to muscle fatigability, which is inversely related to ATP availability. On the other hand these results also suggest that mitochondrial alterations are unlikely to influence aging liver and heart function. With respect to the heart tissue, this observation is in good agreement with previous studies that show no effects of aging on the myocardial potential for energy production in vivo (28.Lakatta E.G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 413-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). It is, however, possible that under conditions of acute stress demanding short term increments of oxidative phosphorylation, the reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number may become a limiting factor in the liver and possibly enhance the observed age-related impairment of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Possible differential effects of aging on other respiratory enzymes as previously reported should also be considered (38.Genova M.L. Castelluccio C. Fato R. Parenti Castelli G. Merlo Pich M. Formiggini G. Bovina C. Marchetti M. Lenaz G. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These possible differences are, however, likely to be due to post-transcriptional events. Available evidence suggests that mitochondrial genes are transcribed in a parallel fashion (20.Aloni Y. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1757-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21.Ojala D. Montoya J. Attardi G. Nature. 1981; 290: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar), and the observed changes in COX transcript levels should therefore be representative of the directional changes of other mitochondrial transcripts. Thus, possible differential age-related alterations of other enzymes do not contradict the current conclusions on the age effect on mitochondrial gene expression and COX activity. A previous study in humans undergoing orthopedic surgery presumably for leg injury or joint replacement reported a positive correlation between age and mitochondrial DNA levels in the quadriceps muscle (39.Barrientos A. Casademont J. Cardellach F. Ardite E. Estivill X. Urbano-Marquez A. Fernandez-Chela J.C. Nunes V. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1997; 62: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The population selected is, however, unlikely to be representative of healthy young and elderly subjects. In particular, disease and related immobilization may have had major effects on skeletal muscle metabolism and thus influenced the study results. Species differences as well as technical differences related to the use of dot blot as opposed to Southern blot might also contribute to the observed discrepancies. Conflicting results were observed in previous animal studies with respect to age-related changes in mitochondrial DNA in heart or liver (6.Stocco D.M. Hutson J.C. J.

Following mitochondrial isolation and quantitative hybridization, one group reported contradictory results with either unchanged (7.Gadaleta M.N. Petruzzella V. Renis M. Fracasso F. Cantatore P. Eur.

Res. 1992; 275: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) mitochondrial DNA levels in both aging heart and liver in similar groups of rats. Another study reported decreased mitochondrial DNA in the heart but not in the liver in aging rats (9.Takasawa M. Hayakawa M. Sugiyama S. Hattori K. Ito T. Ozawa T. Exp. Gerontol. 1993; 28: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the latter study, DNA was also extracted from isolated mitochondria and was normalized for tissue protein content, which is known to decrease in aging animal liver (41.Fu A. Nair K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E1023-E1030PubMed Google Scholar). Two of the above studies also reported reduced cardiac mitochondrial transcript levels (7.Gadaleta M.N. Petruzzella V. Renis M. Fracasso F. Cantatore P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11.Marin-Garcia J. Ananthakrishnan R. Agrawal N. Goldenthal M.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 1029-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RNA was however isolated from tissue collected at least 15 min after death of the animal in one study (11.Marin-Garcia J. Ananthakrishnan R. Agrawal N. Goldenthal M.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 1029-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or following mitochondria isolation procedures (7.Gadaleta M.N. Petruzzella V. Renis M. Fracasso F. Cantatore P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In our experience, both experimental conditions may cause significant amounts of RNA degradation, which might in turn explain at least in part the differences with the current results. The current data are thus the first to indicate a consistent age-related decline of mitochondrial DNA content proportional to oxidative capacities in different skeletal muscle groups and liver with preserved mitochondrial template as well as transcript and enzyme levels in the aging heart. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the effects of aging on mitochondrial gene expression are tissue-specific. Reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number is a major age-related alteration in skeletal muscle and liver, where it appears to be a direct result of oxidative damage. In contrast, DNA levels are preserved in the aging heart muscle presumably because of its unique aerobic workload. Age-related changes in mitochondrial DNA copy number have, however, limited impact on further steps of mitochondrial gene expression under base-line conditions. In contrast, maintenance of transcript levels appears to be a key factor in the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative capacity in old animals, and the current results suggest that it may be linked to oxidative metabolism and energy demand.

https://openalex.org/W1980986250,"The hsp90 family of molecular chaperones was expanded recently due to the cloning of TRAP1 and hsp75 by yeast two-hybrid screens. Careful analysis of the human TRAP1 and hsp75 sequences revealed that they are identical, and we have cloned a similar protein from Drosophila. Immunofluorescence data show that human TRAP1 is localized to mitochondria. This mitochondrial localization is supported by the existence of mitochondrial localization sequences in the amino termini of both the human andDrosophila proteins. Due to the striking homology of TRAP1 to hsp90, we tested the ability of TRAP1 to function as an hsp90-like chaperone. TRAP1 did not form stable complexes with the classic hsp90 co-chaperones p23 and Hop (p60). Consistent with these observations, TRAP1 had no effect on the hsp90-dependent reconstitution of hormone binding to the progesterone receptor in vitro, nor could it substitute for hsp90 to promote maturation of the receptor to its hormone-binding state. However, TRAP1 is sufficiently conserved with hsp90 such that it bound ATP, and this binding was sensitive to the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. In addition, TRAP1 exhibited ATPase activity that was inhibited by both geldanamycin and radicicol. Thus, TRAP1 has functions that are distinct from those of hsp90."

Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3311) Google Scholar, 2.Clapham D. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar, 3.Ambudkar, I. S. (2000) Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med., in pressGoogle Scholar). In salivary gland cells, a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i is required for the activation of the ion channels, such as the Ca2+-activated K+ channel and the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel, which critically regulate the secretion of fluid and electrolytes. [Ca2+]i increase in these cells results from intracellular Ca2+ release and from extracellular Ca2+ influx. While release of Ca2+ from the intracellular store(s) triggers a transient increase in [Ca2+]i and fluid secretion, sustained fluid secretion is dependent on the influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium (3.Ambudkar, I. S. (2000) Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med., in pressGoogle Scholar, 4.Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ release is induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)1 that is generated in reponse to agonist-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (1.Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3311) Google Scholar, 5.Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G. St J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane is mediated via an as yet unknown mechanism referred to as store-operated Ca2+influx (SOC), or capacitative calcium entry, that is activated by the depletion of Ca2+ from the internal Ca2+ store (3.Ambudkar, I. S. (2000) Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med., in pressGoogle Scholar, 6.Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 7.Berridge M.J. Biochem.

The molecular basis for the activation and regulation of SOC has not yet been determined in any nonexcitable cell type. The two critical questions that remain are regarding (i) the signal that is transmitted from the internal Ca2+ store to the plasma membrane to trigger activation or inactivation of SOC and (ii) the molecule that mediates Ca2+ influx into the cells. Recent studies with salivary gland and other nonexcitable cells indicate that store-operated Ca2+ influx is mediated via a channel-like mechanism (8.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 9.Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological measurements demonstrate that Ca2+ influx is associated with the activation of an inward Ca2+ current, which appears to be selective for Ca2+ in some cell types and relatively nonspecific for cations in others (2.Clapham D. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar, 8.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism involved in gating the putative Ca2+ influx channel is not known. Studies toward identifying the molecule(s) mediating Ca2+ influx have led to the cloning of mammalian homologues of the Drosophilatransient receptor potential gene, trp (10.Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 11.Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 211-217PubMed Google Scholar). Presently, full-length or partial sequences have been reported for seventrp genes (trp1–trp7) in various mammalian species, including human, mouse, rat, rabbit, and bovine. It has been proposed that the trp gene(s) encode the store-operated Ca2+ channel in nonexcitable cells. However, studies examining the functional effects induced by expression oftrp genes have demonstrated that the characteristics of the expressed activity are distinct from those of the endogenous SOC activity, suggesting that the encoded Trp protein is functionally different from the endogenous SOC mechanism present in the cells used for the expression. Additionally, several studies also show an increase in receptor-operated, or basal, Ca2+ influx in cells transfected with trp cDNAs. Thus, only a fewtrp gene products meet the functional criteria for SOC, typically defined as an increase in Ca2+ influx stimulated in cells following internal Ca2+ store-depletion by thapsigargin.

Peyton M. Boulay G. Brown D. Qin N. Jiang M. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 2060-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). On the other hand, rtrp2 has been suggested to be associated with the sensory signaling mechanism in brain, apparently independent of store depletion (21.Liman E.R. Corey D.P. Dulac C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5791-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The reported data strongly suggest that Trp3, Trp6, and Trp7 proteins are associated with receptor- or second messenger-regulated Ca2+ influx (22.Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 23.Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27359-27370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, it was recently suggested that Trp3 might be regulated by IP3 via interaction with the IP3 receptor (26.Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be established whether the Trp3-IP3 receptor interaction is involved in the mechanism regulating SOC. More convincing data regarding a role for Trp in SOC has been obtained by expression of antisense sequences of trp cDNA. Expression of either a mixture of antisense cDNA fragments ofmtrp1–mtrp6 or of mtrp4 alone attenuated carbachol-stimulated Ca2+ influx (10.Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B.

Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to assess the role of the trp gene products based on these data, since thapsigargin-stimulated influx was not tested in these studies and, as mentioned above, expression of severaltrp isoforms induce increases in second messenger- or receptor-operated type of Ca2+ influx. In another study, expression of an antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide against the region of the start codon of mtrp1 in Xenopus oocytes attenuated thapsigargin stimulation of a ICl−(Ca) (17.Tomita Y. Kaneko S. Funayama M. Kondo H. Satoh M. Akaike A. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 248: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This sequence is present in all four variants of mtrp1 genes, although onlytrp1α and -β genes have been suggested to encode a polypeptide (27.Sakura H. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The present study uses the human submandibular gland ductal cell line, HSG, to examine the role of the trp1 gene product in the SOC mechanism in salivary gland cells. Similar internal Ca2+release and store-operated Ca2+ influx mechanisms are triggered upon activation of the muscarinic receptor in salivary acinar and ductal cells (28.O'Connell A.C. Redman R.S. Evans R.L. Ambudkar I.S. Radiat. Res. 1999; 151: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, HSG cells exhibit a robust activation of Ca2+ influx when the internal Ca2+ store(s) is depleted by either by muscarinic receptor stimulation (via an IP3-dependent mechanism) or by treatment with thapsigargin or tert-butylhydroxyquinone (9.Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29.Liu X. Rojas E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, SOC appears to be the primary mechanism for Ca2+ influx in these cells following muscarinic receptor stimulation or treatment with thapsigargin. Thus, HSG cells provide an excellent, well characterized model system to study the mechanism of SOC. The results presented below demonstrate that transfection of HSG cells with htrp1α, but not htrp3, cDNA induced dramatic increases in thapsigargin-stimulated SOC, while expression of the htrp1α cDNA in the antisense direction significantly attenuated the endogenous SOC activity. Importantly, changes in SOC were associated with corresponding changes in the levels of Trp1 in HSG cell plasma membranes. Further, and consistent with its proposed function, we show that Trp1 is localized in the plasma membrane region of acinar and ductal cells in intact rat submandibular glands. In aggregate, these data strongly suggest that Trp1 is a candidate protein for the SOC mechanism in salivary gland cells. HSG cells were a kind gift from Dr. Mitsunabo Sato (Tokushima University, Japan). The conditions for cell culture were similar to those described previously (7.Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 29.Liu X. Rojas E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Biofluids, Rockville, MD). Cells were passaged when confluent by detaching from the tissue culture dish with 0.25% trypsin, 1.0 mm EDTA. For functional studies, a single-cell suspension was reseeded on coverslips and used after about 24 h. Rat submandibular glands were excised from anesthetized male Wistar rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley) and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from the frozen tissues and HSG cells using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and was treated with deoxyribonuclease I (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 1 unit of DNase I/1 μg of RNA in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding EDTA at a final concentration of 2.5 mm and heated at 65 °C for 10 min. Sequences of the trp1-specific primers used were described previously (30.Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): for the conserved region, AW3A (5′- TTGGGTCCATTACAGATTTCA) and AW3B (5′-TCGTCGAGCAAACTTCCATTC); for the 3′-end, AW6A (5′-GTAGGCATCTTCTGTGAACAGCAAAGCAA) and AW6B (GTAAGCACGATCACAACCACGACATTGAA). Sequences of thehtrp3 primers were as described previously (14.Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR was performed as described previously (30.Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After PCR, 10 μl of the RT-PCR product was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. Transfection of HSG cells withhtrp1α or htrp3 cDNA was performed using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, HSG cells were cultured to 80% confluence. 3 μg of the plasmid pCDNA3, HA-tagged (5′-end) htrp1α, or HA-tagged (3′-end)htrp3 cDNA was diluted into 300 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM I medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then mixed with 30 μl LipofectAMINE reagent diluted into 300 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM I medium. The mixture was incubated for 45 min at room temperature and then added to 2.4 ml of serum-free medium. The cells were rinsed serum-free medium, overlaid with the transfection mixture, and incubated at 37 °C at 5% CO2 for 5 h. Medium containing 20% FBS was added to the cells, and they were incubated overnight. The medium was then replaced with fresh growth medium containing 20% FBS, and cells were allowed to grow for 72 h. Cells were then detached using versene (Biofluids) and diluted 1:30 in growth medium containing 10% FBS and G418 (400 μg/ml) to select stably transfected clones. G418-resistant single clones were selected by 3 weeks after transfection, and SOC activity was tested as described below. A crude membrane fraction was prepared from control or transfected HSG cells in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem), 19 μl/ml aprotinin (Sigma). The cells were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellets were suspended in the above buffer, aliquoted, frozen, and stored at −70 °C until use. The plasma membrane fraction was purified as described before (31.Lockwich T. Chauthaiwale J. Ambudkar S.V. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) using a Percoll gradient and stored at −80 °C. Conditions for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were as described previously (30.Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transfer of the proteins, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with blocking (TTBS) buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 68.5 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% milk, washed, and then incubated in TTBS containing the primary antibody (1:1000 dilution), either anti-Trp1 or anti-HA (BABCo), for 1 h. The membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody, either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, as required, in TTBS with 0.05% milk, washed, treated with the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to X-OMATTM films (Kodak) as required for detection of the proteins. HSG cells expressing hTrp1α were cultured on glass coverslips for 2 days. These cells were rinsed once with PBS (pH 7.5), fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, treated with 100 mm glycine-PBS for 30 min, permeabilized with methanol at −70 °C on dry ice for 5 min, and then washed with PBS and blocked with 5% donkey serum for 1 h. The sample was then incubated with the primary antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or rabbit polyclonal anti-Trp1 diluted 1:150 or 1:100, respectively, and washed three times. The samples were then incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG at a 1:150 dilution for 1 h, washed with PBS three times, mounted on glass slides, and used for confocal microscopy. Preparation of frozen sections was performed essentially as described previously (32.He X. Tse C-M. Donowitz M. Alper S.L. Gabriel S.E. Baum B.J. Pflug. Arch. 1997; 422: 260-268Google Scholar). Submandibular glands were quickly removed and fixed in prechilled (−20 °C) methanol/Me2SO (4:1, v/v) at −20 °C overnight. Glands were washed for 1 h at room temperature in PBS (pH 7.5) and then transferred to 20% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C overnight. After freezing at −50 °C for 3 min in isopentane, glands were placed in Tissue Tek intermediate sized cryomolds (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN), which were on dry ice and had just received Tissue Tek OCT mounting medium (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN). Frozen samples were cryosectioned in 8-μm sections, which were placed on glass slides at −20 °C. Sections were stored at −70 °C until examined. Sections were rehydrated for 5 min in PBS and used either for immunocytochemistry or confocal microscopy. Immunocytochemistry was performed by using the HistoStain SP kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Samples for confocal microscopy were blocked for 20 min with 5% donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; fraction V; Calbiochem) and then incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody (1:150) in PBS containing 0.2% BSA. Sections were then washed for 5 min in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and incubated for 20 min with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:150 in PBS containing 0.2% BSA. The secondary antibody was then removed by washing the sections twice in PBS containing 0.2% BSA (5 min/wash) followed by two washes with PBS (5 min each). Each immunostained section received a drop of Citifluor (Ted Pella, Redding, CA), was mounted on a coverslip, and sealed. Samples were stored in the dark at 4 °C until examined. Confocal images were collected using an MRC 1024 krypton/argon laser-scanning confocal system (Bio-Rad) equipped with a Nikon Optiphot II photomicroscope (Melville, NY). Images of control and experimental samples were obtained using identical conditions (laser intensities, gain, iris aperture, black level, scan speed). Images were collected in the x-y plane using a × 60 oil immersion PlanApo objective (Nikon, Japan) with a confocal aperture of 2 mm. The entire series of images was then collected into a single focused image using the Confocal Assistant software supplied by the manufacturer. A Codonics NP-1600 Photographic Network Printer (Middleton Heights, OH) was used to print the final single focused image. A piece of coverslip (0.5 × 0.5 mm) with cells was placed in the perfusion chamber (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). Perfusion, at approximately 5 ml/min, was achieved by gravity-fed plastic tubes. A vacuum line continuously removed the bath solution. Complete solution changes were achieved within 10–15 s. The standard extracellular solution for measuring Ca2+-activated K+ channel current (KCa) contained 145 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The pipette was filled with 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Any changes in the composition of the pipette and external solutions are given under “Results.” Patch clamp in a whole cell configuration was performed on single HSG cells attached to coverslips using the standard patch clamp technique described previously (9.Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29.Liu X. Rojas E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane currents were measured with an Axopatch 200A amplifier in conjunction with pClamp 6.1 software and a Digidata 1200 A/D converter (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The currents were filtered at 2 kHz (low pass bessel filter) and sampled with an interval of 10 ms. The currents were digitized and recorded directly onto the hard drive of a Dell Pentium computer. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed and incubated in medium containing 1 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 45 min at 37 °C. Fura-2 fluorescence in single cells was measured at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380, with emission at 510 nm, using a SLM 8000/DMX 100 spectrofluorimeter attached to an inverted Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with a Fluor × 40 oil immersion objective. Images were acquired using an enhanced CCD camera (CCD-72, MTI) and the Image-1 software (Universal Imaging Corp., PA). Analog plots of the fluorescence in single cells are shown. The 340/380 nm ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence have been used to represent [Ca2+]i. Other details of the experiments are given under “Results” and in the figure legends. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Fig.1 A shows RT-PCR products amplified from HSG cell RNA by using htrp1-specific primers for the conserved (400-base pair region) of trp genes (30.Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 37: 193-198Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar) (lane 1). RT-PCR products from rat submandibular gland (lane 2) and rat brain (lane 3) are also shown (rat-specific primer sequences used were described previously; see Ref. 30.Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lane 4 shows DNA size markers. Sequencing the product from HSG cells confirmed the presence of htrp1 (data not shown). Using htrp3-specific primers and RT-PCR, a similar region inhtrp3 was also amplified from HSG cell mRNA and sequenced (data not shown). Fig. 1 B shows the RT-PCR products representing the 2.3-kilobase pair 3′-end of trp1(lane 1, HSG cells; lane 2, rat submandibular glands; lane 3, size markers). Similar 2.3-kilobase pair products were amplified from rat parotid gland (data not shown) and brain mRNA (30.Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endogenous Trp1 protein expression in HSG cells was determined using the Trp1-specific antibody we have previously described (30.Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trp1 protein (shown by an arrow) was detected in HSG cell plasma membranes by Western blotting (Fig. 1 C, lane 1). Since antibody to Trp3 is presently unavailable, the presence of endogenous Trp3 in HSG cells could not be determined. To examine the role of Trp1 protein in salivary gland cell store-operated Ca2+ influx, HSG cells were stably transfected with the HA-tagged trp1α cDNA. The transfected cells were then used for detection of the Trp1 protein and measurement of store-operated Ca2+ influx. Fig. 1 C,lane 2, shows that the plasma membrane fraction of transfected cells contains a higher (about 2-fold) level of Trp1 protein than nontransfected cells (lane 1; detected using anti-Trp1 antibody). The localization of the expressed HA-tagged hTrp1α protein was further examined by confocal microscopy. Fig. 1 D shows an extended focus (stacked) image of FITC fluorescence using an anti-HA antibody. Consistent with the data obtained with the immunoblotting technique, considerable reactivity was detected in the transfected cells, and fluorescence was mainly associated with the plasma membrane and sub-plasma membrane region of the cell. A similar pattern was observed when the anti-Trp1 antibody was used (data not shown). The fluorescence intensity was dramatically diminished when the anti-HA antibody was preincubated with the HA peptide (Fig. 1 E). Fig.2 A shows Fura-2 fluorescence measurements in control (HSG cell) and htrp1α-transfected (hTrp1 cell) cells. The 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio has been used to represent changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i). The experimental protocol used involved stimulating cells with thapsigargin (Tg test) in a Ca2+-free medium to detect internal Ca2+release, following which 10 mm Ca2+ was added to the cell medium to detect Ca2+ influx. This experimental protocol was employed, since we have previously shown that SOC in HSG cells is strongly subject to feedback inhibition by [Ca2+]i when treated with thapsigargin in a Ca2+-containing medium (9.Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin induced a rapid release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in both control and transfected cells, demonstrated by the first transient increase in [Ca2+]i. There was no significant difference in this initial increase in [Ca2+]i in the two sets of cells (p > 0.05; number of cells tested was 65 and 90, respectively, for control and transfected cells). When Ca2+ was readded to the cells, a second increase in [Ca2+]i was obtained, representing the Ca2+ influx component. The peak of this increas"

Here we report the cloning of a novel sentrin-specific protease, SENP1, which has no homology to the known de-ubiquitinating enzymes or ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases. However, SENP1 is distantly related to the yeast Smt3-specific protease, Ulp1. A COS cell expression system was used to demonstrate the activity of SENP1 in vivo. When HA-tagged sentrin-1 was co-expressed with SENP1, the higher molecular weight sentrin-1 conjugates were completely removed. Surprisingly, the major sentrinized band at 90 kDa remained intact. The disappearance of the high molecular weight sentrin-1 conjugates also coincided with an increase in free sentrin-1 monomers. SENP1 is also active against proteins modified by sentrin-2, but not those modified by ubiquitin or NEDD8. In addition, sentrinized PML, a tumor suppressor protein that resides in the nucleus, was selectively affected by SENP1, whereas sentrinized RanGAP1, which is associated with the cytoplasmic fibrils of the nuclear pore complex, remained intact. The inability of SENP1 to process sentrinized RanGAP1in vivo is most likely due to its nuclear localization because SENP1 is active against sentrinized RanGAP1 in vitro. The identification of a nuclear-localized, sentrin-specific protease will provide a unique tool to study the role of sentrinization in the biological function of PML and in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.

It is now clear that the sentrinization pathway in mammalian cells utilizes a unique activating enzyme complex (UBA2/AOS1) and conjugation enzyme (UBC9), to catalyze the modification of a subset of mammalian proteins, such as PML, Sp100, IκBα, RanGAP1, and RanBP2 (3.Matunis M.J.

The biological function of sentrinization in the mammalian system has not been completely elucidated for each target substrate. It has been shown, however, that sentrinization of RanGAP1 is required for its translocation from the cytosol to the nuclear pore complex (3.Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J.

Sentrin-1 is closely related to Smt-3, an essential protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (18.Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar).

J. Biol.

Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 3.Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Thus, in analogy to the ubiquitin pathway (21.Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), enzyme(s) capable of removing sentrin from sentrinized proteins must also exist. Recently, Liet al. (22.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) reported a S. cerevisiae enzyme, Ulp1, which can remove Smt-3 (the yeast homologue of sentrin-1) from its conjugates. Ulp1 also cleaves sentrin-1/SUMO-1, but not ubiquitin, from modified proteins in vitro. Interestingly, Ulp1 is not related to any known de-ubiquitinating enzyme. Here, we report the cloning of a novel protease, called SENP1, which is distantly related to Ulp1 and is active against sentrin but not ubiquitin or NEDD8-modified proteins in vivo. We also elucidate the genomic organization of the SENP1 gene and show that SENP1 differentially regulates sentrin-modified proteins in vivo. Sentrin-1 (also called SUMO-1) is a small polypeptide that can covalently modify specific proteins in a manner analogous to ubiquitination (1.Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.F.

It is now clear that the sentrinization pathway in mammalian cells utilizes a unique activating enzyme complex (UBA2/AOS1) and conjugation enzyme (UBC9), to catalyze the modification of a subset of mammalian proteins, such as PML, Sp100, IκBα, RanGAP1, and RanBP2 (3.Matunis M.J.

The biological function of sentrinization in the mammalian system has not been completely elucidated for each target substrate. It has been shown, however, that sentrinization of RanGAP1 is required for its translocation from the cytosol to the nuclear pore complex (3.Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J.

Sentrin-1 is closely related to Smt-3, an essential protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (18.Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The enzymatic machinery for Smt-3 conjugation (19.Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 20.Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol.

Demonstration of sentrin modification in early studies was complicated by the presence of enzymes that cleaved the isopeptide linkage between sentrin and various target proteins in the cell lysate (2.Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 3.Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Thus, in analogy to the ubiquitin pathway (21.Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), enzyme(s) capable of removing sentrin from sentrinized proteins must also exist. Recently, Liet al. (22.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) reported a S. cerevisiae enzyme, Ulp1, which can remove Smt-3 (the yeast homologue of sentrin-1) from its conjugates. Ulp1 also cleaves sentrin-1/SUMO-1, but not ubiquitin, from modified proteins in vitro. Interestingly, Ulp1 is not related to any known de-ubiquitinating enzyme. Here, we report the cloning of a novel protease, called SENP1, which is distantly related to Ulp1 and is active against sentrin but not ubiquitin or NEDD8-modified proteins in vivo. We also elucidate the genomic organization of the SENP1 gene and show that SENP1 differentially regulates sentrin-modified proteins in vivo. We thank Dr. T. Kamitani for providing us with HA-PML and HA-RanGAP1 constructs."

Recently, we found that two conserved transmembrane (TM) aspartates in PS1 are critical for Aβ production, providing evidence that PS1 either functions as a required diaspartyl cofactor for γ-secretase or is itself γ-secretase. Presenilin 2 (PS2) shares substantial sequence and possibly functional homology with PS1. Here, we show that the two TM aspartates in PS2 are also critical for γ-secretase activity, providing further evidence that PS2 is functionally homologous to PS1. Cells stably co-expressing TM Asp → Ala mutations in both PS1 and PS2 show further accumulation of the APP-derived γ-secretase substrates, C83 and C99. The production of Aβ is reduced to undetectable levels in the conditioned media of these cells. Furthermore, endoproteolysis of the exogenous Asp mutant PS2 is absent, and endogenous PS1 C-terminal fragments are diminished to undetectable levels. Therefore, the co-expression of PS1 and PS2 TM Asp → Ala mutants suppresses the formation of any detectable PS1 or PS2 heterodimeric fragments and essentially abolishes the production of Aβ. These results explain the residual Aβ production seen in PS1-deficient cells and demonstrate the absolute requirement of functional presenilins for Aβ generation. We conclude that presenilins, and their TM aspartates in particular, are attractive targets for lowering Aβ therapeutically to prevent Alzheimer's disease.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). These missense mutations have been shown to subtly alter the proteolytic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is cleaved by α- or β-secretase, and the membrane-retained 83- and 99-residue C-terminal fragments produced by these cleavages (C83 and C99, respectively) serve as the substrates for a second cleavage by a protease designated γ-secretase. The products of the C99 cleavage include the 40- and 42-residue amyloid β-peptides (Aβ), which accumulate to high abundance in myriad amyloid plaques in the brain. The familial Alzheimer's disease mutations in the presenilins appear to selectively increase the production and deposition of Aβ42 in cell culture (2.Scheuner D. Eckman C. Jensen M. Song X. Citron M.

Zhang J. Kholodenko D. Citron M. Podlisny M.B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Seubert P. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the presenilins cause this selective increase in Aβ42 has remained a mystery until recently. The discovery that a deficiency in PS1 inhibits the normal processing of APP and reduces both Aβ40 and Aβ42 production suggested that PS1 facilitates γ-secretase activity (10.De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Gundula G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). The region of function of PS1 in this regard has been further localized to two aspartates within the putative 6th and 7th transmembrane (TM) domains, which are required for Aβ production (11.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). The mutation of either aspartate 257 (TM6) or aspartate 385 (TM7) to alanine interferes with both the endoproteolysis of PS1 and the generation of Aβ. This occurs by a dominant negative mechanism that replaces endogenous PS1 N- and C-terminal fragments (NTFs and CTFs) with the nonfunctional mutant holoprotein. However, in neurons that lack PS1, or in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that overexpress PS1 Asp → Ala mutant protein, residual Aβ production is still present (10.De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Gundula G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar, 11.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). This remaining peptide, which is approximately 20–40% of the normal Aβ level, is postulated to arise from the residual PS2 activity in these cells. To test this hypothesis, we generated Asp → Ala mutations at the equivalent residues in PS2, aspartates 263 and 366. We first showed that these PS2 aspartyl mutants, like their PS1 aspartyl mutant counterparts, have a similar effect on APP processing, providing further evidence that PS2 is functionally homologous to PS1. We then stably introduced the PS2 D366A construct into CHO cells overexpressing human PS1 D257A and wild-type human APP. We found that the presence of both PS1 and PS2 aspartyl mutants completely abolishes γ-secretase processing of APP. We observed additional accumulation of the C83 and C99 APP CTFs and a suppression of total Aβ production to levels that were undetectable by a sensitive sandwich ELISA. This absence of Aβ corresponded with an absence of detectable PS1 and PS2 endoproteolytic fragments. We conclude that functional PS1 or PS2 heterodimers are absolutely required to generate Aβ and that the TM aspartates in particular are critical in both proteins. Full-length wild-type (wt) PS2 cDNA was used as the template to introduce D263A or D366A by site-directed mutagenesis, and the genes were inserted into the vector pcDNA3.1(+) containing either the zeocin or hygromycin resistance genes (Invitrogen). The identities of the mutant genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For transfection, plasmids (10 μg) were introduced into various CHO cell lines in 10-cm dishes using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmids encoding wt PS1, wt PS2, and PS1 D385A have been characterized (11.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J.

Polyclonal antibody 2C20 recognizes the last 20 residues of the PS2 C terminus. 2972, which recognizes the PS2 N terminus (residues 2–84), was a gift of C. Haass (16.Walter J. Grunberg J. Schindzielorz A. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5961-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For experiments in which [35S]methionine labeling was performed, cells were starved for 30 min in media lacking methionine and fetal bovine serum, followed by a 1-h label in [35S]methionine-containing media. In all experiments, cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 and a protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)). Lysates were adjusted to equalize total protein concentration using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Samples were precleared with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min and then precipitated with primary antibody and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed for 20 min at 4 °C in the above lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and then in lysis buffer with 0.1% SDS. This was followed by a final wash in lysis buffer. Samples were eluted in 2× sample buffer (20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) at 65 °C for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10, 14, or 4–20% Tris glycine or Tris-Tricine gels (Novex), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore). Western blotting using ECL Plus detection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For experiments in which quantitative analysis was performed, blots were directly scanned using a Storm 840 scanner (Molecular Dynamics) with a chemiluminescence detection setting. Individual bands were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Statistical significance was determined using the Student's t test (two-tailed). Aβ sandwich ELISAs were performed as described (17.Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. MConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The capture antibody was 266 (to Aβ residues 13–28). The reporter antibody was biotinylated 3D6 (to Aβ residues 1–5). Values were expressed as a fraction of Aβ produced by the wt cell lines (APPwt, PS2wt, and PS1+2wt). The absence of PS1 in neuronal cells decreases the γ-secretase cleavage of APP (10.De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Gundula G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). We recently reported that mutation of either of the two transmembrane (TM) aspartates of PS1 induces a similar suppression of Aβ generation in cell culture (11.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that PS1 is either γ-secretase itself or a cofactor for γ-secretase. PS1 and PS2 share significant homology (18.Levy-Lahad E. Wasco W. Poorkaj P. Romano D.M. Oshima J. Pettingell H., Yu, C. Jondro P.D. Schmidt S.D. Wang K. Crowley A.C. Fu Y.-H. Guenette S.Y. Galas D. Nemens E. Wijsman E.M. Bird T.D. Schellenberg G.D. Tanzi R.E.

Nature. 1995; 376: 775-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that they may possess redundant roles with respect to APP processing. We therefore mutated the equivalent TM aspartate residues in PS2 to alanines in order to ascertain the effect on the accumulation of C83 and C99, the APP C-terminal substrates for γ-secretase. Mammalian expression vectors containing the cDNAs for wild-type (wt) human PS1, wt human PS2, D385A PS1, D263A PS2, or D366A PS2 were transiently transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the 751-residue wt human APP (APPwt cell line). Cell lysates were collected and normalized for total protein content, followed by immunoprecipitation with a C-terminal specific polyclonal APP antibody (C7) and Western blotting with a C-terminal specific monoclonal antibody (13G8). The expression of the PS1 aspartyl mutant or either of the PS2 aspartyl mutants resulted in an increase of C83 and C99 when compared with cells expressing wt PS1 or PS2 (Fig.1). Because mutation of the transmembrane aspartates in both PS1 and PS2 had similar effects on APP catabolism, we investigated the effects of expressing both mutant proteins together. We transfected a PS2 D366A cDNA into CHO cells that overexpress wt APP and PS1 D257A (cell line 2-1) to generate clones that stably express all three human proteins. We screened for expression of the mutant PS2 holoprotein by Western blotting using antibody 2972, which recognizes human but not hamster PS2 with high affinity (Fig. 2 a). Clone 2A-2 demonstrated a high expression level of mutant PS2 holoprotein as indicated by a pair of bands at ∼50–55 kDa (Fig. 2 a, lane 4) that co-migrated with the PS2 bands in the previously characterized wt PS2-expressing CHO cell line (Fig. 2 a, lane 2 and Ref. 3.Xia W. Zhang J. Kholodenko D. Citron M. Podlisny M.B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Seubert P. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7977-7982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These bands were not present in CHO cells lacking human PS2 (Fig. 2 a, lanes 1 and 3). To confirm the expression levels of APP, we performed specific IP/Western analysis on several wt APP-overexpressing cell lines. Using antibody C7 to immunoprecipitate APP and antibody 8E5 to Western blot, the expression levels of full-length human APP were demonstrated to be identical among the cell lines (Fig. 2 b, upper). Importantly, APP expression in 2A-2 is closely similar to its parental cell line, 2-1 (Fig. 2 b, lanes 4 and 5). To confirm that the cells had similar rates of APP production, we [35S]methionine-labeled cells for 1 h and then immunoprecipitated full-length APP with antibody C7. Fig. 2 b(lower) demonstrates equivalent levels of immatureN-glycosylated APP (N-APP) and matureN-,O-glycosylated APP (N+O-APP) in all cell lines. We also verified the expression status of PS1 holoprotein. Fig.2 c demonstrates equivalent levels of expression of human PS1 holoprotein among a wt PS1-expressing cell line (PS1wt) and cell lines 2-1 and 2A-2 (lanes 2, 4, and 5). This expression is compared with APPwt and PS2wt, which contain only endogenous PS1 holoprotein (lanes 1 and 3). Therefore, 2A-2 has levels of human wt APP and PS1 D257A comparable to its parental cell line 2-1 and also expresses high levels of mutant PS2 holoprotein. To assess the combined effects of the aspartyl mutants on APP catabolism, we performed IP/Western analysis of the C83 and C99 APP fragments. To compare appropriately the levels of these fragments, we also detected the full-length APP from the same samples by blotting the top half of the filter with 8E5. To control for the effects of expressing multiple genes in a given cell, we compared the C83 and C99 levels among three wt-containing lines: wt APP (APPwt), wt APP, and wt PS2 (PS2wt), and wt APP, wt PS1, and wt PS2 (PS1+2wt). The single, double, or triple stable expression of these cDNAs in CHO cells resulted in approximately similar levels of C83 and C99 (Fig. 3 a, lanes 1–3). Therefore, the stable transfection of three genes (and the effect of the selection drugs required to maintain them) did not have any effect on APP proteolytic events that generate these fragments. Additionally, we studied the maturation of APP using fine pulse-chase time points to determine if there were a more subtle but nonspecific perturbation in protein metabolism. Following a 5-min pulse and analyzing full-length APP every 5–15 min thereafter (to 60 min), we found no difference in the rate of N-,O-glycosylation of APP when it was expressed at endogenous levels versus in double transfectants versus in triple transfectants. 2W. Xia, W. T. Kimberly, and D. J. Selko, unpublished observations. Therefore, the overexpression of three genes does not appear to have any effect on APP processing. Likewise, there was no alteration of the SDS-PAGE profile of total [35S]methionine-labeled proteins among the three kinds of transfectants (not shown). In cells that stably express the aspartate mutant PS proteins, however, we observed a markedly increased accumulation of C83 and C99. 2-1 cells, which express high levels of PS1 D257A, exhibit such an increase (Fig. 3 a, lane 4), as reported (11.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). 2A-2 has further elevated levels (Fig. 3 a, lane 5), a result that is very clearly demonstrated when the cell lysates are diluted 1:100 and then subjected to IP (Fig. 3 a, lanes 9 and 10). At this dilution, only the predominant C83 species is visible in the aspartate mutant cell lines. To determine whether these mutations were interfering with α- or β-secretase processing of APP, we looked at the secretion of APPs and found that it was not inhibited in the aspartate mutant cell lines, consistent with our previous report (Ref.11.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar; and data not shown). Thus, the combined expression of PS1 D257A and PS2 D366A induces further accumulation of the C83 and C99 fragments, as compared with PS1 D257A alone. We also investigated the effects of two additional clones that co-express PS1 and PS2 aspartate mutations, 2A-19 and 2A-21. We used phosphorimaging analysis to determine quantitatively the level of the C83 fragments in these lines as well as in 2-1, 3-1, and 2A-2. We established a ratio of C83 to N-APP within each cell line and compared that ratio to the value obtained for 2-1. The three PS1 and PS2 aspartate mutant clones had mean relative ratios between 1.58 and 1.83, and their combined relative ratio was significantly greater than 2-1 (1.67 ± 0.08, p < 0.001, TableI). To validate this quantitative approach, we also measured the C83 to N-APP ratio in the previously characterized cell line 3-1 (11.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). This cell line inhibits Aβ secretion to a similar extent as 2-1. As expected, there was no significant difference between 3-1 and 2-1 in relative C83 accumulation (0.99 ± 0.10, Table I), confirming the validity of this method.Table IIncreased accumulation of the C83 APP CTF in PS1 + PS2 aspartate mutant cell linesCell lineAsp → Ala mutant inFold increase in APP CTF C83 (mean ± S.E.)p valueaDifference from line 2-1 (Student's ttest).2-1PS11.003-1PS10.99 ± 0.102A-2PS1 + PS21.62 ± 0.23<0.052A-19PS1 + PS21.83 ± 0.532A-21PS1 + PS21.58 ± 0.26<0.05All 2A cell linesPS1 + PS21.67 ± 0.08<0.001The C83 to N-APP ratio was quantitatively determined within each cell line using ImageQuant software.

The means represent three (2A-21) or four (3-1, 2A-2, 2A-19) independent determinations.a Difference from line 2-1 (Student's ttest).

The means represent three (2A-21) or four (3-1, 2A-2, 2A-19) independent determinations. To investigate Aβ production, conditioned media were collected and analyzed by a sensitive and specific sandwich ELISA. Within each experiment, the values for the wt-expressing cell lines (APPwt, PS2wt, and PS1+2wt) were averaged and assigned a value of 1. The Aβ levels from all cell lines were then expressed as a fraction of that value. 2-1 showed a 64% reduction in Aβ relative to cells expressing wt presenilin (35.8 ± 5.4%, n = 6; Fig. 3 b), closely similar to our previously reported data on this line (11.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Strikingly, 2A-2 showed no detectable Aβ production (<60 pg/ml), which corresponds to a >97% reduction (Fig. 3 b). Even when media were collected after long periods of conditioning (36 h), no Aβ was detected (data not shown). We did not measure Aβ42 levels since the total population of Aβ (which includes capture of the 42-amino acid peptide) was undetectable. Furthermore, the decrease in Aβ levels in conditioned media is not a result of impaired secretion since intracellular Aβ is undetectable in 2-1 cells, in contrast to wt-PS1-expressing cells (11.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Accordingly, microsomes isolated from cells expressing Asp mutant PS are unable to generate new Aβ, whereas wt PS-containing microsomes do so robustly (20.Xia, W., Wolfe, M., Ostaszewski, B. L., Rahmati, T., Zhang, J., and Selkoe, D. J. (1999) Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 219.7Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduction in Aβ detected in the media of aspartate mutant PS-expressing cell lines reflects the specific inhibition of γ-secretase-mediated production. The stable expression of the PS1 aspartyl mutants inhibits the endoproteolytic cleavage of the exogenous protein and also suppresses the level of endogenous hamster PS1 fragments in a dose-dependent manner (11.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of the PS1 aspartyl mutants yields only full-length mutant holoprotein. We therefore investigated the accumulation of the PS2 NTF in cell line 2A-2 to determine if a similar phenomenon occurred. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and PS2 NTFs were detected by Western blotting with the human-specific 2972 antibody. In the PS2wt and PS1+2wt cell lines, an ∼35-kDa NTF band was present (Fig.4 a, lanes 2 and 3). This band was not detected in either the wt APP or the 2-1 cell lines, which do not overexpress human PS2 (Fig. 4 a, lanes 1 and4). A human PS2 NTF was not present in the 2A-2 line, even though it expresses full-length protein at substantially higher levels than the other human PS2-expressing cells (Fig. 4 a, 5th lane). Even after long exposures, no band was detectable (data not shown). Importantly, co-expression of wt PS1 and wt PS2 does not abolish the formation of the PS2 NTF (Fig. 4 a, 3rd lane), even though PS2 holoprotein expression is not as high in the PS1+2wt cells as in 2A-2. This indicates that the lack of fragments in 2A-2 is due specifically to the mutation of the aspartate residues. We then attempted to detect human PS2 CTF with a different set of antibodies. By using polyclonal antibody PS2L for immunoprecipitation and polyclonal antibody 2C20 for Western blotting, we detected an ∼25-kDa band in PS2wt and PS1+2wt cells (Fig.4 b, lanes 2 and 3). Again, we failed to detect any PS2 CTFs in cell line 2A-2 (Fig. 4 b, lane 5). Therefore, the transmembrane aspartates of PS2 are critical for its endoproteolysis, consistent with the effect of the TM aspartates in PS1. The level of PS1 or PS2 fragments affects the relative heterodimer formation of the other (21.Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PS1 can suppress the formation of endogenous fragments of PS2 and vice versa. Based on these findings, it was proposed that PS1 and PS2 compete for limiting cellular factors, which in turn allow endoproteolysis and stabilization of the fragments (21.Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Dav"

Our continued awareness of the diversity of mammalian sPLA2s has cast doubt on earlier studies reporting the molecular identity of sPLA2 species expressed in cultured cells. Furthermore, understanding the physiological functions of the various mammalian sPLA2s is now a complex and challenging area of research in the eicosanoid field. sPLA2s must bind to the lipid-water interface to gain access to phospholipid substrates (10.Ramirez F. Jain M.K. Proteins. 1991; 9: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is becoming apparent that the different mammalian sPLA2s display dramatically different interfacial binding properties (11.Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B. Wilton D.C.

For example, human group IIA sPLA2 binds weakly or not at all to vesicles of the zwitterionic phospholipid phosphatidylcholine even in the presence of millimolar phospholipid, and interfacial binding is greatly enhanced (>106-fold) when anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine or phosphatidic acid are present (15.Kinkaid A.R. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Like group IIA sPLA2, human and porcine group IB sPLA2s also bind much tighter to anionic vesicles, but binding to millimolar concentrations of phosphatidylcholine vesicles can be detected (14.Snitko Y. Han S.K. Lee B.I. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7803-7810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16.Jain M.K. Egmond M.R. Verheij H.M. Apitz-Castro R. Dijkman R. De Haas G.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Human group V sPLA2 binds at least 100-fold tighter to anionic phosphatidylglycerol vesicles than to phosphatidylcholine vesicles, but binding to the latter is of much higher affinity (interfacial dissociation constant ∼ low micromolar) than for group IB and IIA sPLA2s (17.Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Of all the sPLA2s analyzed, cobra venom sPLA2 displays the highest affinity for zwitterionic vesicles (dissociation constant ∼10−7m) (16.Jain M.K. Egmond M.R. Verheij H.M. Apitz-Castro R. Dijkman R.

Robinson B.H. Gelb M.H. Science. 1998; 279: 1925-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), contributions to binding from single amino acid residues can be dissected. Tryptophan appears to be one of the most important residues for promoting tight binding to phosphatidylcholine vesicles (12.Baker S.F. Othman R. Wilton D.C.

Although our understanding of how sPLA2s bind to vesicles at the single amino acid level is increasing, our knowledge of how these enzymes interact with mammalian cell membranes is very limited. Understanding functional sPLA2-cell interaction is a challenging undertaking because of the complexity of cell membranes and the existence of multiple membranes in cells. To study the action of sPLA2s on mammalian cells, two approaches have been taken. Kudo and co-workers (4.Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 21.Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Such studies have shown that groups IIA and V sPLA2s are able to liberate arachidonic acid that functionally couples to cyclooxygenase for production of prostaglandin E2 (4.Murakami M. Shimbara S.

Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3103-3115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The second approach is to add sPLA2s exogenously to cells (22.Hara S. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23.Koduri R.S. Baker S.F. Snitko Y. Han S.K. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 5438-5446PubMed Google Scholar). This approach has generally revealed that mammalian cells are highly resistant to the action of exogenously added group IIA sPLA2, with relatively high concentrations (1–10 μg/ml) being required to detect arachidonate release. This may be due in part to the predicted low affinity of group IIA sPLA2 for the phosphatidylcholine-rich extracellular face of the plasma membrane. Interestingly, very recent studies have shown that group IIA sPLA2 expressed in HEK293 cells becomes associated with the heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycan glypican and is then internalized into what appear to be caveolae (25.Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Yamamoto S. Kuwata H. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29927-29936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Such a process may allow group IIA sPLA2 to come in contact with an interface to which it can bind to release arachidonate for coupling to oxygenating enzymes for eicosanoid production. On the other hand, exogenously added group V sPLA2 is 10–30-fold more active than group IIA sPLA2 in liberating fatty acids from mammalian cells (RAW264.7 cells, CHO-K1 cells, and neutrophils) (however, see below), which may be due in part to the ability of the former enzyme to bind phosphatidylcholine vesicles (17.Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have developed a bacterial expression system for the production of milligram amounts of properly folded human group X sPLA2 (hGX). This has enabled us to study the interfacial binding and kinetic properties of this recently discovered sPLA2. In addition, the ability of hGX to liberate arachidonate when added exogenously to cells was evaluated in comparison with recombinant human group IIA (hGIIA), rat group V (rGV), mouse group IB (mGIB), and cobra venom group IA (cobra-GIA) sPLA2s. The studies reveal striking features of the exogenous action of hGX on mammalian cells. Recombinant rGV was obtained as a gift from Marcel Janssen (26.Janssen M.J. Vermeulen L. Vad der Helm H.A.

The preparation of recombinant human group V sPLA2 will be reported elsewhere. The primary structures of all sPLA2s were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a Bruker/Hewlett-Packard Esquire LC ion-trap HPLC/mass spectrometry. The resolution (±1 atomic mass units at 14 kDa) is sufficient to ensure that all sPLA2 disulfides are intact. mGIB, hGIIA-N1A, and cobra-GIA (from Naja naja naja venom, Miami Serpentarium) were prepared as described (27.Cupillard L.

The N1A mutant of human group IIA sPLA2 (hGIIA-N1A) is used to facilitate removal of the initiator methionine, and its specific activity on vesicles is identical to that of the wild-type enzyme (28.Othman R.

J. 1991; 278: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was purified from anEscherichia coli overexpressor using the procedure provided by D. C. Wilton (University of Southampton). Phospholipids are from Avanti, and 11-dansyl-undecanoic acid is from Molecular Probes. Human interleukin-1β is from R & D Systems. LY311727 was obtained as a gift from E. Mihelich (Lilly), and Pyr-1 was synthesized as described (31.Hite, G. A., Mihelich, E. D., Tulio, S., and Edmund, W. S. (1998) European Patent: 0 846 687 A1Google Scholar). d 31-LPA was made and purified (32.Van Corven E.J. Van Rijswijk A. Jalink K. Van Der Bend R. Van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem.

Kinetic Analysis of the 85 kDa Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 on Anionic Phospholipid Vesicles Ph.D. thesis. University of Washington, Seattle1996Google Scholar). d 31-LPG andd 31-LPE were prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding sn-1 chain perdeuterated 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol and -ethanolamine (Avanti), respectively, with phospholipase A2(crude Crotalus adamenteus venom, Miami Serpentarium) at 37 °C in sodium borate, pH 7.0, with CaCl2 (34.Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis. Pergamon Press Inc., Tarrytown, NY1982Google Scholar). After work up (34.Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis. Pergamon Press Inc., Tarrytown, NY1982Google Scholar), compounds were purified by flask chromatography on silica using CHCl3 with increasing CH3OH. A CHCl3/CH3OH solution of lysophospholipid was washed with water to remove residual silica, and organic solvent was removed in vacuo. For d 31-LPS,sn-1 chain perdeuterated 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (Avanti) was hydrolyzed poorly by C. adamenteus venom, so the phospholipid was dispersed at 10 mol % in 1,2-ditetradecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphomethanol vesicles (16.Jain M.K.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness in a Speed-Vac (Savant), and the residue was taken up in CHCl3/CH3OH, and the product was purified by preparative thin layer chromatography on a silica plate using CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (65/25/4).d 31-LPS was eluted from the scraped silica with CHCl3/CH3OH, and the organic layer was washed with water and filtered through a syringe filter (Gelman Acrodisc, PTFE, 0.45 μm). Solvent was removed in vacuo. The concentrations of lysophospholipids in stock solutions were determined by standard phosphate analysis with ammonium molybdate, and the structures of all lysophospholipids were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The colorimetric sPLA2 substrate dithio-DMPM was prepared as follows. 1,2-Bismyristoylthio-1,2-dideoxy-sn-3-glycero-3-phosphocholine (36.Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5740-5744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (62 mg) was dissolved in a mixture of 1.47 ml of methanol, 2.42 ml of ether, and 4.96 ml of buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm CaCl2, pH 5.6) in a Teflon septum, screw cap glass vial with a stir bar. Cabbage acetone powder (20 mg) (33.Bayburt T. Kinetic Analysis of the 85 kDa Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 on Anionic Phospholipid Vesicles Ph.D. thesis. University of Washington, Seattle1996Google Scholar) was added, and the solution was vigorously stirred for 24 h at room temperature. Thin layer chromatography on a silica plate with CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3CO2H (65/35/8) showed ∼80% product (R f 0.95) and ∼20% starting material (R f 0.6). CHCl3, CH3OH, and water were added to give a two-phase system, and ∼100 mg of EGTA was added. After vortex mixing and separation of layers by centrifugation, the lower organic layer was concentrated to dryness in vacuo. The product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using CHCl3/CH3OH (85/15). The product fractions were pooled, concentrated to dryness in vacuo, and lyophilized from benzene to give a white powder (25 mg). The product structure was confirmed by 1H NMR. A synthetic gene encoding the hGX mature protein was designed based on the protein sequence of cloned hGX sPLA2 (5.Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) using E. coli preferred codons for all amino acids. The gene was prepared in a two-step PCR process using high fidelity Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and three sets of two long, partially overlapping single-stranded oligonucleotides (70–102 bases long). In the first round of PCR (final volume 50 μl), each set of oligonucleotides (2 μg of each primer) with a 20-base complementary sequence was annealed (50 °C/30 s), elongated (72 °C/30 s), and denaturated (95 °C/30 s) for three cycles, and the sizes of the expected DNA fragments were analyzed on 2.5% agarose gel. In the second round of PCR (final volume 50 μl), 0.5 μl of each first PCR reaction were mixed, annealed, and elongated as above for 5 cycles. The two oligonucleotides (0.5 μg each) flanking the hGX synthetic gene were then added, and 15 additional cycles of amplification (94°/1 min, 50 °C/1 min, 72 °C/1 min) were performed. Taq polymerase (2.5 units, Life Technologies, Inc.) and fresh dNTP (0.2 mm) were then added to the reaction tube, and incubation was continued for 5 min at 72 °C. The final PCR product was purified with the wizard PCR prep kit (Promega), ligated into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and entirely sequenced to verify the construct. The hGX synthetic gene was then used as template in a novel PCR reaction to prepare a DNA fragment coding for a factor Xa cleavage site Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg followed by the mature hGX protein, and the fragment was subcloned in frame with the truncated glutathione S-transferase (∼8 kDa) encoded by the modified pGEX-2T vector (pAB3) as described previously for mouse group IID sPLA2 (7.Valentin E.

The sequence of the synthetic gene is available from the authors upon request. Expression of the hGX fusion protein was carried in E. coliBL21 host cells. Bacteria was grown in 2 liters of LB broth with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.5–0.6. Isopropylthiogalactoside was added to 1 mm, and the culture was continued for 3–3.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was stored at −80 °C until processed. The cell pellet was suspended in 100 ml of cold buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the suspension was sonicated on ice (15 cycles of 15 s on and 15 s off). After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm (SS-34 rotor) for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of cold buffer containing 0.8% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.8% sodium deoxycholate with stirring for 20 min. Sonication followed by centrifugation was repeated as above. The pellet was stirred with 100 ml of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature and centrifuged. This process was repeated with buffer without detergent. The inclusion body pellet can be stored at −80 °C or further processed. The protein pellet was dissolved in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride (Amresco, Ultra Pure Grade), 0.3 mNa2SO3, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (10 mg of moist protein per ml of buffer), with stirring at room temperature, and 0.05 volume of Tannhauser reagent (37.Dudler T. Chen W.-Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was added. After stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the solution was dialyzed against 1% acetic acid at 4 °C (4 changes, 50 volumes each). The precipitated sulfonated fusion protein was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm (GSA rotor) at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet (∼240 mg) was dried in a vacuum dessicator overnight and stored at −80 °C. Protein (70 mg) was dissolved in 350 ml of 6 m guanidinium chloride, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, at room temperature with stirring, and the solution was dialyzed against 11 liters of pre-chilled 0.9 m guanidinium chloride, 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm freshly added cysteine, 5 mm EDTA at 4 °C, and the buffer was replaced after 6 h. The enzymatic activity was checked every 12 h using a spectrofluorimetric assay (37.Dudler T. Chen W.-Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) until it reached a maximum (typically 1–2 days). The dialysis bag was transferred to 11 liters of pre-chilled factor Xa buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2). After several hours, the buffer was replaced once. Protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Factor Xa (336 units per 70 mg of processed sulfonated fusion protein, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and digestion was allowed to proceed for 12–15 h at room temperature. Protein can be stored at −20 °C or processed further. Protein solution was filtered (Uniflo-25, 0.2 μm, low protein binding, Schleicher & Schuell). The entire solution was pumped at 3 ml/min directly onto a C18 reverse phase HPLC column (Vydac 218 TP1010) that was previously equilibrated with water with 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A). After loading, the solvent program was started as follows: 10% solvent B (acetonitrile with 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid) to 30% B over 20 min, then to 60% B over 110 min. Column eluant was monitored by UV detection at 280 nm. Factor Xa-cleaved hGX elutes at ∼40 min (column fractions checked by enzyme assay and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The purified protein was mixed with 3 volumes of water and lyophilized. The protein was dissolved in 1 ml of water and re-purified by HPLC using a solvent program of 10% B to 30% B over 20 min then to 45% B over 110 min. Pure hGX eluted at ∼45 min. The hGX fraction was diluted with 3 volumes of water and lyophilized. The approximate yield per liter of bacterial culture is 1 mg. The W67A hGX mutant was prepared as for wild-type enzyme. Mutagenesis was carried out with the QuickChange kit (Stratagene), and the full-length coding sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant hGX was found to have the correct N-terminal sequence and was verified to be native (all disulfides formed) by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (calculated 13, 615.5, observed 13, 614.7, (M + H)+). The molar extinction at 280 nm (ε1%) was calculated to be 15.9 (38.Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The corresponding values for the other sPLA2s were calculated similarly. The specific activity of the purified protein is 8.6 μmol/min/mg using the spectrofluorimetric assay (37.Dudler T. Chen W.-Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). LUVs of POPC, POPS, and POPG were prepared by extrusion in water as described (39.Bayburt T. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3216-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and stored for up to 2 days at 4 °C (or frozen and re-extruded). Phospholipid concentrations in stock solutions were determined by phosphate analysis (ammonium molybdate method). Vesicle hydrolysis studies were carried out with the indicated concentrations of LUVs (Table I) in 1.3 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution with Mg2+ and Ca2+ (1 mm each) containing 13 μg of FABP and 1 μm 11-dansylundecanoic acid at 37 °C with magnetic stirring. After recording the base line for ∼5 min (<2 pmol/min) (excitation at 350 nm and emission at 500 nm, slits 10 nm), reactions were started by the addition of sPLA2. Assays were calibrated to give moles of oleic acid formed by addition of standard oleic acid to the reaction mixture containing all components except sPLA2.Table ISpecific activities for the sPLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of phospholipid LUVssPLA210 μm POPG30 μm POPG10 μm POPS30 μm POPS10 μm POPC30 μm POPCDislodged HEK293 cellsaThe FABP assay detects oleate, linoelate, palmitate, and stearate with similar reponses, and response to arachidonate is ∼3-fold lower per mol.mGIB20141.92.1Lag, 0.18aThe FABP assay detects oleate, linoelate, palmitate, and stearate with similar reponses, and response to arachidonate is ∼3-fold lower per mol.Lag, 0.2777 × 10−3hGIIA-N1A1441442837<5 × 10−4<5 × 10−45.5 × 10−3rGV5.16.40.40.42.21.7183 × 10−3hGX9.18.51.21.50.90.950 × 10−3hGX-W67A4.74.81.21.4Lag, 0.040.12NDcND, not.Cobra-GIA10126.76.21730664 × 10−3All specific activities are micromoles of fatty acid/min/mg sPLA2.

These were carried out with a mixed phospholipid vesicle composed of equimole amounts of POPA, POPC, POPE, POPG, POPM, and POPS. Phospholipids in CHCl3 were mixed; solvent was removed in vacuo, and small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by sonicating a suspension of 6 mm total phospholipid in water as described (35.Jain M.K.

The pH-stat reaction mixture consisted of 8 ml of 1 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, 23 °C containing 250 μm total phospholipid. A 2-ml sample was removed as the minus enzyme control and transferred to a glass tube containing a mixture of deuterated lysophospholipid internal standards (d 31-LPA, -C, -E, -G, and -S, 610 pmol each). Then, 1.4 μg of hGX was added"
https://openalex.org/W1964226250,"The use of 35S-labeled calmodulin (CaM) to screen a corn root cDNA expression library has led to the isolation of a CaM-binding protein, encoded by a cDNA with sequence similarity to small auxin up RNAs (SAURs), a class of early auxin-responsive genes. The cDNA designated asZmSAUR1 (Zea mays SAURs) was expressed inEscherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified by CaM affinity chromatography. The CaM binding assay revealed that the recombinant protein binds to CaM in a calcium-dependent manner. Deletion analysis revealed that the CaM binding site was located at the NH2-terminal domain. A synthetic peptide of amino acids 20–45, corresponding to the potential CaM binding region, was used for calcium-dependent mobility shift assays. The synthetic peptide formed a stable complex with CaM only in the presence of calcium. The CaM affinity assay indicated that ZmSAUR1 binds to CaM with high affinity (K d ∼15 nm) in a calcium-dependent manner. Comparison of the NH2-terminal portions of all of the characterized SAURs revealed that they all contain a stretch of the basic α-amphiphilic helix similar to the CaM binding region of ZmSAUR1. CaM binds to the two synthetic peptides from the NH2-terminal regions ofArabidopsis SAUR-AC1 and soybean 10A5, suggesting that this is a general phenomenon for all SAURs. Northern analysis was carried out using the total RNA isolated from auxin-treated corn coleoptile segments. ZmSAUR1 gene expression began within 10 min, increased rapidly between 10 and 60 min, and peaked around 60 min after 10 μm α-naphthaleneacetic acid treatment. These results indicate that ZmSAUR1 is an early auxin-responsive gene. The CaM antagonistN-(6-aminohexyl)5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide hydrochloride inhibited the auxin-induced cell elongation but not the auxin-induced expression of ZmSAUR1. This suggests that calcium/CaM do not regulate ZmSAUR1 at the transcriptional level. CaM binding to ZmSAUR1 in a calcium-dependent manner suggests that calcium/CaM regulate ZmSAUR1 at the post-translational level. Our data provide the first direct evidence for the involvement of calcium/CaM-mediated signaling in auxin-mediated signal transduction.

Gonzalez-Daros et al. (20.Gonzalez-Daros F. Carrasco-Luna J. Calatayud A. Salguero J. del Valle-Tascon S. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 87: 68-76Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) observed that some, but not all, CaM inhibitors tested could inhibit auxin-induced medium acidification by oat coleoptile segments. Similarly, Reddy et al. (16.Reddy A.S.N. Koshiba T. Theologis A. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 1165-1170Google Scholar) observed that the calcium chelator EGTA and calcium channel blocker D-600 inhibited auxin-induced elongation of pea epicotyl segments. Auxin has been linked with Ca2+ transport (21.Kubowicz B.D. Vanderhoef L.N. Hanson J.B. Plant Physiol. 1982; 69: 187-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), release of Ca2+ ion from membrane vesicles (22.Drobak B.K. Ferguson I.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 145: 1043-1047Google Scholar), and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (23.Ettlinger C. Lehle L. Nature. 1988; 331: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It was proposed that calcium acts as a second messenger in the transduction of the hormone signal (8.Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev.

Auxin-calcium interaction in cellular processes could be regulated through CaM; however, no direct molecular and biochemical evidence for this interaction has been reported so far. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel CaM-binding protein that is encoded by a corn homolog ofSAURs (small auxin up RNAs); it is designated asZmSAUR1 (Zea mays SAURs). SAURs belong to one group of the early auxin-response genes (4.Abel S. Theologis A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Many early auxin-responsive genes have been cloned and characterized (2.Guilfoyle T.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1986; 4: 247-276Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4.Abel S. Theologis A.

Initially isolated from soybean (28.McClure B.A. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 9: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), SAUR genes have also been characterized from several dicots such as mung bean (29.Yamamoto K.T. Mori H. Imaseki H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 93-97Google Scholar), Arabidopsis (30.Gil P. Liu Y. Orbovic V. Verkamp E. Poff K.L. Green P.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and apple (31.Watillon B. Kettmann R. Arredouani A. Hecquet J.F. Boxus P. Burny A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In all cases examined, SAUR genes encode short transcripts with highly conserved open reading frames that accumulate rapidly and specifically after auxin treatment. Soybean SAUR gene transcription can be detected as soon as 2.5 min after the application of auxin (28.McClure B.A. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 9: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 32.McClure B.A. Hagen G. Brown C.S. Gee M.A. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that corn ZmSAUR1 is a rapid auxin-responsive gene as well. The results described here provide direct molecular and biochemical evidence for the involvement of the Ca2+/CaM messenger system in auxin action. 35S-Labeled recombinant CaM was prepared as described (33.Fromm H. Chua N.H. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 199-206Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using a potato CaM PCM6 cloned into the pET-3b expression vector (34.Takezawa D. Liu Z. An G. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The specificity of 35S-labeled CaM was about 0.5 × 106 cpm/μg. A corn root cDNA expression library (λZAP II) prepared in our laboratory was screened using 35S-labeled PCM6 as described (33.Fromm H. Chua N.H. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 199-206Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Several positive clones were isolated from 2 × 105 recombinant phages. The cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands. DNA sequences were analyzed using GCG version 8.0 and 9.0 software (35.Devereaux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar). Corn (Zea mays L. cv. Merit) seeds were sown in plastic trays filled with vermiculite and kept in the dark for about 5 days at 24 °C. The dark-grown coleoptiles were harvested under a dim green light, and 8-mm segments, excluding the 3-mm tip, were excised. Coleoptile segments were transferred into a beaker containing distilled water and kept floating for a 4-h period. Sets of 10 presoaked coleoptile segments were transferred into Petri dishes containing 10 ml of incubation medium consisting of 10 mm KH2PO4(pH 6.3), 1.5% w/v sucrose, 10 mm sodium citrate, and 0.1% v/v ethanol. NAA (Sigma), W-7 (Sigma), and W-5 (Sigma) treatments were carried out as described (19.Raghothama K.G. Mizrahi Y. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 28-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After auxin treatment, the lengths of the coleoptile segments were measured using a ruler under a dim green light, or the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. Corn genomic DNA was extracted as described (36.Yang T. Segal G. Abbo S. Feldman M. Fromm H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 684-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 10 μg of DNA was digested with various restriction enzymes, separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose Tris acetate gel, and transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 0.4 m NaOH. Southern blot analysis was carried out as described earlier (28.McClure B.A. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 9: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) using a ZmSAUR1probe covering the complete coding region from nucleotide 37 to 480 (see Fig. 1). Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue essentially as described (37.Longemann J. Shell J. Willmitzer L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). RNA samples (50 μg) were denatured and separated on 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gels. After transfer to Hybond N+ filters, the blots were hybridized using 32P-labeled ZmSAUR1 cDNA fragment 37-480 and washed as described earlier (38.Yang T. Lev-Yadun S. Feldman M. Fromm H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Blots were stripped and reprobed with a fragment of Arabidopsis 18 S rDNA, accession no. X16077, nucleotides 158–1669. Templates coding for wild type ZmSAUR1 and deletion mΔC and mΔN were produced by PCR amplification from the original cDNA with ZmSAUR1-specific oligonucleotides containing appropriate restriction sites (NdeI at the 5′-end and BamHI at the 3′-end) for cloning into the downstream of the His6 tag in a pET-14b expression vector (Novagen, Inc.). The wild type and deletion mutant proteins of ZmSAUR1 were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS according to the method of Studier et al. (39.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of all cloned fragments derived by PCR amplification was determined after cloning into the pET-14b vector, using oligonucleotides designed for sequencing from both sides of the pET-14b cloning sites as primers. Wild type and truncated ZmSAUR1 proteins were extracted and purified essentially as described (40.Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The amount of protein was estimated by the Bradford (67.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211925) Google Scholar) method using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and treated with 35S-labeled recombinant CaM with 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA as described (40.Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptides were prepared using an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer 431A in the Laboratory of Bioanalysis and Biotechnology, Washington State University. Samples containing 240 pmol (4 μg) of bovine CaM (Sigma) and different amounts of purified synthetic peptides in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and either 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA in a total volume of 30 μl were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE as described (41.Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Using the CaM binding screening approach, nine positive clones from a corn root cDNA expression library were obtained. One of these clones had high affinity to CaM. DNA sequencing indicated that the 760-base pair cDNA clone contained a partial coding region and a full 3′-untranslated region plus a poly(A)+ tail. The clone was designated as ZmSAUR1 because it has high homology to soybean SAUR genes. To get the full clone, a cDNA-specific primer as indicated in Fig.1 and the vector specific T3 primer were used for PCR, and the longest amplified fragment was sequenced. The PCR fragment was 60 base pairs longer than the cDNA clone at the 5′-end. An in-frame methionine residue was deduced in the downstream region of an in-frame stop codon (Fig. 1). Thus, the ZmSAUR1cDNA with the full coding region and 3′-untranslated region was obtained. Fig. 1 shows the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of ZmSAUR1. The cDNA codes for a polypeptide of 147 amino acids flanked by a 320-base pair untranslated region at the 3′-end and a 36-base pair untranslated region at the 5′-end. The calculated molecular mass and the isoelectric point of the ZmSAUR1 polypeptide are 16.6 kDa and 7.22, respectively. The soybeanSAUR genes encode proteins around 10 kDa in size with an isoelectric point between 6 and 7. Like other characterized SAURs (28.McClure B.A. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 9: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 29.Yamamoto K.T. Mori H. Imaseki H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 93-97Google Scholar, 30.Gil P. Liu Y. Orbovic V. Verkamp E. Poff K.L. Green P.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 31.Watillon B. Kettmann R. Arredouani A. Hecquet J.F. Boxus P. Burny A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the amino acid sequence does not contain a typical signal sequence, endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, orN-glycosylation signal, suggesting that the ZmSAUR1 protein does not enter the secretory pathway. However, it is possible that the ZmSAUR1 protein is a nuclear protein because it contains two short regions of basic amino acids (amino acids 33–37 and 67–69) that may form a bipartite nuclear localization signal (42.Raikhel N. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of ZmSAUR1 is aligned in Fig. 2 with those of soybeanSAUR 10A5, 15 A (32.McClure B.A. Hagen G. Brown C.S. Gee M.A. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), mung bean SAUR ARG7 (29.Yamamoto K.T. Mori H. Imaseki H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 93-97Google Scholar), and Arabidopsis SAUR-AC1 (30.Gil P. Liu Y. Orbovic V. Verkamp E. Poff K.L. Green P.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The size of ZmSAUR1 is larger than other SAURs. However, searching the Arabidopsis genomic sequences, a ZmSAUR1 homolog, SAUR-A2, with an even larger molecular mass, was found (Fig. 2). The difference lies in the NH2-terminal 54 amino acids and about 30 amino acids in the COOH terminus of ZmSAUR1, where soybean and other plant SAURs have less similarity. In contrast, the sequences are highly similar within the central portion (from 55 to 117 in ZmSAUR1) in all SAURs. Between these residues, ZmSAUR1 is 70.6% similar (58.8% identical) to the soybean 10A5 and 72.5% similar (54.9% identical) to ArabidopsisSAUR-AC1. Thus it seems likely that the central conserved portion of these proteins is most important for whatever function they fulfill. To study further the properties of ZmSAUR1, the ZmSAUR1 protein was expressed in E. coli, using the pET-14b expression vector. The recombinant protein was present mainly in the soluble fraction. The following two experiments proved that CaM binds to the ZmSAUR1 protein. First, the 18.8-kDa fusion protein (16.6-kDa ZmSAUR1 plus 2.2-kDa NH2-terminal His6 tag) was purified by CaM affinity chromatography to near homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Second, 35S-labeled CaM binds to ZmSAUR1 protein only in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig.3). After adding 2 mm EGTA, no CaM binding was observed, suggesting that CaM binding to ZmSAUR1 is calcium-dependent. The proteins from E. colitransformed with the pET-14b vector did not show any CaM binding (data not shown). To map the CaM binding region of ZmSAUR1, two mutants were prepared (Fig. 4 A). The mutant mΔC lacks the COOH-terminal 81 amino acid residues, which includes the conserved central portion; the mutant mΔN lacks the NH2-terminal 66 residues. The wild type ZmSAUR1 and the two mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified as described (see “Experimental Procedures”). These proteins were used for35S-CaM binding assays in the presence and absence of Ca2+. The binding of CaM to wild type and mutant mΔC was similar, whereas CaM did not bind to the mutant mΔN (Fig.4 A), indicating that a CaM binding region is restricted to the 66 amino acids of the NH2 terminus, where SAURs showed the least similarity. CaM binding to wild type and mΔC of ZmSAUR1 was prevented by the addition of 2 mm EGTA (data not shown), indicating an absolute requirement of Ca2+ for CaM binding. CaM is a protein capable of recognizing the basic amphiphilic α-helical domain of the target proteins (14.Snedden W.A. Fromm H. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 299-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 41.Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 47.Snedden W.A. Koutsia N. Baum G. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4148-4153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Helical wheel projection of the peptide sequences predicted that the CaM binding region was restricted further to amino acids 20–45 of ZmSAUR1. The amino acid residues 32–45 formed a typical basic amphiphilic α-helix (Fig. 4 B), similar to CCaMK, a plant Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase (40.Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A peptide with 26 residues corresponding to the amino acids 20–45 was incubated with bovine CaM, and complex formation was assessed by nondenaturing PAGE in the presence or absence of Ca2+. The results showed that the peptide is capable of forming a stable complex with CaM in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4 C) but not in the absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). Several ratios of peptide to CaM were used. In the absence of the peptide, there was a single band reflecting the pure CaM. As the peptide was added, another band of low mobility appeared, representing the peptide-CaM complex. When the ratio of peptide to CaM was equal, the CaM band disappeared, and the intensity of the peptide-CaM complex increased. At a peptide to CaM molar ratio of 1.5, no free CaM was detected. At higher ratios (up to 2.5), no new band appeared on the gel, nor did the peptide-CaM complex band change its intensity, suggesting that multivalent complexes were absent. These observations indicate that the peptide binds to Ca2+/CaM with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Based on the primary structure of SAURs in Fig. 2, it seems that ZmSAUR1 is very divergent isoform with a longer NH2-terminal domain. However, using the helical wheel projection method, we found that the NH2-terminal portions in all of the SAURs listed in Fig. 2 as well as other SAURs in the data base can form a basic amphiphilic α-helix, suggesting that SAURs in general are CaM-binding proteins. To prove this, two SAURs, 10A5 and SAUR-AC1 from soybean and Arabidopsis,respectively, were selected for further analysis. Both amino acids 9–22 in soybean 10A5 and 3–16 in ArabidopsisSAUR-AC1 formed a basic α-amphiphilic helix, just like ZmSAUR1 (Fig.5 A). Two peptides, corresponding to 2–24 of 10A5 and 2–19 of SAUR-AC1, were synthesized, and a similar gel mobility shift assay was used to study the CaM binding efficiency. In the presence of calcium, like the peptide from ZmSAUR1, both peptides formed a stable complex with CaM, visualized as a larger size band instead of the smaller size band of CaM itself (Fig.5 B). Moreover, the two peptides bind to Ca2+/CaM with a 1:1 stoichiometry, too; however, only one CaM band was detected in the presence of EGTA (data not shown). CaM binding affinity of ZmSAUR1 was studied using different concentrations of 35S-labeled CaM. To eliminate nonspecific CaM binding, bovine serum albumin was used as a negative control. The average background count was subtracted from the counts of ZmSAUR1 protein samples when calculating the specific binding. Binding of labeled CaM to ZmSAUR1 saturated at concentrations above 100 nm (Fig. 6), indicating the presence of a saturable high affinity binding site in ZmSAUR1. From Scatchard plot analysis of the saturation curve, the dissociation constant (K d) of CaM for ZmSAUR1 was estimated to be about 15 nm. The binding of CaM to ZmSAUR1 was blocked completely in the presence of 2 mm EGTA. Scatchard analysis also indicated that ZmSAUR1 has a single CaM binding site (Fig. 6). Most studies of SAUR gene expression in soybean have been conducted using etiolated elongating hypocotyl sections that respond rapidly to auxin treatment (28.McClure B.A. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 9: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 32.McClure B.A. Hagen G. Brown C.S. Gee M.A. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). An analogous system in corn is the etiolated coleoptile segments. Corn coleoptile segments floated in 10 μm NAA solution showed a significant increase in length from that of control without application of NAA (Fig.7 A). After about a 2-h incubation, the elongation of coleoptiles was detectable. After 16 h, the coleoptile elongation increased by more than 50%; however, coleoptiles in the medium without the NAA application elongated only about 5%. To study the auxin induction kinetics of ZmSAUR1expression, corn coleoptile segments were collected at different times after incubation in the medium with 10 μm NAA for RNA preparation. Northern analyses indicated that the level ofZmSAUR1 is undetectable if NAA was not applied (Fig.7 B). Treatment with NAA led to a significant induction of the ZmSAUR1 with a size of ∼ 0.8 kilobase, which coincides with the cDNA size of ZmSAUR1. The induction began within 10 min, a sharp increase occurred between 20 and 60 min, with half-maximal after 30 min and saturation in 60 min. This kinetics of auxin induction is similar to Arabidopsis SAUR-AC1 (30.Gil P. Liu Y. Orbovic V. Verkamp E. Poff K.L. Green P.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), in contrast to soybean SAUR mRNAs, in which the induction happened in 2.5 min and peaked at 15 min (28.McClure B.A. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 9: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 32.McClure B.A. Hagen G. Brown C.S. Gee M.A. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that ZmSAUR1 is indeed an early auxin-responsive gene. Earlier studies in our laboratory revealed that W-7, a CaM antagonist, inhibited auxin-induced coleoptile elongation. However, its structural homolog W-5 (same as W-7 but lacking a Cl), which is 10 times less active as a CaM antagonist with the same membrane affinity, did not inhibit cell elongation significantly (19.Raghothama K.G. Mizrahi Y. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 28-33Crossref PubMed Google Scho"
https://openalex.org/W2082255237,"To identify potential transactivators ofpdx-1, we sequenced approximately 4.5 kilobases of the 5′ promoter region of the human and chicken homologs, assuming that sequences conserved with the mouse gene would contain criticalcis-regulatory elements. The sequences associated with hypersensitive site 1 (HSS1) represented the principal area of homology within which three conserved subdomains were apparent: area I (−2694 to −2561 base pairs (bp)), area II (−2139 to −1958 bp), and area III (−1879 to −1799 bp). The identities between the mouse and chicken/human genes are very high, ranging from 78 to 89%, although only areas I and III are present within this region in chicken. Pancreatic β cell-selective expression was shown to be controlled by mouse and human area I or area II, but not area III, from an analysis of pdx-1-driven reporter activity in transfected β- and non-β cells. Mutational and functional analyses of conserved hepatic nuclear factor 3 (HNF3)-like sites located within area I and area II demonstrated that activation by these regions was mediated by HNF3β. To determine if a similar regulatory relationship might exist within the context of the endogenous gene, pdx-1 expression was measured in embryonic stem cells in which one or both alleles of HNF3β were inactivated. pdx-1 mRNA levels induced upon differentiation to embryoid bodies were down-regulated in homozygous null HNF3β cells. Together, these results suggest that the conserved sequences represented by areas I and II define the binding sites for factors such as HNF3β, which control islet β cell-selective expression of the pdx-1 gene.

The finding that a human born without a pancreas was homozygous for an inactivating mutation inpdx-1 (5.Stoffers D.A. Zinkin N.T. Stanojevic V. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) highlights the critical conserved role that this factor plays in pancreas formation in vertebrates. In the adult pancreas, PDX-1 is expressed at highest levels within islet β cells (6.Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Teitelman G. Development. 1995; 121: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDX-1 can specifically stimulate reporter gene expression from transfected constructs driven by promoter sequences from several genes that are normally transcribed selectively in β cells, including insulin (7.Ohlsson H.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The importance of PDX-1 in controlling the expression of genes required for the sensing and regulation of blood glucose levels suggested that an inactivating mutation within the protein would result in dysfunctional β cells. Indeed, mice that are heterozygous mutant carriers of PDX-1 exhibit symptoms of glucose intolerance, suggesting a dosage effect on insulin expression and β cell function (18.Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Jonsson L. Simu K. Edlund H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 19.Dutta S. Bonner-Weir S. Montminy M. Wright C.V.E. Nature. 1998; 392: 560Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). More significantly, humans with this condition are susceptible to a form of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes designated maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) (20.Stoffers D.A. Ferrer J. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 138-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In addition, selectively removing PDX-1 from adult islet cells using the Cre-LoxP system results in the development of diabetes in mice, which appears to be at least partially caused by the reduction in insulin and GLUT2 gene expression levels (18.Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Jonsson L. Simu K. Edlund H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Although PDX-1 is clearly essential for pancreas formation and islet β cell function, the transcription factors that control its expression are not well characterized. The analysis ofpdx-1-driven reporter constructs in transgenic mice has shown that the cis-acting elements mediating pancreas-and duodenum-specific expression are found within the 5′-flanking region of the gene (21.Sharma S. Leonard J. Chapman H. Leiter E. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2294-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22.Wu K.-L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.E. Henderson E.K. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNaseI and micrococcal nuclease studies performed on the endogenous mouse pdx-1 gene identified three nuclease hypersensitive sites (HSS), which are located approximately between nucleotides −2560 to −1880 (HSS1), −1330 to −800 (HSS2), and −260 to +180 (HSS3) (22.Wu K.-L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.E. Henderson E.K. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, the only sequences that could direct pancreatic β cell-specific expression in transfected cells spanned HSS1 region sequences. Moreover, HSS1 sequences could independently direct β cell-selective transgene expression in vivo (22.Wu K.-L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.E. Henderson E.K. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggested that the HSS1 region was critical for correct development- and differentiation-specific transcription of the pdx-1 gene. Hepatic nuclear factor 3β (HNF3β), a potent transcriptional regulator of the forkhead/winged helix factor family (23.Ang S.L. Wienda A. Wong D. Stevens K.A. Cascio S. Rossant J. Zaret K.S. Development. 1993; 119: 1301-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Ang S.-L. Rossant J. Cell. 1994; 78: 561-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 25.Monaghan A.P.

Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and implicated in controlling HSS1 selective activation via a binding site located in the mousepdx-1 gene at −2007 to −1996 base pair(s) (bp) (22.Wu K.-L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.E. Henderson E.K. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the role of HNF3β in pdx-1 expressionin vivo cannot be resolved from studying HNF3β homozygous null mutant mice, as they die early in embryogenesis before the differentiation of pancreatic endoderm (24.Ang S.-L. Rossant J. Cell. 1994; 78: 561-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 27.Weinstein D.C. Ruiz A. Altoba I. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Prezioso V.R. Jessell T.M. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Recent data, however, suggest that potential insight into HNF3β function in the pancreas may be gained by performing experiments with embryonic stem (ES) cells (28.Duncan S.A. Navas M.A. Dufort D. Rossant J. Stoffel M. Science. 1998; 281: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Thus, differentiation of ES cells to embryoid bodies (EBs) induces the expression of genes encoding pancreas-enriched transcription factors, including hepatic nuclear factors HNF3β, HNF1α, and HNF4α as well their target genes, such as GLUT2 and L-pyruvate kinase (28.Duncan S.A. Navas M.A. Dufort D. Rossant J. Stoffel M. Science. 1998; 281: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 29.Stoffel M. Duncan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13209-13214Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Conversely, the expression of HNF1α and HNF4α was compromised in EBs produced from HNF3β null ES cells (28.Duncan S.A. Navas M.A. Dufort D. Rossant J. Stoffel M. Science. 1998; 281: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These results suggested that ES cells might provide a model system allowing insight into the possible roles of HNF3β in the gene interaction hierarchies regulating pdx-1 transcription under different growth and differentiation stimuli. The three HSS sites detected in pdx-1 presumably reflect an altered chromatin conformation caused by non-histone protein binding (e.g. transcription factors) in expressing versusnonexpressing cells (see Elgin (30.Elgin S.C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19259-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Felsenfeld et al. (31.Felsenfeld G. Boyes J. Chung H. Clark D. Studitsky V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9384-9388Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and Gross and Garrard (32.Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) for a discussion of HSS in gene activation). Since the expression pattern of pdx-1 is very similar in frog (33.Wright C.V. Schnegelsberg E.P. DeRobertis E.M. Development. 1989; 105: 787-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), chicken (34.Kim S.K. Hebrok M. Melton D.A. Development. 1997; 124: 4243-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rat (21.Sharma S. Leonard J. Chapman H. Leiter E. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2294-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), mouse (6.Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Teitelman G. Development. 1995; 121: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and human (35.Peshavaria M. Henderson E. Sharma A. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3987-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we reasoned that critical cis-acting elements within these HSS regions would be conserved among these species. To begin to address this possibility, approximately 4.5 kilobase(s) (kb) of the promoter region from the human and chicken pdx-1 genes was sequenced and compared with mouse. Interestingly, the HSS1 region contained the only shared areas of significant identity, and these could be resolved into three separate conserved subregions, termed areas I, II, and III. Comparison of reporter constructs driven by mouse and human areas I , II, and III demonstrated that area I and area II can mediate β cell-selective activation. Furthermore, the integrity of conserved HNF3β binding sites present in area I and area II were important for stimulation. We also found that HNF3β inactivation greatly decreased the level of pdx-1 expression that occurs in EBs. Our results strongly suggest that conserved sequences within the HSS1 region define the binding sites for key regulators of pdx-1transcription. A human genomic pdx-1 clone (ipf1P1) containing approximately 8 kb of the 5′-flanking region was generously provided by Dr. M. Alan Permutt (Washington University School of Medicine (36.Inoue H. Riggs A.C. Tanizawa Y. Ueda K. Kuwano A. Liu L. Doris-Keller H. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). The chicken pdx-1 locus (cpdx-1 #4) was isolated from a genomic library by probing with a 3′ MluI-EcoRV fragment of the rat pdx-1 cDNA (37.Leonard J. Peers B. Jonson T. Ferreri K. Lee S. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the 14-kb insert contained around 4 kb of 5′-flanking sequence and the entire coding region. Approximately 4.5 kb of human and chicken sequence upstream of the transcription start site (+1 bp) was determined, and alignment with the mouse pdx-1 gene was performed using the MacVector DNA analysis program (Oxford Molecular). The GenBank™ accession numbers for the 5′-flanking sequences of the mouse, human, and chicken pdx-1 genes are AF192495, AF192496, andAF194114, respectively. Human and mouse pdx-1sequences spanning areas I (−2694 to −2561 bp), II (−2139 to −1958 bp), and III (−1879 to −1799 bp) were generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned directly upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Tk) promoter region in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression vector, pTk(An) (38.Jacoby D.B. Zilz N.D. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17623-17626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These subregion sequences in mouse are located between −2761 to −2457 bp (area I), −2141 to −1923 bp (area II), and −1879 to −1600 bp (area III) and between −2839 to −2521 bp (area I), −2252 to −2023 bp (area II), and −1939 to −1664 bp (area III) in humans. The numbering is relative to the S1 transcription start site (21.Sharma S. Leonard J. Chapman H. Leiter E. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2294-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)). Point mutants within the HNF3β binding elements of the human and mouse area I and area II pTk constructs were generated using the Quik Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotides were used for mutagenesis: area I, site A1, human −2726 GCAGCTCTTATGGATAAATACCCCAAAAAGGTGTAAACCAATTA −2683, mouse −2649 TCTTATGGATAAATACCCCAAAACGGCTGTAAAC −2615; area I, site A2, human −2723 AACAGCAGCTCTTATGGATACCCCAACAAAAAAGGTGTAAACCA −2679, mouse −2645 CAGCTCTTATGGATACCCCAACAAAAACGGCTGT −2611; area II, site B, human −2121 GCCTGCCACCCCCGGAGTGTGGCATTTGCACTTCTCAACTAATT −2077. The mutated sequences are underlined. Mouse area I oligonucleotides were used to construct the HNF3β binding mutant in the −2917-bp/PstI to −1918-bp/BstEII region of PstBst:pTk and PstBst:pTk M5 (22.Wu K.-L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M.

The HNF3β mutant in site B of mouse area II was produced from PstBst:pTk M5 by 5′ Xmn1 cleavage. Each construct was verified by sequencing. Monolayer cultures of the pancreatic islet β cell lines, βTC3 (22.Wu K.-L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.E. Henderson E.K. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Cell.

Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained as described previously. The pdx-1:pTk constructs were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (HIT T-15 (40.Whelan J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3253-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), BHK (40.Whelan J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3253-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) or LipofectAMINE (βTC3, MIN6) procedures (Life Technologies, Inc.). The precipitates (11 μg total) used for the HIT T-15 and BHK transfections contained 1 μg of pdx-1:pTk and pRSVLUC, whereas 1 μg of each plasmid (2 μg total) was used with βTC3 and MIN6 cells. The Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) enhancer-driven luciferase (LUC) expression plasmid, pRSVLUC (41.DeWet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar), was used as a recovery marker. HIT T-15 and BHK cells were treated with 20% glycerol (2 min) 4 h after the addition of the calcium phosphate DNA precipitate. Extracts were prepared 40 to 48 h after transfection, and LUC and CAT enzymatic assays were performed as described (41.DeWet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar, 42.Nordeen S.K. Green III, P.P. Fowles D.M. DNA (N. Y.). 1987; 6: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The CAT activity from the reporter constructs were normalized to the LUC activity of the cotransfected internal control plasmid. Each experiment was carried out at least three times. Nuclear extracts were prepared from βTC3 cells as described previously (43.Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). HNF3β wasin vitro transcribed and translated from pGEM1-HNF3β (44.Samadani U.S. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6273-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Binding reactions (20 μl) were carried out according to Wang et al. (45.Wang J.-C. Stromstedt P.-E. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20 mmKCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10% (v/v) glycerol. Approximately 5 μg of βTC3 extract protein was used per gel mobility shift reaction. The double-stranded oligonucleotides used to detect HNF3β binding were end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP. The probe sequences were as follows: human area I, site A1/A2, −2713 CCGTTTTTGTTTATTTATCCA −2693; human area I, site A1 mutant, −2713 CCGTTTTTGGGGATTTAT −2696; human area I, site A2 mutant, −2709 TTTTGTTGGGGTATCCAT −2692; human area II, site B, −2109 GTGCAAAGTAAACACCC −2093; area II, human site B mutant −2109 GTGCAAATGCCACACCC −2093; mouse area II, site B, −2013 GTGCTAAGCAAACATCCT −1996. The mutated nucleotides are underlined. The rabbit anti-mouse HNF3β antiserum (3 μl) was preincubated with extract protein for 10 min at room temperature before initiation of the DNA binding reaction. The HNF3β antibody was raised against amino acids 1 to 117 of mouse HNF3β and specifically recognized this protein (46.Marti E. Takada R. Bumcrot D.A. Sasaki H. McMahon A.P. Development. 1995; 121: 2537-2547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were electrophoresed on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 150 V for 2 h under high ionic strength polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis conditions (10.Peshavaria M. Gamer L. Henderson E. Teitelman G. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) before drying and autoradiography. Wild type, heterozygous, and HNF3β null ES cells were maintained in ES cell medium supplemented with 1,000 units of leukemia inhibitory factor on a primary embryonic fibroblast layer as described (47.Robertson E.J. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 71-112Google Scholar). ES cells were induced to differentiate to EBs in vitro by growing them in bacterial Petri dishes without feeder fibroblasts and leukemia inhibitory factor for 21 days. HNF3β-dependent gene expression was measured in EBs produced from three distinct clonal HNF3β null lines (clones B14, 5.1, 5.2) and two different heterozygous lines (clones B13, 4B1). Targeted disruption of HNF3β was performed as described previously (23.Ang S.L. Wienda A. Wong D. Stevens K.A. Cascio S. Rossant J. Zaret K.S. Development. 1993; 119: 1301-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Weinstein D.C. Ruiz A. Altoba I. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Prezioso V.R. Jessell T.M. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from ES cells and EBs using TRIzol as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by treating with 3 μl of RNase-free DNase-I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/10 μg of RNA. cDNA was synthesized using moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with dNTPs and random hexamer primers (Stratagene). The cDNAs served as templates for PCR reactions with specific primer pairs to detect hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, GATA-4, HNF3β, and PDX-1 levels. The primer sequences used are: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, forward, 5′-AGCGCAAGTTGAATCTGC-3′, reverse 5′-AGCGACAATCTACCAGAG-3′; GATA4, forward, 5′-CGCCGCCTGTCCGCTTCC-3′, reverse 5′-TTGGGCTTCCGTTTTCTGGTTTGA-3′; HNF3β, forward, 5′-ACTGGAGCAGCTACTACG-3′, reverse 5′-CCCACTAGGATGACATG-3′; PDX-1, forward, 5′-ACAAGGACCCGTGCGCATTC-3′, reverse 5′-CTCGGTTCCATTCGGGAAAG-3′. Sequencing of the promoter region of the human and chickenpdx-1 genes and comparison to mouse identified a localized area of substantial identity between all species that corresponds approximately to the previously reported HSS1 region (Fig.1). In contrast, the level of conservation within the HSS2 region, at approximately 39–48%, is similar to that found for non-HSS sequences. There is also significant conservation of HSS3 sequences in human and mouse, but not chicken,pdx-1 (Fig. 1). An E-box element at −99 to −94 bp, which represents a upstream stimulatory factor regulatory site in the HSS3 region (21.Sharma S. Leonard J. Chapman H. Leiter E. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2294-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), is conserved within the mouse and human pdx-1genes (data not shown). The HSS1 region could be subdivided into three distinct domains based on sequence identity, which ranged between mouse and human area I (−2694 to −2561 bp), area II (−2139 to −1958 bp), and area III (−1879 to −1799 bp) from 89, 78, and 84%, respectively, which is higher than the 72% identity shared by the mouse and human promoter-proximal sequences spanning HSS3 (Fig.2). All three subdomains can be considered to be associated with HSS1 (i.e. −2560 to −1880 bp) based upon the standard deviation (± 150 bp) of the HSS analysis (22.Wu K.-L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.E. Henderson E.K. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chicken pdx-1 does not contain a similarly located region homologous to area II, although area I and III sequences are highly conserved between mouse and chicken (Fig. 1). Since Southern blot analysis using mouse and human area II probes has also failed to detect cross-reacting sequences in chicken (data not shown), a chicken equivalent to area II may not exist. We showed previously that mousepdx-1 sequences spanning the −2917- to −1918-bp region (e.g. PstBst:pTk) directed selective reporter construct expression in transfected pancreatic islet β (i.e. HIT T-15, βTC-3) versus non-islet (i.e. BHK, HeLa, H4IIE) cell lines (22.Wu K.-L.

The conserved sequences of areas I and II are entirely contained within this region, but none of area III. To determine if area I, II, or III contributes independently to cell-specific activation, mouse and human pdx-1 sequences spanning each conserved domain were subcloned directly upstream of the Tk minimal promoter in a CAT reporter plasmid. We analyzed their activity in transfected HIT T-15, βTC3, MIN6, and BHK cells. The activity of each construct is presented as the ratio ofpdx-1:pTk expression in β cells relative to BHK cells. Area I and II reporter constructs were much more active than area III constructs in islet β cells (Fig. 3). The finding that human and mouse areas I and II gave similar levels of β cell stimulation provides a functional correlation with the sequence conservation of these regions. In contrast, only the human area III construct was active in the transfection assays, with stimulation low compared with area I or area II and only detectable in βTC3 and MIN6 cells (Fig. 3). We presume that a nonconserved sequence element(s) is involved in activation of human area III in βTC3 and MIN6 cells. Importantly, these results suggested that both area I and area II contribute to the β cell-specific activation pattern observed for the previously tested −2917- to −1918-bp fragment in transfection and transgenic assays (22.Wu K.-L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.E. Henderson E.K. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inspection of the conserved area I, area II, and area III sequences detected two overlapping potential HNF3β binding sites within area I (sites A1 and A2) and one in area II (site B) (Fig. 2). The area II site represents the HNF3β binding element previously determined to contribute in β cell-selective activation of the PstBst:pTk construct (22.Wu K.-L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.E.

Here we characterize protein 4.1B, a novel homolog of erythrocyte protein 4.1R that is encoded by a distinct gene. In situ hybridization revealed high level, focal expression of 4.1B mRNA in select neuronal populations within the mouse brain, including Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, pyramidal cells in hippocampal regions CA1–3, thalamic nuclei, and olfactory bulb. Expression was also detected in adrenal gland, kidney, testis, and heart. 4.1B protein exhibits high homology to the membrane binding, spectrin-actin binding, and C-terminal domains of 4.1R, including motifs for interaction with NuMA and FKBP13. cDNA characterization and Western blot analysis revealed multiple spliceoforms of protein 4.1B, with functionally relevant heterogeneity in the spectrin-actin and NuMA binding domains. Regulated alternative splicing events led to expression of unique 4.1B isoforms in brain and muscle; only the latter possessed a functional spectrin-actin binding domain. By immunofluorescence, 4.1B was localized specifically at the plasma membrane in regions of cell-cell contact. Together these results indicate that 4.1B transcription is selectively regulated among neuronal populations and that alternative splicing regulates expression of 4.1B isoforms possessing critical functional domains typical of other protein 4.1 family members.

These proteins are characterized by the presence of three main conserved structural/functional domains. A 30-kDa N-terminal membrane binding domain (MBD1; also called the FERM domain (1.Chishti A.H.

Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The prototypical protein 4.1R has been characterized most extensively in the erythrocyte, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the erythrocyte's morphology and mechanical integrity. Consequently, deficiency of protein 4.1R yields an elliptocytic morphology and decreased membrane strength, leading to cellular fragmentation and hemolytic anemia (reviewed in Ref. 16.Conboy J.G. Semin. Hemat. 1993; 30: 58-73PubMed Google Scholar). The complement of 4.1 proteins expressed in brain and other nonerythroid cells is structurally more complex and functionally less well understood than in erythroid cells. Western blot analysis suggests that multiple protein 4.1 isoforms are expressed in most nucleated cells (17.Granger B.L. Lazarides E. Cell. 1984; 37: 595-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18.Anderson R.A. Correas I. Mazzucco C. Castle J.D. Marchesi V.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 37: 269-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This molecular heterogeneity is probably due not only to post-translational modifications but also to complex alternative pre-mRNA splicing pathways that insert or delete discrete peptides within the polypeptide backbone (19.Conboy J.G. Chan J. Chasis J.A. Kan Y.W. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8273-8280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Tang T.K. Leto T. Marchesi V.T. Benz E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Several of the alternative splicing events are mediated in tissue-specific fashion, resulting in expression of unique protein 4.1R isoforms in muscle (21.Baklouti F. Huang S.-C. Vulliamy T.J. Delaunay J. Benz Jr., E.J. Genomics. 1997; 39: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22.Schischmanoff P.O. Yaswen P. Parra M.K. Lee G. Chasis J.A. Mohandas N. Conboy J.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10254-10259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Additionally, programmed changes in alternative splicing alter the repertoire of 4.1R isoforms synthesized during erythroid differentiation (23.Chasis J.A. Coulombel L. Conboy J. McGee S. Andrews K. Kan Y.W. Mohandas N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24.Chasis J.A. Coulombel L. McGee S. Lee G. Tchernia G. Conboy J. Mohandas N.

Moreover, transcriptional regulation of three recently discovered 4.1 genes contributes further heterogeneity to the complement of 4.1 isoforms expressed in a given tissue. Among these are protein 4.1G, a widely expressed homolog (14.Walensky L.D. Gascard P. Fields M.E. Blackshaw S. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,26.Parra M. Gascard P. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Mohandas N. Conboy J.G. Genomics. 1998; 49: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); protein 4.1N, a neuronal homolog (27.Walensky L.D. Blackshaw S. Liao D. Watkins C.C. Weier H.-U.G. Parra M. Huganir R.L. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and protein 4.1B, the novel brain-enriched homolog reported here. The brain is a particularly rich source of protein 4.1 isoforms. Byin situ hybridization analysis, 4.1R, 4.1G, 4.1N, and 4.1B mRNAs are all expressed in distinct patterns within the brain. Several studies indicate that 4.1 protein(s) are likely to play important functional roles in the brain. For example, 4.1R has been localized to specific neuronal populations including granule cells of the cerebellum and dentate gyrus (28.Walensky L.D. Shi Z.T. Blackshaw S. DeVries A.C. Demas G.E. Gascard P. Nelson R.J. Conboy J.G. Rubin E.M. Snyder S.H. Mohandas N. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this localization, behavioral studies of protein 4.1R-deficient knockout mice have demonstrated neurological defects in fine motor coordination and spatial learning (28.Walensky L.D. Shi Z.T. Blackshaw S. DeVries A.C. Demas G.E. Gascard P. Nelson R.J. Conboy J.G. Rubin E.M. Snyder S.H. Mohandas N. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second important 4.1 protein in brain is 4.1N, which is found in most neurons of the brain, with expression detected at the earliest stage of postmitotic differentiation (27.Walensky L.D. Blackshaw S. Liao D. Watkins C.C. Weier H.-U.G. Parra M. Huganir R.L. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence experiments show that 4.1N protein is enriched at regions of synaptic contact between neurons, where it could potentially play an important role in synaptic architecture and function (27.Walensky L.D. Blackshaw S. Liao D. Watkins C.C. Weier H.-U.G. Parra M. Huganir R.L. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these recent reports, earlier biochemical studies indicated that at least one brain isoform of 4.1 possesses spectrin-actin binding activity, strongly suggesting that one function of brain 4.1 is analogous to its role in the red cell (29.Krebs K.E. Zagon I.S. Goodman S.R. Brain Res. Bull. 1987; 18: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the relationship of that biochemical activity to the newly described 4.1 genes is unknown. Functional studies of 4.1 proteins in other nonerythroid, nonneuronal cells indicate that selected 4.1 isoforms are imported into the nucleus, where they may play a general structural role in nuclear architecture (30.De Carcer G. Lallena M.J. Correas I. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31.Krauss S.W. Larabell C.A. Lockett S. Gascard P. Penman S. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. J.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4.1 proteins have also been reported to interact with the immunophilin FKBP13 (14.Walensky L.D. Gascard P. Fields M.E. Blackshaw S. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), with CD44 (6.Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Tokimitsu R. Krauss S.W. Kawashima M. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30322-30328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), with the Drosophila protein neurexin (7.Ward R.E., IV Lamb R.S. Fehon R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and with pICln, a protein potentially involved in volume regulation through association with chloride channel protein(s) (35.Tang C.J. Tang T.K. Blood. 1998; 92: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This diversity of interactions suggests that 4.1 proteins play multiple functional roles in addition to their well known function in stabilizing the red cell membrane. Several classes of neurons in the brain, including Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and the majority of thalamic nuclei, appear to exhibit little or no expression of the previously described 4.1 protein family members (27.Walensky L.D. Blackshaw S. Liao D. Watkins C.C. Weier H.-U.G. Parra M. Huganir R.L. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Walensky L.D. Shi Z.T. Blackshaw S. DeVries A.C. Demas G.E. Gascard P. Nelson R.J. Conboy J.G. Rubin E.M. Snyder S.H. Mohandas N. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we present a detailed characterization of a fourth member of the protein 4.1 family, 4.1B. This protein is expressed in Purkinje cells and thalamic nuclei as part of a region-specific expression profile that is distinct from that of the other 4.1 genes in the brain. Conserved structural features of 4.1B are presented as well as evidence that alternative splicing events govern expression of tissue-specific 4.1B isoforms with different functional properties. These studies suggest that 4.1B protein(s) play a critical structural role in a subset of neurons in the brain. The dbEST data base (National Center for Biotechnology Information, or NCBI) was screened for novel clones with homology to 4.1R, 4.1G, and 4.1N, resulting in identification of clone L26705. This cDNA spanned the C-terminal coding sequences plus the 3′-untranslated region of a novel mouse cDNA designated as protein 4.1B. Primers designed from this sequence were used to amplify mouse 4.1B sequences (ultimately corresponding to nucleotides 2973–4019 of mouse 4.1B cDNA, accession number AF152247) for use as a hybridization probe. Two long cDNAs of 3.9 and 3.5 kb, isolated from a mouse brain cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), allowed us to deduce the full-length mouse brain 4.1B primary structure. The translation initiation site was assigned based on the following criteria: it is the first AUG in the cDNA, it is situated in a favorable Kozak consensus sequence, and it encodes an N-terminal peptide (MTTE) that is identical to the N-terminal sequence of 4.1G, 4.1N, and high molecular weight isoforms of 4.1R. The mouse 4.1B gene designation isEpb4.1l3 (36.Peters L.L. Weier H.U. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Parra M. Mohandas N. Conboy J.G. Genomics. 1998; 54: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 4.1B mRNA size was determined by hybridization to Multiple Tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The probe used for Northern blot analysis of 4.1B mRNA was derived from the 3′-untranslated region of 4.1B, not overlapping the coding region. This probe was gene-specific for 4.1B, i.e. it did not cross-hybridize with other 4.1 mRNAs. Control blots were performed using the ubiquitin probe supplied by the manufacturer. Experiments were carried out using digoxigenin-labeled probes corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of mouse 4.1B cDNA (accession number AF152247; nucleotides 2973–4019). Fresh frozen 20 μm cryostat sections of whole mount embryos were laid onto Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher) and processed as described (14.Walensky L.D. Gascard P. Fields M.E. Blackshaw S. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Control sections were hybridized with identical quantities of sense cRNA, and no signal was observed. Thein situ hybridization protocol has been used to discriminate the localizations of transcripts sharing as much as 85–90% nucleic acid identity (37.Vassar R. Ngai J. Axel R. Cell. 1993; 74: 309-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Total RNA from mouse tissues was prepared and transcribed into cDNA using gene-specific antisense primers as described (19.Conboy J.G. Chan J. Chasis J.A. Kan Y.W. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8273-8280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two μl of cDNA was amplified in a 25-μl PCR containing Taq polymerase buffer, 50 pmol each of sense and antisense primers, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 0.625 units of Taq polymerase. Thirty-five cycles of amplification were performed using an automated Perkin-Elmer Cetus 9700 thermal cycler under the following conditions: denaturation for 20 s at 94 °C; annealing for 20 s at 60 °C; extension for 40 s at 72 °C. DNA fragments were analyzed by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The identity of PCR products was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. For PCR of 4.1B SAB domain sequences, the following primers were used to amplify mouse 4.1B sequences: sense strand, 5′-GAAGAAGACAGAAGGAAGAAGGCT-3′; antisense strand, 5′-CCACTCGTTTGTTAAGGCAG-3′. For PCR of mouse 4.1B C-terminal domain sequences, the following primers were used: sense strand 5′-GCCCAGACGATCACGTCTGAAACCACT-3′; antisense strand, 5′-CACGGACGGATAGAAGTCAGTTGGGT-3′. The synthetic peptide N-TTKGISQTNLITTVTPEKKA-C was used as an immunogen to raise goat anti-4.1B antibodies. This peptide represents a portion of the unique U2 domain that is conserved between human and mouse 4.1B but does not share sequence homology with 4.1R, 4.1G, or 4.1N. Before use on Western blots, the antibody was affinity-purified using the immunizing peptide coupled to a Sulfolink column (Pierce). Preimmune IgG affinity purified from the same goat was used in control blots. Brain extracts were also probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the unique U1 domains of 4.1G (14.Walensky L.D. Gascard P. Fields M.E. Blackshaw S. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and 4.1N (27.Walensky L.D. Blackshaw S. Liao D. Watkins C.C. Weier H.-U.G. Parra M. Huganir R.L. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, antibodies were preabsorbed by incubation for 2 h with a 200-fold molar excess of the appropriate 4.1 recombinant proteins expressed in the pET22b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) before blotting. A mouse was perfused free of blood via left ventricular/ascending aortic perfusion with PBS containing 0.5 mm di-isopropyl fluorophosphate. The brain was immediately harvested and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (100 mmNaCl, 50 mm Trizma, pH 7.4, 2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Pefabloc, 5 mmbenzamidine, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Tissue was left on ice for 30 min with intermittent vortexing. The tissue lysate was denatured by boiling with an equal volume of 2× SDS denaturing buffer containing 100 mmdithiothreitol. An aliquot of nondenatured lysate was assayed for protein concentration using DC reagents (Bio-Rad). Detection of endogenous mouse brain 4.1 proteins was performed using fresh brain extracts isolated as described above. 50 μg of protein was loaded per lane in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. For control experiments to detect the epitope-tagged 4.1B isoform expressed in transfected COS-7 cells, 1.5 × 106 cells were grown in two 150-mm culture dishes for 24 h and transfected for 8 h using 30 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and 12.5 μg of DNA/dish. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed in PBS, scraped off the plates in 750 μl of ice cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), 0.1% SDS, 2 mm Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 5 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A), and lysed for 30 min on ice with intermittent vortexing. The supernatant was cleared of particulate materials by centrifugation. 100 μl of protein A-agarose beads, preincubated overnight with 10 μg of anti-hemagglutinin epitope tag antibody, was added and allowed to bind for 6 h at 4 °C. Beads were spun down and washed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and associated proteins were denatured by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semidry electroblotter (Integrated Separation Systems Inc., Natick, MA). Nonspecific binding sites on the membranes were blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.5% Tween 20, 4% nonfat dry milk, 1% BSA, and 0.02% sodium azide. The blocking buffer also included either 2% donkey serum (4.1G, 4.1N) or 2% rabbit serum (4.1B) to minimize subsequent nonspecific binding of secondary antibodies. Blots were then probed overnight at 4 °C with either anti-4.1B antibody at 0.3 μg/ml, anti-4.1G antibody at 0.025 μg/ml, or anti-4.1N antibody at 0.025 μg/ml (all dilutions in TBS buffer). Immunoreactive bands were visualized after incubation with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase, using either a 1:3000 dilution of donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4.1N and 4.1G, or a 1:80,000 dilution of rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma) for 4.1B, together with the Renaissance chemiluminescence detection kit (NEN Life Science Products). Rat PC12 cells were grown for 6 days on two-well Lab Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed for 30 min at room temperature in PBS plus 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature in PBS plus 0.5% Triton X-100. After an extensive wash in PBS, samples were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS plus 10 mg/ml BSA (PBS/BSA) plus 10% goat serum. Prior to incubation with primary antibodies, samples processed for 4.1B staining were incubated at room temperature with an avidin-biotin blocking kit according to the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After blocking, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber with PBS/BSA containing 10 μg/ml of either affinity-purified goat anti-human 4.1B antibody or preimmune serum from the same goat. After incubation with primary antibodies, cells were washed in PBS plus 0.1 mg/ml BSA and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with biotin-SP-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-goat IgGs (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:2000, followed by fluorescein (5-((4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl)amino) fluorescein)-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:15,000. After extensive washing in PBS plus 0.1 mg/ml BSA, samples were mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope. For these assays, peptides from the human 4.1 proteins were utilized to allow comparison with previous functional studies. Recombinant human protein 4.1R SAB bearing a C-terminal hexahistidine tag had the sequence MEPTEAWKKKRERLDGENIYIRHSNLMLEDLDKSQEEIKKHHASISELKKNFMESVPEPRPSEWDKRLSTHSPFRTLNINGQIPTGDGRHHHHHH, corresponding approximately to the coding domains of exons 16 (single underline) and 17 (double underline) as used in previous binding assays (10.Discher D. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but now including a hexahistidine tag. The sequence of the homologous SAB domain in human protein 4.1B was as follows: MGNSLIKRIKGENVYVKHSNLMLEELEKTQDDLMKHQTNISELKRTFLETSTDTAVTNEWEKRLSTSPVGGRHHHHHH, including the C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The single underline indicates sequences homologous to those encoded by 4.1R exon 16, while the double underline represents the first 45 residues encoded by the paralog of 4.1R exon 17. This construct includes all residues with homology to the 4.1R SAB domain defined previously. The N-terminal methionine was added to facilitate translation initiation, and the “G” and “GGR” sequences at each end derive from restriction sites used in construction of the clone. Recombinant proteins were purified by Cobalt column chromatography (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using 200 mmimidazole as the elution buffer. Spectrin was purified from human red cells (38.Ralston G.B.

Biochem. 1978; 88: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and nonmuscle actin derived from human platelets was obtained from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). Monomeric actin was polymerized at high concentration (5 mg/ml) to kinetically favor formation of many short filaments, in the presence of 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm ATP. The effect of recombinant 4.1 peptides on the formation of supramolecular complex with spectrin and actin was assayed by falling ball viscometry (11.Discher D.E. Winardi R. Schischmanoff P.O.

Spectrin (1.8 μm), actin (14 μm), and various concentrations of recombinant 4.1 SAB peptides were mixed, drawn into a 50-μl microcapillary tube, and incubated at 4 °C for a minimum of 1 h to allow gelation. The viscosity was correlated to the velocity of a grade 10 stainless steel ball (0.025 inches in diameter) traveling down the microcapillary at 60° from the horizontal. A novel mouse brain cDNA, representing a new member of the protein 4.1 family of skeletal proteins, was identified and isolated by a combination of computer analysis of genetic data bases and traditional cDNA library screening (see “Materials and Methods”). This new 4.1 family member was designated as 4.1B, reflecting its high level expression in brain as well as its broad expression in a number of other tissues. The 4.1B gene was mapped to mouse chromosome 17 and assigned the gene designation Epb4.1l3 (36.Peters L.L. Weier H.U. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Parra M. Mohandas N. Conboy J.G. Genomics. 1998; 54: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The predicted protein product of this 4.1B cDNA is 103 kDa in size. In overall domain structure, it closely resembles 4.1G, 4.1N, and 4.1R, including three regions of high homology to known functional domains of protein 4.1R (Fig. 1). The most extensive conserved sequence spans residues 118–454 of 4.1B and exhibits 74% identity to the MBD of 4.1R (also called the FERM domain due to the homology of this region in 4.1 with ezrin, radixin, and moesin). As defined by this phylogenetic approach, the MBD extends approximately 38 amin"
https://openalex.org/W2103100861,"Cyclin D2 is the only D-type cyclin expressed in mature mouse B-lymphocytes, and its expression is associated with retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and pRB-related protein phosphorylation and induction of E2F activity, as B-cells enter the cell cycle following stimulation via surface IgM and/or CD40. Cyclin D-dependent kinase activity is required for cell proliferation, yet cyclin D2(-/-) mice have normal levels of mature B-lymphocytes. Here we show that B-lymphocytes from cyclin D2(-/-) mice can proliferate in response to anti-IgM and anti-CD40, but the time taken to enter S-phase is longer than for the corresponding cyclin D2(+/+) cells. This is due to the compensatory induction of cyclin D3, but not cyclin D1, which causes pRb phosphorylation on CDK4-specific sites. This is the first demonstration that loss of a D-type cyclin causes specific expression and functional compensation by another member of the family in vivo and provides a rationale for the presence of mature B-lymphocytes in cyclin D2(-/-) mice."
https://openalex.org/W2018915210,"We recently demonstrated that a template mechanism makes a significant contribution to the heparin-accelerated inactivation of factor Xa (FXa) by antithrombin at physiologic Ca2+, suggesting that FXa has a potential heparin-binding site. Structural data indicate that 7 of the 11 basic residues of the heparin-binding exosite of thrombin are conserved at similar three-dimensional locations in FXa. These residues, Arg93, Lys96, Arg125, Arg165, Lys169, Lys236, and Arg240 were substituted with Ala in separate constructs in Gla domainless forms. It was found that all derivatives cleave Spectrozyme FXa with similar catalytic efficiencies. Antithrombin inactivated FXa derivatives with a similar second-order association rate constant (k 2) in both the absence and presence of pentasaccharide. In the presence of heparin, however,k 2 with certain mutants were impaired up to 25-fold. Moreover, these mutants bound to heparin-Sepharose with lower affinities. Heparin concentration dependence of the inactivation revealed that only the template portion of the cofactor effect of heparin was affected by the mutagenesis. The order of importance of these residues for binding heparin was as follows: Arg240> Lys236 > Lys169 > Arg165 > Lys96 > Arg93 ≥ Arg125. Interestingly, further study suggested that certain basic residues of this site, particularly Arg165 and Lys169, play key roles in factor Va and/or prothrombin recognition by FXa in prothrombinase.

Gla domainless factor Xa, factor Xa from which the N-terminal residues 1–45 (in the chymotrypsin numbering system of Bode et al. (1.Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J.

Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation complex, called prothrombinase, activates prothrombin with a catalytic efficiency that is more than 105-fold greater than factor Xa alone (2.Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu.

Factor Xa circulates in plasma as a light and heavy chain molecule held together by a disulfide bond. The N-terminal Gla domain of factor Xa in the light chain is required for the ability of the protease to bind factor Va on membrane surfaces with high affinity (2.Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S.

However, previous mutagenesis studies suggest that deletion of the Gla domain (GDFXa)1 or both the Gla and epidermal growth factor 1 domains (factor Xa from which the Gla domain and the first epidermal growth factor-like domain (residues 1–84) have been removed by the recombinant DNA methods) from factor Xa result in mutant molecules that can still bind factor Va, although with a lower affinity, to activate rapidly prothrombin to thrombin in solution (5.Skogen W.F.

Antithrombin is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the proteolytic activities of both factor Xa and thrombin in plasma (8.Damus P.S. Hicks M. Rosenberg R.D.

Antithrombin by itself, however, is a weak inhibitor of both proteases unless it binds to heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (12.Jordan R.E. Oosta G.M. Gardner W.T. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10081-10090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Griffith M.J. Thromb. Res. 1982; 25: 245-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14.Olson S.T.

Heparin accelerates the rate of inactivation of thrombin and factor Xa by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude (12.Jordan R.E. Oosta G.M. Gardner W.T. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10081-10090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is the basis for the therapeutic benefit of heparin in the treatment of venous thrombosis. It is well established that heparin accelerates thrombin inactivation by antithrombin by a template mechanism (14.Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 15467-15473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this mechanism of inactivation, the polysaccharide binds both to the protease and inhibitor to enhance the rate of encounter complex formation (bridging mechanism). In factor Xa inactivation, the traditional view is that a template mechanism has no role in the acceleration, but rather a heparin-induced conformational change in the reactive site loop of antithrombin accounts for the accelerating effect of heparin in the reaction (14.Olson S.T.

Recently, however, we demonstrated that the cofactor effect of unfractionated heparin at physiologic Ca2+ is mediated by an ∼300-fold enhancement by the heparin-induced conformational change in the reactive site loop of the serpin and an ∼60–90-fold enhancement by a template mechanism (18.Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16824-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The template cofactor effect of heparin in factor Xa inactivation by antithrombin was not fully appreciated because most of previous heparin-catalyzed protease inactivation studies were conducted in the absence of Ca2+ (14.Olson S.T.

Under this experimental condition, the highly anionic N-terminal Gla domain of factor Xa interferes with heparin binding to factor Xa to approximate the enzyme and the inhibitor for enhanced encounter complex formation (18.Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16824-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The anion-binding exosite 2 of thrombin, located above the active site pocket, contains 11 basic residues that have been shown to constitute the heparin-binding site of thrombin (1.Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). In addition to binding heparin, the basic residues of this exosite are also involved in macromolecular substrate recognition including activation of the cofactors V and VIII by thrombin (19.Esmon C.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13882-13887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20.Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13143-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The structural data indicates that 7 of the basic residues of this region are conserved at the same or similar three-dimensional locations in factor Xa (21.Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). To study the role of these basic residues in the catalytic function of factor Xa and determine whether they are responsible for binding of the protease to heparin, we generated seven separate mutants in which these residues were substituted with Ala. The mutants in the chymotrypsin numbering system (1.Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), R93A, K96A, R125A, R165A, K169A, K236A, and R240A that correspond to factor X numbering (mature peptide) (22.Leytus S.P. Foster D.C. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5098-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) R273A, K276A, R306A, R347A, K351A, K420A and R424A were expressed in human 293 cells and purified to homogeneity. Following activation by RVV-X, the properties of the mutant enzymes were characterized with respect to their ability to bind directly heparin-Sepharose, react with antithrombin in both the absence and presence of high affinity heparin or the active pentasaccharide fragment of heparin, and activate prothrombin in both the absence and presence of factor Va. Our results suggest that, similar to thrombin, these basic residues constitute a heparin-binding exosite in factor Xa. We further demonstrate that certain basic residues of this site are critical for the macromolecular cofactor and/or substrate recognition of factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex. Construction and expression of factor X in Gla domainless form (GDFX) in the RSV-PL4 expression/purification vector system was described previously (7.Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H.

After confirmation of the accuracy of the mutagenesis by DNA sequencing (24.Sanger F. Micklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52764) Google Scholar), the constructs were transfected into 293 cells, and the mutant proteins were isolated from cell culture supernatants by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (7.Rezaie A.R.

The prethrombin-2 derivative of prothrombin was expressed in the pNut-PL2 expression/purification vector system in baby hamster kidney cells and purified to homogeneity as described previously (25.Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1918-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Human plasma antithrombin, human factor Va, and factor X-activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom (RVV-X) were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). The active antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide fragment of heparin and the 64-saccharide long, fractionated high affinity heparin were generous gifts from Dr. Steven Olson (University of Illinois, Chicago). Heparin-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme FXa (SpFXa) was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT), and the chromogenic substrate S2238 was purchased from Kabi Pharmacia/Chromogenix (Franklin, OH). Polybrene was purchased from Sigma. Recombinant factor X derivatives were converted to their activated forms (Xa) with RVV-X as described previously (7.Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active-site concentrations of factor Xa derivatives were determined by their absorbance at 280 nm, titration with known concentration of antithrombin, and an active-site specific immunoassay using biotinyl-ε-aminocaproyl-d-glutamic acid glycylarginine chloromethyl ketone (Hematologic Technologies Inc., Essex Junction, VT) as described previously (7.Rezaie A.R.

Factor Xa derivatives (100 μg) in 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05 m NaCl buffer containing 0.1% PEG 8000 were applied on a 2-ml heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) FPLC column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer, as described previously for the analogous mutants of thrombin (27.He X.

Fractions (400 μl) were collected, and their absorbance at 280 nm and activity toward cleavage of SpFXa were determined. The steady-state kinetics of hydrolysis of SpFXa (15–1000 μm) by the factor Xa derivatives (1 nm) were studied in 0.1m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl (TBS, pH 7.5) containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.1% polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000). The rate of hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm at room temperature in aV max kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) as described previously (26.Rezaie A.R. J. Biol.

The apparentK m and k cat values for substrate hydrolysis were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the catalytic efficiencies were expressed as the ratios of k cat/K m. The initial rate of prethrombin-2 activation by wild type and the mutant factor Xa derivatives was determined in both the absence and presence of factor Va. In the absence of the cofactor, prethrombin-2 (2 μm) was incubated with each factor Xa derivative (20 nm) in TBS buffer containing 2.5 mm Ca2+, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.1% PEG 8000 at room temperature. The initial rate of activation in the presence of human factor Va (100 nm) was measured by incubating each factor Xa derivative (0.5 nm) with prethrombin-2 (2 μm) in the same buffer system. At each time point, samples of the reactions were withdrawn into TBS buffer containing a final EDTA concentration of 20 mm. The initial rate of activation was determined by measuring the increase in amidolytic activity of the samples toward S2238 (100 μm) monitored at 405 nm by a V max kinetic plate reader as described above. The concentrations of thrombin generated in the activation reactions were determined from a standard curve prepared from the cleavage rate of S2238 by known concentrations of recombinant thrombin under the exact same conditions. A similar prothrombinase assay was used to evaluate the apparent affinity (K d(app)) of the factor Xa derivatives for factor Va. In this case, the initial rate of prethrombin-2 activation (2 μm) by each factor Xa derivative (0.5 nm) was monitored as a function of increasing concentrations of plasma-derived human factor Va (0.05–3.0 μm) or bovine factor Va (0.1–6.0 μm) in the same buffer system as described above. All activation reactions were carried out at room temperature for 5 min following which the reactions were terminated by addition of EDTA to 20 mm and the initial rates of activation were determined from the cleavage rate of S2238 as described above. The K d(app)values were estimated by fitting data to a hyperbolic binding equation using Enzfitter computer program. Following determination of the K d(app)values for factor Va, further kinetic analysis was carried out to determine the kinetic constants (K m(app)and k cat(app)) of prethrombin-2 activation by each GDFXa derivative. However, theK d(app) of factor Xa interaction with factor Va is rather high (∼1 μm) in solution (7.Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23807-23814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and this value was further elevated (up to 6-fold) with certain mutants. Noting the high number of the GDFXa derivatives under study, the reactions could not be carried out at saturating concentrations of factor Va for economic reasons. Therefore, kinetic constants were determined for each factor Xa derivative (0.5 nm) in complex with 0.25 × K d(app)concentrations of bovine factor Va as a function of increasing concentrations of prethrombin-2 (0.8–105 μm). The initial rate of activation was measured after 5 min of incubation at room temperature in the same buffer system described above. Under these experimental conditions, it is expected that the effective concentration of the enzyme-cofactor complex would be equal with all GDFXa derivatives. In all experiments less than 5% of zymogen was activated for the calculation of rate constants. The rate of inactivation of the factor Xa derivatives in both the absence or presence of heparin and the pentasaccharide fragment of heparin (500 nm) were measured under pseudo first-order rate conditions by a discontinuous assay as described previously (18.Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16824-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The heparin concentration dependence of the inactivation reactions were determined by incubating 0.2 nm of each factor Xa derivative with 2.5 nmantithrombin and varying concentrations of heparin (0–64 μm) in TBS buffer (I ∼0.12) containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.1% PEG 8000 in 50-μl reactions. After 10 s to 3 min of incubation at room temperature (∼22–23 °C), 50 μl of SpFXa in TBS buffer containing 1 mg/ml Polybrene (to block heparin function immediately) was added to give a final concentration of 0.4 mm. The remaining activities and the second-order inhibition rate constants (k 2) for the heparin-catalyzed inactivation of factor Xa derivatives were determined as described previously (18.Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16824-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The bell-shaped dependence ofk 2 on heparin concentration was computer-fit to Equation 1 as described previously (18.Rezaie A.R. J. Biol.

This equation neglects the uncatalyzed rate constant because its contribution was found to be negligible within experimental error. Fitting of the data by this equation revealed that k 2,penta was not well determined. Its value was therefore fixed at the independently determined value. The ENZFITTER (R. J. Leatherbarrow, Elsevier, Biosoft) computer program was used to fit data to appropriate equations. All values are the average of at least 3–5 independent measurements ± S.E. Wild type and the Ala substitution mutants of factor X in the Gla domainless forms (GDFX) were expressed in 293 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Wild type and mutant molecules were separated from the cell culture supernatants by a single step immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (7.Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified proteins under non-reducing conditions indicated that the isolated proteins are essentially homogenous (Fig.1). An identical result was observed for a double mutant of GDFX in which both residues Arg93 and Lys96 (Arg93 → Ala/Lys96 → Ala) were substituted with Ala (data not shown). All GDFX derivatives were then activated with RVV-X, and their concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm, stoichiometric titration with known concentrations of antithrombin, and by an active-site specific immunoassay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected from the homogeneity on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the concentrations of all enzymes as determined by these assays were in good agreement (within 80%) with those calculated by their absorbance values at 280 nm. Kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate SpFXa by the factor Xa derivatives are presented in Table I. Relative to wild type, a similar or slightly improved amidolytic activity was observed with all mutants suggesting that the mutagenesis of these basic residues did not adversely affect the catalytic pocket of factor Xa. Previously, a similar result has been observed with the analogous substitution mutants of thrombin (27.He X. Ye J. Esmon C.T. Rezaie A.R.

Wild type and R125A eluted by similar 0.40 m NaCl; however, all other mutants required lower concentrations of salt to be eluted from heparin-Sepharose (Table II). The relative decrease in the concentration of NaCl for elution of R93A (0.38 m), K96A (0.38 m), R165A (0.35m), K169A (0.35 m), K236A (0.28 m), and R240A (0.24 m) was more noticeable with the latter mutants suggesting that the two C-terminal residues, Lys236and Arg240, are more critical than others for the interaction of factor Xa with heparin. The effect with the double mutant R93A/K96A was additive since a NaCl concentration of 0.27m was sufficient to elute this mutant from heparin-Sepharose.Table IIKinetic constants for antithrombin inhibition of the factor Xa derivatives in the absence and presence of pentasaccharide and high affinity heparink 2,uncatk 2,pentak 2,maxK AT,HK FX,H[NaCl]10 3 (m −1 s −1)10 5 (m −1 s −1)10 6 (m −1 s −1)nmmWT1.8 ± 0.24.4 ± 0.4144.5 ± 6.025.5 ± 2.1374 ± 330.40R93A2.6 ± 0.46.2 ± 0.7133.6 ± 5.931.6 ± 2.6443 ± 470.38K96A1.7 ± 0.44.3 ± 0.640.4 ± 0.623.4 ± 1.11779 ± 1130.38R93A/K96A1.7 ± 0.34.4 ± 0.511.8 ± 0.427.2 ± 0.46882 ± 1030.27R125A1.6 ± 0.24.4 ± 0.5118.9 ± 0.427.9 ± 0.2326 ± 30.40R165A1.5 ± 0.33.9 ± 0.537.8 ± 0.728.9 ± 1.41197 ± 70.35K169A1.3 ± 0.23.8 ± 0.331.1 ± 1.624.3 ± 3.01716 ± 3270.37K236A1.5 ± 0.34.6 ± 0.521.2 ± 0.533.9 ± 2.76214 ± 6950.28R240A1.7 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.45.7 ± 0.125.7 ± 2.948000 ± 84000.24The inactivation rates in the absence of the cofactors were determined from the residual activities of the factor Xa derivative (1.0 nm) after incubation at room temperature with antithrombin (175–700 nm) for 5–20 min in TBS buffer, containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.1% PEG 8000, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The k 2,penta values were determined by the same procedures except that 0.5 nm enzyme was incubated with 15–25 nm antithrombin for 1–2 min in the presence of 500 nm pentasaccharide.

In the present study, the mechanisms by which Eps15, an AP-2-binding protein, is targeted to CCPs was analyzed by following the intracellular localization of Eps15 mutants fused to the green fluorescent protein. Our previous results indicated that the N-terminal Eps15homology (EH) domains are required for CCP targeting. We now show that EH domains are, however, not sufficient for targeting to CCPs. Similarly, neither the central coiled-coil nor the C-terminal AP-2 binding domains were able to address green fluorescent protein to CCPs. Thus, targeting of Eps15 to CCPs likely results from the collaboration between EH domains and another domain of the protein. An Eps15 mutant lacking the coiled-coil domain localized to CCPs showing that Eps15 dimerization is not strictly required. In contrast, Eps15 mutants lacking all AP-2 binding sites showed a dramatic decrease in plasma membrane staining, showing that AP-2 binding sites, together with EH domains, play an important role in targeting Eps15 into CCPs. Finally, the effect of the Eps15 mutants on clathrin-dependent endocytosis was tested by both immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. The results obtained showed that inhibition of transferrin uptake was observed only with mutants able to interfere with CCP assembly.

The known roles of AP-2,1 clathrin and dynamin in this process are as follows. AP-2 is believed to drive clathrin assembly at the plasma membrane and binds to tyrosine-based internalization signals, playing a central role in both formation and function of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs); clathrin gives an organizing framework to the pit; and the dynamin GTPase activity is required for membrane fusion events leading to coated vesicle formation (1.Mellman I.

The mechanisms by which these soluble proteins are targeted to the plasma membrane to form an organized clathrin coat have been extensively studied. Targeting of AP-2 complexes is mediated by its α-adaptin subunit. Studies of chimeras in which equivalent domains of α-adaptin from AP-2 and γ-adaptin from AP-1 were exchanged allowed the identification of a CCP targeting signal within a 200-amino acid region of the N-terminal “head” or “trunk” domain of α-adaptin. These studies also established a role for the C-terminal “ear” domain of α-adaptin (6.Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7.Page L.J. Robinson M.S.

Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the α-adaptin N-terminal domain also contains a phosphoinositide binding site (9.Gaidarov I. Chen Q. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Keen J.H. J. Biol.

Therefore, as Eps15 does not contain any known plasma membrane targeting signals, its localization to CCPs is likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions through its structural domains. The aim of this study was to identify these signals. With this goal in mind, we generated mutant forms of Eps15 and followed their intracellular localization. Their effect on clathrin-dependent endocytosis was further analyzed and compared with their capacity or inability to localize in CCP. HeLa cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The mouse monoclonal antibodies AP.6 (anti-AP-2 (35.Chin D.J. Straubinger R.M. Acton S. Nathke I. Brodsky F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG was from Immunotech (Marseille, France). The cDNA of human Eps15 subcloned in pBluescript® II KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was obtained in the laboratory (22.Benmerah A. Gagnon J. Bègue B. Mégarbané B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and used as a template to generate the different cDNA fragments used in this study. The Eps15 constructs encoding each structural domain subcloned in the PGEX5.1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the EH deleted mutant EΔ95/295 were described previously (8.Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Benmerah A. Lamaze C. Bègue B. Schmid S.L. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J.

The deleted mutants were obtained by polymerase chain reactions and introduced within Eps15 subcloned between the BamHI/XhoI sites of the PGEX5.1 vector using appropriate restriction sites. Briefly, deletion of the central coiled-coil domain (EΔCC) was obtained by deleting a 635-base pair region corresponding to nucleotides 960–1605 of human Eps15, and the mutated DNA fragment was introduced within the Eps15 sequence using the HindIII (825) and ClaI (1937) sites. Mutants of the C-terminal domain were obtained by introducing stop codons in the corresponding lower primers at position 1856 (EΔA/P/C), 2298 (EΔP/C), or 2544 (EΔC). The mutated polymerase chain reaction fragments were then introduced within the Eps15 sequence using the BglII (1337) and XhoI sites. To generate a Eps15 mutant lacking only AP-2 binding sites (EΔAP-2), a 354-base pair region (1856 to 2298) was deleted as described previously (24.Benmerah A. Lamaze C. Bègue B. Schmid S.L. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). All of the different constructs were excised from the PGEX5.1 vector using the BamHI/XhoI sites, purified on agarose gel, and then subcloned into theBglII/SalI sites of the EGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All of the constructs were checked by nucleotide sequencing (Thermosequenase, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequences of the different primers used to generate the Eps15 mutants are available on request. Subconfluent HeLa cells were used for transient expression of the different constructs. Transfections were performed using the CalPhos Maximizer transfection kit fromCLONTECH. For immunofluorescence studies, transfected HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and used the day after transfection. The cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and 0.03 msucrose for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed once in PBS and, after quenching for 10 min in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, washed again in PBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). The cells were then incubated with the AP.6 antibody in permeabilization buffer (PBS with 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.05% saponin) for 45 min at room temperature. After two washes in the permeabilization buffer, the presence of antibodies was revealed by incubating the cells for 45 min at room temperature in permeabilization buffer containing labeled secondary antibody. After two washes in permeabilization buffer and one in PBS, the cells were mounted on microscope slides in 100 mg/ml Mowiol (Calbiochem), 25% glycerol (v/v), and 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5. To wash out cytosolic GFP constructs, the cells were briefly permeabilized before fixation with a 2–5-min incubation with 0.03% saponin in cytosolic buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes) at 4 °C. The cells were then washed twice in cytosolic buffer and processed for immunofluorescence as described above. For surface staining, transfected cells were incubated with antibodies in PBS, 1 mg/ml BSA at 4 °C. Human transferrin (Tf) was conjugated to Cy3 dye using the CyDye FluoroLink reactive dye kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech following the manufacturer's instructions. Endocytosis of Cy3-conjugated Tf was performed on subconfluent HeLa cells grown on coverslips 1 day after transfection. The cells were first incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, to eliminate receptor-bound Tf and then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 1 mg/ml BSA containing 100 nm Cy3-conjugated Tf. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the cells were rapidly cooled to 4 °C, washed twice in cold PBS, and then fixed as described above. The samples were examined under an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) attached to a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Cell surface Tf-Rs were quantified by flow cytometry. HeLa cells were detached from culture plates 1 day after transfection using a Costar cell lifter. Cells were washed twice in PBS, 1 mg/ml BSA and then incubated at 4 °C for 45 min with anti-Tf-R antibody OKT9 at saturating concentrations in PBS 1 mg/ml BSA. The cells were then washed twice in PBS 1 mg/ml BSA and incubated at 4 °C for 45 min in PBS 1 mg/ml BSA with a phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The cells were then washed twice in PBS 1 mg/ml BSA, and the levels of expression of both GFP and Tf-R on the cell surface were assessed using a FACSCAN (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data were analyzed using the CELLQuest program (Becton Dickinson). Endogenous Eps15 is constitutively found in CCPs (18.Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol.

In this study, the GFP fusion system was used to map the domains of Eps15 involved in its targeting to CCPs. The different mutants derived from Eps15 (see Fig. 6) were fused to GFP, the resulting constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and their intracellular distribution was compared with that of AP-2.Figure 6Structural organization of Eps15 mutants and summary of the results. A, P, andC stand for AP-2 binding, proline-rich, and C-terminal regions, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results obtained in our previous study showed that EH domains are required for CCP targeting of Ep15. Indeed, an Eps15 construct lacking the second and third EH domains showed a diffuse cytosolic staining (8.Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The putative role of EH domains as a sufficient coated pit targeting signal was first tested. As shown in Fig.1 a, a GFP construct encoding EH domains (DI) presented a diffuse intracellular staining, suggesting that the DI construct was not targeted to CCP. This was confirmed by its lack of colocalization with AP-2 at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1,a, b, and insets), showing that EH domains were unable to specifically target GFP to CCPs. From these and previous results (8.Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) it can be concluded that EH domains are required but not sufficient for CCP targeting. The central coiled-coil and C-terminal AP-2 binding domains, DII and DIII constructs, respectively, were then tested for their capacity to bring GFP to CCPs. The DII construct was diffusely distributed in cytosol and did not colocalize with AP-2 at the plasma membrane (Fig.1, c, d, and insets). A similar cytosolic staining was observed with the DIII construct (Fig.1 e). However, expression of the DIII construct, previously shown to inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis (24.Benmerah A. Lamaze C. Bègue B. Schmid S.L. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), induced a mislocalization of AP-2 complexes. Cells expressing DIII showed less AP-2 dots at the plasma membrane and an increase in cytosolic staining compared with neighboring untransfected cells (Fig.1 f, indicated by arrows). These results are reminiscent of those obtained with the EΔ95/295 mutant (8.Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and indicated that expression of the DIII construct also inhibits clathrin-coated pit assembly. Nevertheless, the DIII construct did not colocalize with the AP-2 dots still present at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, e, f, and insets), showing that the AP-2 binding domain is not a sufficient coated pit targeting signal. The lack of plasma membrane punctate staining observed for each structural domain was not due to an excess of cytosolic GFP, because brief permeabilization of the transfected cells before fixation effectively washed out cytosolic GFP constructs but did not reveal any specific plasma membrane-associated staining (data not shown). Altogether, these results show that none of the three structural domains of Eps15 is sufficient for CCP targeting. The fact that EH domains are necessary but not sufficient for coated pit targeting suggests the involvement of another domain(s) in this process. We first investigated the role of the C-terminal domain. Indeed, the C-terminal domain of Eps15 contains both AP-2 binding sites and a proline-rich region. The proline-rich region is found between amino acids 768 and 849 and contains a PALPPK (768/774) sequence that binds to SH3 domain-containing proteins (37.Schumacher C. Knudsen B.S. Ohuchi T.

Matuoka K. Takenawa K. Kurata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14468-14472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a proline-rich domain is responsible for the targeting of dynamin to CCPs (16.Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) through interaction with the SH3 domain of amphiphysin (39.Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism could therefore also be involved in Eps15 targeting. Eps15 constructs lacking either the 849–896 (EΔC; data not shown) or the 763–896 region (EΔP/C; Fig.2 c) showed a bright plasma membrane punctate staining. Furthermore, the plasma membrane punctate staining completely colocalized with AP-2 (Fig. 2, c,d, and insets), showing that EΔP/C is targeted to CCPs. Thus, the proline-rich region of Eps15, responsible for binding to SH3 domain containing proteins, is not necessary for its targeting to CCPs. The role of AP-2 binding sites was investigated using two different constructs; EΔA/P/C lacking the entire C-terminal region after amino acid 620 and EΔAP-2 lacking only the AP-2 binding sites (621–738 region). As shown in Fig. 2, these two constructs showed a very faint plasma membrane staining (Fig. 2, e and g). This very faint staining still presented some colocalization with AP-2 (Fig.2, e-h and insets), showing that the constructs could be found in CCPs. However, the plasma membrane staining was highly reduced compared with that observed for both wild type Eps15 (Fig. 2 a) and for all of the constructs containing both EH domains and AP-2 binding sites (Fig. 2 c and Fig. 3,a and c), showing that AP-2 binding sites play an important role in CCP targeting of Eps15. Noticeably, in contrast to endogenous Eps15 2A. Benmerah, unpublished observation. and transfected GFP-Eps15 (Fig. 2 a), some constructs (including EΔP/C (Fig. 2 c) and EΔA/P/C (Fig. 2 e)) were found in the nucleus. Interestingly, the Eps15-related protein, Eps15r, is found both in plasma membrane CCPs and in the nucleus (40.Coda L. Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Pelicci G. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Pelicci P.G. Difiore P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3003-3012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, Eps15 mutants may reveal a possible nucleocytoplasmic traffic for Eps15. 3V. Poupon, N. Cerf-Bensussan, A. Dautry-Varsat, and A. Benmerah, manuscript in preparation. Finally, the role of the central dimerization domain in coated pit localization was also tested. The EΔCC construct lacking the coiled-coil domain colocalized with AP-2 at the plasma membrane (Fig.3, a, b, andinsets), showing that the coiled-coil domain is not required for CCP targeting of Eps15. However, we repeatedly noticed that the CCP staining observed for EΔCC (Fig. 3 a) was fainter than for the full-length Eps15 (Fig. 2 a). Compared with EΔP/C (Fig.2 c), which only lacks the C-terminal and proline-rich regions, weaker CCP staining was also observed for the EΔCC+P/C (Fig.3 c) lacking the coiled-coil domain, the C-terminal, and the proline-rich regions. Altogether, these results suggest that the coiled-coil domain does not provide specific targeting information but rather helps to enhance the number of Eps15 molecules present in a given CCP. We next checked the effect of all of the Eps15 mutants (described above) on clathrin-dependent endocytosis. These mutants can be classified in two groups. Group I includes DIII and EΔ95/295 that affect CCP assembly, and group II includes all of the other mutants that do not affect CCP assembly (Fig. 6). Indeed, in the latter group, clathrin-dependent endocytosis could be affected at a later step, i.e. CCP invagination and/or coated vesicle formation. The effect of these mutants on Tf uptake was therefore tested. Expression of group II mutants did not inhibit internalization of Cy3-conjugated Tf (Fig. 4 B and data not shown) whereas a strong inhibition was observed with group I mutants (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). We next verified that the lack of inhibition of Tf uptake by group II mutants was not due to lower expression levels of group II mutants compared with group I mutants. We took advantage of the fact that inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis induces an increase in the number of Tf-R at the cell surface (41.Durrbach A. Louvard D. Coudrier E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 457-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Lamaze C. Fujimoto L.M. Yin H.L. Schmid S.L. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 6775-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4 A, cells expressing the EΔ95/295 construct (a) presented both an inhibition of internalization of Cy3-Tf (b) and an increase of cell surface Tf-R (c) compared with neighboring untransfected cells. In contrast, no increase of cell surface Tf-R was observed in cells expressing group II mutants that did not inhibit Cy3-Tf uptake (Fig.4 B and data not shown). An increase of cell surface Tf-R was then used to follow the inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. HeLa cells transiently transfected with group I, group II, and control constructs were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells expressing identical levels of GFP constructs were selected (Fig.5 a, region 2) and analyzed for cell surface Tf-R expression. As shown in Fig.5 b, cells expressing the DII construct presented similar levels of cell surface Tf-R compared with cells expressing the control construct D3Δ2, which do not inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis (24.Benmerah A. Lamaze C. Bègue B. Schmid S.L. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Similar results were also found for cells expressing the EΔCC construct (data not shown). Cells expressing either DI or EΔA/P/C constructs did not show increased cell surface Tf-R (Fig.5 b). Rather they expressed a lower level of cell surface Tf-R compared with that found for both DII and D3Δ2 constructs. Only cells expressing either DIII (Fig. 5 b) or EΔ95/295 (data not shown) showed a clear increase of cell surface Tf-R compared with cells expressing the control D3Δ2 construct. Therefore, the quantitative results obtained by flow cytometry confirm those obtained by Tf uptake experiments and show that, at identical expression levels, group I but not group II mutants inhibit CCP functions. The present results extend our previous study and indicate that EH domain-binding protein(s), together with the AP-2 complex, play an important role in coated pit targeting of Eps15 (summarized in Fig.6). Furthermore, they show that the inhibitory effect of Eps15 mutants correlates with inhibition of CCP assembly. Results obtained by several groups have shown that Eps15 EH domains bind to numerous proteins through NPF-based motifs (21.Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 32.Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Difiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Some of the identified proteins including RAB/RABr are not found in CCPs nor involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis and therefore can be excluded as physiological partners for Eps15 targeting. The most interesting candidate is the recently identified EH domain-binding protein, epsin. Like Eps15, epsin is a constitutive component of CCPs that is associated with AP-2 and required for clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Interestingly, overexpressed wild type epsin is localized to the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane in regions devoid of clathrin coat (21.Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with a role of epsin as a plasma membrane-associated docking protein, which could therefore link Eps15 to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, Eps15 recruitment into CCPs also requires binding to AP-2. The fact that AP-2/Eps15 interaction sites (26.Benmerah A. Bègue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) are involved in their respective targeting to CCPs (6.Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7.Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8.Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that Eps15 is targeted to CCPs complexed to AP-2. The Eps15 mutants can be classified as group I mutants, which inhibit both CCP assembly and clathrin-dependent endocytosis and group II mutants, which do not (Fig. 6). The group I mutants contain the AP-2 binding sites. However, the presence of AP-2 binding sites is not sufficient for these inhibitory effects because the EΔCC construct that contains both EH domains and the AP-2 binding domain did not inhibit coated pit assembly nor clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The EΔCC construct was still targeted to CCP (Fig. 3) whereas DIII and EΔ95/295 were not (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 8.Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibitory effects of Eps15 mutants on clathrin-dependent endocytosis requires both the presence of AP-2 binding sites and a lack of CCP localization. Comparable domain requirements were also reported for dynamin. Dynamin mutants lacking the pleckstrin homology domain were recently shown to inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis of Tf (45.Achiriloaie M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1410-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 46.Lee A. Frank D.W. Marks M.S. Lemmon M.A. Curr.

Biol. 1999; 9: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As previously shown for GTPase-deficient mutants (48.Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the C-terminal amphiphysin binding region is required for the inhibitory effect of the mutants on clathrin-dependent endocytosis (47.Vallis Y. Wigge P. Marks B. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as observed for Eps15 with EH domains, the autonomously expressed dynamin pleckstrin homology domain does not inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis (49.Jost M. Simpson F. Kavran J.M. Lemmon M.A. Schmid S.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Klein D.E. Lee A. Frank D.W. Marks M.S. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27725-27733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recently, the ear domain of α-adaptin, the Eps15 binding site on AP-2, was shown to bind to many other proteins including epsin, amphiphysin, auscilin, and AP-180 (51.Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Noble M.E. Hunter J.B. Dafforn T.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Cell. 1999; 97: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, auxillin and AP-180 are only expressed in neuronal cells (52.Morris S.A. Schroder S. Plessmann U. Weber K. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 53.Schroder S. Morris S.A. Knorr R. Plessmann U. Weber K. Nguyen G.V. Ungewickell E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); Eps15, epsin, and amphiphysin seemed to be the main α-ear domain partners in peripheral cells. Interestingly, all of these different proteins bear DPF repeats first found in the AP-2 binding domain of Eps15 (26.Benmerah A. Bègue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and were shown to share with Eps15 the same α-ear binding site (51.Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Noble M.E. Hunter J.B. Dafforn T.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Cell. 1999; 97: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We could not formally exclude the possibility that the effects that we observed by expression of AP-2 binding sites containing Eps15 mutants on CCPs were because of a general inaccessibility of the α-ear domain. Nevertheless, the increasing number of α-ear binding proteins suggests a very important role of this AP-2 domain in clathrin coat function, an hypothesis confirmed by the fact that expression of α-ear inhibits clathrin-dependent internalization of Tf. What could be these functions? The α-ear domain could bring accessory proteins to the pit as it is thought for dynamin via amphiphysin (39.Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Another possibility, and both are not exclusive, is that α-ear plays an active role in the recruitment of AP-2 complexes onto the plasma membrane. This hypothesis is sustained by the fact that the ear domains of α-, γ- and δ-adaptins are the most divergent parts of assembly protein complexes (54.Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 55.Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 56.Simpson F. Peden A.A.

The fact that an α-ear domain GFP fusion protein is efficiently targeted to CCP (8.Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) shows that this domain effectively acts as a sufficient coated pit targeting signal. In this model, epsin and Eps15 seemed to be interesting potential candidates as constituents of the plasma membrane-associated AP-2 docking machinery. We thank V. Collin and V. Mallarde for helpful technical assistance and D. Ojcius for careful reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2113330475,"This paper documents for the first time a volume-sensitive Ca2+ influx pathway in osteocytes, which transmits loading-induced signals into bone formation. Stretch loading by swelling rat and chicken osteocytes in hypo-osmotic solution induced a rapid and progressive increase of cytosolic calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i. The influx of extracellular Ca2+ explains the increased [Ca2+]i that paralleled the increase in the mean cell volume. Gadolinium chloride (Gd3+), an inhibitor of stretch- activated cation channels, blocked the [Ca2+]i increase caused by hypotonic solutions. Also, the expression of α1C subunit of voltage-operatedl-type Ca2+ channels (α1C) is required for the hypotonicity-induced [Ca2+]i increase judging from the effect of α1C antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) specifically potentiated the hypotonicity-induced [Ca2+]i increase in a dose-dependent manner through the activation of adenyl cyclase. The increases induced by both PTH and hypotonicity were observed primarily in the processes of the osteocytes. In cyclically stretched osteocytes on flexible-bottomed plates, PTH also synergistically elevated the insulin-like growth factor-1 mRNA level. Furthermore, Gd3+ and α1C antisense significantly inhibited the stretch-induced insulin-like growth factor-1 mRNA elevation. The volume-sensitive calcium influx pathways of osteocytes represent a mechanism by which PTH potentiates mechanical responsiveness, an important aspect of bone formation.

On the other hand, prolonged immobilization is one of the important reasons of bone loss. However, the intracellular mechanisms by which bone cells sense mechanical strain are not well known (1.Lanyon L.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1984; 36: S56-S61Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Although osteocytes are the most abundant cells in bone, the role of osteocytes in bone remodeling was not clear until recently. Direct inhibition of osteoclastic activity by osteocyte-derived protein through osteoclast-osteocyte attachment was demonstrated (2.Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Sato T. Tezuka K. Nijweide P.J.

Furthermore, intermittent mechanical loading within the physiological range enhances IGF-11mRNA expression in osteocytes (4.Lean J.M. Jagger C.J. Chambers T.J. Chow J.W. Am. J.

Although the involvement of stretch-activated cation channels (SA-Cat) in the reception of mechanical stress has been reported in many other cell types, none has been functionally demonstrated in osteocytes so far. The localization of PTH receptors by in situ hybridization (14.Fermor B. Skerry T.M. J. Bone. Miner.

Stretch-activated cation channels and their activation by PTH were demonstrated in UMR 106 osteoblast-like cells by Duncan et al. (16.Duncan R.L. Hruska K.A. Misler S.

Osteocytes differentiate from osteoblasts along with a dramatic elongation of cytoplasmic processes. This morphological change suggests that their levels of sensitivity to mechanical loading and the mechanisms of response could be distinct. In this study, we have identified a stretch-activated Ca2+entry pathway for the first time in both rat and chicken osteocytes by swelling the cells with hypo-osmotic stress. Also, by using single cell [Ca2+]i video-image analysis, we demonstrated that osteocyte processes are furnished with volume-sensitive, stretch-activated Ca2+ entry pathways that are activated by PTH. Apparently, the pathways are dependent on the expression of α1C subunit of the VOCC molecule. Fetal calf serum was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Bacterial collagenase was purchased from Wako Biochemicals (Osaka, Japan). The acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (fura-2 AM) was purchased from Dojin (Kumamoto, Japan). Parathyroid hormone and its fragments were from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). All other reagents were of analytical grade from Sigma unless otherwise mentioned. Chicken osteocytes were isolated from bone marrow-free calvariae of 16-day-old chicken embryos according to the modified method of Van der Plas and co-workers (2.Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Sato T. Tezuka K. Nijweide P.J. Katoh Y. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1995; 21: 189-192PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Van der Plas A. Nijweide P.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, calvariae of 16-day-old chicken embryos were minced and digested with 1 mg/ml type I collagenase in the isolation buffer (25 mm Hepes, 10 mm NaHCO3, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mg/ml glucose, 7.5 μmα-tosyl-l-lysyl chloromethane, a protease inhibitor) (37 °C, 30 min), washed in PBS, incubated in PBS(−) containing 5 mm EDTA (37 °C, 30 min), and finally digested with collagenase in the isolation buffer (37 °C, 30 min) and cultured on glass coverslips in α-minimal essential medium with 2% chicken serum. Most osteocytes were positively stained with osteocyte-specific monoclonal antibody, OB7.3, kindly provided by Dr. M. J. Alblas and P. Nijweide (University of Leiden, Netherlands). Rat osteocytes were prepared from frontal and parietal bones that were dissected aseptically from newborn rats according to the method of Mikuni-Takagaki et al. (5.Mikuni-Takagaki Y. Suzuki Y. Kawase T. Saito S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2028-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, pieces of bone were stripped of periosteal soft tissue and sutures and digested with 25 ml of 0.75 mg/ml collagenase. Cells released after the first 30 min and the second through the fourth 20-min digestion at 37 °C (fractions I–IV) were collected and, filtered through a nylon screen with 40-μm pores, and the fraction III cells were cultured as osteoblasts at the original density of 5 × 104 cells/ml on glass coverslips coated with type I collagen. The residual bone pieces were further washed with 4 mm EDTA in Ca2+,Mg2+-free PBS and then digested with collagenase as before for 20 min each. Isolated 2 × 104 fraction VI cells were cultured as young osteocytes on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and insulin, transferrin, and selenium. Fraction VI cells were cultured on coverslips coated with Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products/Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) to stimulate cell differentiation toward the osteocytic phenotype (20.Mikuni-Takagaki Y. Kakai Y. Satoyoshi M. Kawano E. Suzuki Y. Kawase T. Saito S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The mean cell volume of rat osteocytes at various osmolarities was measured using a Coulter counter (CDA-500, Sysmex Co., Kobe, Japan) adapted with a 100-μm diameter aperture as described previously (21.Hazama A. Okada Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 402: 687-702Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar,22.Okada Y. Hazama A. Yuan W.L. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 12 (suppl.): 5-13Google Scholar). Fraction VI rat young osteocytes (1 × 104) were resuspended in various Ringer's solutions of different osmolarities, and the cell volume was measured. Cell volume distribution curve was taken, and mean cell volume was calculated by computer software. Cytosolic calcium was measured in single cells using the fluorescent calcium indicator, fura-2 as described previously (23.Miyauchi A. Hruska K.A. Greenfield E.M. Duncan R. Alvarez J. Barattolo R.

Osteocytes cultured for 1–2 days on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and loaded with 5 μm fura 2/AM for 1 h at 25 °C in Ringer's solution (138 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.3 with NaOH)). After two washes with Ringer's solution, the measuring chamber was mounted to a microfluorometric system and images (F340 and F360) were collected at wavelengths of 340 and 360 nm. The ratio of F340/F360 constructed after background image subtraction disclosed subcellular [Ca2+]i localization. The average cell [Ca2+]i values were calculated from calibration curve as described (26.Kudo Y. Ogura A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 89: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 27.Ogura A.

Rat osteocytes cultured on Matrigel were placed 5–7 mm from the edge of the flexible plate wells coated with type I collagen (5.Mikuni-Takagaki Y. Suzuki Y. Kawase T. Saito S.

For stretching at the physiological level, the bottom of the plate was deformed by a computer operated vacuum system (Flexercell Strain Unit, Flexercell Corp., McKeesport, PA), with a frequency of 1/2.5 Hz (4 cycles of stretching in 10 s, followed by 50 s of relaxation) for 1 h. The expected strain was between 2,000 μE (microstrain) and 4,000 μE (0.4% elongation)."

Inhibin also binds type II activin receptors and antagonizes many activin effects. Here we describe alanine scanning mutagenesis of the ActRII extracellular domain. We identify a cluster of three hydrophobic residues (Phe42, Trp60, and Phe83) that, when individually mutated to alanine in the context of the full-length receptor, cause the disruption of activin and inhibin binding to ActRII. Each of the alanine-substituted ActRII mutants retaining activin binding maintains the ability to form cross-linked complexes with activin and supports activin cross-linking to the type I activin receptor ALK4. Unlike wild-type ActRII, the three mutants unable to bind activin do not cause an increase in activin signaling when transiently expressed in a corticotroph cell line. Together, our results implicate these residues in forming a critical binding surface on ActRII required for functional interactions with both activin and inhibin.

Activin was first identified and isolated based on its ability to stimulate the release of follicle-stimulating hormone from gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary (3.Vale W. Rivier J. Vaughan J. McClintock R. Corrigan A. Woo W. Karr D. Spiess J. Nature. 1986; 321: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), whereas inhibin was identified based on its ability to inhibit this process (4.Vale W. Rivier C. Hsueh A. Campen C. Meunier H.

Activins (∼28,000 Da) and inhibins (∼32,000 Da) are disulfide-linked dimers of related polypeptides, with activins consisting of two β chains (activin A, βA-βA; activin AB, βA-βB; and activin B, βB-βB) and inhibins possessing an α chain disulfide-linked to a β chain (inhibin A, α-βA; and inhibin B, α-βB) (1.Vale W. Hsueh A. Rivier C. Yu J. Sporn M.A. Roberts A.B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 95/II. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1990: 211-248Google Scholar). The structure of these factors is determined by several conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds in the tightly folded “cystine-knot” motif shared by TGF-β superfamily members (6.Isaacs N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although inhibins frequently counteract the effects of activins (7.Vale W. Rivier C. Munson P. Principles of Pharmacology: Basic Concepts & Clinical Applications. Chapman and Hall, Inc., New York1995: 883-886Google Scholar), there are cell types in which inhibin is unable to attenuate the activin response (8.Lebrun J.-J. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1389-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), making it unlikely that inhibin blocks activin effects exclusively by competing with activin for receptor binding as has been previously suggested (10.Xu J.M. McKeehan K. Matsuzaki K. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6308-6313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Type II activin receptors (ActRII and the closely related ActRIIB) are single-transmembrane domain serine/threonine kinase receptors that bind activin with high affinity and thereby initiate the cellular responses triggered by activin (11.Mathews L.S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), activin receptors are thought to exist as homodimers, a finding consistent with their proposed role in binding dimeric ligand. Inhibin also binds ActRII and ActRIIB, although with an ∼10-fold lower affinity than has been shown for activin (11.Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 12.Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Kintner C.R. Science. 1992; 255: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that inhibin exerts its effects by binding to its own distinct receptor component(s) in addition to ActRII (8.Lebrun J.-J. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell.

After binding activin, the type II receptor-activin complex interacts with the type I activin receptor ALK4 (13.Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to form a heteromeric receptor complex. As with other type II TGF-β family member receptors, the type II activin receptors phosphorylate type I receptors on serine and threonine residues in conserved cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domains to activate the type I receptor (14.Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Montalvo E. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Following activation, the type I receptors phosphorylate and activate Smad proteins, which subsequently associate with the common mediator Smad protein, Smad4, and then migrate to the nucleus, where they initiate transcriptional responses (17.Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 18.Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3985) Google Scholar). To characterize the initial steps in the activin signaling cascade, we have focused on identifying the residues in the ECD of ActRII required for activin and inhibin binding. We recently expressed and characterized the soluble ECD of ActRII and showed that it is capable of binding activin and inhibin and that it competitively inhibits the ability of activin to stimulate follicle-stimulating hormone secretion from gonadotrophs, presumably by competing with full-length ActRII on gonadotrophs for activin binding (19.Donaldson C.J. Vaughan J.M. Corrigan A.Z. Fischer W.H. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1760-1766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we recently solved the crystal structure of the ActRII ECD (20.Greenwald J. Fischer W.H. Vale W.W. Choe S. Nat. Struct.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16711-16718Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The ActRII ECD consists of seven disulfide-cross-linked β sheets that form a three-finger toxin-like fold similar to the folds of several cobra cardiotoxins (22.Rees B. Bilwes A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 385-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). By solving the ECD crystal structure, we were able to identify surface-exposed amino acid residues that may play an important role in protein-protein interactions such as receptor-ligand or receptor-receptor binding interactions (20.Greenwald J. Fischer W.H. Vale W.W. Choe S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To identify the amino acid residues on ActRII required for activin and inhibin binding, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis of the receptor ECD. We focused on amino acid residues shown by the crystal structure to be exposed at the surface of the molecule and therefore potential candidates for protein-protein interactions. Residues were also chosen if they were conserved between mouse (11.Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) andDrosophila (23.Childs S.R. Wrana J.L. Arora K. Attisano L. Oconnor M.B. Massagué J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9475-9479Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) type II receptors, two evolutionarily divergent proteins that have a similar high affinity for activin A. Using this approach, we have identified three conserved hydrophobic residues (Phe42, Trp60, and Phe83) that, when mutated individually to alanine, yield receptors with disrupted activin A and inhibin A binding. The ECD crystal structure shows that these residues interact with each other to form a hydrophobic surface that is a likely binding interface (20.Greenwald J. Fischer W.H. Vale W.W. Choe S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We present evidence in this report that these three residues together form a site on ActRII required both for activin A and inhibin A binding to ActRII and for a functional activin response in intact cells. NuPAGE gels and molecular weight markers were obtained from Novex (San Diego, CA). Protease inhibitors were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Recombinant human activin A and inhibin A were generated using a stable activin-expressing cell line generously provided by Dr. J. Mather (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and were purified by Wolfgang Fischer (Peptide Biology Laboratory, Salk Institute). 125I-Activin A and 125I-inhibin A were prepared using the chloramine-T method as described previously (24.Vaughan J.M. Vale W. Endocrinology. 1992; 132: 2038-2050Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), with resulting specific activities ranging from 50 to 100 μCi/μg. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) and protein G-agarose were purchased from Calbiochem. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-ActRII polyclonal antibodies (directed against residues 482–494 of mouse ActRII) have been previously described (25.Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19013-19018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG, 3,3′,5,5′ tetramethylbenzidene (TMB) peroxidase substrate, and chemiluminescent substrate (SupersignalTM) were obtained from Pierce. The mouse ActRII (11.Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) and human ALK4 (13.Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) clones used in this study were in the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To incorporate the amino-terminal Myc epitope and to generate mutations in the extracellular domain of full-length mouse ActRII, we utilized an overlapping polymerase chain reaction strategy. We introduced a uniqueAgeI site just 5′ of the transmembrane domain in the ActRII construct, allowing us to make and to subclone mutant polymerase chain reaction products (∼500 base pairs) spanning only the ECD of the receptor. Primers were constructed to incorporate a 5′-EcoRI site and a 3′-AgeI site, and polymerase chain reaction products were gel-purified and digested with both enzymes and then subcloned into AgeI/EcoRI-digested mouse ActRII vector to yield full-length receptor constructs. For each construct, the mutated amino-terminal ECD region was confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK 293 cells were grown in 5% CO2 to ∼40–60% confluence in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 10% bovine calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, andl-glutamine) and then transfected following the calcium phosphate precipitation method (26.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) using Hepes-buffered saline (pH 7.07). For cotransfection of ActRII and ALK4, a 20:1 ratio of their respective cDNAs was used. Following transfection, cells were incubated at 5% CO2 for 48 h and then harvested by rinsing each plate once with Hepes dissociation buffer (HDB; 12.5 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, and 5 mm KCl) and incubating each plate in HDB containing 1 mm EDTA for 10 min to release the cells. To prepare soluble extracts, pelleted cells were treated with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm 4-(aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min on ice, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. To prepare membranes for binding, cells from each plate were pelleted by centrifugation, aspirated, resuspended in 10 ml of 5% sucrose, homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer 10 times on ice, and pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 30 min. Membrane pellets resulting from each confluent 10-cm plate were resuspended in 200 μl of 5% sucrose containing protease inhibitors. Resuspended membranes were stored at −70 °C until used in binding assays. To detect Myc-tagged receptors expressed at the cell surface, cells were transfected on day 1 in 10-cm plates, trypsinized and replated on day 2 in poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates (50,000 cells/well), and evaluated 48 h after transfection. Each well was rinsed with HDB, and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, rinsed with HDB, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in HDB for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed with HDB, incubated for 2 h with 2 μg/ml anti-Myc antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin in HDB, rinsed three times with HDB, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG in 3% bovine serum albumin in HDB for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were rinsed three times with HDB; 100 μl of TMB peroxidase substrate was added to each well; and plates were incubated at room temperature until a blue color was visible. Reactions were stopped by adding 100 μl of 0.18m H2SO4 to each well, and peroxidase activity was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the resulting yellow solutions at 450 nm. Binding was performed in 96-well 0.2-μm Durapore plates using the vacuum filtration multiscreen assay system (Millipore). Each well contained a total of 200 μl: 50 μl of binding buffer (HDB with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mmMgSO4, and 1.5 mm CaCl2), 50 μl of unlabeled competitor (activin A or inhibin A) at various dilutions in binding buffer, 50 μl of 125I-activin A (∼100,000 cpm/well) or 125I-inhibin A (∼300,000 cpm/well) diluted in binding buffer, and 50 μl of HEK 293 cell membranes (3–5 μg/well) diluted in binding buffer. Plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, vacuum-filtered, washed twice with 50 μl/well binding buffer, and allowed to dry, and individual filters were punched out and counted using a γ-counter. Binding data were analyzed using the Prism program. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out under reducing conditions on NuPAGE gels. Electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes was carried out in a Novex X-cell II apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unbound sites were blocked either for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl). For ActRII detection, blocked membranes were washed three times for 10 min each with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 2 μg/ml anti-Myc antibody (9E10). Membranes were then washed three times for 10 min each with TBST and incubated for 30 min with 2 μg/ml peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG. Blots were washed three times for 10 min each with TBST, and reactive bands were visualized using the Pierce SupersignalTM ECL detection system. Covalent cross-linking was carried out by incubating ∼106HEK 293 cells resuspended in HDB with ∼2 × 106 cpm125I-activin A in a total of 500 μl for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. Following this incubation, 1 ml of cold HDB was added to each tube, and cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 500 μl of HDB, brought to 0.5 mm disuccinimidyl suberate, and incubated for an additional 30 min on ice. Cross-linking reactions were quenched by adding 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline to each tube; cells were pelleted by centrifugation and aspirated; and cell pellets were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer on ice for 30 min. Triton X-100-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation; 2 μg of anti-Myc antibody was added to each supernatant; tubes were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C; and immune complexes were precipitated by adding 10 μl of 50% protein G-agarose slurry to each tube, incubating for an additional 1 h at 4 °C, and pelleting the resulting immobilized immune complexes by centrifugation. Each protein G-agarose pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, boiled for 10 min, eluted in 25 μl of NuPAGE SDS sample buffer (Novex), and resolved via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The activin/TGF-β-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid 3TPLux has been previously described (13.Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was generously provided by Dr. Joan Massagué. Mouse AtT20 cells were trypsinized and plated at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells/well in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 2 mm glutamine for 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected in complete medium with ∼1 μg of 3TPLux plasmid, 0.1 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase plasmid, and 0.2 μg of either vector or ActRII plasmid. Transfections were performed under optimized conditions using Superfect transfection reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). After incubating for 2.5 h with transfection reagent and DNA, cells were washed and allowed to recover for 5 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. The cells were treated with activin A for ∼16 h and then harvested in solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and luciferase reporter activity was measured and normalized to relative β-galactosidase activities. Fig. 1 Ashows a space-filling diagram of the ActRII ECD structure (residues 6–102) (20.Greenwald J. Fischer W.H. Vale W.W. Choe S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) illustrating both the concave (left) and convex (right) faces of the molecule and indicating the locations of the residues we selected for individual mutation to alanine. Most of the residues selected are conserved between mouse (mouse ActRII and ActRIIB) and Drosophila (activinreceptor type II (AtrII)) type II receptors, each of which binds activin with high affinity (Fig. 1 B). We predicted that by individually mutating conserved residues to alanine, we would be able to identify amino acids that are important for activin, inhibin, and possibly ALK4 binding while minimizing the structural changes caused by mutation. To facilitate detection of ActRII expressed in HEK 293 cells, we used polymerase chain reaction to introduce a Myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDL) at the extreme amino terminus immediately following the putative signal peptide. We have previously shown by peptide sequencing that the amino termini of the majority of soluble recombinant ActRII ECDs expressed in insect cells begin with the sequence AILG, but that a small fraction of the N-terminal sequences start with the downstream sequence RSET (19.Donaldson C.J. Vaughan J.M. Corrigan A.Z. Fischer W.H. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1760-1766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2C. J. Donaldson and W. Vale, unpublished observations. To ensure that the Myc epitope was not cleaved with the signal peptide, we inserted it immediately upstream of the RSET sequence (Fig. 1 B). To demonstrate that the Myc-tagged ActRII constructs were expressed in HEK 293 cells, we initially performed Western blot experiments. Fig.2 A shows that ActRII, with or without the amino-terminal Myc tag, was expressed in HEK 293 cells. An antibody directed against ActRII recognized an ∼65-kDa protein expressed in cells transfected with ActRII or ActRII-Myc, but not vector alone (Fig. 2 A, left), whereas an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody detected ActRII-Myc, but not ActRII (right). To demonstrate that the Myc-tagged ActRII constructs were expressed at the cell surface, we developed an intact cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based assay as described below (see Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that the Myc epitope is present on the ActRII-Myc construct, that both the untagged and Myc-tagged receptors are expressed in this system at similar levels, and that the receptors are expressed at the cell surface.Figure 4ActRII mutants deficient in activin A and inhibin A binding are expressed at the cell surface.

Fig. 2 Bshows the resulting competition curves and demonstrates that the Myc epitope had little effect on the ability of ActRII to bind activin A. Although we could detect very low levels of displaceable activin A and inhibin A binding in HEK 293 cells transfected with empty vector, this level of binding was negligible in comparison to the binding seen in cells transfected with ActRII (data not shown). To identify amino acid residues on ActRII required for binding activin, we expressed a series of ActRII point mutants in which individual selected residues in the ECD were changed to alanine. Competition binding experiments were performed on isolated membranes from HEK 293 cells expressing each mutant to determine the IC50 of activin A for each mutant receptor and to compare these values with those obtained for the wild-type receptor. TableI shows the results of this screen for wild-type and mutant ActRII-Myc constructs. As indicated in Table I, we identified three residues in the ECD (Phe42, Trp60, and Phe83) that yielded no detectable binding. We were unable to detect the G58A mutant following transfection into HEK 293 cells by either Western blotting or activin A binding, indicating that this mutant was not expressed. All of the other alanine mutants tested had IC50 values that were comparable to that measured for wild-type ActRII (0.11 (0.02–0.66) nm), with values ranging from 0.1 nm for D77A to 0.7 nm for K37A (Table I). Together, these data strongly suggest that Phe42, Trp60, and Phe83 form a binding site for activin A on ActRII and that the other surface-exposed residues examined are not required for activin A binding.Table IActivin binding to N-terminally Myc-tagged ActRII constructsActRII-MycIC50(nm)WTaWT, wild-type.0.11 (0.02–0.66)F42ANo detectable bindingW60ANo detectable bindingF83ANo detectable bindingG58ANo detectable expressionV81A0.22 (0.18–0.26)V28A0.21 (0.13–0.32)F13A0.12 (0.10–0.14)F14A0.15 (0.11–0.19)I52A0.13 (0.09–0.20)I54A0.10 (0.09–0.12)D34A0.15 (0.10–0.21)D36A0.20 (0.15–0.27)D62A0.20 (0.18–0.24)E29A0.16 (0.10–0.26)D77A0.10 (0.08–0.13)E10A0.30 (0.23–0.38)D71A0.33 (0.26–0.43)K37A0.70 (0.53–0.92)K56A0.11 (0.09–0.15)Competition binding was performed on isolated membranes from HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type or mutant ActRII-Myc constructs.

Open table in a new tab Competition binding was performed on isolated membranes from HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type or mutant ActRII-Myc constructs. Binding curves, resulting IC50 values, and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using the Prism program. Because activin is a β-β dimer and inhibin is an α-β dimer and also because activin and inhibin can compete for binding to ActRII, it is likely that the β subunit mediates the interaction between each ligand and ActRII and that both activin and inhibin bind to the same or overlapping sites on the receptor. To test whether Phe42, Trp60, and Phe83 are required for activin A and inhibin A binding, we performed competition binding experiments using125I-activin A and 125I-inhibin A in the presence of 25 nm unlabeled activin A or inhibin A, respectively. Fig. 3 A shows that 125I-activin A bound wild-type ActRII and that this binding was blocked in the presence of 25 nm unlabeled activin A. Membranes from cells expressing the F42A, W60A, and F83A mutants displayed very low levels of activin A binding that were not displaced by unlabeled activin A (Fig. 3 A). A similar result was obtained with 125I-inhibin A, with displaceable binding observed with wild-type ActRII, but not with F42A, W60A, or F83A. The percent of bound ligand relative to total ligand used in these experiments was typically severalfold higher for activin than for inhibin, likely reflecting the higher affinity of activin than inhibin for ActRII. In summary, the three ActRII ECD residues Phe42, Trp60, and Phe83 are each required for both activin A and inhibin A to bind ActRII. Because these three mutants did not have detectable activin A or inhibin A binding, we performed additional experiments to verify their expression. Fig. 3 A shows, by Western blot analysis using the anti-Myc antibody, that the F42A, W60A, and F83A mutants were expressed at similar levels and migrated at similar positions following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis relative to the wild-type receptor. In some cases, ActRII migrated as a doublet, most likely reflecting variable levels of glycosylation of the ECD (Fig.4 A). To further demonstrate that each of these mutant receptors was expressed at the cell surface, we developed and employed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based assay that allowed detection of the Myc epitope on the surface of intact cells using an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. This assay allowed us to demonstrate that each of the three mutant receptors deficient in activin A and inhibin A binding displayed its amino-terminal Myc epitope at the surface of the cell (Fig. 4 B). The levels of cell-surface expression measured for these three mutants varied, and only the W60A mutant was consistently measured at levels comparable to wild-type levels. However, both F42A and F83A were consistently expressed at levels higher than those with vector a"

Together these chromosomal translocations account for nearly one-third of all AML and one-fourth of all childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases containing discernable chromosomal abnormalities (24.Rubnitz J.E. Crist W.M. Pediatrics. 1997; 100: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although these translocations are closely associated with acute leukemia, it is the wild-type form of AML-1 that transforms cells. Wild-type AML-1 (AML-1B) is transforming when expressed in fibroblasts, and this activity requires the C-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain (25.Kurokawa M. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Ogawa S. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 883-892PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Tanaka T. Kurokawa M. Ueki K. Tanaka K. Imai Y. Mitani K. Okazaki K. Sagata N. Yazaki Y. Shibata Y. Kadowaki T.

Likewise, the closely related protein PEBP2αA1 (AML-3) is up-regulated by retroviral insertions that cooperate with c-Myc to induce T-cell lymphomas (27.Stewart M. Terry A. Hu M. O'Hara M. Blyth K. Baxter E. Cameron E. Onions D.E. Neil J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8646-8651Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Therefore, in fibroblasts and in mice, AML-1-family proteins are oncogenes. Thus, AML-1 has the unusual property that both the wild-type and the translocated alleles can affect cellular proliferation and differentiation pathways. Overexpression of the fusion protein encoded by the Inv (16.Lutterbach B. Westendorf J. Linggi B. Isaac S. Seto E. Hiebert S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 651-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (223) Google Scholar) inhibited cell cycle progression (28.Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P.

This protein can act as an AML-1 dominant repressor, suggesting a role for AML-1 in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. However, the Inv (16.Lutterbach B. Westendorf J. Linggi B. Isaac S. Seto E. Hiebert S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 651-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (223) Google Scholar) fusion protein could also interact with and regulate other factors. In addition, many proteins are required for cell cycle progression, but few factors actually promote transit through the cell cycle. Therefore, we have explored the functions of AML-1 in regulating the cell cycle. We have enforced the expression of AML-1B and found that it accelerates transit through the G1 phase, whereas transcriptionally inactive forms of AML-1 do not affect the cell cycle. This phenotype is similar to that observed upon overexpression of the D- and E-type cyclins (29.Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

Thus, AML-1 is one of the first transcription factors whose enforced expression shortens the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Parental 32D.3 myeloid progenitor cells were maintained as suspension cultures in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), 2 mml-glutamine (BioWhittaker), 1% penicillin G-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 15 units/mL IL-3. 32D.3 cells stably transfected with AML-1B or derivatives thereof were constructed as described previously (32.Hiebert S.W. Packham G. Strom D.K. Haffner R. Oren M. Zambetti G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6864-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using the sheep metallothionine promoter plasmid pMT-CB6. COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The designation pMT indicates a control neomycin-resistant clonal cell line that was co-selected with the AML-1B-expressing cell lines that are designated pMT-AML-1B. The numbers after each cell line name are the clone (e.g.pMT.11, control cell line number 11). Asynchronously growing cells were washed 2× in PBS and resuspended in media lacking IL-3. At the indicated times after IL-3 removal, 1 × 106 cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of propidium iodide staining solution (0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, 5 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100) and analyzed by flow cytometry as described (33.Strom D. Nip J. Cleveland J.L. Hiebert S.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 59-69PubMed Google Scholar). For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) analysis, asynchronously growing cells were resuspended at 0.5 × 106/ml in media containing IL-3. Cells were pulse-labeled with 10 μm BrdU (Sigma) for 30 min, washed twice to remove BrdU, and resuspended in normal growth media containing IL-3. Aliquots of 2 × 106cells were obtained at the indicated time points following the removal of BrdU. BrdU detection was performed by standard procedures (33.Strom D. Nip J. Cleveland J.L. Hiebert S.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 59-69PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in cold PBS and fixed in cold 70% ethanol for 30 min. Cell pellets were then incubated for 30 min in 4n HCl, washed in 0.1 m borax (pH 9.1) (Sigma), followed by a PBS wash. Cells were then resuspended in 50 μl of PBS-TB (PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 0.5% bovine serum albumin Fraction V (Sigma)), and a 1:150 dilution of an anti-BrdU antibody (BU-33) (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. After two washes in PBS-TB, cells were incubated with a 1:150 dilution of sheep fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse F(ab′)2(Sigma) in PBS-TB for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were again washed twice in PBS-TB, resuspended in PBS containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 1 μg/ml RNase A, and analyzed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For protein analysis, cells were lysed in microextraction buffer, sonicated, and clarified as described previously (34.Hiebert S.W. Chellappan S.P. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 35.Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3384-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Total protein concentration of lysates was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Cell lysate (100 μg) was electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with the indicated antibodies. Immune complexes were detected using the Super Signal detection system (Pierce) and a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma). All proteins were detected using a purified rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the runt homology domain (RHD) of AML-1. Gel mobility shift analysis and antibodies recognizing the AML family of proteins have been described (36.Meyers S. Lenny N. Sun W. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 303-312PubMed Google Scholar). The antisera are available from Calbiochem. Gel mobility shift analysis for E2F was performed as described (35.Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3384-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis for cell cycle regulatory proteins was performed with antisera purchased from Calbiochem. A 1.1-kilobase pair fragment of the murine cyclin D2 promoter was amplified from genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction based on the published sequence (37.Jun D.Y. Kim M.K. Kim I.G. Kim Y.H. Mol. Cell. 1997; 7: 537-543Google Scholar). This fragment was cloned into pGL2 basic, which contains a polylinker sequence upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. The indicated promoter deletions were made using convenient endonuclease restriction sites. pGL2-D2 was co-transfected using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen) with pCMV5-AML-1B orpCMV5-AML-1B(L175D) into COS-7 cells, and luciferase activity was measured 40 h later. Secreted alkaline phosphatase activity expressed from the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter was used as an internal control to correct for transfection efficiency. Regulation of the human thymidine kinase promoter was performed in the same manner but using the renilla luciferase as the reporter gene (Promega). The cyclin D1-luciferase promoter plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Ronald Wisdom (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine) (38.Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The observation that the Inv (16.Lutterbach B. Westendorf J. Linggi B. Isaac S. Seto E. Hiebert S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 651-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (223) Google Scholar) fusion protein inhibited cell cycle progression (28.Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) suggested that AML-1 normally functions in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. To test this possibility, we enforced the expression of AML-1B, the largest AML-1-encoded product, to determine its effects on the cell cycle. The diploid, IL-3-dependent myeloid progenitor cell line 32D.3 was used for this cell cycle analysis because these cells express relatively low levels of AML-1B. We established 32D.3 cell lines expressing AML-1B from the zinc-inducible sheep metallothionine promoter. Single cell clones expressing AML-1B were identified from three separate parental populations by immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for AML-1 (Fig. 1). As a control for later experiments, we also selected clonal cell lines that did not express AML-1B (labeled pMT in later figures). In addition, we isolated cell lines that expressed mutant AML-1B proteins. AML-L175D contains a single amino acid change within the DNA binding domain (also known as the runt homology domain or RHD) that disrupts DNA binding (leucine 175 changed to aspartic acid, labeled L175D, Fig. 1) (39.Lenny N. Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1761-1769PubMed Google Scholar), whereas AML-1a lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain (AML-1a.3, Fig. 1). Although the metallothionine promoter was used, high levels of protein expression were found in the absence of zinc. To avoid complications in the cell cycle experiments, metal induction was not used. Cell lines with higher basal expression were used for further analysis (e.g. lines 7 and 28). To compare the rates of cell cycle progression of these cell lines, DNA content analysis was performed. Enforced expression of AML-1B appeared to affect the cell cycle, as fewer cells were present in the G1 phase and more cells accumulated in S phase in AML-1B-expressing cells versus a control cell line that was established at the same time (designated pMT, Fig.2 A). The accumulation of AML-1-expressing cells in S phase could be due to a shortening of another cell cycle phase or to a lengthening of S phase. To address this issue, we determined the timing of the cell cycle phases by performing pulse-chase analysis using the nucleotide analogue BrdU. This method avoids the use of cell cycle poisons that grossly disrupt cellular morphology and physiology. A 30-min pulse of BrdU was followed over a 24-h chase period by flow cytometry using an anti-BrdU antibody to quantitate BrdU incorporation and propidium iodide staining of DNA to measure DNA content (Fig. 2, B and C). By plotting BrdU incorporation versus DNA content we were able to observe both BrdU labeled (Fig. 2 B, panel pMT.3, 0 Hour area above the horizontal line, and see arrows in Fig. 2 C) and unlabeled cells (Fig. 2 B, panel pMT.3, 0 Hour area below the horizontal line and areas highlighted by arrowheads in Fig. 2 C) traversing the cell cycle during the chase period. This method of analysis gives rise to a characteristic horseshoe-shaped plot (Fig. 2 B,panel pMT.3, 0 Hour). During the 30-min labeling period, all cells that were synthesizing DNA incorporated BrdU (Fig. 2 B, panel pMT.3, O Hour, + BrdU). This includes cells at the G1to S phase transition that appear to have a 2 n DNA content, and cells at the S to G2 phase transition that have a 4 n DNA content (Fig. 2 B, panel pMT.3, 0 Hour). To measure the time required for cells to traverse the G2/M and G1 phases, we measured cells re-entering the S phase from 8 h to 16 h after labeling. Cells that were labeled with BrdU and that were re-entering the S phase had divided and contained one-half the levels of BrdU of undivided cells. This difference ensured that we were observing cycling cells (note that the plots in Fig. 2, B and C use a logarithmic scale, making this 2-fold shift small). To measure cells that were clearly in S phase versus those cells that had just begun to synthesize DNA, the gate was set to quantitate the central portion of the S phase plot. This area is equivalent to the area between the unlabeled G1 and G2/M phase cells immediately after the labeling (below the horizontal line and labeled -BrdU at 0 Hour, Fig.2 B). At 8 to 9 h post-BrdU labeling, labeled cells had exited S phase and divided as judged by a reduction in fluoresence intensity, and the first cells were beginning to re-enter S phase (Fig. 2, Band C). By 10 h after labeling, only 17% of control 32D.3 cells containing BrdU were present in early S phase (Fig.2 B, pMT.3, 10 Hour). By 12 h after BrdU labeling, 30% of cells that were originally in S phase had traversed G2/M and G1 and were re-entering S phase (Fig. 2 B, pMT.3, 12 Hour). In addition, 10 h and 12 h after labeling with BrdU, most of the unlabeled cells that were initially in the G1 and G2/M phases had moved into the S phase and the G1 phase, respectively (e.g. Fig. 2 B, compare pMT.3 0 Hour and 10 Hour, and note areas marked by arrowheads in Fig. 2 C). Cells expressing E2F-1 and its co-factor DP-1 showed similar cell cycle profiles (38% S phase 12 h post-BrdU labeling; Fig.2 B, pMAM-Neo-E2F-1.1/DP-1.2, and see Hiebertet al. (32.Hiebert S.W. Packham G. Strom D.K. Haffner R. Oren M. Zambetti G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6864-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)). When AML-1B-expressing cells were assayed, nearly twice as many BrdU-labeled cells expressing AML-1B were re-entering S phase 10 h after labeling as control cells (34% and 30% versus 17% for control cells; Fig. 2 B compare panels pMT-AML-1B.7 and pMT-AML-1B.28 with pMT.3 at 10 h). At 12-h post-labeling, nearly 50% more AML-1B-expressing cells were in mid-S phase (45% and 54% S-phase,pMT-AML-1B.7 and pMT-AML-1B.28, respectively; Fig. 2 B). In addition, at the 12-h time point, the unlabeled AML-1B-expressing cells showed accelerated cell cycle kinetics (Fig.2 B; note also the unlabeled cells in the 9- and 13-hpanels marked with arrowheads in Fig.2 C). 12–13 h after labeling the AML-1B-expressing cells had exited the G1 phase and were in late S phase (Fig. 2,B and C) (note the reduction in the number of cells in early S phase of the unlabeled cell portions of the plots of cells expressing AML-1B as compared with control and E2F-1-expressing cell plots (Fig. 2 B, and marked with bracketsFig. 2 C)). Similar results were obtained from more than 10 independently isolated single cell clones that were selected from three different parental populations of 32D.3 cells. The percentages of cells entering S phase 10 or 11 h after BrdU labeling from three different experiments are shown in TableI. Each AML-1B-expressing cell line entered S phase faster than the control cell lines (Fig. 2 Band Table I).Table ICell cycle analysis of AML-1B overexpressing 32D.3 cellsCell linesaCell lines used were 32D.3 clones containing either vector alone (pMT) or vector containing an AML-1B insert (1B).Cells in S phasebShown are the percentage of cells in S phase at the indicated time (10 or 11 h) after BrdU-labeling.%10-h time point pMT.1016 1B.538 1B.747 1B.2744 1B.284611-h time point pMT.438 pMT.1037 1B.258 1B.349 1B.663 1B.286110-h time point pMT.327 pMT.426 1B.648 1B.749 1B.3240 1B.3648 1B.5041Shown are the results of three separate BrdU-labeling experiments listed as percentage of BrdU-labeled cells in S phase at indicated times following BrdU pulse-labeling.

Open table in a new tab Shown are the results of three separate BrdU-labeling experiments listed as percentage of BrdU-labeled cells in S phase at indicated times following BrdU pulse-labeling. Experiments were performed exactly as described in the legend to Fig. 2 B. The results of DNA content analysis (Fig. 2 A) and BrdU analysis of S phase suggested that AML-1B caused accelerated entry into S phase. In principle, this could be due to a shortening of the G1 or the G2/M phases. However, DNA content analysis indicated that the total number of AML 1B-expressing cells in the G2/M phase were similar to control cells, and the number of cells in the G1 phase was reduced, suggesting a shortening of the G1 but not G2/M phases (Fig.2 A). To extend this result and to directly determine whether the G2/M phase was shortened by AML-1B expression, we used BrdU pulse-chase analysis to determine the time required to traverse G2/M (Fig. 3 and TableII). This was accomplished by measuring the time required for the first BrdU-labeled cells (those cells in late S phase at the time of labeling) to traverse G2/M and enter the G1 phase. Both control G418-resistant cells (pMT) and AML-1B-expressing cells passed through the G2/M phase and began entering the G1 phase after 3–4 h (Fig. 3 and TableII). Analysis of further time points confirmed this result. We conclude that enforced expression of AML-1B does not affect G2/M but shortens the G1 phase, consistent with the ability of an AML-1 inhibitor to arrest cells in the G1 phase (28.Cao W.

The observation that AML-1B-expression accelerated S phase entry in myeloid progenitor cells was unexpected. Cell cycle regulatory transcription factors and oncogenes that act in the G1 phase of the cell cycle such as E2F-1 and c-Myc do not alter the timing of the cell cycle (32.Hiebert S.W. Packham G.

However, both E2F-1 and c-Myc can induce S phase progression of 32D.3 cells in the absence of IL-3 (32.Hiebert S.W. Packham G. Strom D.K. Haffner R. Oren M. Zambetti G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6864-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 33.Strom D. Nip J. Cleveland J.L. Hiebert S.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 59-69PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether AML-1B could also induce continued cell cycle progression in the absence of cytokine. Cell lines were cultured in media lacking IL-3 for 12 h, and cell cycle progression was measured using propidium iodide staining to determine their DNA content. E2F-1-expressing cells displayed no apparent cell cycle defects in the presence of IL-3 (Fig.4). In the absence of IL-3, E2F-1 induced continued S phase entry in the absence of the cytokine (Fig. 4). By contrast, there were fewer cells expressing AML-1B in the G1 phase and more cells in S-phase in the presence of IL-3, but in the absence of IL-3 these cells accumulated in the G1 phase (Fig. 4). Thus, AML-1B requires cooperating proliferative signals from IL-3 to accelerate S phase entry and affect the cell cycle. One of the major targets for regulation of cell cycle progression is the Rb pathway (41.Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To determine whether this pathway was affected either directly or indirectly by AML-1B expression, we measured the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (cdk2), cdk4, cyclin D2, and E2F. Cell lysates were prepared from control and AML-1B-expressing cells, and antibodies to each of these proteins were used to probe immunoblots to determine their levels. Each cell line expressing AML-1B contained more cdk2, slightly elevated cdk4, and substantially more cyclin D2 (Fig.5 A). Consistent with this observation, the levels of histone H1 kinase activity present in cdk2 immunoprecipitates was 2–3-fold higher in the AML-1B-expressing cells (data not shown). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis indicated that AML-1B-expressing cells also contained more overall E2F DNA binding activity relative to control cells, with most of this increase corresponding to the “free” or active form of E2F (Fig.5 B). This was in contrast to Sp1 DNA binding activity that did not change upon AML-1B expression (Sp1, Fig. 5 B). The shortening of the G1 phase and the higher levels of cyclin D2 suggested that AML-1 might activate key cell cycle regulatory genes that affect cell cycle progression. Therefore, we scanned the promoters for the G1 cyclins and found several AML-1 binding sites in the cyclin D2 promoter. To determine whether AML-1 could activate the cyclin D2 promoter, we used this promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene in transient assays. In COS-7 cells, the cyclin D2 promoter was activated by wild-type AML-1B but not by an AML-1B containing a point mutation that ablates DNA binding (L175D, changing residue 175 from leucine to aspartic acid, Fig.6 A). Expression from the internal control promoter was unaffected by AML-1B (data not shown, but used to correct for transfection efficiency). Promoter deletion analysis indicated that 5′ promoter sequences containing several potential and known AML-1 binding sites were required for full AML-1B-dependent transactivation, whereas a perfect AML-1 binding site 3′ to the first transcriptional start site was not sufficient for full activation (Fig. 6 B). The caveat in this analysis is that cyclin D2 is regulated during the cell cycle. Thus, the activation observed with AML-1B could be indirect if AML-1B was stimulating cell cycle progression. Therefore, we compared the ability of AML-1B to activate the cyclin D2 promoter with other cell cycle regulated promoters. Although the cyclin D2 promoter was activated to a greater extent than the cyclin D1 or human thymidine kinase promoter (which are not known to contain AML-1 binding sites), these promoters were also activated by AML-1B (Fig. 6 C). Once again, the internal control was unaffected by AML 1B (data not shown). Because we could not determine whether AML-1B directly activated cell cycle regulatory promoters, we probed the mechanism of AML-1B cell cycle control by asking whether expression of AML-1a, which lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain (3.Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Kagoshima H. Inuzuka M. Lu J. Satake M. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6859-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 42.Zeng C. van Wijnen A.J.

A. 1997; 94: 6746-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), or AML-1B(L175D) could affect cell cycle progression. The clonal 32D.3 cell lines expressing AML-1a or AML-1B(L175D) (Fig. 1 and7 A) were compared with control and AML-1B-expressing cells using BrdU pulse-chase analysis (Fig.7 B). Once again, the AML-1B-expressing cells entered S phase with accelerated kinetics as compared with G418-resistant control cells. Cells expressing either AML-1a or AML-1B(L175D) did not show gross alterations in the timing of S-phase entry, indicating that both the C-terminal domain and DNA binding activity are required for AML-1B cell cycle functions. We conclude that AML-1B shortens the G1 phase by regulating the expression of downstream target genes. AML-1 is unusual in that it is an oncogene, yet it is disrupted by chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia. We observed that enforced expression of AML-1B induced accelerated S phase entry (Figs. 2 and 7and Table I). Cultures of cells expressing AML-1B had fewer cells in the G1 phase and more cells in S phase (Fig. 2). The time needed to traverse G2/M remained constant in these cells (Fig. 3, Table II), which is consistent with expression of AML-1B accelerating transit through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Thus, AML-1B is one of the first transcription factors described that shortens the length of the G1 phase of the mammalian cell cycle. Furthermore, this work points toward a cell cycle mechanism for the ability of AML-1 to transform cells. The ability of AML-1B to alter the cell cycle led us to examine the promoters of known components of the G1 phase cell cycle control machinery to determine whether any of these genes could be direct targets of AML-1B. We found perfect AML-1B binding sites in the p21Waf1/Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor promoter (16.Lutterbach B. Westendorf J. Linggi B. Isaac S. Seto E. Hiebert S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 651-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 43.Lutterbach B. Westendorf J.J. Linggi B. Patten A. Mariko M. Davie J. Huynh K. Bardwell V. Lavinisky R.

In AML-1B-expressing cells, endogenous p21Waf1/Cip1 protein levels were slightly elevated (approximately 2–3-fold, data not shown). Recent work indicates that p21Waf1/Cip1 can both inhibit cdk activity and promote the assembly of cyclin:cyclin-dependent kinase complexes (44.Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Both the p21Waf1/Cip1 and cyclin D2 promoters can be regulated by AML-1B (Fig. 6, data not shown, and Refs. 16.Lutterbach B. Westendorf J. Linggi B. Isaac S. Seto E. Hiebert S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7176-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), consistent with the requirement of AML-1B transcriptional activation for the cell cycle phenotype (Fig. 7). However, because AML-1B accelerates the cell cycle, we could not definitively determine whether up-regulation of these genes is directly responsible for the shortening of the G1 phase or whether the levels of these proteins (or the activation of their promoters) are elevated because the cells are cycling faster. Initially, we observed faster growth of the AML-1B-expressing cells, suggesting that these cells had not compensated for the acceleration of the G1 phase and were cycling faster. However, as these lines were maintained in culture, this phenotype was lost. It is likely that these cells eventually compensated for the shortening of G1 by lengthening the S phase, as has been observed for cells overexpressing the G1 cyclins (29.Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A.

Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). We also found that the cell culture conditions were critical for revealing the AML-1B-cell cycle phenotype. For instance, at high cell densities, the shortening of G1 was lost (data not shown), suggesting density-dependent effects. The mechanisms behind these phenotypes will require further investigation. Transcription factors such as E2F-1 and c-Myc are capable of affecting cellular proliferation, but enforced expression of these factors did not affect the timing of the 32D.3 cell cycle (32.Hiebert S.W.

Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the phenotype of enforced AML-1B expression is more similar to that of overexpression of the G1 cyclins, accelerating the G1 phase without affecting the entry to or exit from quiescence (29.Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 30.Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M.

Although stimulation of cyclin D2 or p21Waf1/Cip1 expression may contribute to AML-1B-mediated G1 phase control, these genes are unlikely to be the only mediators of this phenotype. We are actively searching for other cell cycle control genes that may contribute to AML-1-cell cycle control.

This is supported by the long-standing observation that one of the first visible stages of prostate and mammary involution is the disruption of interepithelial adhesion prior to the onset of apoptosis. In a previous study addressing this aspect of involution, we acquired compelling evidence indicating that the disruption of E-cadherin-dependent adhesion initiates apoptotic programs during prostate and mammary involution. In cultured prostate and mammary epithelial cells, inhibition of E-cadherin-dependent aggregation resulted in cell death following apoptotic stimuli. Loss of cell-cell adhesion in the nonaggregated population appeared to result from the rapid truncation within the cytosolic domain of the mature, 120-kDa species of E-cadherin (E-cad120). Immunoprecipitations from cell culture and involuting mammary gland demonstrated that this truncation removed the β-catenin binding domain from the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin, resulting in a non-β-catenin binding, membrane-bound 97-kDa species (E-cad97) and a free cytoplasmic 35-kDa form (E-cad35) that is bound to β-catenin. Examination of E-cadherin expression and cellular distribution during prostate and mammary involution revealed a dramatic reduction in junctional membrane staining that correlated with a similar reduction in E-cad120 and accumulation of E-cad97 and E-cad35. The observation that E-cadherin was truncated during involution suggested that hormone depletion activated the same apoptotic pathway in vivo as observed in vitro. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that truncation of E-cadherin results in the loss of β-catenin binding and cellular dissociation that may signal epithelial apoptosis during prostate and mammary involution. Thus, E-cadherin may be central to homeostatic regulation in these tissues by coordinating adhesion-dependent survival and dissociation-induced apoptosis.

Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). In secretory tissues, such as that of the prostate gland and mammary gland, interepithelial membrane adhesion is dependent on the homophilic interaction of E-cadherin (1.Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 2.Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 307-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Such homophilic cell-cell adhesion results in the formation of desmosomes and adherens junctions that are required for tissue morphogenesis and the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype (1.Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). Cadherins share a common molecular structure; their ectodomain consists of five tandem repeated units of 110 amino acids each that share structural similarities to the immunoglobulin variable-like domain (3.Tamura K. Shan W-S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies indicate that the homophilic binding between cadherins occurs through interactions at the amino terminus, with binding specificity being confined within the first 113 amino-terminal residues of domain 1 (4.Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The intracellular domain of E-cadherin is linked to the actin cytoskeleton through its interaction with the cytoplasmic adapter proteins β-catenin, α-catenin, and γ-catenin (plakoglobin) (5.Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 6.Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R.

The β-catenin binding domain of E-cadherin has been mapped to the residues 815–839 in the cytoplasmic tail, which are required for the adhesive function of the molecule (8.Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Although central to cell-cell adhesion, E-cadherin has also been implicated in physiologic roles beyond the mechanical interconnection of cells. Recent evidence suggests that E-cadherin may also be associated with regulatory pathways involved in various aspects of cell fate including developmental decisions, cellular differentiation, and cell survival (8.Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 9.Peifer M. Science. 1997; 275: 1752-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 10.Day M.L.

Both the prostate and lactating mammary gland are complex tissues with specialized secretory functions that undergo involution upon removal of the appropriate trophic hormones (11.Tenniswood M.P. Guenette R.S. Lakins J. Mooibroek M. Wong P. Welsh J.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Following depletion of androgenic steroids, the prostate gland will undergo dramatic involution resulting from apoptotic death of the luminal epithelium. Likewise, involution following weaning also results from extensive apoptotic cell death in the mammary gland (12.Walker N.I. Bennett R.E. Kerr J.F. Am. J. Anat. 1989; 185: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, homeostatic balance between cell death and cell survival is critically dependent on hormone levels; however, the precise mechanism of hormone-induced cell death in these tissues is still unknown. A potential target of hormone action during involution may be the intercellular junction of the adjacent secretory epithelium. This is supported by the observation that an early visible indication of prostate and mammary involution is the disruption of interepithelial adhesion (11.Tenniswood M.P. Guenette R.S. Lakins J. Mooibroek M. Wong P. Welsh J.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 13.Potter S.W. Gaza G. Morris J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, loss of lateral adhesion may be involved in an apoptotic response in these tissues destined for involution. Previous studies have demonstrated that anchorage-dependent epithelium will undergo apoptosis following loss of integrin contact with the ECM1 (reviewed in Refs. 14.Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar and 15.St. Croix B. Kerbel R.S. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Likewise loss of integrin contact with the ECM will induce apoptosis of prostate and mammary epithelial cells (17.Day M.L.

It has been suggested that just as integrins function to mediate cell-ECM interactions in anchorage-dependent survival, cadherins might also act in such a capacity, possessing a direct functional role in the regulation of adhesion-dependent survival. This has now been demonstrated in several studies in which intercellular adhesion-dependent survival is uniquely regulated through the E-cadherin cell-adhesion system (10.Day M.L.

These studies showed that homophilic binding of cadherin molecules on adjacent cells may transduce apoptotic suppressive signals and that the specific disruption of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion was required for apoptosis to occur.

Historically, PKC activity has been associated with the regulation of cell growth and differentiation; however, recent studies have demonstrated that the PKC family may regulate apoptotic programs as well (31.Day M.L.

A potential target of PKC action, with important ramifications in intercellular contact and tissue homeostasis, is E-cadherin (33.Winkel G.K. Ferguson J.E. Takeichi M. Nuccitelli R. Dev.

We have recently demonstrated that inducible overexpression of the PKC α isozyme (PKCα) or treatment with the PKC activator, TPA, initiated an E-cadherin dependent program of cellular aggregation that was required for the survival of mammary and prostate epithelial cells (10.Day M.L. Zhao X Vallorosi C.J. Putzi M. Powell C.T. Lin C. Day K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9656-9664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38.Zhao X. Gschwend J.E. Powell C.T.

In the present study, we have examined a mechanism by which E-cadherin is rapidly truncated in the cytosolic domain. Co-immunoprecipitations from cell culture and involuting mammary gland demonstrated that this truncation removed the β-catenin binding domain from the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin, resulting in a non-β-catenin binding, membrane-bound 97-kDa species (E-cad97) and a free cytoplasmic 35-kDa form (E-cad35) that complexes with β-catenin. Examination of E-cadherin expression and cellular distribution during prostate and mammary involution revealed a dramatic reduction in junctional membrane staining that correlated with a similar reduction in E-cad120 and accumulation of E-cad97 and E-cad35. Coupled with the observation that E-cad97 and E-cad35accumulated during involution suggested that hormone depletion signaled the same apoptotic pathway in vivo as observed in vitro. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that truncation of E-cadherin results in the loss of β-catenin binding and cellular dissociation that may signal epithelial apoptosis during prostate and mammary involution. E-cadherin may then play a predominant role in the regulation of prostate and mammary homeostasis by coordinating adhesion-dependent survival and dissociation-induced apoptosis. The cell line LNCaP (ATCC) was propagated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and subcultured weekly. The SUM185 mammary epithelial cell line (gift of Dr. Stephen P. Ethier) was grown as described (10.Day M.L. Zhao X Vallorosi C.J. Putzi M. Powell C.T. Lin C. Day K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9656-9664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cell viability was followed by trypan blue exclusion (Life Technologies, Inc.) or, by the colorimetric MTS assay (Promega). Chemicals for PKC studies, staurosporine and TPA (LC Laboratories; S-8451, P-1680, respectively), were dissolved in 100% ethanol, aliquotted, and stored at −20 °C. TPA was used at a final concentration of 10 nm. Staurosporine was used at 50-nm concentration as a pretreatment 90 min prior to PKC activation. For treatment with tunicamycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1.3 × 106 LNCaP cells were plated in 100-mm2 dishes for 48 h. Tunicamycin (1.5 μg/ml) was added to the cells 8 h prior to TPA treatment. To prepare protein lysates from tissue culture cells and frozen prostate and mammary tissues, the following buffer was added at the time of lysis; 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 40 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μm orthovanidate. The cells were allowed to lyse for 1 h (on ice), lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected and quantitated. All proteins were quantified using a Bradford assay, separated by 6, 10, or 12% Tris-glycine precast NOVEX gels and analyzed using the NOVEX and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) detection systems as described previously (38.Zhao X.

Note that for 10 and 12% gels, the transfer or blotting time was increased to 60 min. For experiments involving Western analysis of detergent-extracted membranes, cells were lysed as described above. Following incubation on ice, the cell lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants decanted. The insoluble, precipitated pellet was then washed with Tris-buffered saline and centrifuged again. The insoluble, washed membrane pellet was re-extracted with the lysate buffer (described above) containing 0.06% Triton X-114 (Sigma) and incubated for 1 h on ice. Following centrifugation, the supernatants were quantitated and analyzed by Western blot. Antibodies utilized for the detection of 120- and 97-kDa E-cadherin were HECD-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories) SC7870 (Santa Cruz) and E-9 (39.Wheelock M.J. Buck C.A. Bechtol K.B. Damsky C.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 34: 187-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). For the detection of 120- and 35-kDa E-cadherin, the following antibodies were employed: SC1499 (Santa Cruz), 4A2 (40.Nieman M.T. Kim J.B. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and E2 (gift of Dr. W. James Nelson). The anti-E-cadherin C20820 (Transduction Laboratories) was employed for the rat tissue staining. For β-catenin immunoprecipitations and Western blots, the CAT-5H10 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used. The appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-goat, anti-mouse, or anti-rat secondary antibodies were obtained from Amresco and Jackson Immuno Research Labs. Inc. LNCaP, MCF-7 cells, and rat prostate and breast tissue lysates were prepared and quantitated as described above. For the immunoprecipitation reactions, the following lysate buffer was used: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm calcium chloride, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 40 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μmorthovanidate. The lysates were precleared with the appropriate Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories) conjugated with either protein A (for rabbit/goat antibodies) or protein G (for mouse/rat antibodies) prior to the immunoprecipitation reactions. (Note that all beads were diluted with an equal volume of Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl) with 2.5% milk prior to use (termed blocked beads).) Following the preclearing step, lysates were aliquotted into microcentrifuge tubes, where 1 mg of protein was used per immunoprecipitation reaction for LNCaP and SUM 185 and 3 mg of protein was used per immunoprecipitation reaction with prostate and breast tissues. For each immunoprecipitation reaction, the volumes were equalized to 500 μl with lysis buffer, 5 μg of primary antibody was added, and the reaction was carried out at 4 °C overnight, rotating end over end. The next day, the corresponding protein A- or protein G-conjugated Sepharose beads were added (120 μl of blocked beads/immunoprecipitation reaction), and this secondary reaction was allowed to continue mixing end over end for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted (microcentrifuge, 4 °C at 9000 rpm for 5 min) and washed four times with 1 ml of lysate buffer (+ CaCl2 and protease inhibitors). Finally, 40 μl of 2× reducing sample buffer was added to each pellet (washed beads), and samples were then heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Supernatants were then loaded onto gels for Western analysis. Male, 250-g Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were castrated at the indicated times, the ventral prostates were excised and fixed (or frozen), and histology was performed. Frozen tissue sections (3 μm) from the castrated rats were fixed in 100% methanol and stained with the rat anti-E-cadherin antibody (Transduction Laboratories C20820) at 1:40,000 dilution. Nursing Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained with litters. The mothers were allowed to nurse their pups for 3–4 weeks. The pups were taken from the mothers at day 0 (lactating) and the involuting breast tissue was harvested each day following weaning for 8 days. The excised tissue was fixed and embedded in paraffin or frozen, and the resulting sections (3 μ) were stained with the 4A2 antibody at 1:800 dilution. For both prostate and mammary sections, the secondary antibody was a biotinylated horse anti-mouse (Vector Labs BA-2001) diluted 1:200 and conjugated with peroxidase (brown). The sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. In a previous study we demonstrated that, in subconfluent cultures of prostate and mammary epithelial cells, overexpression and activation of PKCα or treatment with the phorbol ester, TPA, resulted in two populations: 1) surviving aggregated cells and 2) dissociated apoptotic cells (10.Day M.L.

Survival of the aggregated population required E-cadherin-mediated adhesion. Because only aggregated cells survived, we postulated that some perturbation to the cell-cell adhesion mechanism might signal apoptosis in the nonaggregated population. To investigate this further, we examined the expression of E-cadherin protein in both prostate and mammary epithelial cells following PKC activation. Immunoblot analysis revealed strong expression of full-length E-cad120 following PKC activation in both the LNCaP (prostate) and SUM185 (mammary) cell lines (Fig. 1). The maximum accumulation of E-cad120 at 6 h coincided precisely with the onset of cellular aggregation (10.Day M.L. Zhao X Vallorosi C.J. Putzi M. Powell C.T. Lin C. Day K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9656-9664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Concurrent with induction of E-cad120 was the rapid accumulation of a novel 97-kDa form of E-cadherin (E-cad97). E-cad97 was detectable by 6 h following PKC activation and increased steadily over the next 42 h, preceding significant cell death by 18 h. Staurosporine, a potent, nonspecific catalytic inhibitor of protein kinase C (41.Huang K.P. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 425-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), suppressed apoptosis and the generation of E-cad97 (Fig. 1). To determine whether E-cad97 was uniquely associated with the nonaggregated apoptotic population, we examined the expression of E-cad120 and E-cad97 in both the aggregated and nonaggregated cells. Because of decreased anchorage, the nonaggregated cells were separated from aggregated cells by gentle agitation as early as 12 h following TPA treatment. We found that E-cad97was strongly expressed in this nonaggregated population, which was approximately 50% apoptotic by 24 h, whereas very little expression of E-cad97 could be detected in the aggregated, surviving population (Fig. 2). Comparison of viability and E-cadherin expression at the 12- and 24-h time points demonstrated that the accumulation of E-cad97 preceded the onset of cell death. We analyzed expression of E-cadherin proteins in involuting rat prostate and mammary glands to determine whether E-cadherin was truncated in response to reduced hormone levels in vivo. Prostate and mammary involution involves extensive regression of the ductal architecture to an atrophic state following castration or weaning, respectively (11.Tenniswood M.P. Guenette R.S. Lakins J. Mooibroek M. Wong P. Welsh J.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12.Walker N.I. Bennett R.E. Kerr J.F. Am. J.

The predominance of apoptotic cells in prostatic ducts observed 3 to 4 days following castration indicates that regression results from programmed cell death of the luminal epithelium. To determine whether E-cadherin is truncated prior to apoptosis in vivo, we examined expression of E-cadherin in the rat ventral prostate following castration and the rat mammary gland following weaning. The glandular epithelium constitutes approximately 70–90% of the total cell mass. Apoptotic cells begin to appear by day 3 following castration or weaning, where more than 80% of the cells had died by day 7 (42.English H.F. Santen R.J. Issacs J.T. Prostate. 1987; 11: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 43.Guenette, R. S., Horbeil, H. B., Leger, J., Wong, K., Mezl, V., Mooibroek, M., and Tenniswood, M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 12, 47–60Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of E-cadherin protein in the rat ventral prostate following castration revealed a dramatic reduction of E-cad120 expression by 24 h, which is the time E-cad97 begins to appear (Fig.3 A). Although slightly delayed, the conversion of E-cad120 to E-cad97was observed during mammary involution as well (Fig. 3 A). E-cad97 from both involuting prostate gland and mammary gland migrated precisely with E-cad97 observed in the LNCaP and SUM185 cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that E-cadherin was localized exclusively in the junctional membranes of the luminal epithelium in the ventral prostate gland and mammary gland of untreated rats (Fig. 3 B, a and c). In comparison, glands from the 48-h castrates and the 48-h weaned females exhibited dramatic reductions in E-cadherin membrane staining (Fig.3 B, b and d), which coincided precisely with the reduction of E-cad120 observed by immunoblot analysis. In a previous study, we demonstrated by TUNEL analysis (which detects fragmented DNA) that apoptotic nuclei were prominent throughout the luminal epithelium in the 72-h castrates and only in cells that had lost E-cadherin staining in the junctional membrane (10.Day M.L. Zhao X Vallorosi C.J. Putzi M. Powell C.T. Lin C. Day K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9656-9664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To specifically map the truncation of E-cad120, we employed a variety of region- and peptide-specific antibodies in immunoblot analysis of TPA-treated LNCaP lysates. The epitopes of these antibodies are schematically depicted in Fig.4 A. As shown in thediagram, the monoclonal antibodies HECD-1 (44.Shimoyama Y. Hirohashi S. Hirano S. Noguchi M. Shimosato Y. Takeichi M. Abe O. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2128-2133PubMed Google Scholar), E9 (39.Wheelock M.J. Buck C.A. Bechtol K.B. Damsky C.H. J. Cell.

Oncol. 1994; 5: 1049-1057PubMed Google Scholar), raised against various regions of the extracellular domain, recognize both E-cad120 and E-cad97(Fig. 4 B). However, antibodies 4A2, E2 (47.Marrs J.A. Napolitano E.W. Murphy-Erdosh C. Mays R.W. Reichardt L.F. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and SC-1499 (48.Stappert J. Kemler R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which are specific for various cytosolic epitopes, recognize only E-cad120. We predicted that a single cleavage event in this region would result in the accumulation of two peptides: the 97-kDa species and a smaller peptide with a molecular mass of 25–35 kDa. When the cytosolic-specific antibodies (Fig. 4 B, d–f) were used in immunoblots of LNCaP lysates resolved on 12% acrylamide gels, we detected a PKC-inducible 35-kDa fragment of E-cadherin, which we have designated E-cad35 (Fig. 4 C). Considering the molecular masses of the two fragments and the antibody mapping suggests that E-cad120 was truncated proximal to the transmembrane domain in the cytosolic domain. We predicted that a clip in this region would result in membrane-bound 97-kDa fragment and free cytosolic 35-kDa fragment. To confirm the cellular location of these peptides, we addressed whether E-cad97 and E-cad35 were associated with the cell membrane. E-cad97 could only be detected in the pelleted fraction of PKC activated cells and not in the supernatant, suggesting membrane localization of E-cad97. However, when we specifically examined the membrane using a second Triton X-114 phase separation of cellular proteins, we found that E-cad97 and E-cad120 were detected in the Triton X-114 fraction and not in the aqueous fraction (Fig. 5). Examination of the cytosolic fraction revealed only E-cad35.Figure"

ARFs are GTPases that function as molecular switches by alternation between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. Inactivation of ARF-GTP requires interaction with a GTPase-activating protein that accelerates hydrolysis of bound GTP (9.Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol.

Mansour M. Pohajdak B. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1993; 63: 42-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The B2-1 gene product cytohesin-1 is a 47-kDa protein found at high levels in natural killer and cytotoxic T-cells and at very low levels in monocytes and several cultured cell lines (16.Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Part of its deduced amino acid sequence resembles that of the so-called Sec7 domain of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae Sec7 protein (Sec7p), which had been identified as a pivotal component in Golgi protein transport (17.Franzusoff A. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2695-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Cytohesin-1 was independently isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the intracellular domain of integrin β2 as a bait and appears to be involved in inside-out signaling via an integrin cytoplasmic domain (16.Kolanus W.

GEP activity of the Sec7 domain of yeast Sec7p was inhibited by brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal fatty acid metabolite that reversibly alters Golgi structure and function, suggesting that the 200-amino acid Sec7 domain contains both the inhibitory and the catalytic sites (24.Sata M.

Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), have significant identity with cytohesin-1 in deduced amino acid sequences (∼90%). Apparently orthologous rat cDNA sequences (designated msec7–1, -2, and -3) have also been published (26.Telemenakis I. Benseler F. Stenius K. Südhof T.C. Brose N. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 143-149PubMed Google Scholar). To simplify nomenclature, we refer to this family of proteins as cytohesins, because the cDNA sequence of cytohesin-1 (B2-1) was the first published (14.Liu L. Pohajdak B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of ARNO (19.Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and cytohesin-2 differ only in the presence or absence of a single glycine in the PH domain. Here, we demonstrate the existence of two mRNA isoforms that differ in the same way for each of the three known cytohesins. We describe, in addition, the cDNA and gene structures of cytohesin-4, for which only one mRNA could be detected. To begin to elucidate the regulatory mechanism(s) that control the single glycine insertion/deletion in the PH domain, we also partially characterized the cytohesin-1 gene. Cytohesin-1 and cytohesin-4, which differ most among the cytohesins, have similar gene structures within the coding region, suggesting that the family may have arisen by gene duplication. Restriction enzymes and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products; SeaKem-agarose was from FMC Bioproducts; BFA was from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI); phosphatidylserine and imidazole were from Sigma. An Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer was used for automated sequencing. Cell lines THP-1, Meg01, MOLT4, KG-1a, ARH-77, Raji, K562, and J774A.1 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). KG-1a cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All other lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as described for KG-la cells. Buffy coats were collected from heparinized venous blood of healthy donors. Red cells were lysed, and white cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with the following cell surface markers: anti-CD15-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), anti-CD33-phycoerythrin (PE), anti-CD2-FITC, anti-CD19-PE, anti-CD4-FITC, anti-CD8-PE (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL), and anti-CD3-PerCP (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Cells were sorted on a Beckman Coulter EPICS-ELITE ESP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). Lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes were first defined by size and granularity (forward and side scatter). Additional sort gates based on fluorescent cell surface markers included CD15+for granulocytes, CD33+ for monocytes, CD2+ for lymphocyte T/NK, and CD19+ for B lymphocytes. T lymphocytes were sorted based on dual positive staining with CD3+/CD4+ for the helper/inducer subset and with CD3+/CD8+ for the cytotoxic/suppressor subsets. Purity of each cell population was greater than 98%. A human brain frontal cortex cDNA library (∼5 × 107 plaque-forming units), constructed in Lambda Zap II vector (Stratagene), was screened using a 345-bp DNA fragment (nucleotides 262–606, when +1 = A of the translation initiation codon of B2-1 cDNA) generated by PCR (35 cycles of 94 °C/1 min, 45 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/1 min). The template was 20 ng of cloned B2-1 cDNA, and primers were B2-1-S-1 (5′-AAGGATGAGATAGCAGAA-3′) and B2-1-AS-1 (5′-TCAGTGAACTCATGCAG-3′). Samples (50 ng) of the products were labeled using a Random Primer DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After hybridization at 55 °C for 16 h in 6× SSC, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 0.4% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution containing denatured salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml) and radiolabeled probe (2 × 107 cpm/ml), the final wash was done with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 20 min. One of 21 positive clones was identical to ARNO3 (25.Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S. Monier S. Goud B. Chardin P. Chavrier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For subsequent library screening, another 348-bp DNA probe (nucleotides +274 to +621, when A = +1 of the translation initiation codon of ARNO3 cDNA), which includes the Sec7 domain of ARNO3, was generated by PCR amplification (35 cycles of 94 °C/1 min, 45 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/1 min) using 20 ng of the cloned ARNO3 plasmid DNA as template with primers ARNO3-S-1 (5′-GACCTGCTACAGAGTTCCCCAGAAGAC-3′) and ARNO3-AS-1 (5′-GTTGTGGAGGCTGGT GTTGAGCAT-3′). The product was purified from 1% agarose gel using a QIAEXII Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and a sample (50 ng) was radiolabeled (2 × 107 cpm/ml) using a Random Primer DNA labeling kit. The same filters that had been screened with the B2-1 probe were hybridized with the ARNO3 cDNA at 55 °C for 16 h with 6× SSC, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 0.4% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution containing denatured salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml), followed by a final wash at 37 °C with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The human genomic library EMBL-3 SP6/T7 (CLONTECH) was screened using a ∼1.2-kb DNA fragment including sequence of human cytohesin-1 cDNA (nucleotides +1 to +1194) as radiolabeled probe. Recombinants were grown on agar plates, and replica filters were hybridized with the probe at 42 °C for 16 h in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl. Final washes were at 47 °C for 15 min with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Cloned phage DNA was digested withEcoRI or EcoRI plus SalI, transferred to a nylon filter, and hybridized with the ∼1.2-kb cytohesin-1 cDNA. Genomic fragments that hybridized were isolated and subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) for sequencing. DNA fragments that included the codon for the variable single glycine residue in the PH domain were amplified. Cytohesin-1 DNA fragments (282 or 279 bp) were amplified using primers Cyto-1–8-S (5′-ATGAACCGAGGCATCAATGATGGG-3′) and Cyto-1–11-AS (5′-TCCCGGATACTCAGATTCTCTAAAG-3′). Cytohesin-2 DNA fragments (350 or 347 bp) were amplified using primers, Cyto-2–8-S (5′-CACAATCCCAATGTCCGGGACAAGC-3′) and Cyto-2–11-AS (5′-TCGTCCACCTCTC GGATGCTCAGAT-3′). Cytohesin-3 DNA fragments (370 or 367 bp) were amplified in a nested PCR. The first PCR was performed using primers Cyto-3–8-1-S (5′-CGTGCTACGTGC TGTCATTCGCC-3′) and Cyto-3–11-1 AS (5′-GTTGGGTTTCCGGGGGTCCTCCAC-3′). For the second PCR, primers were Cyto-3–8-2-S (5′-TGCTCAACACCAGCCTCCACAACCA-3′) and Cyto-3–11-2-AS (5′-GGGTCCTCCACCTCCCTGATGCTGA-3′). All reactions were carried out for 35 cycles of 94 °C/1 min, 55 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/1 min with 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. Products were purified from 1% agarose gel using QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and subcloned into pCRR TOPOII TA vector (Invitrogen). Positive clones, 45 for each cytohesin gene, were transferred to GeneScreen Plus, followed by allele-specific hybridization with 100 pmol of 5′-end radiolabeled oligonucleotide and 500 pmol of unlabeled competitor, Cyto-1+G (5′-AAACTCGGAGGTGGCAG-3′) and Cyto-1−G (5′-TGAAACTCGGTGGCAGG-3′) for cytohesin-1, Cyto-2+G (5′-AAGCTGGGAGGGGCCG-3′) and Cyto-2−G (5′-TGAAGCTGGGGGGCCGG-3′) for cytohesin-2, and Cyto-3+G (5′-AAGCTGGGAGGAGGGCG-3′) and Cyto-3−G (5′-GAAGCTGGGAGGGCGTG-3′) for cytohesin-3. Final washes were done in 6× SCC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min. Based on the similarity of gene structures of cytohesin-1 and cytohesin-4, exon 2 and exon 3 sequences in the cytohesin-4 cDNA were used to synthesize two forward primers for nested PCR, Cyto4EX2–1 (5′-AGCCCGCGGACCTGAGCAGCGG-3′ and Cyto4EX2–2 (5′-ACCTGAGCAGCGGGGAGACGG-3′. The first PCR, using Cyto4EX2–1 and Cyto-431 and human leukocyte cDNA as template, was carried out for 35 cycles of 94 °C/1 min, 55 °C/min, and 72 °C/1 min with 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The same conditions were used for the second PCR with products of the first PCR as templates and primers Cyto4EX2–2 and Cyto-441 to yield E2T (Fig. 1). To obtain the 5′-end of the cDNA, a Human Leukocyte Marathon-Ready cDNA kit (CLONTECH) was used. Two gene-specific primers were synthesized as follows: GSP-1 (5′-GTGCAATGTCCTGGACGTCAGG-3′) and GSP-2 (5′-TGGACGTCAGGGGTCAGCAGCTTG-3′). Two adaptor primers for 5′-RACE were AP-1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and AP-2 (5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′). The first PCR using AP-1 and GSP-1 with human leukocyte cDNA as template and 2.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase was carried out for 35 cycles of 94 °C/1 min, 55 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/1 min. The same conditions were used for the second PCR with products of the first PCR (AP-1/GSP-1 PCR products) as template and primers AP-2 and GSP-2. The two different-sized 5′-RACE products, ∼350 (R5F, Fig. 1) and ∼210 bp from the second PCR, were excised from 2% agarose gel, purified by QIAEXII Gel Extraction Kit, subcloned into pCRRTOPOII TA vector by T-A ligation, and sequenced by automated sequencing using M13 reverse primer (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′). Because the longest cDNA obtained by 5′-RACE, which contained 55 bp upstream of the ATG, lacked an in-frame termination codon, RT-PCR using 1 μg of human leukocyte cDNA as template was performed with two sets of nested primers to produce E1ST (Fig. 1). Primer C4EX1UP-1 (5′-CAAGCAGGAAGGAGCCTGTT-3′) and reverse primer Cyto-431 were used for the first PCR, and forward primer C4EX1UP-2 (5′-GAAGGAGCCTGTTACAGTCAAG-3′) and reverse primer Cyto-441 for the second. Each PCR was carried out for 35 cycles of 94 °C/1 min, 55 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/2 min with 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase. cDNA (∼0.3 μg) from a blood mononuclear cell fraction was the template for synthesis of full-length human cytohesin-4 cDNA in a nested PCR. Primers C4E1C-1 (5′-CCCAGAGGCGTCGGAATGGACCTGTG-3′) and C4E13R-1 (5′-GTCGACTCACTGCTTGCTGGCAATCTT-3′) were used for the first PCR and primers C4E1C-2 (5′-GTCGGAATGGACCTGTGCCACCCAG-3′) and 4E13R-2 for the second, with the first PCR product as template. Each PCR was carried out for 35 cycles of 94 °C/1 min, 55 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/2 min using 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Products were gel-purified and recovered using QIAEXII Gel Extraction kit. The isolated DNA fragment was incubated for 1 h at 72 °C with 4 μm dATP and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase before subcloning in pCRRTopoII TA vector. Cytohesin-4 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the forward primer (4C) 5′-GACATATGGACCTGTGCCACCCAGAGCCCGCGGAGCTGAGCAGCGGGGAC-3′ (italicized sequence is an NdeI cleavage site), reverse primer (TER-1) 5′-CTCGAGTCACTGCTTGCTGGCAATCTTCTTCTT-3′ (italicized sequence is an XhoI cleavage site), 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase, and 10 ng of plasmid pTA-cytohesin-4 as a template for 30 cycles of 94 °C/1 min, 55 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/3 min. The products were extracted from 1% agarose gel and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated with ethanol, and incubated for 1 h at 72 °C with 4 μm dATP and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase to add a single deoxyadenine, followed by subcloning in pCRR Topo II TA vector. Sequence of the construct was confirmed by automated sequencing using primers Cyto-411, (Cyto-461) 5′-CCCAGAAGATAG ACCGGATGAT-3′, (Cyto-462) 5′-AGGGTTGGCTGCTCAAGCTAG-3′, (Cyto-463) 5′- CCGA GGAACGTGACCAGTGGA-3′, and (Cyto-464) 5′-GGGTCAGCAGCTTGTGCTCAATG-3′. Recombinant plasmid in pCRRTopo II TA vector (3 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with NdeI plusXhoI. The purified excised cytohesin-4 fragment was ligated into NdeI/XhoI sites of pET-14b expression vector (Novagen). For large scale preparation of recombinant protein, 6 ml of overnight culture of the transformed bacteria (BL-21) were added to a flask with 500 ml of LB broth and ampicillin, 100 μg/ml, followed by incubation at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm). When the culture reached an A 600 of 0.6, 2 ml of 100 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were added (final concentration 0.4 mm). After incubation for 3 h, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (Sorvall SuperliteTM GSA, 5500 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min) and stored at −20 °C. Bacterial pellets were thawed and dispersed in 10 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl) with protease inhibitors (PharMingen), 10 μg/ml. Lysozyme (Sigma), 10 mg/ml, was added, and after incubation (4 °C, 30 min) cells were disrupted by sonification (Branson Sonifier 450), followed by two cycles of freezing and thawing. The lysate was centrifuged twice (Sorvall SuperliteTM GSA, 14000 rpm, 4 °C, 20 min). The final supernatant was applied to Ni2+-His·Bind resin (1 ml) that had been equilibrated in buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.9)) containing 5 mmimidazole. After washing with 6 ml of the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, followed by 100 mm imidazole in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) with 10% glycerol, bound proteins were eluted with 400 mm imidazole in the latter buffer. The presence of recombinant protein was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The His6-tagged fusion protein (∼50 μg/ml) was divided into small portions and stored at −20 °C. Two different preparations of each protein were used for the experiments reported here. Assay of GEP activity (27.Patton W.A. Zhang G.-F. Moss J. Vaughan M. Aktories K.

Briefly, ARF was incubated with or without GEP at 30 °C for the indicated time in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmNaN3, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20–30 mm NaCl, 280 mm phosphatidylserine, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 4 μm [35S]GTPγS (total volume, 100 μl). Protein-bound nucleotide was collected on nitrocellulose for radioassay (31.Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3063-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All assays were carried out in triplicate, and experiments were repeated at least twice with different preparations of recombinant proteins. PCR-generated 595-bp cytohesin-4 DNA (50 ng) that included Sec7 domain codons plus adjacent 5′ sequence was labeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 μCi/ml) using a Random Primer labeling kit, and purified with a Quick Spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl at 42 °C for 16 h before final washing with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 47 °C for 15 min. The same conditions were used for hybridization with samples (20 μg) of total RNA from cultured leukocyte-derived cell lines (1 × 107 cells) that had been subjected to electrophoresis in a 6.5% formaldehyde, 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreen Plus (NEN Life Science Products). Total mononuclear cell RNA was extracted from 20 ml of blood from a normal volunteer using Trizol solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5 μg was used for cDNA transcription with 200 units of Superscript II RT and 150 ng of random hexamers (Life Technologies, Inc.). Based on the assumption that illegitimate (ectopic) transcription of the cytohesin-4 gene may occur in every cell type (32.Chelly J. Concordet J.-P. Kaplan J.-C. Kahn A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2617-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), a 595-bp cytohesin-4 cDNA fragment (+189 to +784) was amplified using 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase and two sets of primers for nested PCR. Primers for the first PCR were Cyto-411 in exon 4 (5′-CCGGATGGCCCAGAAGGAGAAGG-3′) and Cyto-431 in exon 9 (5′-CTAGCTTGAGCAGCCAACCCTCCC-3′). Primers Cyto-421 (5′-GAGCTGTGT ATTGGGCGCAAGAAGT-3′) and Cyto-441(5′-GGTCTGGATTGAAGAAGGTGTGAGTG-3′) were used for the second PCR. Both were carried out for 35 cycles of 94 °C/1 min, 55 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/1 min. The resulting products were purified from 1% agarose gel using QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, subcloning into pCRR TOPOII TA vector, and sequencing. For in situ hybridizations, a 350-bp fragment of cytohesin-4 mRNA corresponding to nucleotides 143–492 (+1 = A of translation initiation codon) was amplified by PCR using 50 pmol each of forward (cRNA/F) 5′-CTGCTTCGAGAGTGCGGAGG-3′ and reverse (cRNA/R) 5′-CCATCATCCGGTCTATCTTC-3′ primers with 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase and 250 ng of plasmid pTA-cytohesin-4 as template for 30 cycles of 94 °C/1 min, 55 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/2 min and cloned into pBluescript KS+ plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sense and antisense riboprobes were generated from a linearized pBluescript plasmid containing the 350-bp fragment using T3 (antisense) or T7 (sense) RNA polymerase and biotin-16-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In situ hybridizations were performed essentially as described previously (33.Hayashi T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Fleming M.V. Fishback N. Koss M.V. Liotta L.A. Ferrans V.J. Travis W.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1241-1256PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells stained with monoclonal antibodies and sorted by flow cytometry were adhered to slides by cytospin, air-dried, and stored at −80 °C. Before hybridization, cells were fixed (30 min), in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized for 10 min in 0.25% acetic acid, 0.1m triethanolamine, followed by washing three times with PBS (all at room temperature). Specimens were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and air-dried. Prehybridization was performed at 50 °C for 2 h in a moist chamber with 50 μl of hybridization solution (Ambion, Austin, TX). After hybridization"

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains one major arginine methyltransferase, Hmt1p/Rmt1p, which is not essential for normal cell growth. However, cells missing HMT1 and also bearing mutations in the mRNA-binding proteins Npl3p or Cbp80p can no longer survive, providing genetic backgrounds in which to study Hmt1p function. We now demonstrate that the catalytically active form of Hmt1p is required for its activity in vivo. Amino acid changes in the putative Hmt1p S-adenosyl-l-methionine-binding site were generated and shown to be unable to catalyze methylation of Npl3pin vitro and in vivo or to restore growth to strains that require HMT1. In addition these mutations affect nucleocytoplasmic transport of Npl3p. A cold-sensitive mutant of Hmt1p was generated and showed reduced methylation of Npl3p, but not of other substrates, at 14 °C. These results define new aspects of Hmt1 and reveal the importance of its activity in vivo. Many eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins are modified by methylation of arginine residues.

S-adenosyl-l-methionine polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline with 0.25% Tween 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 5-fluoro-orotic acid Post-translational modifications are frequently used by cells to expand the repertoire of proteins to control their activity temporally or spatially or to target their degradation. The methylation of the guanidino group of arginine residues was first recognized 30 years ago (1.Paik W.K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2108-2114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but recently more work has focused on this modification. Protein arginine methyltransferases have been identified and cloned from many eukaryotes (2.Lin W.J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

In addition, the number of potential substrates for these enzymes has grown as genome sequencing projects have revealed numerous proteins containing the RGG motif common to substrates for arginine methylation, many of which are RNA-binding proteins (7.Birney E.

Although it is not yet clear what effect methylation may have on the activity of such proteins, the yeast arginine methyltransferase Hmt1p has been shown to facilitate the export of at least two of its substrates from the nucleus, pointing to the importance of methylation in nucleocytoplasmic transport (9.Shen E.C.

In addition to monomethylated forms of these proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 undergoes asymmetric dimethylation, resulting inN G,N G-methylarginine residues, whereas myelin basic protein is symmetrically methylated (N G,N G′-methylarginine) (3.Gary J.D.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2545-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In vitro methylation of recombinant Hrp1p had no effect on its specific binding to the polyadenylation efficiency element; however, binding of Hrp1p to RNA inhibits its methylation by Hmt1p (27.Valentini S.R. Weiss V.H. Silver P.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Npl3p has been shown to be methylated in vivo (4.Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell.

A. 1996; 93: 13641-13646Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and there are at least three other proteins that are substrates for Hmt1p (3.Gary J.D. Lin W.J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2545-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The first evidence for the importance of HMT1 in cellular processes was the finding that it is required for efficient export of Npl3p and Hrp1p from the nucleus (9.Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The role of Hmt1p in protein export is also specific; Hrb1p export is not inhibited by the deletion of HMT1(9.Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).Similar to Npl3p and Hrp1p, eukaryotic Cbp80p is involved in RNA processing and nuclear export of RNA-protein complexes (29.Lewis J.D. Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3332-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30.Lewis J.D. Izaurralde E. Jarmolowski A. McGuigan C. Mattaj I.W.

The lack of RGG tripeptides in Cbp80p, however, suggests that this protein is not likely to be a substrate for methylation. The lethality of Δhmt1 Δcbp80 strains may reflect the importance of methylation of Npl3p or other proteins involved in these processes in the absence of Cbp80p. Alternatively, Hmt1p may have cellular functions in addition to its role as a methyltransferase that are required in strains lacking CBP80.We have now tested directly whether the methyltransferase activity is crucial for its biological function. In addition we have discovered a new mutation that affects the ability of Hmt1p to methylate certain substrates and have defined its effect in vivo.DISCUSSIONThe primary yeast protein arginine methyltransferase, Hmt1p, has been shown to be essential for viability of strains with mutations in the RNA-binding proteins Npl3p and Cbp80 (4.Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9.Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this report, the introduction of point mutations into the co-factor binding site of Hmt1p, one of which abolishes its enzymatic activity, has revealed that its methyltransferase activity is crucial for the survival of these strains. Random mutagenesis of HMT1 led to the identification of a cold-sensitive allele, hmt1-E18V. The N-terminal E18V substitution affected in vitro methylation of Npl3p but not of other substrates.The cofactor-binding site of methyltransferases comprises both specific residues for SAM coordination and a loop that lies between a β-sheet and an α-helix (18.Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 40.Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The methyltransferase motif I contains the loop residues, and the third amino acid in the loop, corresponding to G68 in Hmt1p, is structurally constrained (40.Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Given the sizes of the amino acids substituted for glycine at this residue, arginine would be expected to perturb SAM binding by Hmt1p to a greater extent than alanine would. Correspondingly, no methyltransferase activity of Hmt1-G68R was detected in vivo or in vitro, whereas the activity of Hmt1-G68A was detectable but significantly reduced. The lower activity of Hmt1-G68A protein was sufficient to partially suppress the Δhmt1 Δcbp80 synthetic lethality but not that of Δhmt1 npl3–1.Upon sequencing of the original hmt1–1 allele, which was found to be synthetically lethal with npl3–1 (4.Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we found a mutation that would result in a glycine-to-aspartate change at residue 86 (asterisk, Fig. 1 B; data not shown). The location of this mutation in the post-I methyltransferase motif, which is also thought to be involved in SAM binding (3.Gary J.D. Lin W.J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 39.Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that the lethality of the hmt1–1 npl3–1 strain may also be due to defective cofactor binding and a concomitant reduction in methyltransferase activity.We were interested in determining whether there are any regions of Hmt1p other than those implicated in SAM binding that are important for its biological function. Such regions might, for example, be involved in Hmt1p-substrate interactions. The change of a glutamate to a valine at residue 18 of Hmt1p caused cold sensitivity of a Δcbp80strain; in a npl3–1 strain, the hmt1-E18V allele was lethal. The E18V substitution resulted in an enzyme with lowered methyltransferase activity toward Npl3p, but not other substrates, at low temperature. This in vitro substrate specificity and the location of residue 18 N-terminal to the defined methyltransferase motifs suggest that this residue might be involved in substrate binding or positioning rather than catalysis. It is not yet clear why a mutation that affects Npl3p methylation causes cold sensitivity in the Δcbp80 background, but both NPL3 andCBP80 have been implicated in RNA export.The majority of the RNA in the cell is thought to be associated with proteins throughout its lifetime. For example, cap-binding proteins Cbp80p and Cbp20p bind nascent mRNAs co-transcriptionally and are joined by splicing and polyadenylation factors (e.g. Hrp1p) and other nuclear RNA-binding proteins, such as Npl3p (44.Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.9). These proteins are likely to escort the RNAs through the nucleus and nuclear pores to the cytoplasm and to be exchanged for cytoplasmic proteins before translation. In Δhmt1 cells, in which Npl3p export is severely slowed, Cbp80 may expedite the export of mRNAs and allow survival (9.Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Conversely, in the absence of Cbp80, RNA export may require the efficient methylation of Npl3p, which is inhibited at low temperature in hmt1-E18V cells. Alternatively, the E18V mutation may disrupt methylation of another substrate that is required at low temperature in the absence of CBP80. Future studies should help to define the interactions among these genes implicated in RNA binding and nuclear transport. Post-translational modifications are frequently used by cells to expand the repertoire of proteins to control their activity temporally or spatially or to target their degradation. The methylation of the guanidino group of arginine residues was first recognized 30 years ago (1.Paik W.K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2108-2114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but recently more work has focused on this modification. Protein arginine methyltransferases have been identified and cloned from many eukaryotes (2.Lin W.J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 3.Gary J.D. Lin W.J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, the number of potential substrates for these enzymes has grown as genome sequencing projects have revealed numerous proteins containing the RGG motif common to substrates for arginine methylation, many of which are RNA-binding proteins (7.Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 8.Kim S. Merrill B.M. Rajpurohit R. Kumar A. Stone K.L. Papov V.V. Schneiders J.M. Szer W. Wilson S.H. Paik W.K. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5185-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although it is not yet clear what effect methylation may have on the activity of such proteins, the yeast arginine methyltransferase Hmt1p has been shown to facilitate the export of at least two of its substrates from the nucleus, pointing to the importance of methylation in nucleocytoplasmic transport (9.Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Arginine methyltransferases were initially identified biochemically in mammalian cell lysates by their ability to transfer a radiolabeled methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)1 to histones, myelin basic protein, or the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (10.Casellas P.

In addition to monomethylated forms of these proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 undergoes asymmetric dimethylation, resulting inN G,N G-methylarginine residues, whereas myelin basic protein is symmetrically methylated (N G,N G′-methylarginine) (3.Gary J.D.

Rajpurohit R. Paik W.K. Kim S. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of methyltransferases has revealed motifs common to enzymes that methylate different molecules (17.Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar); at least one of these motifs has been implicated in binding to their common co-factor, SAM (18.Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Novel proteins that contain these motifs have since been identified in general data base searches and in genetic screens (2.Lin W.J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1998; 48: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The first protein arginine methyltransferase gene in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, HMT1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein methyltransferase), was identified in a screen for genes that interacted with NPL3, which encodes an RNA-binding protein (4.Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The same methyltransferase gene, alternately called RMT1, was also found in a systematic search of the yeast genome for proteins containing methyltransferase motifs (3.Gary J.D. Lin W.J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).HMT1 is not an essential gene in yeast, but it is required in at least two separate genetic backgrounds: in strains with the temperature-sensitive npl3–1 allele or in strains lacking the 80-kDa cap-binding protein gene CBP80(Δcbp80) (4.Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9.Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A search of ESTs for human homologs ofHMT1 revealed two human methyltransferase cDNAs, HRMT1L1 and HRMT1L2, and HRMT1L2 was shown to substitute for HMT1 innpl3–1 strains (19.Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Lalioti M.D. Rossier C. Silver P.A. Henry M.F. Genomics. 1998; 48: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The ability of a human arginine methyltransferase to function in yeast indicates that cellular mechanisms involving protein methylation are conserved throughout eukaryotes. The S. cerevisiae Hmt1 protein has been shown to have methyltransferase activity in vitro, methylating a range of RGG-containing proteins including yeast proteins Npl3p, Hrp1p and Hrb1p, and human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (4.Henry M.F.

A major poly(A) RNA-binding protein in yeast, Npl3p, contains 15 RGG motifs and has been implicated in many cellular processes including nuclear transport, ribosome biogenesis, and silencing (21.Lee M.S.

The change of a glutamate to a valine at residue 18 of Hmt1p caused cold sensitivity of a Δcbp80strain; in a npl3–1 strain, the hmt1-E18V allele was lethal. The E18V substitution resulted in an enzyme with lowered methyltransferase activity toward Npl3p, but not other substrates, at low temperature. This in vitro substrate specificity and the location of residue 18 N-terminal to the defined methyltransferase motifs suggest that this residue might be involved in substrate binding or positioning rather than catalysis. It is not yet clear why a mutation that affects Npl3p methylation causes cold sensitivity in the Δcbp80 background, but both NPL3 andCBP80 have been implicated in RNA export.The majority of the RNA in the cell is thought to be associated with proteins throughout its lifetime. For example, cap-binding proteins Cbp80p and Cbp20p bind nascent mRNAs co-transcriptionally and are joined by splicing and polyadenylation factors (e.g. Hrp1p) and other nuclear RNA-binding proteins, such as Npl3p (44.Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.9). These proteins are likely to escort the RNAs through the nucleus and nuclear pores to the cytoplasm and to be exchanged for cytoplasmic proteins before translation. In Δhmt1 cells, in which Npl3p export is severely slowed, Cbp80 may expedite the export of mRNAs and allow survival (9.Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Conversely, in the absence of Cbp80, RNA export may require the efficient methylation of Npl3p, which is inhibited at low temperature in hmt1-E18V cells. Alternatively, the E18V mutation may disrupt methylation of another substrate that is required at low temperature in the absence of CBP80. Future studies should help to define the interactions among these genes implicated in RNA binding and nuclear transport. The primary yeast protein arginine methyltransferase, Hmt1p, has been shown to be essential for viability of strains with mutations in the RNA-binding proteins Npl3p and Cbp80 (4.Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9.Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this report, the introduction of point mutations into the co-factor binding site of Hmt1p, one of which abolishes its enzymatic activity, has revealed that its methyltransferase activity is crucial for the survival of these strains. Random mutagenesis of HMT1 led to the identification of a cold-sensitive allele, hmt1-E18V. The N-terminal E18V substitution affected in vitro methylation of Npl3p but not of other substrates. The cofactor-binding site of methyltransferases comprises both specific residues for SAM coordination and a loop that lies between a β-sheet and an α-helix (18.Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 40.Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The methyltransferase motif I contains the loop residues, and the third amino acid in the loop, corresponding to G68 in Hmt1p, is structurally constrained (40.Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Given the sizes of the amino acids substituted for glycine at this residue, arginine would be expected to perturb SAM binding by Hmt1p to a greater extent than alanine would. Correspondingly, no methyltransferase activity of Hmt1-G68R was detected in vivo or in vitro, whereas the activity of Hmt1-G68A was detectable but significantly reduced. The lower activity of Hmt1-G68A protein was sufficient to partially suppress the Δhmt1 Δcbp80 synthetic lethality but not that of Δhmt1 npl3–1. Upon sequencing of the original hmt1–1 allele, which was found to be synthetically lethal with npl3–1 (4.Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we found a mutation that would result in a glycine-to-aspartate change at residue 86 (asterisk, Fig. 1 B; data not shown). The location of this mutation in the post-I methyltransferase motif, which is also thought to be involved in SAM binding (3.Gary J.D. Lin W.J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 39.Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that the lethality of the hmt1–1 npl3–1 strain may also be due to defective cofactor binding and a concomitant reduction in methyltransferase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2008279103,"We report here a novel ceramidase that was purified more than 150,000-fold from the membrane fraction of mouse liver. The enzyme was a monomeric polypeptide having a molecular mass of 94 kDa and was highly glycosylated with N-glycans. The amino acid sequence of a fragment obtained from the purified enzyme was homologous to those deduced from the genes encoding an alkaline ceramidase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a hypotheical protein of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. However, no significant sequence similarities were found in other known functional proteins including acid ceramidases of humans and mice. The enzyme hydrolyzed various N-acylsphingosines but not galactosylceramide, sulfatide, GM1a, or sphingomyelin. The enzyme exhibited the highest activity around pH 7.5 and was thus identified as a type of neutral ceramidase. The apparent K m andV max values for C12–4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-ceramide and C16-14C-ceramide were 22.3 μm and 29.1 μmol/min/mg and 72.4 μm and 3.6 μmol/min/mg, respectively. This study also clearly demonstrated that the purified 94-kDa ceramidase catalyzed the condensation of fatty acid to sphingosine to generate ceramide, but did not catalyze acyl-CoA-dependent acyl-transfer reaction.

Ceramidase (CDase, EC 3.5.1.23) hydrolyzes theN-acyl linkage between a fatty acid and a sphingosine base in Cer and is ubiquitously found in various tissues in mammals (3.Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Yavin E. Gatt S. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5.Sugita M. Williams M.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Isoforms of CDase have been reported which mainly differ in their catalytic pH optima. CDase with acidic pH optima (acid CDase) resides in lysosomes and is thought to function primarily in degradation of Cer for further catabolism. Genetic acid CDase deficiency is responsible for Farber disease in which Cer is accumulated in lysosomes (7.Chen W.W. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 208: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, an acid CDase was purified from human urine (8.Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and the cDNA encoding human and mouse acid CDases has been cloned (9.Koch J.

Genomics. 1998; 50: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CDases with activity at neutral to alkaline pH (neutral and alkaline CDases) were found in porcine intestine (11.Nilson A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 176: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), guinea pig skin (12.Yada Y. Higuchi K. Imokawa G. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 203-210Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Recently, we purified a novel type of alkaline CDase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had been isolated from a patient with atopic dermatitis (14.Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and cloned the gene encoding the alkaline CDase from a genomic library of P. aeruginosa (15.Okino N. Ichinose S. Omori A. Imayama S. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36616-36622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have suggested that neutral and alkaline CDases could be involved in signal transduction pathways to generate sphingosine for regulation of cell functions. It has been reported that an alkaline CDase in rat glomerular mesangial cells is up-regulated by growth factors (16.Coroneos E. Martinez M. Mckenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition, neutral CDase activity was found to be regulated by interleukin-1β in rat hepatocytes (17.Nikolova-Karakashian M. Morgan E.T. Alexander C. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18718-18724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, these enzymes have not yet been purified. Furthermore, the relationship between neutral and alkaline enzymes is not clear at present. We found a lysosphingolipid-forming enzyme, sphingolipid CerN-deacylase, which hydrolyzes the N-acyl linkage of Cer in various glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin (18.Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this enzyme catalyzed the condensation of a free fatty acid to a sphingosine to produce Cer, whereas the enzyme hardly hydrolyzed free Cer (18.Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). By using this unique reaction of the enzyme, radioisotope-labeled Cer (19.Mitsutake S. Kita K. Okino N. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and fluorescent Cer were prepared (20.Tani M. Kita K. Komori H. Nakagawa T. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We found that C12-NBD-Cer thus prepared was hydrolyzed by neutral and alkaline CDases much faster than 14C-Cer or C6-NBD-Cer (21.Tani M. Okino N. Mitsutake S. Ito M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 746-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), although CDase activity has usually been measured using14C-Cer (3.Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or C6-NBD-Cer (17.Nikolova-Karakashian M. Morgan E.T. Alexander C. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18718-18724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, C12-NBD-Cer was relatively resistant to the acid CDase. Thus the use of this fluorescent substrate makes it possible to perform specific and sensitive assay for neutral and alkaline enzymes (21.Tani M. Okino N. Mitsutake S. Ito M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 746-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Gatt (3.Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that an acid CDase of rat brain condensed fatty acid to sphingosine to generate Cer and suggested that there is an alternative synthetic pathway of Cer catalyzed by reverse hydrolysis reaction of CDase. However, the question of whether a single protein can catalyze both hydrolysis and condensation reactions or if some other factors are required for ceramide synthesis by CDase remains unclear, because the enzyme has not yet been purified (22.Hassler D.F. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe the purification and characterization of a novel type of neutral CDase, a 94-kDa glycoprotein with N-linked glycans, from the membrane fraction of mouse liver. We also report that the purified 94-kDa CDase catalyzed both hydrolysis and condensation reactions but did not catalyze acyl-CoA-dependent acyl-transfer reaction. 14C-Fatty acids (stearic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, and palmitoyl-CoA) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. N-Palmitoylsphingosine, phytosphingosine, and Triton X-100 were obtained from Sigma. Precoated Silica Gel 60 TLC plates were obtained from Merck, dihydrosphingosine was from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc.,d-erythro sphingosine was from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan), and bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit was from Pierce. HRP-labeled lectins (concanavalin A, Ricinus communis agglutinin I, and wheat germ agglutinin) and glycopeptidase F were purchased from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and Takara Shuzo Co. (Otsu, Japan), respectively. Lysylendopeptidase (Lys-C) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Fluorescence-labeled dodecanoylsphingosine (C12-NBD-Cer) was prepared by the method as described by Tani et al. (20.Tani M. Kita K. Komori H. Nakagawa T. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Various 14C-fatty acids were condensed to sphingosine (d18:1), sphinganine (d18:0), and phytosphingosine (t18:0) to produce 14C-labeled Cers by the condensation reaction of sphingolipid Cer N-deacylase as described by Mitsutake et al. (19.Mitsutake S. Kita K. Okino N. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the enzyme efficiently condensed the free fatty acid to sphingoid base, although the enzyme hardly hydrolyzed Cer (18.Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 14C-Cers were purified by using a Sep-Pak Plus Silica, Sep-Pak Plus C18, and a Sep-Pak Plus CM cartridge (19.Mitsutake S. Kita K. Okino N. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 14C-Glycosphingolipids were also prepared using condensation reaction of sphingolipid CerN-deacylase and purified by HPLC using a normal phase silica column according to the method described in Ref. 23.Mitsutake S. Kita K. Nakagawa T. Ito M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. The activity of CDase was measured using C12-NBD-Cer (NBD-C12:0, d18:1) as a substrate as described below. The reaction mixture contained 550 pmol of C12-NBD-Cer and an appropriate amount of the enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% sodium cholate. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), dried in a Speed Vac concentrator, and redissolved in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and an appropriate amount of sample was applied to a TLC plate, which was developed with chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonia (90/20/0.5, v/v, solvent I). NBD-dodecanoic acid released by the action of the enzyme and the remaining C12-NBD-Cer were separated by TLC, then analyzed, and quantified with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner (excitation 470 nm, emission 525 nm). One enzyme unit was defined as the amount capable of catalyzing the release of 1 μmol of NBD-dodecanoic acid/min from the C12-NBD-Cer under the conditions described above. A value of 10−3 and 10−6 units of enzyme was expressed as 1 milliunit and 1 microunit, respectively, in this study. Reverse hydrolysis (condensation) reaction was measured as follows: 100 pmol of NBD-dodecanoic acid and 3 nmol of sphingosine were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with an appropriate amount of enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. C12-NBD-Cer generated by the action of the enzyme and the remaining NBD-dodecanoic acid were separated by TLC, then analyzed, and quantified with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner as described above. Livers, 181 g (wet weight) from 105 mice (Sea:ddy species, female), were homogenized with 300 ml of 0.25 m sucrose containing 1 mm EDTA (sucrose-EDTA). Debris was removed by centrifuging at 600 ×g for 10 min. The supernatants were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min, and the precipitates were collected (membrane fraction). The neutral CDase was solubilized from the membrane fraction as described below. The precipitates were suspended in 480 ml of sucrose-EDTA, frozen at −80 °C immediately, and then thawed under running tap water. The suspension was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min after the freeze-thawing was repeated once more, and the supernatant was obtained (extract I). The sediment was resuspended in sucrose-EDTA, immediately frozen at −80 °C, and then thawed under running tap water. The freeze-thawing was repeated three times and then centrifuged at 105,000 ×g for 90 min, and the supernatant was obtained (extract II). The extracts I and II were combined and pooled (solubilized enzyme fraction). Half of the enzyme solution (260 ml) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (100 ml), pre-equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% Lubrol PX (buffer A) at a flow rate of 4.7 ml/min, using a BPLC-600FC HPLC system (Yamazen Co., Osaka, Japan). The enzyme was adsorbed onto the column and eluted with buffer A containing 1 m NaCl. The fractions containing CDase activity were pooled (160 ml) and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose 6FF column (100 ml), pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (buffer B), containing 2 mNaCl at a flow rate of 5.2 ml/min, using a BPLC-600FC HPLC system. The enzyme was adsorbed onto the column that was washed with a decreasing NaCl gradients from 2 to 0 m. The enzyme was then eluted with an increasing Lubrol PX gradient from 0 to 1% in buffer B. The active fractions were pooled (310 ml), and applied to a chelating Sepharose FF column (chelated with Cu2+, 25 ml), pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Lubrol PX (buffer C) and 0.5 m NaCl at a flow rate of 4.7 ml/min, using a BPLC-600FC HPLC system. After washing the column with the same buffer and subsequently with buffer C, the enzyme was eluted with buffer C containing 2 mNH4Cl, whereas most of the contaminating proteins were eluted with buffer C containing 0.1 m imidazole. The fractions containing CDase activity were concentrated and replaced with buffer C using an Amicon concentrator using a PM-10 membrane. The enzyme solution (30 ml) was applied to a POROS HQ packed column (4.6 × 100 mm; PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer C at a flow rate of 5.0 ml/min, using the BioCAD system. The enzyme was adsorbed onto the column and eluted with an increasing NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5 m in buffer C. The active fractions were pooled and applied to a hydroxyapatite column (7.5 × 100 mm, Pentax Co., Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% Lubrol PX and 0.2 m NaCl at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, using the BioCAD system. The enzyme was passed through the column, whereas contaminating proteins were adsorbed and eluted with 300 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% Lubrol PX. The active fractions were pooled, and an appropriate amount of sample was applied to a Superdex 200 HR column (10 × 300 mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.3% Lubrol PX and 0.2m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, using the BioCAD system. Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) or SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The proteins on PAGE were visualized by staining with silver-staining solution (25.Ohsawa K. Ebata N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and determined with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner with the reflectance mode set at 540 nm. Triton-PAGE was performed by a 4–20% acrylamide gradient gel (NOVEX) using 0.1% Triton X-100 instead of SDS. For lectin blotting, the purified enzyme preparations were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl (TBS) for 1 h with gentle shaking and then washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (T-TBS). For specific detection of glycan moieties, the membranes were treated with HRP-labeled lectins (5 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing 5 times with T-TBS and then twice with TBS, the membrane was incubated in staining solution (0.05% 4-chloro-1-naphthol in 17% methanol containing 0.05% H2O2). The reaction was stopped by washing the membrane with distilled water. The purified CDase (27 ng as protein) was denatured in a boiling water bath for 3 min in 5 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, containing 0.5% SDS and 0.75% β-mercaptoethanol. The denatured enzyme was then incubated at 37 °C for 18 h with 0.5 milliunit of glycopeptidase F in 25 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, containing 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.15% β-mercaptoethanol. Exoglycosidases and proteases were assayed withp-nitorophenyl glycosides (26.Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 702-713Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and Azocoll (27.Moore G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), respectively, as the substrate. The activities on glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin were measured using 14C-labeled glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin as the substrate, respectively, by the method described previously (23.Mitsutake S. Kita K. Nakagawa T. Ito M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For concentration of the sample, the purified CDase was applied to a MonoQ column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.3% Lubrol PX using a SMART System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The enzyme was adsorbed onto the column and eluted with the same buffer containing 0.4m NaCl. The 94-kDa CDase protein (about 30 pmol) obtained was reduced and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The CDase protein was visualized with a GelCode Blue Stain regent (Pierce), and digested with Lys-C at 37 °C in 50 μl 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, for 16 h. The digest was put on a reverse-phase HPLC column (2.1 × 150 mm) and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min by Gloosa/Hewlett-Packard HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Amino acid sequences of the isolated peptides were determined by automated Edman degradation (sequencer model). Neutral CDase activities were shown to be distributed in various mouse tissues when the activity was measured using C12-NBD-Cer as a substrate at pH 7.5 (Table I). Interestingly, the enzyme activity was detected in both membrane and soluble fractions, although the former was predominant (Table I). The distribution of neutral CDase in rat tissues was similar to that in mice, but very weak activities were detected in porcine tissues (data not shown). In this study, we used mouse livers as a starting material for the purification of neutral CDase, because total activity of the enzyme was superior to that of other tissues (Table I). The neutral CDase was solubilized from the membrane fractions of mouse liver by the freeze-thawing method without use of detergents as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The solubilized CDase fraction increased by repeated freeze-thawing, and the maximal activity was recovered when the procedure was repeated 6 times (Fig.1 A). Use of protease inhibitors during freeze-thawing procedures did not affect the efficiency of solubilization of the CDase (data not shown), suggesting that the release of the CDase from membrane fractions was not due to proteolysis. In contrast, CDase of mouse kidney was hardly solubilized by the freeze-thawing method (Fig. 1 B). The kidney enzyme was solubilized using 0.1% Triton X-100. This result suggested that the neutral CDases from different origins somewhat differ in the mode of association with the membrane. Solubilization of the enzyme by the freeze-thawing method was demonstrated to be very effective for purification of the enzyme; i.e. more than 90% activity was recovered, whereas total protein was reduced to one-quarter (TableII).Table IDistribution of CDase activity from various mouse tissuesSpecific activityTotal activityMembrane fractionmilliunits/mgmilliunits/mouse%Liver0.11923.980.6Kidney0.31511.695.5Spleen0.0350.64858.6Brain0.2003.0088.3Each tissue was homogenized with 0.25 m sucrose.

The neutral CDase was purified from the solubilized CDase fraction by sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose FF, phenyl-Sepharose 6FF, chelating Sepharose FF, POROS HQ, hydroxyapatite, and Superdex 200 HR. The CDase was finally purified more than 150,000-fold with an overall yield of 27.8% (Table II). The most effective step for the purification of the enzyme was chromatography using hydroxyapatite in which most of the contaminating proteins bound to the column in the presence of 1 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, whereas the CDase passed through the column. By this chromatography, specific activity of the enzyme was increased at least by 20-fold with 85% recovery (TableII). The final preparation of the CDase was completely free from the following enzymes: α- and β-galactosidases, α- and β-glucosidases, α- and β-mannosidases, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, α-N-acetylgalactosamindase, α-N-acetylglucosaminidase, α-l-fucosidase, proteases, sphingomyelinase, endoglycoceramidase, and sphingolipid CerN-deacylase, as confirmed by determination of activity using 10 microunits of CDase for each assay and incubation with an appropriate substrate for 24 h. The purified enzyme gave a single protein band corresponding to a molecular mass of 94 kDa on SDS-PAGE after staining with silver-staining solution under both reducing (Fig.2 A) and nonreducing (data not shown) conditions, indicating that no subunit was linked by disulfide bonds in the enzyme molecule. The 94-kDa protein was stained strongly with HRP-labeled concanavalin A and R. communis agglutinin I and hardly with HRP-wheat germ agglutinin (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, treatment of the 94-kDa protein with glycopeptidase F resulted in generation of a 75-kDa protein (Fig. 2 A,lane 2). These results indicated that the enzyme was highly glycosylated with N-linked glycans possessing mannosyl and galactosyl residues at the nonreducing ends. The elution profile of CDase activity on chromatography of Superdex 200 HR coincided with that of the 94-kDa band on SDS-PAGE, and no other co-eluted bands were observed (Fig. 3 A). The purified 94-kDa protein was also subjected to Triton-PAGE. The distribution of CDase activity on Triton-PAGE corresponded to that of the band observed on silver staining (Fig. 3 B). These results indicated that the 94-kDa band was a CDase. Interestingly, the elution profile from Superdex 200 HR (Fig. 3 A) and the distribution of CDase on Triton-PAGE (Fig. 3 B) also coincided with the activity capable of catalyzing the condensation of NBD-dodecanoic acid to sphingenine (d18:1) to generate NBD-dodecanoylsphingosine, indicating that the 94-kDa protein catalyzed reversible reactions in which the N-acyl linkage of ceramide is cleaved or formed.Figure 3Gel filtration chromatography and Triton-PAGE of the purified neutral CDase. A, gel filtration chromatography on HPLC using a Superdex 200 HR column and SDS-PAGE of each fraction. HPLC was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were stained with silver staining solution, and the content of the 94-kDa protein was determined using a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner with the reflectance mode set at 540 nm. Both hydrolysis and condensation activities were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard proteins (molecular masses shown on the left) were: blue dextran (2000 kDa, V0), β-amylase (200 kDa), apo-transferin (81 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), and cytochrome-c (12.4 kDa). V t was determined using NaCl. ○, activity for hydrolysis; ●, activity for condensation; ■, elution of the 94-kDa protein (OD at 540 nm).B, Triton-PAGE of the purified enzyme. 500 microunits of enzyme were analyzed by Triton-PAGE using a 4–20% gradient acrylamide gel (NOVEX) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 instead of SDS. Protein was stained with silver staining solution. Unstained gels were cut into 3-mm slices and crushed in Eppendorf tubes with 300 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100.

One major peak obtained was sequenced using a protein sequencer, and 25 amino acid residues were determined. As shown in Fig.4, the sequence was found to be homologous to that deduced from the gene encoding an alkaline CDase ofP. aeruginosa (15.Okino N. Ichinose S. Omori A. Imayama S. Nakamura T. Ito M. J.

Furthermore, we found a sequence homologous to the sequence of 94-kDa CDase in a hypothetical protein encoded in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum using the GenBankTM data base (accession number U82513). However, no significant sequence similarities were found in other known functional proteins including acid CDases of humans (9.Koch J. Gartner S. Li C.-M. Quintern L.E. Bernardo K. Levran O.

The optimum pH of the purified CDase was found to be around 7.5 using both fluorescent and 14C-labeled Cers, although the pH dependence of the enzyme was quite broad (Fig.5 A). To examine whether the broad pH dependence for hydrolysis of Cer was due to a single protein, the purified 94-kDa CDase was subjected to Triton-PAGE (Fig.3 B); the enzyme was extracted from each 3-mm gel slice, and the activity was measured at different pH"

Osteoblasts from bothCasR +/+ and CasR −/−mice displayed an initial period of cell replication followed by a culture duration-dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, expression of osteocalcin, and mineralization of extracellular matrix. In addition, a panel of extracellular cations, including aluminum and the CasR agonists gadolinium and calcium, stimulated DNA synthesis, activated a transfected serum response element-luciferase reporter construct, and inhibited agonist-induced cAMP in CasR −/− osteoblasts. The functional responses to these cations were identical inCasR +/+ and CasR −/−osteoblasts. Thus, the absence of CasR alters neither the maturational profile of isolated osteoblast cultures nor their in vitro responses to extracellular cations. In addition,CasR transcripts could not be detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with mouse specific primers in either CasR +/+ orCasR −/− osteoblasts, and immunoblot analysis with a CasR-specific antibody was negative forCasR protein expression in osteoblasts.

The major physiological function of CasR is to transduce extracellular calcium regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion in parathyroid glands. This role is supported by the findings that inactivating mutations of CasR cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) (4.Pollak M.R. Brown E.M. Chou Y.Y.W. Cell. 1993; 75: 1297-1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) and that activating mutations result in hypoparathyroidism (5.Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O.

In addition, targeted ablation of CasR results in hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone levels in mice (6.Ho C. Conner D.A. Pollak M.R. Ladd D.J. Kifor O. Warren H.B. Brown E.M. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The function ofCasR in other tissues is less clear. In the kidney,CasR may modulate renal tubular transport, possibly acting as an antagonist to parathyroid hormone actions on renal calcium handling (7.Brown E.M. Pollak M. Seidman J.G. Chou Y.H. Riccardi D. Hebert S.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).

Since cells may reduce CasR expression in culture, it remains unclear whether nontransformed osteoblasts or native osteoblasts express the known CasR.

Commun. 1991; 181: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cations also induce c-fos mRNA expression and SRE-luciferase promoter activity in osteoblasts (17.Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E.

Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3144-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The osteoblastic cation response is coupled to G-proteins as evidenced by [32P]GTP azidoanilide labeling of 42- and 38-kDa Gα-proteins in osteoblast membranes following cation stimulation (27.Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E., II Middleton J.P. Zhang J. Arthur J.M. Raymond J.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 106-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, the osteoblastic cation-sensing receptor inhibits agonist-induced stimulation of cAMP accumulation as reported forCasR (23.Hartle J.E., II Pripic V. Siddhanti S.R. Spurney R.F. Quarles L.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The functional properties of the putative osteoblasticCasR-like receptor differ, however, from those ofCasR in several ways. The cation specificities for the putative osteoblastic receptor, while overlapping, are not identical to those for CasR (17.Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E. Siddhanti S.R. Guo R. Hinson T.K. J. Bone Miner.

For example, the trivalent cation aluminum, which acts by a mechanism in common with gadolinium (26.Quarles L.D. Wenstrup R.J. Castillo S.A. Drezner M.K.

Quarles L.D. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1750-1758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas neither the CasR agonist magnesium (17.Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E. Siddhanti S.R.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3601-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Also, unlike CasR, the osteoblastic receptor does not appear to be coupled to phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C. Rather, the effects of cations in osteoblasts are mediated by the activation of protein kinase C through unknown signaling pathways (17.Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E. Siddhanti S.R. Guo R. Hinson T.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These functional differences suggest that a related but molecularly distinct calcium-sensing receptor may be present in osteoblasts (17.Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E. Siddhanti S.R. Guo R. Hinson T.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and account for the inconsistent findings of CasR expression in osteoblasts. In an effort to prove the existence of another calcium-sensing receptor, we isolated and cloned the full-length mouse CasRcoding sequence and tested for CasR transcripts in osteoblasts using RT-PCR analysis with mouse CasR-specific primers. In addition, we evaluated the ability of a mouse anti-CasR antibody to detect CasR protein in osteoblasts by Western blot analysis. Finally, we determined whether the extracellular cation-sensing response is abolished in osteoblasts derived from mice deficient in CasR. Consistent with the presence of a novel osteoblastic cation-sensing mechanism, we found that cations stimulated to the same degree all measures of cation responses in osteoblasts derived from both wild-type andCasR-deficient mice. We used RT-PCR to isolate the full-length mouseCasR cDNA coding sequence. Total RNAs were prepared from mouse kidney tissue using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (17.Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E. Siddhanti S.R. Guo R. Hinson T.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We designed mouseCasR-specific oligonucleotide primers based on the incompletely characterized mouse CasR sequence (11.Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Kifor O. Brown E.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3561-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20.Hinson T. Damodaran T.V. Chen J. Zhang X. Qumsiyeh M.B. Seldin M.F. Quarles L.D.

For segments in which the mouse sequence was unknown, we substituted primers derived from regions of the rat CasR cDNA sequence that were highly conserved across species (2.Riccardi D. Lee W.S. Lee K. Segre G.V. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F951-F956PubMed Google Scholar). Using this approach, we were able to design six primer sets (see Table I) to overlapping segments covering the entire mouse cDNA open reading frame as well as portions of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. RT-PCR was done using the TitanTM One Tube RT-PCR kit purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The reverse transcription reaction using 2.0 μg of total RNA treated with DNase I (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was incubated at 45 °C for 60 min, and the template was denatured at 94 °C for 2 min. PCR was performed with thermal cycling parameters of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 45 s for 10 cycles. This was followed by an additional 25 cycles with thermal cycling parameters of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 45 s plus an additional 5 s with each cycle. The reaction was completed with a final extension at 68 °C for 7 min. The resultant PCR products were subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced using M13 forward and reverse primers. Sequence analysis was performed using the GCG software package (Version 8, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI).Table IOligonucleotide primers used for RT-PCR amplification of mouse CasR from kidneyNamePrimer sequencePositionaThe numbers refer to the nucleotide position within the mouse kidney calcium-sensing receptor cDNA sequence where the 5′-end of the primer will anneal.GenBank™Ref.1Facatg atgtc acttc tcagg1U103542.Riccardi D.

Kifor O. Warren H.B. Brown E.M. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), and C57BL/6J mice expressing the large T antigen of SV40 were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine). Mice were maintained and used in accordance with recommendations as described (37.National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.in: DHHS Publication NIH 86–23. Institute on Laboratory Animal Resources, Rockville, MD1985Google Scholar) and following guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Duke University. Heterozygous CasR knockout females (CasR −/+) were mated with males expressing the large T antigen of SV40. The resulting male and female offspring that were heterozygous for expression of both the large T antigen of SV40 and CasR knockout were mated. Offspring of this mating were genotyped, and those that expressed the large T antigen of SV40 and either CasR +/+ (wild type) orCasR −/− (homozygous) were selected for isolation of calvarial osteoblasts. We used modifications of a nonenzymatic method for obtaining the osteoblastic cell lines (31.Ecarot-Charrier B. Glorieux F.H. van der Rest M. Pereira G. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A fragment of the frontal and/or parietal bone from a single calvaria was aseptically removed from a 3–7-day-old mouse. Suture lines and endosteum were dissected away, and the bone fragment was placed in a culture dish. One or two metal strips were positioned on the endocranial surface and incubated for 3–4 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin until the outgrowth of osteoblasts. The metal strips were removed, and the cells were allowed to grow until ∼60% confluent. The cells were subcultured and propagated by incubation in α-modified essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. In addition, we also used established MC3T3-E1 (29.Quarles L.D. Yohay D.A. Lever L.W. Caton R. Wenstrup R.J. J. Bone Miner.

These cells were grown in α-modified essential medium supplemented as described above in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Cells were subcultured every 3–5 days using 0.001% Pronase. We used a PCR approach to detect wild-typeCasR +/+ and CasR −/−knockout osteoblasts expressing the large T antigen of SV40. Genomic DNA tissue was extracted and purified from the tail of each mouse or osteoblastic cell culture using a QIAamp blood kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). To detect the presence ofCasR −/−, we used the reverse primerCasR2144.R (5′-TGAAGCACCTACGGCACCTG-3′), specific for the native mouse CasR gene sequence, in combination with a primer designed for upstream elements in exon 4,CasR1956.F (5′-TGATGAAGAGTCTTTCTCGG-3′), or primer KCM-F (5′-TCTTGATTCCCACTTTGTGGTTCTA-3′) for the inserted neomycin gene sequence used for targeted disruption of exon 4 (32.Kovacs C.S. Ho-Pao C.L. Hunzelman J.L. Lanske B. Fox J. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2812-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Progeny containing the SV40 transgene were identified by PCR amplification of an ∼500-bp product of SV40 from individual genomic DNA using forward primer 5′-CAGAGCAGAATTGTGGAGTGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGACAAACCACAACTAGAATGCAGTG-3′. PCR was performed with thermal cycling parameters of 94 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 45 s for 35 cycles followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplification products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. To detect CasR expression, RT-PCR was done using two-step RNA PCR (Perkin-Elmer). In separate reactions, 2.0 μg of DNase-treated total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with the respective reverse primers specified below and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reactions were carried out at 42 °C for 60 min followed by 94 °C for 5 min and 5 °C for 5 min. The products of first strand cDNA synthesis were directly amplified by PCR using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) using three separate sets of primers based on the mouse CasR cDNA sequence. PCR was performed with thermal cycling parameters of 94 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The primer sets used to amplify overlapping regions of the 5′-end of mouse CasR included the mouse specific forward primer mCasR216.F (5′-AGAGCCATGGCATGGTTTGG-3′) and reverse primer mCasR653.R (5′-TGCTCCCACCACTGCGATGGTTG-3′) and the intron-spanning primer set consisting of the forward primer mCasR291.F (5′-CAGCGAGCCCAAAAG AAAGG-3′) and reverse primer mCasR1190.R (5′-CTTCA GACCG AACCC AATGG-3′). We documented that these primer sets were intron-spanning by comparing the sizes of the products derived from PCR of reverse-transcribed kidney RNA and genomic DNA. To amplify a region containing the 3′-end of CasR, we used the forward primer mCasR2431.F (5′-TCATC TGCAT CATCT GGCTC-3′ and the mouse specific reverse primer mCasR3537.R (5′-TTGGCTTCCTTGGGAAGACC-3′), located within the same exon. In addition, using a similar protocol (30.Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E700-E708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the mouse osteocalcin transcript was RT-PCR-amplified using the forward primer mOG+8.F (5′-CAAGTCCCACACAGCAGCTT-3′) and the reverse primer mOG+378.R (5′-AAAGCCGAGCTGCCAGAGTT-3′). Mouse β-actin was amplified as a control for the RT-PCRs as described previously (30.Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Am. J.

Some RGS proteins contain a Gγ subunit-like (GGL) domain, which mediates a specific interaction with Gβ5. The role of such interactions in RGS function is unclear. RGS proteins can accelerate the kinetics of coupling of G protein-coupled receptors to G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels. Therefore, we coupled m2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to GIRK channels in Xenopus oocytes to evaluate the effect of Gβ5 on RGS function. Co-expression of either RGS7 or RGS9 modestly accelerated GIRK channel kinetics. When Gβ5 was co-expressed with either RGS7 or RGS9, the acceleration of GIRK channel kinetics was strongly increased over that produced by RGS7 or RGS9 alone. RGS function was not enhanced by co-expression of Gβ1, and co-expression of Gβ5 alone had no effect on GIRK channel kinetics. Gβ5 did not modulate the function either of RGS4, an RGS protein that lacks a GGL domain, or of a functional RGS7 construct in which the GGL domain was omitted. Enhancement of RGS7 function by Gβ5 was not a consequence of an increase in the amount of plasma membrane or cytosolic RGS7 protein.

G protein-coupled receptor regulators of G protein signaling GTPase-activating protein acetylcholine m2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor G protein γ subunit-like domain G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 form the largest family of cell surface receptors and mediate cellular responses to diverse signals that include neurotransmitters, hormones, and sensory stimuli (1.Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1994: 731-740Google Scholar, 2.Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). These receptors are proteins with seven membrane-spanning regions and can interact with intracellular, heterotrimeric G proteins. When an agonist-bound or activated GPCR encounters a trimeric G protein, it catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP at the α subunit of the G protein (Gα). This leads to activation of the Gα and dissociation of the activated GTP-bound Gα subunit from the Gβγ dimer. Both the activated GTP-bound Gα subunit and the freed Gβγ dimers regulate the activity of many intracellular effector molecules. The intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα mediates signal termination. The Gα subunit hydrolyzes the bound GTP to GDP to produce the inactive GDP-Gα subunit, which then reassociates with high affinity to the Gβγ dimer. The intrinsic GTPase activity of purified Gα measured in vitro is much slower than the rate of termination of many cellular G protein responses such as phototransduction (3.Arshavsky V.Y. Pugh E.N. Neuron. 1998; 20: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and ion channel modulation (4.Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 38: C821-C830Crossref Google Scholar). This suggested that cells contained factors that accelerated the GTPase activity of Gα. Subsequently, a new gene family called “regulators of G protein signaling” (RGS) was identified (3.Arshavsky V.Y. Pugh E.N. Neuron. 1998; 20: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5.Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 6.Kehrl J.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). RGS proteins may have several functions (7.De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 138-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); one function of RGS proteins is to serve as “GTPase-activating proteins” (GAPs) for Gα, hence to accelerate signal termination. Swift transduction kinetics allow cells to read or detect rapidly changing concentrations of a signaling molecule, while slow transduction kinetics cause them to integrate or filter such a signal. Therefore, RGS proteins are important components of the programs that determine how the temporal information specified in the release and removal of an extracellular signaling molecule is translated into an appropriate cellular response. RGS proteins vary in size and sequence but all have a common, conserved core “RGS domain” of ∼120 amino acids, which is necessary and sufficient for their GAP activity. The RGS family can be subclassified into small (160–220-residue) and large (380–1400-residue) proteins. Small RGS proteins consist largely of the RGS domain flanked by short N termini and even shorter C termini. The larger RGS proteins contain additional sequence-definable domains and motifs that predict interactions with proteins other than Gα subunits (7.De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 138-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These additional domains underscore the current view that some RGS proteins are not simply GAPs but have separate functions that link them to other signaling pathways. For example, the RGS protein p115RhoGEF acts as a GAP for Gα13 and as a GDP-GTP exchange factor for the small GTPase RhoA (8.Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G.

Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has revealed that a subset of the large RGS proteins, RGS6, -7, -9, and -11, contain a G protein γ subunit-like (GGL) domain between the N terminus and the RGS domain (10.Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Gβ5 is significantly different from the other Gβ proteins in structure and cellular localization. Gβ5 has only about 50% identity with Gβ subunits 1–4, which themselves are about 90% identical (13.Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Gβ5 is found predominantly in neuronal tissues. Gβ5-long, the long form of Gβ5, is found in the outer segment membranes of retinal photoreceptors (14.Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Gβ5-short, a shorter form of Gβ5 is found in brain and in the inner retina (13.Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the interaction of Gβ5 with the GGL domains of RGS proteins has been well established, the effect of such interaction on RGS function is presently uncertain. Levay et al. (12.Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) reported that the formation of the Gβ5-RGS7 complex blocked the binding of RGS7 to the Gαosubunit in purified preparations and concluded that Gβ5 is a specific RGS inhibitor (12.Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Snow et al. (10.Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) showed that the complex between Gβ5 and a partial RGS11 construct (lacking a 200-amino acid stretch at the N terminus) had GAP activity. In addition, recent work performed with rod photoreceptor preparations indicates that the RGS9-Gβ5 complex is a GAP for transducin in the presence of the effector, the γ subunit of rod phosphodiesterase (15.Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T.S. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, the latter two studies did not compare the GAP activity of the RGS-Gβ5 dimer with that of the RGS protein alone (10.Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 15.Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T.S. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of Gβ5 on RGS function remains to be clarified. A useful way to study the kinetics of the G protein cycle is to follow the kinetics of activation and deactivation of G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels. GIRK channels are heterotetrameric channels that are widely expressed in the brain and in the heart and are activated by G protein-coupled receptors, such as m2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m2-mAChR) and D2-dopamine receptor, that couple to pertussis-sensitive G proteins (16.Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Free Gβγ subunits that are released from activated Gα G proteins activate or gate the GIRK channels (16.Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The key step in G protein signal termination occurs when the GTPase activity of the Gα subunit hydrolyzes the bound GTP to GDP. This produces the inactive GDP-Gα-G protein that then reassociates with high affinity to the Gβγ dimer. Thus, the deactivation kinetics of the GIRK channels are governed either by the rate of GTP hydrolysis by the Gα G protein or by the rate at which Gβγ subunits dissociate from the GIRK channels. In atrial myocytes and in neurons, GIRK currents activate and deactivate with time constants <1 s after application, and removal of receptor agonist occurs in less than 1 s (4.Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 38: C821-C830Crossref Google Scholar, 17.Sodickson D.L. Bean B.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6374-6385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes or other systems that have low endogenous levels of RGS proteins, the currents recovered much more slowly, over many seconds (18.Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 19.Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The rate was comparable with the rate of GTP hydrolysis by purified Gαi/Gαomeasured in vitro, suggesting that that GTP hydrolysis determines the rate of channel deactivation. Two studies showed that the co-expression of RGS proteins with receptors and GIRK channels inXenopus oocytes reconstituted the native kinetics of GIRK channels (18.Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 19.Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Point mutations in RGS2 designed to kill its GTPase accelerating activity abolished RGS2 acceleration of GIRK inactivation (20.Herlitze S. Ruppersberg J.P. Mark M.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 341-352Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results suggest that RGS proteins accelerate GIRK inactivation kinetics by enhancing the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gα. Whatever the mechanism, it is clear that the time course of GIRK channel deactivation following the unbinding of agonist from receptor may be used as a measure of RGS function (21.Zerangue N. Jan L.Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R313-R316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we expressed m2-mAChR and GIRK channels with either RGS7 or RGS9 alone or in combination with Gβ5 in Xenopusoocytes. We observed an enhancement of RGS function in the presence of both forms of Gβ5 and provide data to suggest that the GGL domain is required for the enhancement of RGS function by Gβ5. We also showed that co-expressing Gβ5 did not alter the total concentration of RGS, indicating that the enhancement of RGS function by Gβ5 was not mediated by an increase in the level of RGS protein. cRNA was synthesized in vitro from plasmids containing the cDNA and appropriate promoters for cRNA transcription. Plasmids were linearized prior to cRNA synthesis, and mMESSAGE MACHINE kits (Ambion) were used to generate capped cRNA. The m2-mAChR receptor was provided by E. Peralta (Harvard University). The cDNA for the GIRK subunits, rat Kir3.1 (22.Dascal N. Schreibmayer W. Lim N.F. Wang W.Z. Chavkin C. Dimagno L. Labarca C. Kieffer B.L. Gaveriauxruff C. Trollinger D. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) were generated in our laboratory. Xenopus oocyte preparation was described previously (25.Quick M.W. Naeve J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 357-361PubMed Google Scholar). cRNA was injected into oocytes at a volume of 50 nl/oocyte using a Drummond microinjector. Oocytes were maintained in a saline buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) solution supplemented with sodium pyruvate (2.5 mm) and Gentamycin (50 μg/ml). All oocytes were injected with 0.01 ng of cRNA for the m2-mAChR and 0.02 ng of cRNA each for GIRK1 and GIRK2. 200 nm acetylcholine (ACh) was used as the m2-mAChR agonist. Receptor activation was reversed by simultaneous ACh wash-off and perfusion with the m2-mAChR antagonist, atropine (1 μm). A valve system controlled by the data acquisition software, pCLAMP 6 (Axon Instruments), was used to control solution changes and to minimize wash-in and wash-out times. Two-electrode voltage clamp of the oocytes were performed 36–72 h after cRNA injection. Membrane potential was clamped at −80 mV using a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments) and pCLAMP 6 software. Electrodes were filled with 3m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–1.5 megaohms. To reveal inward currents through the inwardly rectifying GIRK channels, recordings were performed in oocyte saline buffer with elevated (16 mm) KCl concentration (other components: 82 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Plasma membranes were separated mechanically as described (26.Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were incubated for 10 min in ice-cold hypotonic solution (5 mm NaCl, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin). The plasma membranes together with the vitelline membranes (extracellular collagen-like matrix) were removed manually with fine tweezers and appeared as transparent sheets. The remainder of the oocyte (cytosol), consisting of cytoplasm and intracellular organelles, was left as an intact sphere. The two fractions were pelleted separately by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g and 4 °C) in a microcentrifuge. Previously, it was shown by electron microscopy that the clear plasma and vitelline membrane sheets were devoid of other cellular components (26.Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After cRNA injection, 2 mCi/ml [35S]methionine was added to the oocyte incubation solution, and the oocytes were incubated in this solution for 36–48 h. Eight whole oocytes, 30 plasma membranes, or eight cytosolic fractions were homogenized in 100 μl of SDS solubilization buffer (4% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin) and boiled for 2 min. 900 μl of detergent containing immunoprecipitation buffer (190 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 2.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin) was then added, and the homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C to remove insoluble components. The supernatant was precleaned by incubation with protein A-Sepharose slurry for 3 h at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose slurry was pelleted by centrifugation and discarded. 10 μg of an antibody to RGS7 was added to each sample group and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. The RGS7 antibody, R4613, was raised in rabbit against recombinant bovine RGS7. The antigen-antibody complex was captured by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation (30 s at 10,000 × g). The antigen-antibody-protein A-Sepharose pellets were washed four times by resuspension and centrifugation in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.02% SDS). The supernatant was discarded each time. The pellets were then boiled in SDS-gel loading buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein bands were visualized by autoradiography, and the relative intensities of the labeled bands were measured using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics) software. Kinetic analysis and curve fitting were performed using pCLAMP 6 software. Exponentials were fit to the activation and deactivation phases of the GIRK currents. Cursors were positioned at points on the activation and deactivation curves that corresponded to 20 and 80% of the maximum equilibrium responses, and the exponentials were fitted to the portions of the current trace between these two points. We used Student's ttest for comparison of the independent means. Two-tailed pvalue < 0.01 is defined as significantly different. We used ACh-evoked GIRK currents recorded from Xenopusoocytes co-expressing the functional Kir3.1/Kir3.2 channel heteromultimer along with the m2-mAChR to define the role of the G protein Gβ5 subunit in RGS7 function. GIRK channels respond to G protein activation and are useful for following G protein kinetics and in turn as an assay for RGS function (21.Zerangue N. Jan L.Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R313-R316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis may also be physiologically relevant because the GIRK channel subunits used in this study, Kir3.1 and Kir3.2, are widely distributed in the brain (27.Karschin C. Dissmann E. Stuhmer W. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3559-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their expression overlaps with the expression of RGS7 (28.Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Odagiri M. Ichikawa M. Yamagata K. Sekine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9899-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and Gβ5. The expression of RGS7 modestly accelerated the deactivation kinetics of the GIRK response when compared with control (Fig.1, p < 0.01), reflecting a stimulation of the GTPase activity of the oocyte Gα-G proteins by RGS7. This acceleration has been independently observed recently (28.Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Odagiri M. Ichikawa M. Yamagata K. Sekine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9899-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that co-expression of both the short and the long forms of the G protein subunit Gβ5 with RGS7 significantly accelerated the speed of GIRK deactivation when compared with RGS7 alone (Fig. 1, p < 0.01). We also found that Gβ5 enhanced the function of another GGL-containing RGS protein, the striatally enriched RGS9-2 (24.Rahman Z. Gold S.J. Potenza M.N. Cowan C.W. Ni Y.G. He W. Wensel T.G. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2016-2026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of RGS9 with GIRK channels and m2-mAChR accelerated GIRK channel kinetics (Fig. 2,p < 0.01). Again, when we co-expressed Gβ5, the acceleration of GIRK channel kinetics was strongly increased over that produced by RGS9 alone (Fig. 2, p < 0.01). Expression of Gβ5 in the absence of RGS7 or -9 had no effect on GIRK kinetics (Fig. 4, data not shown), indicating that the Gβ5 isoforms function to enhance the action of these RGS proteins on Gα-G proteins. The functional activity of RGS7 and RGS9 when expressed alone does not appear to be due to any endogenous Gβ5 expressed byXenopus oocytes. Oocyte lysates from uninjected oocytes showed no immunoreactivity to an anti-Gβ5 antibody that recognized Gβ5 from Xenopus retina or Gβ5 exogenously expressed in the oocytes by cRNA injection (data not shown).Figure 4Effect of Gβ5 on function of an RGS7 construct lacking the GGL domain. RGS7ΔN (corresponding to amino acids 322–470 of the wild type clone) is an RGS7 construct created by deleting the N-terminal region containing the GGL domain from the full-length wild type mouse RGS7. Control oocytes were injected with cRNA for the m2-mAChR (0.01 ng) and 0.02 ng of cRNA each for GIRK1 and GIRK2. The other oocyte groups tested were injected with the following cRNA combinations in addition to those injected into the control oocytes: RGS7ΔN (3 ng), RGS7ΔN (0.5 ng), Gβ5 short form (10 ng) and RGS7ΔN (0.5 ng), RGS7ΔN (0.1 ng), Gβ5 short form (10 ng) and RGS7ΔN (0.1 ng), Gβ5 short form alone (10 ng). Comparison of the activation (1/τactivation,solid bars) and deactivation (1/τdeactivation, open bars) rate constants derived from the exponential fits of the activation and deactivation phases of the GIRK currents in the different oocyte groups is shown. All bars are means ± S.E. from 4–6 oocytes, all from the same oocyte donor. The mean steady-state current amplitudes in nA ± S.E. for the different oocyte groups were as follows: control, 1094 ± 103; control + Gβ5, 573 ± 32; RGS7ΔN (0.1 ng), 573 ± 27; RGS7ΔN (0.1 ng) + Gβ5 short, 820 ± 169; RGS7ΔN (0.5 ng), 956 ± 82; RGS7ΔN (0.5 ng) + Gβ5 short, 651 ± 48; RGS7ΔN (3 ng), 736 ± 81.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results appear to be at odds with those obtained by Levayet al. (12.Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), who showed that formation of the RGS7-Gβ5 complex abolished the binding of RGS7 to purified Gαo. Their suggestion that Gβ5 serves to inhibit RGS function differed from the findings of Snow et al. (10.Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), who showed that the RGS11-Gβ5 complex has GAP activity and hence must interact with Gα. The discrepancy may have arisen because Snow et al. (10.Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) used a truncated RGS11 construct, while Levay et al. (12.Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) used full-length RGS7. Another explanation for the differing results may be that Levay et al. (12.Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) separately synthesized the RGS protein and the Gβ5 subunits in rabbit reticulocyte lysates before allowing complex formation by mixing the two reactions. The assumed RGS7-Gβ5 complex prepared in this manner may differ from the RGS7-Gβ5 complex that is produced in the same cells, so that the former RGS7 conformation may not correspond to that formed within the cell. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that GGL domains bind only Gβ5 subunits (10.Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc.

Similarly, we found that the enhancement of RGS7 action was specific to Gβ5; co-expression of Gβ1 did not increase the rate constant of GIRK activation or deactivation (Fig. 1). We tested the integrity of the Gβ1 cRNA that was used by coinjecting a subset of the Gβ1 cRNA receiving oocytes with Gγ2. The activation of GIRK channels by G protein-coupled receptors is mediated by Gβγ dimers. As previously reported, the coinjection of cRNA for Gβ1 and Gγ2, but not Gγ2 alone, resulted in a dramatic increase in the basal activation of the GIRK channels and an occlusion of further GIRK activation by coexpressed m2-mAChR (data not shown) (29.Kunkel M.T. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30.Lim N.F. Dascal N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 31.Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniquez-Lluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan Y.L. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This result verified that functional Gβ1 protein could be translated from the injected cRNA transcript. In the example shown (Fig. 1 B), it appears that coinjection of Gβ1 cRNA produces a small but significant slowing of the action of RGS7 on GIRK deactivation kinetics. This slowing may have resulted from a small decrease in RGS7 protein due to competition between RGS7 and Gβ1 cRNA for the oocyte protein translational machinery. We then tested the effect of Gβ5 on the function of RGS4, which does not contain a GGL domain. Oocytes were injected with two concentrations of RGS4 cRNA. Oocytes that were injected with 30 ng of RGS4 cRNA displayed the fastest activation and deactivation of ACh-elicited GIRK currents. The kinetics of the GIRK current response were significantly slower in oocytes injected with 3 ng of RGS4 cRNA and slowest in the control group. Coinjection of Gβ5 cRNA into oocyte groups injected with 3 ng of RGS4 cRNA did not significantly accelerate the kinetics (Fig. 3). That Gβ5 did not noticeably affect RGS4 function was not due to an inability to measure faster GIRK kinetics because the kinetics of GIRK activation and deactivation were significantly accelerated in oocytes injected with a higher amount of RGS4 cRNA (30 ng). Associated with the extreme acceleration of the GIRK activation phase produced in the oocyte group injected with 30 ng of RGS4 cRNA is a significant decay or sag of the current trace. This has been observed previously and may reflect a desensitization process that is normally obscured by slower rise times (18.Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 32.Chuang H.H., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11727-11732Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We also tested the effect of Gβ5 on the function of a mutant RGS7 construct, RGS7ΔN, lacking the N terminus and the GGL domain. Oocytes were injected with three concentrations of RGS7ΔN cRNA. Oocytes that were injected with 3 ng of RGS7ΔN cRNA displayed markedly accelerated activation and deactivation of ACh-elicited GIRK currents. These rates exceeded 2 s−1 and may have been limited by the exchange time of our chamber; the rates were thus at least as great as those observed with full-length RGS7 coexpressed with Gβ5 or with RGS4. Thus, removal of the N terminus and GGL domain may allow RGS7 to function more efficiently. However, the major point for the present experiments is that GIRK kinetics were slower and well within the resolution of our chamber in oocytes injected with 0.5 ng of RGS7ΔN cRNA, slower still in the group injected with 0.1 ng of cRNA, and slowest in the control group (Fig. 4,p < 0.01). Importantly, coinjection of Gβ5 cRNA into control oocytes or groups injected with either 0.1 or 0.5 ng of RGS7ΔN cRNA did not significantly accelerate the kinetics (Fig. 4). These data indicate that Gβ5 cannot accelerate GIRK kinetics when expressed alone and does not enhance the function of RGS proteins that lack GGL domains. Furthermore, these data argue against the possibility that it is the RGS7-Gβ5 complex that specifically interacts with the channel to accelerate the kinetics. In previous experiments on Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells, the co-expression of RGS proteins increased the rate constants for both GIRK activation and deactivation (18.Doupnik C.A.

We obtained similar results in our experiments with RGS7, RGS9, and Gβ5. The expression of RGS7 and RGS9 modestly enhanced the observed activation rate constants when compared with control, and these observed activation rate constants were further enhanced by co-expression of Gβ5 (Figs. 1 and 2; p < 0.01). Accelerated activation kinetics (an increase in 1/τactivation) are in fact an unsurprising and necessary consequence of the accelerated deactivation kinetics (an increase in 1/τoff = 1/τdeactivation), because in most kinetic formulations, 1/τactivation=1/τon+1/τoffEquation 1 Thus, point mutations introduced in RGS2 and RGS4 that abolished their GTPase enhancing activity also resulted in the loss of the property of these proteins to enhance both the activation and deactivation kinetics of GIRK channels (20.Herlitze S. Ruppersberg J.P. Mark M.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 341-352Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The surprising aspect of this and previous experiments (18.Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A.

Biol. 1998; 8: R313-R316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is that the increased 1/τoff does not lead to a decrease in steady-state activation, since the predicted fraction of open channels ƒ is given by the following. ƒ=1/τon/(1/τon+1/τoff)Equation 2 In the most likely explanation for this increase in steady-state currents, RGS proteins may be enhancing the rate of GDP-GTP exchange as well as the rate of GTP hydrolysis (33.Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We also explored mechanisms by which Gβ5 might enhance RGS7 function. In one possible mechanism, Gβ5 would stabilize the cellular conformation of RGS7, thereby increasing its cellular concentration. Precedent for such a mechanism is provided by the observation that Gβ and Gγ subunits are unstable when unpaired and that co-expression of Gβ and Gγ subunits results in higher cellular protein levels for both subunits (34.Higgins J.B. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9067-9073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Pronin A.N. Gautam N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36.Schmidt C.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4538-4544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this is also true for Gβ5 (13.Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Gβ5 increases cellular levels of RGS7 protein, we used an anti-RGS7 antibody to immunoprecipitate 35S-labeled RGS7 from oocyte groups that had been tested electrophysiologically. The immunoprecipitated RGS7 proteins were detected and quantitated after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Contrary to our expectations, we found that neither the level of total nor cytosolic RGS7 protein was increased by the co-expression of Gβ5 (Fig.5). The failure to detect an increase in RGS7 levels after co-expression of Gβ5 was not due to saturation of either the anti-RGS7 antibody or the detection technique, because the amount of RGS7 detected was proportionally increased with more starting material (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained when the oocytes were lysed and the immunoprecipitations were performed in buffers containing no detergents, suggesting that Gβ5 did not enhance RGS7 function by altering its solubility (data not shown). Alternatively, Gβ5 might enhance RGS7 function by targeting RGS7 to the plasma membrane, thus increasing the effective concentrations of RGS7 near the G protein. However, both the long and short forms of Gβ5 contain no predicted membrane targeting sequences (13.Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Instead, Gβ subunits are thought to associate with membrane by complexing to prenylated Gγ subunits (37.Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 38.Higgins J.B. Casey P.J. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In accordance with the above arguments, we detected no RGS7 signal in the oocyte plasma membranes from any of the oocyte groups that were tested (Fig. 5). RGS expression may be increased by Gβ5 in other systems; Snow et al. (11.Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) reported that the protein levels of RGS6, which also contains a GGL domain, were elevated in COS cells expressing Gβ5. Consequently, it is notable that our data indicate that Gβ5 enhances the function of the GGL containing RGS7 in the absence of changes in RGS7 protein expression. Instead, we suggest that Gβ5 may alter the conformation of the GGL containing RGS proteins, thereby leading directly to enhanced function. In support of this idea, it has previously been shown that the conformations of monomeric Gβ and Gγ are altered during dimerization (35.Pronin A.N. Gautam N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36.Schmidt C.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4538-4544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The principal findings of this study are severalfold. First, we have demonstrated that GIRK kinetics can be accelerated by the co-expression of the GGL domain containing RGS7 and -9. We have addressed uncertainties about the role of Gβ5 in the function of RGS proteins by demonstrating that Gβ5 enhances this action of both RGS7 and RGS9. We provide data to suggest that the GGL domain is required for the enhancement of RGS function by Gβ5. We show that the enhancement of RGS7 function by Gβ5 is not a result of an increase in the total, cytosolic, or plasma membrane RGS7 protein concentration. These results should assist our understanding of the role of GGL-RGS proteins in modulating G protein signaling."

Inspection of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a short motif similar to the Bcl-2 homology (BH) domain 3, suggesting that p193 may be a member of a family of apoptosis promoting proteins containing only BH3 motifs. In support of this, p193 expression promoted apoptosis in NIH-3T3 cells. Deletion of the BH3 motif abolished p193 apoptosis activity. p193-induced apoptosis was antagonized by co-expression of Bcl-XL.

Alteration of this balance can have significant pathophysiological consequences; tumorigenesis results when cell proliferation is favored, whereas autoimmune and/or degenerative disorders result when apoptosis is favored. In mammalian cells, apoptosis can be induced by at least two independent regulatory pathways. The first pathway relies on direct activation of the death receptors (members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily; reviewed in Ref. 1.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). For example, activation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 or CD95 receptors initiates a signal transduction cascade primarily through Fas-associated death domain, which rapidly activates caspase 8, thereby initiating apoptosis. Apoptosis can also be regulated through the activities of Bcl-2 family members (reviewed in Ref. 2.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). The prototypical family member, Bcl-2, was originally identified as the product of a gene activated by chromosomal translocation in some human lymphomas (3.Tsujimoto Y. Finger L.R. Yunis J. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M. Science. 1984; 226: 1097-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 4.Bakhshi A. Jensen J.P. Goldman P. Wright J.J. McBride O.W. Epstein A.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Subsequent analyses have identified a family of approximately 20 proteins that share homology to Bcl-2 at one or more domains (known as Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 domains 1–4). Functional analyses have shown that family members with the greatest homology to Bcl-2 tend to promote cell survival, whereas those more distantly related tend to promote apoptosis. The proapoptosis group is further subdivided into the Bax subfamily (which contains BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains; see Refs. 6.Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Commitment to apoptosis is governed, at least in part, by the relative levels of prosurvival and proapoptosis Bcl-2 family members, which, in turn, regulate the activity of Apaf-1 (an activator of caspase 8). Thus, the caspase family of cysteine proteases are the downstream effectors of apoptosis, regardless of the initial regulatory pathway. Once activated, the caspases effect cell death by initiating a proteolytic cascade that destroys cellular organelles, thereby giving rise to distinct morphologic changes that are diagnostic for apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 19.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). These include nuclear condensation, fragmentation of DNA at nucleosomal junctions, mitochondrial disintegration, and ultimately autolysis of the cell. The DNA tumor virus oncoproteins have provided an interesting model system with which to dissect the molecular regulation of cell growth and death. The transforming activities of these proteins (as exemplified by SV40 large T antigen and adenovirus E1A) reside largely in their ability to bind to, and thereby alter the activity of, endogenous cell cycle and cell death regulatory proteins (reviewed in Refs. 20.Ludlow J.W. Skuse G.R. Virus Research. 1995; 35: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and 21.Moran E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the case of T antigen (T-Ag), amino acid residues 105–115 are required for binding to members of the retinoblastoma family (RB and the related proteins p107 and p130; see Refs. 22.DeCaprio J.A.

T-Ag/RB binding blocks sequestration of E2F family members (which are maintained in an inactive state by binding to RB). Once released, these transcription factors activate expression of genes needed for S phase entry (reviewed in Refs. 26.Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 27.Hatakeyama M. Weinberg R.A. Prog.

The discontinuous region localized between T-Ag amino acid residues 350–450 and 532–625 is required for binding to p53 (29.Kierstead T.D. Tevethia M.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1817-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among other activities, p53 functions as a transcriptional co-activator of both proapoptosis and growth inhibitory genes. T-Ag/p53 binding prevents transcriptional activation of these genes and concomitantly inhibits their activities (30.Bates S. Vousden K.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 31.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). Adult cardiac myocytes are terminally differentiated cells that exhibit little if any capacity to reenter the cell cycle (32.Soonpaa M.H. Field L.J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In previous studies aimed at identifying potential therapeutic targets to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation, transgenic mice that express the SV40 large T-Ag oncoprotein in the ventricles and/or atria were generated (33.Field L.J. Science. 1988; 239: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 34.Katz E.B. Steinhelper M.E. Delcarpio J.B. Daud A.I. Claycomb W.C. Field L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H1867-H1876PubMed Google Scholar). T-Ag expression in the hearts of transgenic mice led to the development of myocardial tumors composed of differentiated, proliferating muscle cells. Given the extremely low frequency of primary myocardial tumors (which presumably reflects a highly redundant series of cell cycle checkpoints), we reasoned that these transgenic tumors would provide a useful reagent with which to identify novel T-Ag-binding proteins. Analysis of cell lines derived from the transgenic cardiac tumors revealed that p53 and p107 were prominent T-Ag-binding proteins (35.Daud A.I. Lanson Jr., N.A. Claycomb W.C. Field L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H1693-H1700PubMed Google Scholar). Two additional novel proteins of 193 and 380 kDa were also observed to bind, either indirectly or directly, to T-Ag (35.Daud A.I. Lanson Jr., N.A. Claycomb W.C. Field L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H1693-H1700PubMed Google Scholar). 2Daud, A. I. and Field, L. J., unpublished results. Here we have cloned and characterized the 193-kDa SV40 T-Ag-binding protein. Sequence analysis suggested that p193 may be a new member of the BH3-only proapoptosis family. This notion was supported by the observation that p193 expression promoted a prompt apoptotic response in NIH-3T3 cells. Immune cytologic analysis indicated that p193 is a cytoplasmic protein and that co-expression of T-Ag resulted in the cytoplasmic localization of both proteins. p193-induced apoptosis occurs in G1, and pulse-chase experiments revealed that T-Ag is also localized in the cytoplasm (albeit transiently) at the same point of the cell cycle. The data are consistent with the notion that T-Ag possesses an antiapoptosis activity, independent of p53 sequestration, that is actuated by T-Ag/p193 binding in the cytoplasm. AT-2 cardiomyocytes were homogenized in 20 ml of NET, precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads, and mixed with anti-T-Ag monoclonal antibody PAb419 (90 min at 4 °C). Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose, displayed on polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The region of the gel containing p193 was excised, alkylated with isopropylacetamide, and digested with F-trypsin (0.2 μg of trypsin at 37 °C for 17 h) as described (36.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The peptides were then extracted with 5% formic acid/50% acetontrile and separated on a C18 0.32 × 100-mm capillary column (LC Packing, Inc.). An aliquot of each of the isolated HPLC fractions was applied to a premade spot of matrix (0.5 ml of 20 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinammic acid plus 5 mg/ml nitrocellulose in 50% acetone/50% 2-propanol) on the target plate. Ions were formed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with a nitrogen laser, 337 nm. Spectra were acquired with a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager Elite time-of-flight mass spectrometer, operated in linear delayed extraction mode. Subsequently, fragment ions for selected precursor masses were obtained from post-source decay (PSD) experiments (37.Kaufman R. Kirsch D. Spengler B. Int. J. Mass Spec. Ion Proc. 1994; 131: 355-385Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Automated protein sequencing was performed on a model 470A Applied Biosystems sequencer equipped with an on-line PTH analyzer using modified cycles as described (38.Henzel W.J. Grimley C.

Peaks were integrated with Justice Innovation software using Nelson Analytical 760 interfaces. Sequence interpretation was performed on a DEC 5900 (39.Henzel W.J. Rodriguez H. Watanabe C. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 404: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). p193 cDNAs were isolated from an adult heart cDNA library generated from C3HeB/FeJ inbred mice (40.Kim K.K. Daud A.I.

Plaque hybridizations, phage DNA isolation, and subcloning were performed using standard methodologies (41.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequence was determined for both strands of all cDNA clones examined using the dideoxy chain terminating approach (Sequenase, United States Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH). To demonstrate p193/T-Ag binding, a full-length p193 cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/myc-His expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) such that the epitope tag was incorporated into the C terminus of the molecule (construct designated CMV-p193Myc). A T-Ag cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector (which lacks the epitope tag; construct designated CMV-T-Ag). For immune precipitation/Western analyses, NIH-3T3 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with CMV-T-Ag and CMV-p193Myc using the calcium phosphate approach (41.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein (1 mg) prepared from the transfected cells was reacted with an anti-T-Ag (PAb419), an anti-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or an IgG subtype-matched nonspecific antibody (anti-GST, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the resulting immune complexes were subjected to Western blot analysis. 100 μg of total protein from nontransfected cells and 100 μg from transfected cells were included as controls. The blots were probed with an anti-Myc (9E10) or anti-T-Ag (PAb416) antibody, and signal was developed using the ECL method. To demonstrate p193/T-Ag binding in vitro, [35S]methionine-labeled in vitrotranscription/translation (TNT kit, Promega) product obtained from a full-length p193 cDNA subcloned into pBluescript IISK (Stratagene, La Jolla CA) was mixed with 1.2 μg of recombinant SV40 T-Ag (Molecular Biology Resource) and reacted with anti-T-Ag (PAb419) or an IgG subtype-matched nonspecific control antibody (anti-MAP kinase D2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complex was then visualized via autoradiography (p193) or Western blotting (T-Ag) as described above. For Northern blots, 10 μg of total RNA was denatured with glyoxal, displayed on agarose gels, transferred to Genescreen (NEN Life Science Products), and reacted with a nick-translated full-length p193 cDNA as described (41.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For mapping the p193 binding site on T-Ag, in vitro translation products from a full-length p193 cDNA clone and various T-Ag deletion constructs were mixed, and immune complex was generated with an N-terminal specific anti-T-Ag monoclonal antibody (PAb419). Immune complex was then visualized by autoradiography. The various T-Ag deletion constructs were generated via polymerase chain reaction amplification using oligonucleotide primers incorporating stop codons or base pair substitutions as indicated in the text. The fidelity of each construct was confirmed by sequence analysis. For FACS analyses, NIH-3T3 cells transfected with either CMV-βGALMyc or CMV-p193Myc were labeled with Hoechst, trypsinized, and fixed in 5% acetic acid in ethanol, rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline, and reacted with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Oncogene Sciences) as described (42.Esser C. Gottlinger C. Kremer J. Hundeiker C. Radbruch A. Cytometry. 1995; 21: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 43.Brown D.R. Thomas C.A. Deb S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2513-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The DNA content of fluorescein isothiocyanate-positive cells was then analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACS-PLUS instrument. Immune cytologic analyses were as described (44.Klug M.G. Soonpaa M.H. Koh G.Y. Field L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), and images were captured using a Bio-Rad laser scanning confocal microscope or photographed directly using conventional light or fluorescent microscopy. For the cell death time course experiment, NIH-3T3 cells synchronized by two rounds of serum depletion (starvation medium contained 0.1% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were transfected with either CMV-p193Myc or CMV-βGALMyc using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24 h. The cultures were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured for an additional 6 h in starvation medium. Medium containing [3H]thymidine (26 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was then added, and cells were processed for autoradiography and immune cytology at various points thereafter as described (44.Klug M.G. Soonpaa M.H. Koh G.Y. Field L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). To localize T-Ag during the cell cycle, subconfluent cultures of AT-2 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum received a 40-min pulse of [3H]thymidine. The cells were rinsed and then cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then processed for autoradiography and immune cytology at various points thereafter as described (44.Klug M.G. Soonpaa M.H. Koh G.Y. Field L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). For the colony growth assay, NIH-3T3 cells transfected with CMV-null, CMV-p193 sense, or CMV-p193 antisense were selected in G418 for 15 days (the expression vectors also encoded a CMV-neor cassette). The dishes were then fixed and stained with gentian violet. For TUNEL analysis of DNA fragmentation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1% citric acid/phosphate-buffered saline and processed for TUNEL staining using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals in situ cell death detection kit (Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Samples were then processed for anti-Myc immune reactivity as describe above, counterstained with Hoechst 33342, and visualized via fluorescent microscopy. To identify the T-Ag-binding proteins in cardiomyocytes, immune complexes were generated using protein prepared from [35S]methionine-labeled AT-2 cells, a cell line derived from the transgenic heart tumors (35.Daud A.I. Lanson Jr., N.A. Claycomb W.C. Field L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H1693-H1700PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins with apparent molecular masses of 380, 193, and 120 kDa (see Fig.1 a) were detected in immune complex generated with either anti-T-Ag (PAb419; Fig. 1 a, lane 3) or anti-p53 (PAb421 and PAb246; lanes 2 and6, respectively) monoclonal antibodies. These proteins were not present in immune complexes generated with IgG subtype-matched nonspecific control antibodies (DYS1 (Fig. 1 a, lane 1) and PAb240 (lane 5)), nor in controls lacking primary antibody (lane 4). Previous studies have shown that the 120-kDa protein is p107 (45.Kim K.K. Soonpaa M.H. Daud A.I. Koh G.Y. Kim J.S. Field L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22607-22613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Kim K.K. Soonpaa M.H. Wang H. Field L.J. Genomics. 1995; 28: 520-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and that the 180-kDa protein (present only in PAb421 anti-p53 immune complex) is the murine homologue of RAD50, a protein involved in the repair of dsDNA breaks in yeast (40.Kim K.K. Daud A.I. Wong S.C. Pajak L. Tsai S.-C. Wang H. Henzel W.J. Field L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29255-29264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 380-kDa protein has not yet been characterized. To clone p193, large scale anti-T-Ag immune complex preparations were resolved on polyacrylamide gels and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The region containing p193 was excised, digested with trypsinin situ, fractionated by HPLC, and analyzed by mass spectroscopy using PSD (Fig. 1 b). Information obtained from the PSD experiment was used to search a protein sequence data base using a modified version of FragFit. The search indicated that p193 was homologous to a previously identified open reading frame of unknown function isolated from a human immature myeloid cell line (47.Nomura N. Nagase T. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Seki N. Kawarabayasi Y. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to generate a short cDNA clone spanning the region homologous to the largest p193 peptide. This clone was then used to screen an adult mouse heart cDNA library. Six overlapping cDNA clones were ultimately obtained (Fig.1 c). Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame 5067 nucleotides in length that encoded a protein of 1689 amino acid residues and with a deduced molecular mass of 192,346 Da (Fig.2 a). All of the p193 proteolytic peptides identified in the PSD experiment were present in the deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA clones. Analysis of the sequence revealed the presence of a leucine zipper at amino acid residues 593–619, an LXCXE motif (the consensus sequence for binding to retinoblastoma family proteins; see Ref. 48.Gibson T.J. Thompson J.D. Blocker A. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 946-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) at amino acid residues 1052–1056, and two G protein receptor motifs at amino acid residues 556–572 and 1071–1087. In addition, a putative BH3 domain was identified at amino acid residues 1566–1572; no other BH domains were present in p193. Sequence alignment of the BH3 domain of p193 and those of the BH3-only family members are shown in Fig.2 b. To confirm that these clones encoded the 193-kDa T-Ag-binding protein, a full-length p193 cDNA was subcloned into a CMV-promoted expression vector that incorporated a short Myc-epitope tag at the C terminus. The resulting clone, designated CMV-p193Myc, was co-transfected along with CMV-T-Ag (an expression construct encoding T-Ag) into NIH-3T3 cells. Protein prepared from cells 24 h posttransfection was subjected to immune precipitation/Western blot analyses using anti-T-Ag and anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 3 a). Full-length p193Myc and T-Ag were readily detected in total protein prepared from the co-transfected cells (Fig. 3 a). p193Myc was detected in anti-T-Ag immune complex, and T-Ag was detected in anti-Myc immune complex. Neither protein was present in immune complex generated with an IgG subtype-matched nonspecific control antibody. Thus, cloned p193Myc binds to T-Ag in vivo. Immune precipitation analyses of mixtures of in vitro translated p193 and recombinant T-Ag were also performed (Fig. 3 b). Radiolabeled p193 was present in immune complex generated with anti-T-Ag antibody but not in immune complex generated with an IgG subtype-matched nonspecific control antibody, confirming that the 193-kDa T-Ag-binding protein was successfully cloned. Northern blots revealed a somewhat restricted pattern of p193 expression in adult mouse tissues (Fig. 3 c). Relatively high levels of p193 mRNA were detected in the heart, as might be anticipated given that the protein was originally identified in cell lines derived from cardiac tumors. To identify the region of T-Ag that binds to p193, in vitro translation products from a series of T-Ag deletion constructs were mixed with full-lengthin vitro translated p193, and immune complexes generated with anti-T-Ag antibody were resolved on polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 4). p193 was present in immune complex generated with T-Ag mutants with deletions encompassing as much as amino acid residues 147–708, indicating that the p193 binding site resides within T-Ag amino acid residues 1–147. In contrast, p193 was not present in immune complex generated with a T-Ag mutant in which amino acid residues 92–708 where deleted, indicating that the C-terminal boundary of the binding site lies within T-Ag amino acid residues 92–147. Importantly, point mutations at T-Ag amino acid residues 107 and 108, which disrupt binding of RB family members did not effect p193 binding (Fig. 4, construct 1–147ΔRB). Thus, p193 binds to the N-terminal region of T-Ag distinct from the RB family member binding site. To determine the effects of p193 expression on cell growth, NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with either CMV-βGALMyc (an expression construct encoding β-galactosidase with a Myc-epitope tag) or CMV-p193Myc. At 48 h posttransfection, FACS analyses using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Myc antibody revealed that most cells expressing CMV-βGALMyc had a normal 2C DNA content (Fig.5 a; the inset shows a CMV-βGALMyc transfected cell: green signal is anti-Myc immune fluorescence, and blue signal is Hoechst fluorescence). In contrast the preponderance of cells expressing CMV-p193Myc exhibited hypodiploid DNA content, indicative of apoptotic cell death (Fig. 5 b). Visual inspection of the cultures confirmed that the bulk of the transfected cells were dying and had markedly condensed chromatin (Fig. 5 b, inset:green signal is anti-Myc immune fluorescence, andblue signal is Hoechst immune fluorescence). Thus, expression of p193 can induce apoptosis. To determine at what point in the cell cycle p193 induced cell death, serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with CMV-p193Myc. Medium containing serum and [3H]thymidine was then added, and the cultures were processed for anti-Myc immune cytology and autoradiography at various time points thereafter. Most cells expressing CMV-p193Myc were dead by 20 h post-serum replenishment (Fig. 5 c, black trace), and DNA synthesis never reinitiated in these cells (Fig. 5 c, red trace). This suggests that p193-induced apoptosis occurs during G1. In contrast, the preponderance of nontransfected cells on the same chamber slide reinitiated DNA synthesis by 14 h post-serum replenishment (Fig.5 c, green trace), thus establishing the fidelity of the synchronization protocol. In control experiments, cells expressing CMV-βGALMyc reinitiated DNA synthesis at a rate comparable to the nontransfected cells (not shown), indicating that transgene expressionper se did not have an impact on cell cycle progression or viability. p193Myc immune reactivity in the synchronized cultures was initially localized uniformly throughout the cytoplasm but became restricted to the perinuclear region prior to the onset of cell death (Fig. 5, d and e, respectively). Bax, a well characterized proapoptosis protein, undergoes a similar cytoplasmic to perinuclear redistribution during apoptosis (10.Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Finally, it is of interest to note that p193Myc-expressing cells are viable if cell cycle progression is blocked; >90% of p193-expressing cells were viable at 40 h posttransfection if maintained under low serum conditions. This suggests that some degree of cell cycle progression is needed to actuate apoptosis. Cell death induction by BH3-only family members can be antagonized by co-ex"

A common structural feature in the collagen-binding αI domains is the presence of an extra helix, named helix αC. However, its participation in collagen binding has not been shown. Here, we have deleted the helix αC in the α2I domain and tested the function of the resultant recombinant protein (ΔαCα2I) by using a real-time biosensor. The ΔαCα2I domain had reduced affinity for type I collagen (430 ± 90 nm) when compared with wild-type α2I domain (90 ± 30 nm), indicating both the importance of helix αC in type I collagen binding and that the collagen binding surface in α2I domain is located near the metal ion-dependent adhesion site. Previous studies have suggested that the charged amino acid residues, surrounding the metal ion-dependent adhesion site but not interacting with Mg2+, may play an important role in the recognition of type I collagen. Direct evidence indicating the participation of these residues in collagen recognition has been missing. To test this idea, we produced a set of recombinant α2I domains with mutations, namely D219A, D219N, D219R, E256Q, D259N, D292N, and E299Q. Mutations in amino acids Asp219, Asp259, Asp292, and Glu299 resulted in weakened affinity for type I collagen. When α2 D219N and D292N mutations were introduced separately into α2β1 integrin expressed on Chinese hamster ovary cells, no alterations in the cell spreading on type I collagen were detected. However, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing double mutated α2 D219N/D292N integrin showed remarkably slower spreading on type I collagen, while spreading on type IV collagen was not affected.

Chinese hamster ovary polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin metal ion-dependent adhesion site glutathione S-transferase The integrins are a large family of transmembrane proteins forming α/β heterodimers, which act as receptors for connective tissue components and also bind to counter receptors on other cells (1.Hemler M.E.

Integrin α and β subunits show some similarity but have evolved independently (3.Hughes A.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 216-234PubMed Google Scholar). Integrin α subunits can be divided into two different subgroups depending on the presence of an inserted domain (I domain) in their N-terminal part. In general, the α subunits participating in the formation of extracellular matrix receptors do not contain αI domain, whereas it is found in all four β2integrin-associated α subunits involved in cell-cell adhesion of leukocytes. The four collagen-binding integrin α subunits, namely α1, α2, α10, and α11, are an exception; they contain an αI domain, and at least α1I and α2I domains can, as recombinant proteins or proteolytic fragments, bind to collagen (4.Kamata T.

Thus, the collagen receptor integrins have a unique ligand binding mechanism when compared with the interaction of the other matrix receptor integrins with their ligands. Indeed, whereas many functional motifs in integrin ligands contain aspartic acid in a critical position (6.Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar, 7.Guan J.L. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1990; 60: 53-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), often situated at a protruding loop (8.Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), these motifs are not recognized by αI domains (9.Wang J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Integrin αI domains contain a Mg2+ ion that might coordinate the folding of the domain (10.Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that the Mg2+ ion also forms the actual binding site for the ligands (10.Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). One model of collagen binding to α2I domain suggests that a glutamic acid residue on the surface of the tropocollagen molecule binds to Mg2+ in the α2I domain (11.Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Some evidence suggests, however, that the metal ion is displaced from the α2I domain during the process of ligand binding (12.Dickeson S.K. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Mathis N.L. Schlesinger P.H. Santoro S.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11280-11288Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The initial recognition of collagen and also its binding might be a complex process involving multiple steps and interactions. Furthermore, it seems to be evident that both the fibrillar collagens, such as type I collagen (13.Messent A.J. Tuckwell D.S. Knäuper V. Humphries M.J. Murphy G. Gavrilovic J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the basement membrane-associated network-forming type IV collagen (5.Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Eble J. Kuhn K. Humphries M.J. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12244-12249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have multiple individual sites recognized by integrins. We have recently described a short cyclic peptide that binds to α2I domain and prevents its interaction with matrix molecules, including type I and type IV collagens (15.Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Three amino acids, RKK, and the proper cyclic conformation seem to be critical for the function of the peptide (15.Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The structure of the peptide suggests the importance of charged amino acid residues in collagen recognition. Other studies support this as well. For example, in type IV collagen, three amino acid residues, one arginine and two aspartic acids, all from separate collagen α chains, might be necessary for receptor binding (16.Eble J.A. Golbik R. Mann K. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recently, an α2β1 integrin binding type I collagen-derived triple helical peptide was described (17.Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Onley D.J. Peachey A.R. Messent A.J. Smethurst P.A. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33287-33294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The importance of a short sequence, GER, and especially the essential role of the two charged amino acids in it, also suggest that interactions between positively and negatively charged amino acid residues are involved in integrin-collagen binding. However, in previous studies collagen binding could be affected only by mutation of the amino acid residues directly interacting with Mg2+ ion (4.Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Integrins α1β1 and α2β1 are known to have some differences in their ligand binding specificity. Integrin α1β1 binds with better affinity to type IV collagen than to type I collagen or to other fibrillar collagens, whereas α2β1 is a better receptor for fibrillar collagen than for type IV collagen (18.Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A similar difference can be seen also in the function of the corresponding recombinant αI domains (5.Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Eble J. Kuhn K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12311-12317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and a chimeric α1β1 integrin containing α2I domain instead of α1I has ligand binding functions similar to α2β1(19.Kern A.

A common feature of the collagen-binding αI domains is the presence of an extra α helix, helix αC (11.Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol.

Here, we have made mutations to the α2I domain and produced the variants as recombinant proteins. Some of the mutations were also introduced into α2β1 integrin expressed on CHO1 cells. Our results indicate the important role of helix αC and several charged amino acids surrounding the Mg2+ binding site in the recognition of type I collagen. Furthermore, α2β1 integrin seems to recognize type IV collagen by a mechanism different from that used in type I collagen binding. Recombinant α2I domain was produced as described previously (15.Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford's method (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Protein purity and folding were checked in native and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Phast-System; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Site-specific mutations in the α2I domain were made using the Stratagene QuickChange mutagenesis kit, essentially following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR primers having the desired mutation for both DNA-strands were designed, and then PCR was performed usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene), which makes at 68 °C exactly one copy of the whole GEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing the α2I domain sequence. The PCR was digested with DpnI, which cuts only methylated DNA (i.e.only the template is digested). After this, PCR product DNA strands having the desired mutation were paired. The resulting GEX-2T vector having the mutated α2I domain was transformed intoEscherichia coli strain DH5α, and the construct was checked by sequencing the entire α2I domain. For the production of the recombinant protein, the construction was transformed into E. coli strain BL21. The I domain binding assay, based on the use of europium labeling, was used as described previously (15.Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Labeling of I domains with europium was carried out using 110 volume of 1 mNaHCO3 (pH 8.5) with I domains, and the labeling reagent (Wallac) was added in the molar ratio 0.3–2:1 (label:protein) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Unbound label was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the fractions containing the labeled protein were pooled. Typically, coating of 96-well immunoplates (Maxisorp, Nunc) was performed by exposing the plates to 0.1 ml of PBS containing 5 μg/cm2(about 16 μg/ml) type I collagen (from rat tail; Sigma) or type IV collagen (native, isolated from basement membrane of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma; Sigma), overnight at 4 °C. Alternatively, matrix proteins (5 μg/cm2) were coated on 96-well amine binding plates (Costar) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual protein absorption sites on all wells were blocked with the Dilution II solution (including 7.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA); Wallac) in PBS for 1–2 h at 37 °C. Europium-labeled α2I was added at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in PBS, 2 mm MgCl2 to the coated wells and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Wells were then washed three times with PBS, 2 mm MgCl2. Finally, 0.1 ml of Delfia enhancement solution (Wallac) was added to each well, and the Europium signal was measured by fluorometry (Victor 2 or model 1232 Delfia; Wallac). CHO cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were used as hosts for expression of integrin α2 subunits. Integrin α2 cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 1–4559 in the published sequence (27.Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Hemler (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). cDNA was ligated into the pAWneo2 expression vector (Ref. 28.Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. van den Elsen P. Yanagi Y. Yoshikai Y. Calman A.F. Terhorst C.

Weiss; University of California, San Francisco, CA), which carries the spleen focus-forming virus long terminal repeat promoter and a neomysin resistance gene. Stable transfections were carried out using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Neomysin analogue G418 (400 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium. After 2–3 weeks of selection, the nontransfected control cells were dead, and G418-resistant clones were isolated and analyzed for their expression of α2 integrin by flow cytometry as follows. Cells were grown to early confluence and detached with trypsin-EDTA, and trypsin activity was inhibited by medium supplemented with serum. Cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and then incubated with PBS containing 10 mg/ml BSA, 1 mg/ml glycine, and 0.02% NaN3 for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, exposed to a saturating concentration of monoclonal antibody against α2 integrin (12F1) in BSA/PBS (BSA concentration 1 mg/ml) containing NaN3 for 30 min at 4 °C and stained with rabbit anti-mouse IgG coupled to fluorescein (1:20 dilution; Dacopatts, Denmark) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS containing NaN3 and suspended in the same buffer. In order to measure the amount of α2 integrin on the cell surfaces, the fluorescent excitation spectra were analyzed by using a FACScan apparatus (Becton Dickinson). Control samples were prepared by treating the cells without primary antibodies. 96-well maxisorp plates (Nunc) or high binding microtitration plates (Nunc) were coated by exposing them to 0.1 ml of PBS containing 1 or 5 μg/cm2 (3 or 15 μg/ml) type I or type IV collagen for 12 h at 4 °C. Residual protein absorption sites on all wells were blocked with 0.1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. CHO cell clones expressing α2β1 integrins were used in spreading studies. Cells (10,000 cells/well) were allowed to spread in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Merck) and 5% sucrose (BDH) for 30 min, and at least three parallel wells (three parallel fields each) were examined and photographed by using a phase-contrast microscope. The total number of cells attached to collagen and the percentage of spread cells were counted. A spread cell was characterized as one having a clearly visible ring of cytoplasm around the nucleus. IASYS experiments were performed on the IASYS Auto plus apparatus (Affinity Sensors, Ltd.). A carboxymethyldextran cuvette was coated with type I collagen according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coupling buffer was sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and in the coupling process the type I collagen concentration was 100 μg/ml. Type I collagen was coupled to the cuvette up to the saturating level (based on the reading of the apparatus). A concentration series from 10 to 300 μg/ml in PBS, 2 mmMgCl2 for wild-type and mutant α2I domains was measured. Regeneration of the cuvette was performed with 10 mm or 100 mm EDTA in PBS, and the task was not always easy; for the tightest bound I domain, several successive regeneration steps were needed to remove most of the bound I domain from collagen. Results were analyzed with Fastfit software from IASYS. A three-dimensional model of the structure of the ΔαCα2I domain was built using MALIGN (29.Johnson M.S. Overington J.P. J. Mol.

The model was constructed almost entirely from the x-ray structure of the α2I domain (11.Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), but the αMI (10.Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) and αLI (25.Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) domains were used to build the structure in the vicinity of the deleted helix. This was done because the number of residues in that area in ΔαCα2I is exactly the same as in αM and αL. This makes the modeling more reliable in that region. The x-ray structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (32.Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer Jr., J.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 233: 716-738Google Scholar). The helix αC is a unique structural feature shared by the collagen-binding αI domains. Furthermore, one of the major differences between the putative collagen binding surfaces of α1I and α2I domains (the α2I domain is shown in Fig.1) is in the structure of helix αC. In the α1I, the groove situated on the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) face of the I domain is wider than in the α2I, because α1I residues Ser284 and Gly288, oriented toward the groove in the helix αC, are replaced in α2I by the bulky residues tyrosine and asparagine (20.Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Owens R.T. Carson M. Höök A. Moore D. Yang V.W.-C. Narayana V.L. Höök M. J. Biol.

D. 1999; 55: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To study the role of the helix αC for the collagen binding function of α2I domain, a deletion was produced; residues 284–288 (GYLNR) were deleted from the α2I domain by using PCR with specifically designed primers. We used molecular modeling to estimate the effects of helix αC deletion on the α2I domain (Fig. 1). The model predicted that the surface of mutant α2I domain would become more negatively charged than the wild type and more flattened. In the x-ray structure of the α2I domain, there is an arginine (Arg288) at the end of helix αC. This arginine forms a salt bridge with glutamate (Glu318) between strand βF and helix α7. As a result of the deletion of helix αC in α2I, Glu318 and the adjacent aspartate (Asp317) are placed in the vicinity of the MIDAS. The recombinant α2I domain lacking the helix αC (named as ΔαCα2I) was produced in E. coli as a GST fusion protein. To measure the effect of the helix αC deletion on the affinity of type I collagen binding, we used IASYS technology. For this, the ΔαCα2I domain was tested as a fusion protein (GST/α2I domain) to achieve greater mass and easier detection by IASYS. Collagen (100 μg/ml) was attached chemically to the cuvette according to the manufacturer's instructions, and different concentrations of I domain (10–300 μg/ml) were added into the cuvette. The binding event was monitored in real time, and examples are shown in Fig.2 A. The ΔαCα2I binding kinetics was different when compared with wild-type α2I domain. The association and dissociation parts were clearly faster than with the wild type, and the equilibrium was reached quickly (Fig. 2 A). The total effect of these changes was seen on K d values, which were estimated from Req (binding at equilibrium) versus ligand concentration: for wild-type K d was 90 ± 30 nm, and for ΔαCα2I K dwas 430 ± 90 nm (Fig. 2 B). As a conclusion, ΔαCα2I can bind type I collagen about twice as much as wild-type at high ligand concentrations, but the binding is about 5-fold weaker than for wild type. This result demonstrates, for the first time, the important role of the αC helix in type I collagen binding. Furthermore, it confirms the previous suggestions that the collagen binding surface of α2I domain is located near the MIDAS site. After GST was removed, the resultant α2I domain was labeled with europium. Binding of the mutant and wild-type α2I domains to collagen types I and IV was tested. Wells were coated with different concentrations of collagen type I or IV (1–15 μg/cm2), incubated with europium-labeled I domain (1 μg/ml), and bound I domain was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. These experiments suggested that the recognition of collagen subtypes by ΔαCα2I may be different when compared with the wild-type α2I domain. The mutant preferred type IV collagen over type I collagen (Fig.3), indicating differences in type IV collagen binding mechanism when compared with type I collagen binding. Interestingly, the collagen binding pattern of ΔαCα2I domain resembled the one previously described for α1I domain (5.Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Eble J. Kuhn K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12311-12317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), suggesting that the differences in αC structure might partially explain the functional differences between α1I and α2I domains. In collagen-binding αI domains, there is one extra amino acid residue in the loop between helices α3 and α4. However, in α1I and α2I domains, the extra amino acid has an opposite charge (Asp219 in α2I domain, Arg218 in α1I domain), suggesting another possible mechanism for the different functions of the two integrins. To test this possibility, we produced a mutant α2I domain, D219R. This mutation did not, however, have a clear effect on the ratio of type I collagen/type IV collagen binding (Fig. 3). Five negatively charged amino acid residues in the α2I domain were mutated, and the effects on ligand binding were tested. The α2I domain variants were prepared by using PCR with primers having the desired mutation, and the entire DNA of the mutated I domain was checked by sequencing. The mutations were the following: D219A, D219N, D219R, E256Q, D259A, D259N, D292N, and E299Q. Mutant α2I domains were expressed as GST fusion proteins, and they were purified as both “plain” I domains and as fusion proteins (GST/I domain). Mutant α2I domain D259A could not be expressed in E. coli BL21, and it was not studied any further. Expression levels of α2I domain D259N were also quite low. All expressed proteins were routinely checked by SDS and native gel electrophoresis for purity and quality of protein. In native gel electrophoresis, every α2I domain protein sample had a small extra band having larger mass than the true I domain band (not shown). The extra band disappeared with a reducing agent (dithiothreitol). This extra band is likely to be a small proportion of misfolded I domain that was able to refold back to correct conformation when dithiothreitol was added. A second, shorter version of wild-type α2I domain was prepared, where the amino terminus of the I domain was deleted at the position of the first cysteine (Cys140). This protein, named as wild type (ΔC140), did not show an extra band in native gel electrophoresis (not shown) under nonreducing conditions, but unfortunately the collagen binding ability of wild type (ΔC140) decreased significantly. All tested mutant α2I domains were based on the first wild-type version. Since mutations in the α2I domain were made close to the MIDAS, it was necessary to check that none of the mutations affected significantly the metal dependence of the I domain binding. The binding of mutant α2I domains to type I collagen was measured at four different magnesium concentrations (1, 2, 5, or 10 mm) and with 10 mm EDTA, which was used as “0 mm.” Eu-labeled I domain (1 μg/ml) was incubated in collagen-coated (5 μg/cm2) wells, and bound I domain was measured. The results are shown in Fig.4. The data indicate that the produced mutations, including ΔαCα2I, have no effects on metal binding site, and the concentration of 2 mmMg2+, conditions where all αI domains were tested, represent satisfactory saturating conditions. The effects of the mutations on collagen binding were tested by using IASYS technology. The mutant α2I domains were produced as GST fusion proteins. The binding event was monitored in real time, and examples are shown in Fig. 5. Concentration series were measured for each α2I domain, and the results representing saturating conditions (300 μg/ml) are listed in Table I. The wild type (ΔC140) showed only about 20–40% binding when compared with wild-type α2I domain, indicating the importance of the"

Therefore there is considerable interest in the therapeutic potential of these molecules for use in treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is underscored by the success of GDNF in relieving disease symptoms in several animal models of Parkinson's disease (10.Grondin R. Gash D.M. J. Neurol. 1998; 245 Suppl. 3: 35-42Crossref Google Scholar). However the difficulty of delivering these large polypeptides to their intended site of action in the central nervous system makes it desirable to understand the molecular basis of their action to aid in attempts to produce minimal agonists of the GFL receptor system. The GFLs signal through a unique multicomponent receptor complex, consisting of a high affinity glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored binding component (GFRα1-GFRα4) and the receptor tyrosine kinase RET. Extensive in vitro and in vivoexperimentation has supported the hypothesis that for each GFL there is a preferred GFRα receptor, to which the GFL binds with highest affinity and most potently activates RET.

Furthermore, the precise details of receptor complex formation and stoichiometry are also poorly characterized. The crystal structure of GDNF indicates that it is a disulfide-bonded dimer that is significantly similar to the structure of TGF-β2, as predicted by the cysteine spacing of its primary sequence (19.Daopin S. Piez K.A. Ogawa Y. Davies D.R. Science. 1992; 257: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 20.Schlunegger M.P. Grutter M.G. Nature. 1992; 358: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 21.Eigenbrot C. Gerber N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the structure itself yields only speculative information regarding receptor binding surfaces. Furthermore, analogy to other TGF-β superfamily members regarding receptor binding surfaces would likely be unfounded as the receptors used by GDNF and the TGF-βs are drastically different and likely hold no structural similarity. To characterize the structural requirements of GDNF for interacting with its receptors, we performed homologue-scanning mutagenesis, replacing short blocks (∼8 amino acids) of GDNF sequence with the homologous blocks from PSPN, which cannot bind or activate GFRα1·RET or GFRα2·RET. This screen identified two critical regions for the GDNF-GFRα1 interaction and at least one additional region critical for the alternate GDNF-GFRα2 interaction. These blocks are discontinuous along the primary sequence of GDNF but are directly adjacent along the second finger of GDNF when mapped to the crystal structure. We further demonstrate that these two regions from any of the GFRα1 agonists (GDNF, NRTN, or ARTN) are sufficient to activate GFRα1·RET in the context of the PSPN molecule and that these chimeric mutants function as GFRα1·RET-specific agonistsin vitro. Finally, we identify an additional region that is critical for the NRTN-GFRα2 and ARTN-GFRα3 interactions. These data identify a putative receptor interaction site shared by the GFLs to activate GFRα1·RET and identify additional determinants required for GDNF and NRTN to activate GFRα2·RET and for ARTN to activate GFRα3·RET. All mutants were produced by fusion polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. The amino acid sequence of rat GDNF, mouse NRTN and PSPN, and human ARTN was used for all constructs. Polymerase chain reaction products were directly cloned into the MluI and XbaI sites of plasmid pCB6 (22.Brewer C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the inserts were sequenced entirely. For mutant G-hf-GDNF the 6His-FLAG tag was inserted between the third and fourth residue of mature GDNF, making the sequence (N- … RLKR SPD-HHHHHHDYKDDDD-KQAL … -C). For mutant N-hf-GDNF, residues 1–38 were truncated from mature GDNF and attached to the prepro-region of NRTN. The resulting sequence was (N- … RRAR PGA-HHHHHHDYKDDDDK-RGCV … -C). For N-hf-ARTN, residues 1–13 were truncated from mature human ARTN and attached to the prepro-region of NRTN, with the resulting sequence (N- … RRAR PGA-HHHHHHDYKDDDDK-RGCR … -C). For mutant P-hf-PSPN, the tag was inserted between the third and fourth residue of mature PSPN, resulting in N- … RLPR ALA-HHHHHHDYKDDDDK-GSCR … -C. Expression plasmids for homologue-scanning mutants were produced as above by fusion polymerase chain reaction, and all were based on the N-hf-GDNF construct. For mutant protein production in COS cells, expression plasmids were transfected using the DEAE-dextran/Chloroquine method (23.Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). COS cells were plated onto 10- or 15-cm dishes, transfected, and switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal calf serum. After 4–5 days, conditioned medium was collected, cleared, and either concentrated using Centriprep-10 concentrators (Amicon) or purified by nickel chromatography (Qiagen). Proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Relative quantities of FLAG-tagged proteins were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay also using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Briefly, purified proteins or conditioned medium were coated to Nunc-Immuno MaxiSorp microtiter plates overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed (3× in Tris-buffered saline, 0.03% Tween 20), blocked (blocking solution: Tris-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 25 °C, washed again (5×), and then incubated with a 1:500 dilution of anti-FLAG M2 antibody in blocking solution for 1.5 h at 25 °C. After another wash (5×), plates were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies diluted 1:5000 in blocking solution. Finally, wells were washed 5×, and the presence of horseradish peroxidase was assayed by the addition of the chromogenic substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 0.5 mH2SO4, and color was measured in a plate reader at 450 nm. The absolute concentration of GDNF in purified and conditioned medium samples was determined for the G-hf-GDNF construct using the GDNF E-MAX enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Receptor activation assays were performed as described previously (4.Baloh R.H. Tansey M.G. Lampe P.A. Fahrner T.J. Enomoto H. Simburger K. Leitner M.L. Araki T. Johnson E.M.J. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1291-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). RET-3T3 cells were plated at 85,000 cells/well in 12-well plates and transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) with the reporter plasmids (250 ng/well Gal4-Luc, 50 ng/well Gal4-Elk), CMV-lacZ (50 ng/well) for transfection normalization, a CMV-GFRα (250 ng/well) expression plasmid, a mutant GFL construct (250 ng/well), and 650 ng/well pBluescript as a carrier for a total of 1.5 μg of DNA/well. Cells were switched to 0.5% serum-containing medium the morning after transfection and harvested 36 h later. The average luciferase activity of duplicate or triplicate samples was normalized to β-galactosidase activity of the cotransfected lacZ reporter. For the receptor complex formation assay, Neuro2a cells were transiently transfected using Superfect with an expression plasmid for rat GFRα1 with a FLAG tag inserted by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis after the signal sequence. Cells were treated with 25 ng/mL of the indicated factor for 6 h; the cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody conjugated to agarose (Sigma). After washing, the immunoprecipitated samples were visualized by immunoblotting with an anti-RET antibody (C-9, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The NBL-S proliferation assay and the SH-SY5Y differentiation assay were performed as described (4.Baloh R.H. Tansey M.G. Lampe P.A. Fahrner T.J. Enomoto H. Simburger K. Leitner M.L. Araki T. Johnson E.M.J. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1291-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Rat cerebellar granule cell dissection and culture was performed as described previously (24.Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Timed pregnant Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). At postnatal day 7, cerebella were dissected, cut into 1-mm pieces, and incubated for 15 min in 0.3 g/ml trypsin (Worthington) at 37 °C. The pieces were triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette in the presence of trypsin, and the resulting cell suspension was passed through a Nitex filter (size 3–20/14; Tetko, Elmsford, NY). Cells were plated at a density of 2.3 × 105 cells/cm2 in 4-well dishes (Nunc) coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine. Plating medium (K25 +S) consisted of basal medium Eagle (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 20 mmKCl, 100 unit/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To reduce the number of non-neuronal cells, 3.3 μg/ml aphidocholine was added to the medium 24 h after plating. Granule cell transfections were performed using a modified calcium phosphate protocol as described previously (25.Moulder K.L. Onodera O. Burke J.R. Strittmatter W.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 705-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for GFRα1, GFRα2, and RET are described elsewhere (11.Baloh R.H. Tansey M.G. Golden J.P. Creedon D.J. Heuckeroth R.O. Keck C.L. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Johnson E.M.J. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 793-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). At 5 daysin vitro, medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h. During this time, an equal volume of solution containing 0.25 m CaCl and 67 μg/ml DNA was added to a 2× HEPES-buffered saline (274 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mmNa2HPO4-7H2O (Fisher), 15 mm dextrose, and 42 mm HEPES (free acid), pH 7.07) and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 25 min. 30 μL of the precipitate (1 μg of DNA) were added to each 4-well dish and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then returned to plating medium. Transfection efficiency was approximately 0.2–0.5%. To quantify transfection results, the number of initial EGFP-positive cells in a defined area (minimum of 150 cells) of two to four wells (of a 4-well dish) per condition were counted 24 h after transfection, then rinsed the cultures twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and switched them to high potassium/serum (K25+S), low potassium/no serum (K5-S) medium alone, or K5-S supplemented with the indicated factors for 48 h. After this period, the number of enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive cells remaining in the originally defined area of the well was counted again to obtain the percentage neuronal survival. Amino acid sequence comparison and alignment was performed using the MegAlign program of the DNAstar software package. Molecular modeling and analysis was done using the Swiss PDB viewer (26.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar), and models were rendered using Mole software (Applied Thermodynamics). The GDNF structure was modeled after entry 1AGQ (21.Eigenbrot C. Gerber N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) of the Protein Data Bank. The “C/D” dimer from 1AGQ is shown, with the missing segment of monomer “C” built as determined for monomer “D.” An alignment of the mature rat GDNF with mouse NRTN, ARTN, and PSPN is shown in Fig. 1. Rat GDNF was the basis for all mutagenesis in this study because its structure has been determined (21.Eigenbrot C. Gerber N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The largest notable difference between the GFLs is the N-terminal extension before the first structural cysteine, which varies from 40 amino acids in GDNF to only 5 amino acids in NRTN and PSPN, and shows little similarity between the different family members. Furthermore GDNF, NRTN, and ARTN have multiple RXXR consensus subtilisin-like proprotein convertase cleavage sites (27.Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore multiple isoforms of these extensions are possible. The ones shown are consistent with N-terminal sequencing of GDNF and NRTN (2.Lin L.-F.H. Doherty D.H. Lile J.D. Bektesh S. Collins F. Science. 1993; 260: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2875) Google Scholar, 3.Kotzbauer P.T. Lampe P.A. Heuckeroth R.O. Golden J.P. Creedon D.J. Johnson E.M. Milbrandt J.D. Nature. 1996; 384: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), the single cleavage site in PSPN (5.Milbrandt J. de Sauvage F.J. Fahrner T.J. Baloh R.H. Leitner M.L. Tansey M.G. Lampe P.A. Heuckeroth R.O. Kotzbauer P.T. Simburger K.S. Golden J.P. Davies J.A. Vejsada R. Kato A.C. Hynes M. Sherman D. Nishimura M. Wang L.C. Vandlen R. Moffat B. Klein R.D. Poulsen K. Gray C. Garces A. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 245-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and a cleavage site conserved between mouse and human ARTN (4.Baloh R.H. Tansey M.G. Lampe P.A. Fahrner T.J. Enomoto H. Simburger K. Leitner M.L. Araki T. Johnson E.M.J. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1291-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To determine if the large N-terminal extension of GDNF is required for its activity, we took advantage of the differential processing of GDNF and NRTN by mammalian cells. Chimeric constructs with the prepro-region from NRTN attached to GDNF were generated, and we assessed both their processing and their ability to activate the GFRα1·RET receptor complex (Fig. 2). Tandem 6X histidine and FLAG tags were inserted after the RXXR cleavage site of GDNF or NRTN to allow purification and tracking of the proteins. When expressed in COS cells, similar quantities of tagged GDNF with its own pro-region (G-hf-GDNF) or the NRTN pro-region (N-hf-GDNF) could be purified from conditioned medium using nickel chromatography (Fig.2 B). Only species corresponding to the expected processing events were observed in the medium, indicating that the pro-domains of NRTN and GDNF are sufficient to direct proper processing of their different N-terminal extensions. To assess the ability of these proteins to activate the high affinity GDNF receptor, GFRα1·RET, we utilized the Gal4-Elk1/Gal4-luciferase reporter system as described previously (4.Baloh R.H. Tansey M.G. Lampe P.A. Fahrner T.J. Enomoto H. Simburger K. Leitner M.L. Araki T. Johnson E.M.J. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1291-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). This system monitors the level of RET activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which induces the Gal4-Elk1 fusion protein to activate the Gal4-luciferase reporter, giving a facile measure of receptor activation (28.Worby C.A. Vega Q.C. Chao H.H.-J. Seasholtz A.F. Thompson R.C. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3502-3508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29.York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmids, together with expression plasmids for GFRα1 and the indicated GDNF construct, were cotransfected into fibroblasts that stably express RET (Fig.2 C). Subsequently, the steady-state level of GFRα1·RET activation was measured after two days of autocrine ligand stimulation by the cells. Wild-type GDNF, G-hf-GDNF, and N-hf-GDNF all showed comparable activation of GFRα1·RET in this assay, whereas tagged PSPN constructs with either the PSPN or NRTN pro-region did not activate the receptor. These results are consistent with previous receptor activation and binding experiments indicating that GDNF, but not PSPN, can bind and activate RET through GFRα1 (4.Baloh R.H. Tansey M.G. Lampe P.A.

Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 245-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these data indicate that the N-terminal extension of GDNF is not required for its ability to activate the GFRα1·RET receptor complex, and the location of the epitope tag does not interfere with the function of GDNF. Although the crystal structure of GDNF is known, the molecular determinants for GDNF-GFRα receptor binding and specificity are currently undefined. To identify regions of GDNF that are required for its ability to activate the GFRα1·RET receptor complex, we utilized homologue-scanning mutagenesis together with the receptor activation assay described above. Ten GDNF mutants (termed “GPG” mutants) were generated by replacing blocks of nonconserved sequence from PSPN into GDNF (Fig.3, see Fig. 1 for sequence changes). This method allows comprehensive mutagenesis of sites responsible for the difference in the ability of GDNF and PSPN to activate GFRα1·RET and is highly likely to maintain structural integrity of the mutants because the replacements are from a homologous (and likely structurally similar) protein. All mutants were produced at similar quantities when transfected into COS cells, and the processing of each appeared normal (Fig. 3 B). Comparison of the GPG mutants with GDNF revealed that although many mutants showed slightly decreased activity, only one (GPG-F2a) completely lost the ability to activate the GFRα1·RET receptor (Fig. 4 A). This region maps to the bottom of the GDNF molecule along the second finger (Fig.4 B) (21.Eigenbrot C. Gerber N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The only other notable mutant that consistently showed activity 60% or lower than full-length GDNF was GPG-F2c, which maps to the strand adjacent to the region F2a along the bottom of the molecule. It is well established that GDNF is also capable of binding and activating the GFRα2·RET receptor, albeit with a lower affinity than NRTN (11.Baloh R.H. Tansey M.G. Golden J.P. Creedon D.J.

Site-directed mutagenesis of Ser-154 abolished the phosphorylation by recombinant CDK2 in vitro and the majority of cyclin A phosphorylation in the cell. Activation of CDK2 and binding to SKP2 or p27KIP1 were not affected by the phosphorylation of Ser-154. Surprising, in marked contrast to cyclin E, where phosphorylation of Thr-380 by CDK2 is required for proteolysis, degradation of cyclin A was not affected by Ser-154 phosphorylation.

Cyclin B is associated with CDC2 and the cyclin B-CDC2 complexes regulate entry into M phase (1.King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes are important for progression through S phase and the G1/S transition, respectively (2.Sherr C.J.

D-type cyclins are associated with CDK4 and CDK6, and the complexes are required for G1 progression (2.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of CDK is tightly regulated by an intricate system of phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions (4.Poon R.Y.C. Bertino J.R. Encyclopedia of Cancer. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 246-255Google Scholar, 5.Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). By definition, the activation of CDKs is dependent on the association with a cyclin subunit. The post-translational regulation of cyclins occurs mainly through degradation (6.Koepp D.M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1999; 97: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The mitotic cyclins are degraded near the end of anaphase by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, consisting of a nonspecific ubiquitin-activating enzyme, a ubiquitin-carrier protein, a cyclin-specific ubiquitin ligase known as the cyclosome or anaphase-promoting complex (APC), and a constitutively active proteasome complex. The N-terminal destruction box sequences of the mitotic cyclins are required for their degradation (7.Yamano H. Tsurumi C. Gannon J. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), possibly because they are recognized by the cyclin-specific ubiquitin ligase enzyme. Recent biochemical and genetic studies have demonstrated that vertebrate APC contains at least eight subunits (APC1–APC8) (8.Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The activity of APC is highly regulated, turning on in anaphase and persist until late G1 (9.Brandeis M. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10.Amon A. Irniger S. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 77: 1037-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Association between APC and the WD40 repeat-containing protein Hct1p (also known as Cdh1p) is required for the degradation of mitotic cyclins in yeast (11.Schwab M. Lutum A.S. Seufert W. Cell. 1997; 90: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). From S phase onward, phosphorylation of Hct1p by CDKs blocked the Hct1p-APC interaction (12.Zachariae W. Schwab M. Nasmyth K. Seufert W. Science. 1998; 282: 1721-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), allowing the mitotic cyclins to accumulate until anaphase. After anaphase, cyclin destruction is initiated by the dephosphorylation of Hct1p by the phosphatase Cdc14p (13.Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 14.Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Morgan D.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Cdc14p is sequestered in the nucleolus by anchoring to Cfi1p for most of the cell cycle and is only released from the nucleolus to act on its targets during anaphase (15.Visintin R. Hwang E.S. Amon A. Nature. 1999; 398: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Polo-like kinase (Cdc5p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is activated by cyclin B-CDC2, and activated Polo-like kinase phosphorylates components of APC and promotes the ubiquitination of cyclin B (16.Shirayama M.

Cell. 1998; 1: 371-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A, on the other hand, phosphorylates two subunits of APC but suppresses APC activity (18.Kotani S. Tugendreich S. Fujii M. Jorgensen P.M. Watanabe N. Hoog C. Hieter P. Todokoro K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 371-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The high activity of Polo-like kinase and low activity of protein kinase A at metaphase may contribute to the activation of APC. Cdc5p itself is degraded by Hct1p-APC-dependent mechanism in G1, which could provide a feedback mechanism by which the APC destroys its activator at the onset of the next cell cycle. Unlike the mitotic cyclins, the G1 cyclins do not have a destruction box but do contain PEST sequences at the C-terminal portion of the protein that are partly responsible for the relatively short half-life of these cyclins (19.Salama S.R.

Similarly, phosphorylation of human cyclin E (on Thr-380) and cyclin D1 (on Thr-286) is important for their ubiquitin-dependent degradation (22.Clurman B.E. Sheaff R.J. Thress K. Groudine M. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 23.Won K.A. Reed S.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4182-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 24.Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CDK2 partner of cyclin E can phosphorylate cyclin E at Thr-380, but the CDK4 partner of cyclin D1 is apparently not responsible for cyclin D1 Thr-286 phosphorylation. Instead, Thr-286 can be phosphorylated by GSK-3β, linking cyclin D1 turnover to mitogen signal transduction pathways (25.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination of Cln cyclins involves their phosphorylation-dependent association with SCF complexes. The current model is that cullins (Cdc53p in yeast), together with SKP1, RBX1/ROC1 (or Hrt1p), and an F box-containing protein, assemble into a cyclin-specific ubiquitin ligase complex named SCF. CDC34 (ubiquitin-carrier protein enzyme) and SCF complexes containing the same SKP1, cullin, and RBX1/ROC1 but different F box-containing proteins may target different proteins for ubiquitination. For the Cln cyclins, SCFGRR1 binds to phosphorylated Cln1p and Cln2p and targets their destruction (26.Seol J.H. Feldman R.M. Zachariae W. Shevchenko A. Correll C.C. Lyapina S. Chi Y. Galova M.

Cyclin A is one of the first cyclins to be identified and is believed to function between that of cyclin E and cyclin B. Cyclin A can associate with both CDK2 (also a cyclin E partner) and CDC2 (also a cyclin B partner) in somatic cells. Two forms of A-type cyclins, cyclin A1 and cyclin A2, which represent the embryonic and somatic A-type cyclins, respectively, are present in higher eukaryotes. Disruption of cyclin A1 in mice leads to a block of the first meiotic division in male mice (32.Liu D. Matzuk M.M. Sung W.K. Guo Q. Wang P. Wolgemuth D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). On the other hand, disruption of cyclin A2 causes early embryonic lethality (33.Murphy M. Stinnakre M.G. Senamaud-Beaufort C. Winston N.J. Sweeney C. Kubelka M. Carrington M. Brechot C. Sobczak- Thepot J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Cyclin A-CDK2 associates with the SCFSKP2 complex (34.Lyapina S.A. Correll C.C. Kipreos E.T. Deshaies R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7451-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 35.Michel J.J. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 435-449PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Lisztwan J. Marti A. Sutterluty H. Gstaiger M. Wirbelauer C. Krek W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 368-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). SKP2 is overexpressed in many cancer cells (37.Yam C.H. Ng R.W.M. Siu W.Y. Lau A.W.S. Poon R.Y.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 38.Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), but the precise function of cyclin A-CDK2-SCFSKP2 complex is unclear. One possibility is that cyclin A-CDK2 that binds SCFSKP2 phosphorylates substrates that are subsequently targeted for degradation by the SCFSKP2 complex, since there is a propensity for SCF complexes to interact only with the phosphorylated forms of their targets. One potential target of SCFSKP2 is p27KIP1; SCFSKP2 interacts with the Thr-187-phosphorylated form of p27KIP1 and targets p27KIP1 for ubiquitination (39.Tsvetkov L.M. Yeh K.H. Lee S.J. Sun H. Zhang H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Degradation of the transcription factor E2F-1 has also been linked to its interaction with SCFSKP2 (40.Marti A. Wirbelauer 1 C. Scheffner M. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), but phosphorylation of E2F-1 is apparently not required in this case. Given that the degradation of mammalian cyclin D, cyclin E, and the yeast Cln cyclins is linked to phosphorylation by CDKs and other kinases, it is interesting to see whether the degradation of the mammalian cyclin A is also linked to its phosphorylation by CDKs. By using in vitro and in vivo degradation assays, we showed that the degradation of cyclin A can be inhibited by a kinase-inactive mutant of CDK2, a kinase-inactive mutant of CDC2, and the CDK inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1. Since one obvious explanation of these results is that cyclin A degradation may involve CDK-dependent phosphorylation of cyclin A, we next identified the CDK phosphorylation site in cyclin A as Ser-154. Surprising, we found that mutation of the cyclin A phosphorylation site to alanine did not affect the degradation of cyclin A. Degradation of cyclin E was also inhibited by kinase-inactive CDK2. But in contrast to cyclin A, mutation of the CDK phosphorylation site in cyclin E (Thr-380) to alanine inhibited the degradation of cyclin E. All cyclin A used in this study were from human somatic cyclin A2. Cyclin A in pGEM4 (a gift from Dr. Tong Hunter, Salk Institute) was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-GCAGCCATGGTGGGCAACTCT-3′ (cyclin A forward) and 5′-TGAATTCTTACAGATTTAGTGTCTCTGG-3′ (cyclin A reverse), cut withNcoI-EcoRI, and put into pUHD-P1 (37.Yam C.H.

TheNcoI-XhoI fragment of cyclin A in pET21d was put into pGEX-KG to create GST-cyclin A in pGEX-KG. Site-directed mutagenesis of cyclin A was constructed by a PCR method as described elsewhere (41.Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 217-247Google Scholar), using cyclin A forward and cyclin A reverse primers and the oligonucleotide 5′-AGTTTTGAGGCACCACATA-3′ and its antisense to introduce the mutation; the PCR product was cut withNcoI-EcoRI and ligated into pUHD-P1 or pET21d. Cyclin A in pET21d was cut with NcoI-XhoI and put into pGEX-KG to create GST-cyclin A(S154A) in pGEX-KG. Cyclin A(NΔ171) in pET21d was a gift from Dr. Tim Hunt (ICRF, UK).

Human B-cell antigen CD20 in pCMX was as described previously (37.Yam C.H. Ng R.W.M. Siu W.Y. Lau A.W.S. Poon R.Y.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged ubiquitin for bacterial expression was a gift from Tim Hunt (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, UK). HtTA1 cells (gifts from Dr. Hermann Bujard) are HeLa cells (human cervical carcinoma) stably transfected with pUHD15–1 expressing the tTA tetracycline repressor chimera (45.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar) and can express genes cloned into the pUHD-P1, pUHD-P2, or pLINX vectors in the absence of deoxycycline (1 μg/ml to turn off expression). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells were obtained as described previously (44.Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). LLnL (also called MG101) was used at 50 μm for 16 h. Cells were blocked at G2/M by incubation in medium containing 0.1 μg/ml nocodazole for 16 h. G1 cells were obtained 4 h after released from the nocodazole block. Cells were blocked in S phase by incubation in medium containing 2 mm hydroxyurea for 24 h. Semiconfluent HtTA1 cells (10-cm diameter plates) were transiently transfected with constructs (10 μg) by the calcium phosphate method (46.Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA for each transfection was adjusted to the same level using vectors containing the same promoter. Cells were grown for a further 24 h after transfection before being harvested for cell extracts. For preparation of cell extracts for destruction assays, cells were lysed in a hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and sonicated on ice for 5 min. The lysate were frozen at −80 °C, then thawed on ice, and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 10 min to pellet the insoluble materials. For other purposes, cell extracts were prepared with a Nonidet P-40 lysis method as described elsewhere (44.Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of cell lysates was measured with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay system (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as standards. In promoter turn-off experiments, two 10-cm dishes of cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids as described above. At 16 h after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, and split into six identical 60-mm plates. After growing for another 24 h, deoxycycline (1 μg/ml) was added to the medium, and the cells were harvested at the indicated time. Flow cytometry analysis was essentially as described previously (37.Yam C.H. Ng R.W.M. Siu W.Y. Lau A.W.S. Poon R.Y.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 47.Siu W.Y. Arooz T. Poon R.Y.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Semiconfluent cells were transiently transfected with a vector expressing CD20 surface marker (2 μg). After transfection (16 h), the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and grown in fresh medium for another 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Dako) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and stained with a solution containing propidium iodide (40 μg/ml) and RNase A (40 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cell cycle distribution of the CD20-positive (transfected) cells and the CD20-negative (non-transfected) cells was analyzed with a FACSort machine (Becton Dickinson). Coupled transcription-translation reactions in the presence of [35S]methionine in rabbit reticulocyte lysate were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Expression and purification of GST- and histidine-tagged proteins were as described previously (42.Poon R.Y. Yamashita K. Adamczewski J.P. Hunt T. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3123-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thrombin cleavage of fusion proteins was as described (48.Poon R.Y.C. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Human cyclin A translated in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine (1 μl) was mixed with 9 μl of buffer or nocodazole-blocked cell extracts (or other cell extracts as stated). Alternatively, when two different extracts were used, 1 μl of reticulocyte lysate was mixed with 4.5 μl of nocodazole-blocked extract and 4.5 μl of another cell extract. In some experiments, LLnL (50 μm) and ubiquitin-H6 (0.1 mg/ml) were added to the reactions. The reactions were supplemented with an energy mix (final concentration of 25 mm phosphocreatine, 10 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 1 mm ATP). Unless stated otherwise, the reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min and stopped by addition of SDS-sample buffer. Histone H1 kinase assays were performed as described (48.Poon R.Y.C. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis after partial acid hydrolysis was performed on 32PO4-labeled polypeptides after transfer to Immobilon (Millipore) as described (49.Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acids were separated on cellulose TLC plates (Schleicher & Schuell) by electrophoresis at 1600 V for 60 min with pH 1.9 buffer, followed by thin layer chromatography using the phospho-chromatography buffer (50.van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 422-450Crossref Google Scholar). To label cells with 32P, cells were grown to about 80% confluent, and the medium was changed to phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% v/v PBS-dialyzed calf serum. After incubation in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 10% CO2, the medium was changed to phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% v/v PBS-dialyzed calf serum and 1 mCi/ml 32P. The cells were labeled for 4 h before harvested for cell extracts preparation. To phosphorylate cyclin A by CDK2 in vitro, bacterially expressed protein A-cyclin A or thrombin-cleaved GST-cyclin A (10 μg/ml) were mixed with CAK-activated GST-CDK2 (10 μg/ml) in the presence of 15 mm Mg(OAc)2, 30 μm ATP, and 1.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 30 min. Monoclonal antibody M2 against FLAG tag was obtained from Eastman Koda Co. Rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibodies were gifts from Dr. Katsumi Yamashita (Kanazawa University, Japan) or from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-807). Monoclonal antibody G173–524 against p27KIP1 was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA).

Rat monoclonal antibodies YL1/2 against mammalian tubulin (37.Yam C.H. Ng R.W.M. Siu W.Y. Lau A.W.S. Poon R.Y.C. Mol. Cell.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5168-5178PubMed Google Scholar) were as described previously. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (44.Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Cyclin A (but not cyclin B) is destroyed when cells are arrested at G2/M with drugs like nocodazole. We first investigated the degradation of cyclin A by translating cyclin A in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine, and we mixed the cyclin A with extracts of HeLa cells that were synchronized in different phases of the cell cycle. Fig.1 A shows that cyclin A was destroyed when incubated with a nocodazole-blocked extract (lane 2). In contrast, cyclin A was not destroyed when incubated with cell extracts derived from cells in G1, S, G2, or G0 phase of the cell cycle. The destruction of the cyclin A by nocodazole-blocked extracts was inhibited by the addition of the calpain/proteasome inhibitor LLnL (lane 7). On higher exposure of the PhosphorImager (middle panel), higher molecular size forms of cyclin A can be seen in the presence of nocodazole-blocked extracts and LLnL. Reticulocyte lysate-translated SKP2 were used instead of cyclin A as a control (bottom panel), and this showed that the level of SKP2 was not altered when incubated with the nocodazole-blocked extracts. Instead, we observed mobility shifts of the SKP2 that was due to phosphorylation of Ser-76 by CDKs (37.Yam C.H. Ng R.W.M. Siu W.Y. Lau A.W.S. Poon R.Y.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The destruction of cyclin A in our in vitro system was dependent on the presence of the N-terminal destruction box. Fig.1 B shows that deletion of the N terminus to residue 171 (NΔ171) inhibited the destruction of cyclin A by the nocodazole-blocked extracts. When reticulocyte lysate-translated cyclin B1 was used instead of cyclin A, we found that cyclin B1 was destroyed in G1 phase cell extracts but not by S phase or nocodazole-blocked extracts (Fig. 1 C). Collectively, these data indicate that we have established an in vitro assay for cyclin A destruction by nocodazole-blocked extracts that was specific for cyclin A but not for cyclin B1. We next investigated whether the destruction of cyclin A by nocodazole-blocked extracts was affected by cyclin A-associated proteins. Reticulocyte lysate-produced cyclin A and SKP2 were mixed with nocodazole-blocked extracts. A third cell extracts from cells transfected with either control vector or a dominant-negative kinase-dead mutant of CDK2 (K33R, Lys-33 mutated to Arg) were added to the reaction. Fig. 1 D shows that as before cyclin A was destroyed while SKP2 control was relatively stable in the nocodazole-blocked extracts. Expression of CDK2(K33R) clearly inhibited the destruction of cyclin A (lanes 9–12). As a further control, expression of components of SCFSKP2 complexes did not significantly affect the rate of cyclin A"

NOSs are homodimers composed of 130–160-kDa subunits, each comprising an N-terminal oxygenase domain that contains binding sites for heme, l-arginine, and (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4B) and a C-terminal reductase domain that contains binding sites for NADPH, FAD, and FMN (5.Chen P.-F.

As in cytochrome P-450 and chloroperoxidase, the heme of the oxygenase domain is axially coordinated to the thiol group of an endogenous cysteine residue. The electron flow from the reductase domain to the heme domain is controlled by a Ca2+/calmodulin binding site located in the central portion of each of the NOS isoforms (11.Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S.

Several lines of evidence indicate that the heme-iron is involved in NO synthesis. NOS activity is inhibited by carbon monoxide (12.White K.A.

The H4B cofactor also binds in the vicinity of the heme, close to the heme propionates in a perpendicular orientation. Both the substrate and H4B molecules participate in an extensive hydrogen bond network that includes a heme propionate, water molecules, and several amino acids. The proximity of thel-arginine binding site to the heme is consistent with the interactions of substrates with heme-bound ligands such as CO, NO, and imidazole, which were revealed by optical (19.McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), EPR (20.Migita C.T. Salerno J.C. Masters B.S.S. Martasek P. McMillan K. Ikeda-Saito M.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12660-12665Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, the substrates and H4B, when present, cause a shift in the spin state of the ferric enzyme (24.Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is not clear if H4B is also involved in catalysis, although recent results suggest that H4B may provide an electron required for oxygen activation (25.Bec N. Gorren A.C. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The formation of nitric oxide by NOSs involves the NADPH-dependent oxidation of l-arginine to citrulline using oxygen as a co-substrate. The complete enzymatic cycle requires two successive hydroxylation reactions proceeding viaN ω-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA) as an intermediate (26.Stuehr D.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Griffith O.W. Feldman P.L. Wiseman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6259-6263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first steps in the catalytic cycle of NOS are thought to involve reduction of the heme and binding of an oxygen molecule. Subsequently, the hydroxylation of l-arginine to NOHA is thought to occur through a P-450 type mechanism involving an oxyferryl porphyrin π cation complex, Fe4+= O, while the second step, the hydroxylation of NOHA to citrulline and NO, has been suggested to involve a hydroperoxo species, Fe3+(OOH), formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the substrate NOHA (27.Clague M.J. Wishnok J.S. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14465-14473Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recent results with the oxygenase domain of nNOS (nNOSoxy) (28.Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 30.Sato H. Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed the formation of intermediates characterized by optical spectra that are consistent with the formation of the dioxygen complex, although different optical spectra were reported depending on the specific technique that was used. To obtain detailed structural information about intermediates of the NOS catalytic cycle, we have used resonance Raman spectroscopy to characterize oxygenated intermediates of nNOSoxy generated by the rapid mixing of the ferrous enzyme with oxygen. We show the rapid formation of the ferrous dioxygen species following mixing, and we unambiguously identify the O-O stretching mode of the heme-bound dioxygen molecule. We also show that the νO-O line is insensitive to the presence of substrates and H4B. The data from the oxy complexes are in contrast to results obtained with carbon monoxide that revealed steric or polar interactions between the CO and thel-arginine molecules and thereby define structural differences between the ferrous dioxygen and carbon monoxide complexes. H4B was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). NOHA and l-arginine were from Sigma. N2 and 16O2 gas were from Tech Air, and 18O2 gas was from Icon (Mt. Marion, NY). The oxygenase domain of nNOS was expressed in Escherichia coli from the cloned cDNA and was purified as described previously (28.Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) in the absence ofl-arginine and H4B. The hemoprotein concentration was determined from the absorbance at 444 nm of the CO complex using an extinction coefficient of 76 mm−1 cm−1 (14.Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When required,l-arginine, H4B, and NOHA were added to the purified enzyme in 100-, 3–5-, and 10-fold excess concentration over heme, respectively. The incubation of the enzyme with substrates and cofactor was performed at room temperature for ∼12 h. The binding of these compounds was followed by optical spectroscopy from the change in the spin state of the ferric enzyme (31.Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The enzyme preparations were then used immediately without freezing. The buffer used for kinetic measurements was 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, containing 1 mmdl-dithiothreitol. To prepare the ferrous form of nNOSoxy, the ferric enzyme (80–125 μm) was equilibrated with prepurified nitrogen gas for 30 min at room temperature, and the heme was then reduced with sodium dithionite. The amount of sodium dithionite used was sufficient to reduce the enzyme and leave an excess of 50 μm over heme. The concentration of the dithionite solution used to reduce nNOSoxy was determined from the reduction of ferric cytochrome c. Complete reduction of nNOSoxy was verified by optical spectroscopy. Oxygen-containing buffer solutions were prepared by equilibrating deoxygenated buffer with16O2 or 18O2 at 1 atmosphere pressure. The rapid mixer used here was described previously (32.Takahashi S. Yeh S.R. Das T.K. Chan C.K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Prior to use, oxygen was removed from the mixer, the observation chamber, and the buffer lines with a solution of 10 mm sodium dithionite, which was left in the apparatus for 1 h. The apparatus was then washed with anaerobic buffer containing 50 μm sodium dithionite prior to connecting the syringes containing the ferrous protein and oxygen-saturated buffer. The output at 413.1 nm from a krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics), ∼50 milliwatts, was focused to a ∼30-μm spot on the continuously flowing sample in the flow cell. The position of the laser focusing point was moved along the flow direction to obtain the desired time point. The flow rate used varied between 1.2 and 1.5 μs/μm. The data were measured at time delays after mixing ranging from 0.6 to 3 ms. All measurements were recorded at room temperature (∼25 °C). The resonance Raman spectra were calibrated with the lines of indene. The resonance Raman spectrum of reduced cytochrome c was recorded prior to each mixing experiment and was used to adjust small differences in the calibration of spectra from different mixing experiments. To obtain the optical spectrum of the ferric, reduced, and ferrous dioxygen forms of nNOSoxy, the light emitted by a UV-visible lamp was focused on the flow cell, and the transmitted light was collected and focused on the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The grating used was 30 lines/mm instead of the 1200 lines/mm grating used to record resonance Raman spectra. The optical spectra were calibrated with the lines in the absorption spectrum of holmium oxide. To obtain the resonance Raman spectrum of the oxygenated form of the nNOSoxy domain, we first measured the spectrum of the ferric protein as shown in Fig.1 a. The high frequency of the strong line at 1371.5 cm−1, ν4, the oxidation state marker line, confirms the ferric oxidation state of the heme. Upon reduction by minimal dithionite the ferrous spectrum, shown in Fig. 1 b, is obtained, in which ν4 shifts to lower frequency, forming a doublet with maxima at 1349 and 1359 cm−1. When the reduced enzyme is reacted with oxygen, using a submillisecond continuous flow mixer (32.Takahashi S. Yeh S.R. Das T.K. Chan C.K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the spectrum shown in Fig. 1 c is obtained within 0.6 ms of the mixing. As in the oxy forms of other heme proteins, the oxidation state marker line as well as the other lines in the spectrum shift to frequencies similar to those seen in the oxidized forms of the heme. However, the line in the 1132-cm−1 region is noticeably stronger in the spectrum of the oxygen-reacted species than in either of the other forms of the nNOSoxy domain. To determine if any oxygenated products contribute to the spectrum, the reaction was carried out both with 16O2 and18O2. Most significantly, the strong line observed at 1132 cm−1 when the reaction was carried out with 16O2 (Fig.2 a) was weaker in the presence of 18O2, and a new line appeared at 1068 cm−1 (Fig. 2 b). We attribute the low intensity line, which remained at 1132-cm−1 in the Fe2+(18O2) spectrum, to an overlapping porphyrin mode based on similar observations in ferrous dioxygen complexes of myoglobin (33.Kerr E.A., Yu, N.-T. Bartnicki D.E. Mizukami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8360-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cytochrome P450 (34.Hu S. Schneider A.J. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4815-4822Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This porphyrin mode is canceled in the Fe2+(16O2) minus Fe2+(18O2) difference spectrum and the oxygen-sensitive line is then very well defined with a strong positive peak at 1135 cm−1 and a strong negative peak at 1068 cm−1 (Fig. 2 c). We assign the 1135-cm−1 line as the νO-O stretching mode of the ferrous dioxygen complex of nNOSoxy based on the observed isotope frequency shift, ΔνO-O = 67 cm−1, which is in good agreement with the theoretical value, ΔνO-O = 65 cm−1, expected for a diatomic harmonic oscillator for iron and O2. Also, a line present at a similar position in the spectrum of the oxygenated complex of cytochrome P450cam and in model P-450 compounds was assigned as the νO-O stretching mode of the oxygen-bound heme (TableI). No other oxygen-sensitive line was detected in the Fe2+(O2) spectrum of nNOSoxy from 400 to 1200 cm−1 in the 0.6–3-ms time range we examined.Table IFrequencies of the Raman lines of the dioxygen adducts of nNOSoxy, cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450 model compounds, and hemoglobinCompoundProximal ligandδFe-O-OνFe-O-OνO-OReferencecm −1cm −1cm −1nNOSoxyCysNDaND, not determined.ND1135 (1068)This workP450cam/camphorCys402 (381)540 (510)1139 (1073)Refs. 34.Hu S.

The νO-O line of Fe2+(O2) nNOSoxy is located at a similar frequency as that of Fe2+(O2) P450cam, 1139 cm−1, as well as other oxygenated complexes of heme proteins (Table I). With cytochrome P450 model compounds, it has been shown that the νO–O line of the ferrous dioxygen complex is sensitive to modifications of the axial-thiolate ligand (34.Hu S. Schneider A.J. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4815-4822Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Table I). Crystallographic data indicate that in iNOSoxy and chloroperoxidase, the proximal cysteine is involved in additional hydrogen bonds with surrounding residues as compared with cytochrome P450 (35.Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1997; 278: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 36.Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with resonance Raman studies of the CO complexes of nNOS and chloroperoxidase, which indicate that the cysteine-iron linkage is weaker in these proteins than in cytochrome P450 (21.Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4595-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus the slightly lower frequency of the νO-Oline in nNOSoxy may result from a weaker iron-cysteine bond as compared with that of cytochrome P450. By resonance Raman scattering, we have unambiguously identified the ferrous dioxygen intermediate of nNOSoxy produced by the rapid mixing of the reduced enzyme with oxygen. To compare this intermediate with those reported by others, we have recorded the optical spectrum of this species in the same continuous flow mixing apparatus that was used to obtain the resonance Raman spectrum. In the optical spectrum, recorded 0.6 ms after mixing (Fig.3), the wavelength maximum of the Soret band is located at 430 nm, a value very close to that of the oxygenated intermediates of nNOSoxy (28.Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and full-length nNOS (30.Sato H. Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) generated in stopped flow apparatus by the rapid mixing of the ferrous enzymes with oxygen (427 nm) (Table II). The Soret band of the dioxygen complex of nNOS and nNOSoxy is located at a higher value than that of the dioxygen complex of cytochrome P450, 418 nm, but at a similar position to that of chloroperoxidase (∼430 nm) (TableII). The longer wavelength for the Soret transition in chloroperoxidase has been suggested to result from a more polar heme pocket as compared with that in cytochrome P450 (37.Sono M. Eble K.S. Dawson J.H. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15530-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the wavelength maximum of the dioxygen complex of a heme-mercaptide P-450 model compound exhibits a strong dependence on the polarity of the solvent, ranging from 422 nm in hydrophobic solvent to 430 nm in more polar solvent (38.Budyka M.F. Khenkin A.M. Shteinman A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In NOS, although the heme pocket is mostly hydrophobic, several polar amino acids are close to the substrate binding site, including tyrosine 367, glutamate 371, and the carboxyl group of tryptophan 366, and may increase the polarity of the environment around the oxygen binding site (16.Crane B.R.

On the other hand, the longer wavelength for the Soret transition of Fe2+(O2) nNOS may be caused by proximal effects resulting from the additional hydrogen bonds to the heme cysteine ligand (35.Crane B.R.

Open table in a new tab The optical spectrum of the dioxygen complex of nNOS and nNOSoxy, obtained by the rapid mixing of the ferrous enzyme with oxygen, differs from that reported for the dioxygen complexes of nNOS (25.Bec N.

In the latter studies, performed at −30 °C, the wavelength maximum of the Soret band was observed at 416 and 419 nm, respectively. For cytochrome P450 and chloroperoxidase, the optical spectrum of the dioxygen complex does not appear to be affected by temperature (Table II). Experiments are currently under way to record low temperature resonance Raman spectra of Fe2+O2 nNOSoxy to determine if the intermediate obtained at low temperature by other groups is the dioxygen complex nNOS and, if so, to determine what structural changes can explain the different optical spectra. The intermediates obtained by the two methods differ in another way. At low temperature, the oxygenated complex of the oxygenase domain could be observed only in the presence of substrate and biopterin (29.Ledbetter A.P. McMillan K. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Dawson J.H. Sono M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8014-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), presumably because in their absence, the complex is not stable and the initial ferrous form of the enzyme decayed to the ferric form without forming a detectable intermediate. Here, the ferrous dioxygen complex of nNOSoxy is formed in the absence or presence of substrate and H4B (see below) as was reported previously (28.Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the oxygenase domain of eNOS and iNOS revealed that thel-arginine and H4B binding sites are located close to the heme (16.Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D.

Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). To determine if substrates and H4B interact with the heme-bound dioxygen molecule, we have performed rapid mixing experiments with l-arginine- or NOHA-saturated enzyme in the presence and absence of H4B. The resonance Raman spectrum of the dioxygen intermediate obtained with these preparations, recorded 1.5–3 ms after mixing, is similar to the one recorded in the absence of l-arginine and H4B. Again, a strong positive line at 1135 cm−1 and a strong negative line at 1068 cm−1were detected in the Fe2+(16O2) minus Fe2+(18O2) difference spectra (Fig. 2, d–g). No other oxygen-sensitive line was observed in the 400–1200-cm−1 region. Since we observe no difference in the O-O stretching mode between the H4B-free and the H4B-bound enzyme, our results demonstrate that the ∼10-fold increase in the autoxidation rate of the ferrous dioxygen complex of nNOSoxy containing H4B, measured by Abu-Soudet al. (28.Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), results from a change in the electron transfer rates that does not originate from the substrate or the H4B directly interacting with the bound oxygen. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that at longer reaction times there may be differences. It is somewhat surprising that the binding of substrates and H4B have no detectable effect on the position of the νO-O line. In CO-nNOS, it was shown that the heme pocket undergoes a conformational change upon binding ofl-arginine that results in a shift of the νFe-CO line from 487/501 to 503 cm−1, a shift of the δFe-CO line from 562 to 566 cm−1, and a shift of the νC-O line from 1930/1949 to 1929 cm−1 (21.Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4595-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23.Fan B. Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12660-12665Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In thel-arginine-bound conformation, it was concluded that the heme pocket adopts a closed structure, where the substrate exerts a strong polar and/or steric effect on the heme-bound CO molecule. Because of the apparent absence of interaction between the substrate and the heme-bound dioxygen molecule in the ferrous dioxygen complex, we have examined the interaction of substrates with CO in CO-nNOSoxy. In the absence of substrate and H4B, a broad νFe-CO line was identified at 491 cm−1, and the δFe-CO line was identified at 562 cm−1(Fig. 4, c–e). Withl-arginine- andl-arginine/H4B-bound enzyme, the νFe-CO and the δFe-CO line were detected at 502 cm−1 and 565 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 4,a and b). These results indicate that the heme pocket structure of the oxygenase domain is similar to that of the full-length enzyme. Therefore, the observations of interactions between the substrates and the heme-bound CO are in contrast to the case of the oxygenated heme of nNOSoxy, in which the substrate does not display any strong steric/polar interactions with the dioxygen molecule. Several hypotheses could explain these observations. First, the vibrational modes of the oxygen molecule may not be very responsive to steric/polar interactions involving nearby residues. In myoglobin, it was shown that the resonance Raman lines associated with the Fe-O2 linkage are not as sensitive as those of the Fe-CO linkage to the mutation of amino acid residues of the heme pocket. This was suggested to occur because the dioxygen molecule is highly polar and exists in only one resonance structure, while the CO molecule is apolar and exists in two resonance structures that involve net changes in bond order and alteration in the charge of the oxygen atom (42.Hirota S. Li T. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mukai M. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7845-7846Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A second explanation could be that the dioxygen molecule of Fe2+(O2) nNOSoxy adopts a different orientation in the heme pocket as compared with that of CO. Typically, the heme-bound CO molecule adopts a nearly linear conformation (39.Kachalova G.S. Popov A.N. Bartunik H.D. Science. 1999; 284: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 40.Edwards S.L. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2588-2595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Raag R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), while in oxy complexes, the dioxygen molecule is bent with an angle of ∼120o (42.Hirota S. Li T. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mukai M. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7845-7846Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). If this is the case in nNOSoxy, then the bending of the dioxygen molecule away from l-arginine could explain the absence of interaction of the dioxygen molecule with substrate. Third, the structure of the heme pocket of the Fe2+(O2) nNOSoxy complex could differ in such a way that the l-arginine molecule is located at a greater distance from the heme-iron as compared with its position in the CO complex, thus decreasing polar/steric interactions between the substrate and the dioxygen molecule. Last, we cannot exclude the possibility that in substrate-free Fe2+(O2) nNOSoxy, the dioxygen molecule is involved in steric/polar interactions with a heme pocket residue. This proposition could account for the fact that in substrate-free CO nNOS (21.Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4595-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and CO nNOSoxy (Fig.4 c), approximately half of the enzyme adopts the closed conformation with the νFe-CO line at 502 cm−1. The cofactor is not responsible for the fraction of enzyme that adopts the closed conformation, since this splitting is observed in the absence of biopterin (Fig. 4 c). Therefore, in the closed conformations of substrate-free CO nNOSoxy, it is likely that an amino acid residue or water molecule(s) interact with the CO. A similar situation could occur with oxygen. If this is the case, then the involvement of an amino acid residue or water molecule with the dioxygen molecule in substrate-free nNOSoxy could mask the effect of l-arginine in the Fe2+(O2) complex of substrate-bound enzyme. The measurements that we have reported here unequivocally demonstrate the formation of the ferrous dioxygen complex of the oxygenase domain of nNOS shortly after rapid mixing oxygen with the ferrous enzyme. The optical spectrum of the ferrous dioxygen species of nNOSoxy shows that the Soret band is located at 430 nm, in good agreement with previous experiments performed with a stopped flow apparatus at 10 °C, but different from the values of the Soret band reported for oxygenated complexes obtained at low temperature. Further experiments are needed to characterize the structure of the intermediate detected at −30 °C in which the Soret transition is located at 416–419 nm. Finally, the observation of the oxygen-oxygen stretching mode in the oxy complex lays the foundation for identifying other oxygen modes such as those associated with the activated oxygen intermediates and thereby unraveling the catalytic mechanism of this fascinating enzyme."

Both membrane and soluble CD14 function to enhance activation of cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which we refer to as receptor function. We have previously reported the LPS binding and cell activation functions of a group of five deletion mutants of CD14 (Viriyakosol, S., and Kirkland, T.N. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 361–368). We have now studied the functional impact of these mutations on soluble CD14. We found that some deletions that abrogated LPS binding in membrane CD14 have no effect on LPS binding in soluble CD14. In fact, some of the soluble CD14 deletion mutants bound LPS with an apparent higher affinity than wild-type CD14. Furthermore, we found that all five deletions essentially ablated soluble CD14 LPS receptor function, whereas only two of the deletions completely destroyed membrane CD14 LPS receptor function. Some of the mutants were able to compete with wild-type CD14 in soluble CD14-dependent assays of cellular activation. We concluded that the soluble and membrane forms of CD14 have different structural determinants for LPS receptor function."

Flow linear dichroism shows that ethoxidine exhibits the same inhibition of DNA relaxation as fagaronine at the 10-fold lower concentration. The patterns of DNA cleavage by top I show linear enhancement of CPT-dependent sites at the 0.016–50 μm concentrations of fagaronine, whereas ethoxidine suppress both top I-specific and CPT-dependent sites. Suppression of top I-mediated cleavage by ethoxidine is found to be specific for the sites, including strand cut between A and T. Fagaronine and ethoxidine are DNA major groove intercalators. Ethoxidine intercalates DNA in A-T sequences and its 12-ethoxy-moiety (absent in fagaronine) extends into the DNA minor groove. These findings may explain specificity of suppression by ethoxidine of the strong top I cleavage sites with the A(+1), T(−1) immediately adjacent to the strand cut. Fagaronine does not show any sequence specificity of DNA intercalation, but its highly electronegative oxygen of hydroxy group (absent in ethoxidine) is shown to be an acceptor of the hydrogen bond with the NH2 group of G base of DNA. Ability of fagaronine to stabilize top I-mediated ternary complex is proposed to be determined by interaction of its hydroxy group with the guanine at position (+1) of the DNA cleavage site and of quaternary nitrogen interaction with top I.

Baez A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that fagaronine is able to stabilize top I1 ternary cleavable complexes at low concentrations and to inhibit both top I and top II ternary complexes at higher concentrations (12.Wang L.K. Johnson R.K. Hecht S.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13.Larsen A.K. Grondard L. Couprie J. Desoize B. Comoe L. Jardillier J.-C. Riou J.F. Biochem.

The most potent fagaronine derivative nitidine (Fig. 1), isolated from extract of a climbing shrub Zanthoxyulum nitidum (14.Fang S.D. Wang L.K. Hecht J. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 5025-5027Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar), was observed to trap both, top I- and II-cleavable complexes. Nearly 100 naturally occurring alkaloids in this class have been isolated from plants, and many more have been synthesized, but they are generally not markedly better than nitidine and fagaronine (15.Janin Y.L. Croisy A. Riou J.F. Bisagni E. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36 (and references herein): 3686-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and do not exhibit any significant activity against solid tumors. It is worth noting that the only benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids found thus far to stabilize the top I-cleavable complexes are those that have previously been shown to have antitumor activity in experimental animal models (12.Wang L.K. Johnson R.K. Hecht S.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). So, new structural analogues of benzophenanthridines, top I inhibitors with an enlarged spectrum of activity, are highly desirable. In terms of structure-activity relationship, two main points can be emphasized: (i) all the compounds synthesized and studied so far carry the iminium charge on the benzo[c]phenanthridine ring (Fig. 1), which seems to be necessary for their biological action, and (ii) the reactivity of the iminium toward nucleophilic attack has been put forward to explain the anti-leukemia activity of these series (15.Janin Y.L. Croisy A. Riou J.F. Bisagni E. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36 (and references herein): 3686-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recently, the iminium bond electrophilicity within the benzo[c]phenanthridines was shown to be a factor which requires consideration in ternary complex formation with reverse transcriptase (16.Kerry M.A. Duval O. Waigh R.D. Mackay S.P. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1998; 50: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The other molecular determinants playing the key role in the benzo[c]phenanthridines anticancer or enzymes-inhibition activity are not known yet and need to be identified. Recently, a new fagaronine derivative ethoxidine (Fig. 1), has been synthesized by one of us (17.Mackay S.P. Comoe L. Desoize B. Duval O. Jardillier J.C. Waigh R.D. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1998; 13: 797-813PubMed Google Scholar), and its activity against human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 reverse transcriptase has been described (16.Kerry M.A. Duval O. Waigh R.D. Mackay S.P. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1998; 50: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our recent Raman, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and flow linear dichroism (FLD) comparative studies of ethoxidine and fagaronine DNA complexes showed that the new derivative is an intercalator with its DNA binding mode different from that of fagaronine (18.Ianoul A. Fleury F. Duval O. Waigh R. Jardillier J.C. Alix A.J.P. Nabiev I. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 2008-2013Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our preliminary results demonstrate also 10-fold higher top I inhibition activity of ethoxidine, as well as its much lower IC50 values in the human K562 and A549 cancer cell lines, as compared with fagaronine (19.Fleury, F., Sukhanova, A., Devy, J., Ianoul, A., Nabiev, I., Jardillier, J.

In this paper we present the results of the study with a wide range of biochemical and biophysical techniques aiming to: (i) compare mechanisms of top I inhibition by fagaronine and ethoxidine, (ii) correlate sequence specificity and molecular interactions of these compounds within the DNA complexes with their mechanisms of top I inhibition, and (iii) identify molecular determinants of the drug chromophores responsible for their DNA binding and top I poisoning or catalytic inhibition.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 3′-labeled DNA fragments were purified by electrophoresis on a nondenaturing 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and isolated by electroelution followed by ethanol precipitation. Cleavage was carried out by incubating 50 units of top I with a 5 μl of the solution of the radioactively labeled DNA fragment (3,000–10,000 cpm) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5% glycerol, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (final volume 20 μl). For the analysis of DNA cleavage by top I in the presence of the drugs, reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min, then SDS and proteinase K were adjusted to 0.5% (w/v) and 1 mg/ml, respectively. After incubation for a further 45 min at 37 °C, DNA was purified by phenol extraction, precipitated with ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and dried. The samples of DNA were dissolved in 1.5 μl of the formamide-dye mixture (90% formamide containing 15 mm EDTA (pH 8)), heated 1 min at 90 °C, and applied to 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was proceeded for 65 min at 65 watts (2,500 V). The gels were fixed with 10% acetic acid and dried on glass pretreated with Bind-silane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cleavage products were identified by comparison with “A + G” Maxam-Gilbert sequencing ladder. Uv-visible spectra were recorded with a JASCO V-530 UV-visible scanning spectrophotometer. CD spectra were recorded in the region 200–500 nm with a Jobin Yvon Mark III dichrograph. CD and UV-visible measurements were performed using quartz cells of 1 and 0.5 cm, respectively. FLD spectra were recorded in the region 220–450 nm with a Jobin Yvon Mark III dichrograph equipped with a self-made achromatic λ/4 device. The self-made flow cell described in Ref. 21.Fleury F. Ianoul A. Kryukov E. Sukhanova A. Kudelina I. Wynne-Jones A. Bronstein I.B. Maizieres M. Berjot M. Dodson G.G. Wilkinson A.J. Holden J.A. Feofanov A.V. Alix A.J.P. Jardillier J.C. Nabiev I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14630-14642Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, with optical length ∼0.5 mm and volume 200 μl was used for orientation of DNA in the flow. Inhibition of top I-induced DNA relaxation reaction was monitored using a measurement of the LD signal at 260 nm. 3 μg of pGEM7Zf(+) plasmid in 200 μl of a reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol) was placed into the flow cell. Then about 3 units of top I were added directly into the cell. Time kinetics was observed as an increase of the FLD signal. Inhibition of DNA relaxation was performed by addition of fagaronine or ethoxidine stock solutions into reaction mixture to obtain the final concentrations of 4.3 or 0.86 μm fagaronine and 0.45 or 0.22 μm ethoxidine. Linear dichroism (ΔA) is the difference between the absorbance for light polarized parallel (A ∥) and perpendicular (A⊥) to the flow. The reduced linear dichroism (LDr) is defined by LDr = ΔA/A = (A ∥ −A ⊥)/A, where A is the isotropic absorbance of the sample. Measurements of the linear dichroism in the region of absorption of the drug was used to determine the drugs chromophore orientation relative to the DNA axis. The angle β between the transition moment of the dye chromophore and the orientation axis of the DNA was calculated from the measured ratios of LDr for the DNA bases and for the drugs, (ΔA/A) drug/(ΔA/A) DNA=(3cos2β−1)/(3cos2α−1)Equation 1 where α = 86° is the angle between transition moment of the bases and the orientation axis of the DNA molecule (25.Matsuoka Y. Nordén B. Biopolymers. 1982; 21: 2433-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SERS spectra were recorded with a spectrometer Coderg, model PHO, with double monochromator in the frequency range 300–1800 cm−1. Ar+-ion laser (Coherent Radiation, model Innova 2020) operating at 457.9 nm (for fagaronine) or at 488 nm (for ethoxidine) wavelengths was used for spectra excitation. SERS spectra were recorded for 1 scan with a 1 s time constant. Silver hydrosol was prepared according to the protocol published before (26.Nabiev I. Chourpa I. Riou J.-F. Nguyen C.H. Lavelle F. Manfait M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9013-9023Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The model DNA plasmids with inserted oligonucleotides corresponding to the top I cleavage sites were constructed by modification of the DNA pGEM7Z (f+) plasmid and contain the random combination of the top I recognition sites within the 100–200-bp region (23.Sukhanova A. Grokhovsky S. Zhuze A. Roper D. Bronstein I. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 997-1010Google Scholar). Restricted DNA fragment of the selected model DNA plasmid 1454 with the strong top I-specific and CPT-dependent cleavage sites (Fig.2) was used as a top I substrate. To compare the abilities of fagaronine and ethoxidine to modulate the top I-mediated DNA cleavage, we have analyzed the DNA cleavage pattern of the α-33P-labeled DNA substrate by enzyme with and without drugs. The cleavable complex formation was estimated by analysis of distribution of the single strand DNA breaks after the SDS and proteinase K treatment. The specific DNA cleavages by top I without any drugs and with 10 μm CPT were used as a control. In the absence of drugs, top I-specific cleavage sites (designated as A, B, C, D, E, G, H) with different cleavage intensities have been revealed (Fig. 2). Addition of 10 μm CPT in the reaction mixture induces typical modulation of the pattern of DNA cleavage by top I. The intensities of cleavage in the sites C and H were found to be unchanged, the sites A, B, D, E, and G were enhanced, and a new site (F) was induced. As expected, all of the enhanced sites have a T base at the cleavage position (−1), and most of them have G at the cleavage position (+1) in accordance with the data published previously (27.Pommier Y. Pourquier P. Fan Y. Strumberg D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Fagaronine induces the same dose-dependent modulation of the top I-mediated DNA cleavage as camptothecin with canonical G(+1) and T(−1) immediately adjacent to the strand cut (Fig. 2). These results confirm the data published previously (12.Wang L.K. Johnson R.K. Hecht S.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13.Larsen A.K. Grondard L. Couprie J. Desoize B. Comoe L. Jardillier J.-C. Riou J.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and were used as a reference to comparative study of the pattern of DNA cleavage modulated by ethoxidine. The pattern of top I-mediated DNA cleavage in the presence of ethoxidine was found to be completely different from that of fagaronine. The presence of ethoxidine in the reaction mixture at the same concentrations as fagaronine induces strong suppression of top I-specific and CPT-dependent cleavage sites (Fig. 2). All these sites were strongly reduced by 2 μm ethoxidine, and some of these sites disappeared at 10 μm, while others at 50 μm concentration of the drug. Suppression of DNA cleavage sites by ethoxidine was found to be sequence-specific. To establish dependence of ethoxidine-induced suppression of DNA cleavage by top I on the local base sequence immediately adjacent to the cleavage site, we have analyzed the site-by-site intensities of DNA cleavage by top I in the presence of ethoxidine. The sites B, C, E, and H include 3′-AT-5′-sequence in position of the strand cut (Group 1), whereas the sites A, D, and G include 3′-GT-5′-sequence in position of the strand cut (Group 2). Densitometric analysis of dependence of DNA cleavage intensities on the drug concentration shows that the sites B, C, E, and, partially, H, are strongly suppressed even at 10 μm ethoxidine concentration (9.1, 15.0, 18.0, and 22.8% of initial cleavage intensity, respectively), whereas the intensities of DNA cleavage in the sites A, D, and G were found to be 33.3, 40.0, and 23.5% from the initial level of DNA cleavage, respectively. An increase of ethoxidine concentration up to 50 μm induces additional preferential suppression of DNA cleavage in the sites B, C, E, H (5.41, 5.0, 16.4, and 16.3% of initial level, respectively), whereas the cleavage in the sites A, D, and G remains significant (27.8, 37.3, and 22.3%, respectively). Obviously, ethoxidine suppresses the sites of the first group more effectively than the sites of the second group. Addition of top I into the flow cell with the plasmid DNA induces enhanced FLD signal saturating within approximately 5 min of DNA/top I incubation (Fig.3 A). In the presence of fagaronine or ethoxidine, kinetics of the DNA relaxation was found to be much slower than in the absence of the drugs. Moreover, at the low drug concentrations 0.22 μm ethoxidine exhibited the same top I inhibitory effect as 0.86 μm fagaronine, whereas at the higher drugs concentrations 0.45 μm ethoxidine exhibited the same effect as 4.3 μm fagaronine (Fig.3 A). Finally, the same level of inhibition of plasmid DNA relaxation by top I was observed at the up to 10-fold lower ethoxidine concentration compared with fagaronine. So, ethoxidine appears to be much more potent top I inhibitor than fagaronine. Fig. 3 B shows reduced linear dichroism as a function of [DNA]/[drug] ratios for fagaronine and ethoxidine DNA complexes. Both curves have the maxima with the highest value of the reduced linear dichroism of fagaronine at 1/2 DNA bp ratio, and of ethoxidine at 1/4 DNA bp ratio. The maxima of the reduced linear dichroism curves indicate the points of DNA “saturation” with the drugs. Thus, fagaronine and ethoxidine interact with the DNA in binding stoichiometry of 1 drug molecule per ∼2.0 bp of DNA and 1 drug molecule per 4.0 bp of DNA, respectively. The FLD technique enables to determine the relative orientation of the plane of the drug chromophore to the plane of DNA bases: the linear dichroism of intercalators is known to be negative, whereas the minor groove binders induce the positive signal (28.Bailly C. Henichart J.P. Colson P. Houssier C. J. Mol. Recognit. 1992; 5: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). FLD signals from fagaronine and ethoxidine bound to DNA at the saturation ratios were found to be negative in the regions of all electronic transitions (Fig.4 B). The angles between the short axis electronic transition of the fagaronine and ethoxidine chromophores and the axis of the DNA molecule calculated with Equation1 are ∼73° and 79°, respectively. So, the plane of the drug chromophores appears nearly normal to the DNA orientation axis, that is almost parallel to the plane of the DNA bases. UV-visible spectra of fagaronine and ethoxidine show two groups of bands corresponding to π → π* electronic transition (Figs. 4 and 5): 1Lb (380–420 nm) and 1La (270–350 nm). The La electronic transition is directed along the long (z axis) of chromophore, whereas Lb lies along its y axis (29.Murrell J.N. The Theory of the Electronic Spectra of Organic Molecules. John Wiley & Sons, New York1963Google Scholar). Deprotonation of fagaronine OH group results in disappearance of bands corresponding to 1Lb electronic transition of the chromophore and an increase with a bathochromic shift of the bands of the 1La transition (Fig. 4 A). The pH dependence of the fagaronine's UV-visible spectrum is determined by its OH group with pK = 8.0 (Fig. 4, inset). Therefore, at the physiological pH the solution contains both protonated and deprotonated forms of fagaronine. UV-visible spectra of ethoxidine in Me2SO, ethanol, methanol, and PBS are found to be practically identical (spectra not shown). On the other hand, the profile and relative intensities of the fagaronine spectra are modified upon Me2SO-ethanol-methanol-PBS transitions (Fig.4 C). The molecules of polar solvents are presumed to form the hydrogen bonds with the oxygen of OH group of fagaronine, and this effect leads to a decrease of the influence of the strong negative charge of the oxygen on the conjugated chromophore system. So, the distribution of electronic density in fagaronine chromophore in polar solutions becomes more similar to this in ethoxidine, and the UV-visible spectra of fagaronine and ethoxidine in PBS are found to be closer than their spectra in Me2SO. The trace 6in Fig. 5 A shows the differential spectra of fagaronine in PBS minus Me2SO. The profile of this difference spectrum may be used as a reference for the effects induced in the case of formation of hydrogen bond between the oxygen of fagaronine's OH group and a less electronegative moiety. Addition of CT DNA to fagaronine or ethoxidine solution results in a hypsochromic shift in their absorption spectra and an increase in the band at ∼400 nm accompanied by relative changes in the bands in the 270–340 nm region (Fig. 5). Characteristic difference spectra of fagaronine and ethoxidine within the DNA complexes are shown in Fig. 5, trace 3. These pronounced spectral modifications induced by DNA binding were used to evaluate the binding constants. For that purpose, DNA was titrated by the drugs (not all the spectral curves are presented in the Fig. 5 for clarity), and the drug/DNA binding constants were determined (Table I).Table IDNA binding constants of fagaronine and ethoxidineDNA/ligandFagaronineEthoxidineCalf thymus DNA1062.5 × 105Poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC)1.1 × 106105Poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT)1062.5 × 106 Open table in a new tab We have analyzed the spectra and determined the binding constants of the drugs within poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) and poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) complexes. In terms of the values of its binding constants, fagaronine does not show base preference of intercalation (Table I). The binding constants on the level of 106m−1 were found for its interaction with all used sequences as well as with CT DNA. Contrary, ethoxidine shows strong preference of intercalation within the AT sequences. Specificity of ethoxidine binding with the poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) is 25-fold lower than with poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) (Table I). The differences of molecular interactions of fagaronine and ethoxidine within the specific DNA sequences may be revealed from analysis of the profiles of the difference UV-visible spectra of drugs within the complexes (Fig. 5). The spectral profiles of the difference spectra of fagaronine complexes with poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) and with CT DNA are very similar, and they are drastically different from those of fagaronine-poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) complexes (compare trace 4 with the traces 3 and 5, Fig.5 A). Otherwise, we did not observe any differences in the spectral profiles of difference spectra of ethoxidine complexed with CT DNA and with a number of alternating polynucleotides (Fig.5 B, traces 3–5). Trace 6 of Fig. 5 A shows the difference spectrum of fagaronine solutions in PBS and in Me2SO. At the same time, the spectra of ethoxidine in Me2SO and PBS solutions were found to be identical (no difference spectrum). Moreover, the profile of the fagaronine difference (PBS minus Me2SO) spectrum in the 1Lb spectral region corresponds exactly to effect of fagaronine binding with poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) and with CT DNA (compare trace 6 with traces 3 and5 in Fig. 5 A). So, participation of the oxygen of the OH group of fagaronine in the hydrogen bond with the molecules of the polar solvent induces the same spectral effect as its molecular interactions upon DNA and poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) binding. It is reasonable to suggest that the oxygen of the fagaronine OH group is an acceptor of proton coming from the guanine NH2 group (see “Discussion”). Since the fagaronine and ethoxidine are the planar and achiral chromophores, only those molecules complexed to the asymmetric DNA matrices are able to display induced CD (Fig.6). These induced CD signals, which are indicative of interactions between the drug and host DNA duplex, can be used to detect and to monitor any CD-active DNA binding mode(s). The CD spectra of fagaronine and ethoxidine contain all bands corresponding to 1Lb (400–420 nm) and 1La (270–340 nm) electronic transitions. As is known, the 1La (oriented along chromophore's long axis) and 1Lb electronic transitions lie in the plane of the chromophore's aromatic system and are normal to each other (29.Murrell J.N.

Pulmonary surfactant insufficiency leads to respiratory distress syndrome in newborn infants, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among neonates worldwide. Substantial benefit is derived from treating affected infants with surfactant replacement preparations, particularly those containing the hydrophobic surfactant protein (SP-)1 B or SP-C (1.Robertson B. Halliday H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 346-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Hereditary SP-B deficiency in human infants results in intractable respiratory distress syndrome at birth and death shortly thereafter (2.Nogee L.M. DeMello D.E. Dehner L.P. Colten H.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice in which both SP-B alleles were disrupted (SP-B−/−) rapidly developed lethal, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (3.Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Pulmonary compliance was dramatically decreased in SP-B−/− neonates and intracellular packaging of surfactant phospholipids was disrupted, resulting in a virtual absence of lamellar bodies, the intracellular storage granule for surfactant. Intracellular processing of the surfactant protein C proprotein was disrupted, leading to accumulation of an SP-C processing intermediate (M r ∼ 8,000) and reduced levels of SP-C mature peptide (M r ∼ 3,500) in the alveolar surfactant pool. Collectively, these observations indicate that SP-B plays a critical role in the maintenance of pulmonary surfactant homeostasis.SP-B is synthesized as a 381-amino acid preproprotein in Type II cells and Clara cells of the distal respiratory epithelium. Ablation of SP-B expression in Clara cells does not affect lung funtion whereas ablation of SP-B expression in Type II cells results in lethal, neonatal respiratory dysfunction (4.Lin S. Na C. Akinbi H.T. Apsley K.S. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19168-19174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Type II cells, SP-B proprotein is routed to the multivesicular body where amino- and carboxyl-terminal peptides are sequentially cleaved to produce the 79-amino acid mature SP-B peptide (5.Weaver T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mature peptide shares sequence homology with saposin proteins A-D, placing it in the saposin-like protein (SAPLIP) family. Members of the SAPLIP family share a common secondary structure characterized by three conserved intramolecular cysteine bridges (6.Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). SP-B differs from other members of this family in that it is more hydrophobic and forms sulfhydryl-dependent homodimers (7.Johansson J. Curstedt T. Jornvall H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6917-6921Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The SP-B proprotein, M r ∼ 42,000, and its major processing intermediate, M r ∼ 25,000, are never detected in oligomeric form, consistent with dimerization of the SP-B mature peptide following proprotein processing. In humans and mice, the mature peptide is detected exclusively as a homodimer (M r ∼ 16,000), suggesting that dimerization may be important for pulmonary surfactant structure and/or function. The current study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that formation of SP-B homodimers is critical for SP-B function in transgenic mice.DISCUSSIONThe SP-B mature peptide is detected exclusively as a homodimer in humans and mice. It is the only member of the SAPLIP family that forms disulfide-dependent dimers, suggesting that dimerization of SP-B may be critical for its role in surface tension reduction at the alveolar air-liquid interface. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mouse lines were generated that expressed SP-B monomer in the distal respiratory epithelium. Under oxidizing conditions that maintained cysteine bridge integrity, transgenic protein was detected as a monomer, M r ∼ 8,000. This result confirmed the prediction from in vitro analyses that SP-B cysteine residue 248 participates in an intermolecular disulfide bridge and mediates SP-B homodimerization (7.Johansson J. Curstedt T. Jornvall H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6917-6921Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). No overt phenotype was observed in hSP-Bmon, mSP-B+/+ mice, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that expression of human SP-B did not alter lung structure or function in wild type mice (4.Lin S. Na C. Akinbi H.T. Apsley K.S. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19168-19174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10.Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Ikegami M.

Normal longevity was restored in these mice, indicating that the formation of SP-B dimer was not essential for survival in unchallenged animals. The role of SP-B dimerization in lung function was assessed by generation of pressure-volume curves. The hysteresis area of lungs containing only SP-B monomer was significantly decreased when compared with lungs containing equivalent amounts of SP-B dimer on a weight basis. This indicates that there was a loss of function in the absence of SP-B dimer that could not be compensated for by the presence of SP-B monomer. These data indicate that SP-B dimer is important in establishing normal lung hysteresis, likely due to an important role in surfactant function.To further investigate the role of SP-B dimerization in surfactant film formation and surface tension reduction, the surface properties of large aggregate surfactant fractions isolated from hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/−, and wild type mice were testedin vitro. As predicted from pressure-volume studies, surfactant from hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− mice was less able to reduce surface tension forces compared with wild type surfactant. Two explanations are possible: SP-B dimers contribute directly to the surface tension reducing properties of pulmonary surfactant, or SP-B dimerization is critical in the Type II cell for formation of an optimal surfactant protein-lipid complex. To distinguish between these possibilities, SP-B monomer and dimer were isolated from mice that produced large quantities of human SP-B dimer (hSP-Bdimer, mSP-B−/−, GM-CSF−/−) or human SP-B monomer (hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/−, GM-CSF−/−) and used to reconstitute synthetic surfactant preparations for in vitro analyses. Surfactant from GM-CSF−/− mice has been shown to have surface properties similar to equivalent amounts of wild type surfactant, providing a useful model for generating large quantities of functional surfactant proteins and lipids (14.Ikegami M. Ueda T. Hull W. Whitsett J.A. Mulligan R.C. Dranoff G. Jobe A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L650-L658Google Scholar). SP-B levels for both transgenic lines in the GM-CSF−/− background were increased more than 100-fold when compared with wild type mice (data not shown). When equal masses (2% w/w) of monomer or dimer were combined with a DPPC/POPG mixture, the monomer preparation exhibited surface properties that were not significantly different from lipid alone. Since SP-B dimer consists of two covalently linked mature peptides, there were twice as many molecules of SP-B monomer than SP-B dimer. Increasing the concentration of SP-B monomer 2-fold (four times the molar quantity) resulted in normal surface activity. These data suggest that increased levels of SP-B monomer can compensate for diminished protein function.The surface tension reducing properties of surfactant are very dependent upon concentration (26.Ikegami M. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Bruno M.D. Wert S.E. Wada K. Jobe A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L247-L254PubMed Google Scholar). The current study utilized low concentrations of surfactants (25 μg/μl) in order to better identify differences between the surface activities of SP-B dimer and SP-B monomer. At this dilution, the surfactant containing 2% SP-B monomer had relatively poor surface activity. However, it should be noted that at such low concentrations, even surfactant containing SP-B dimer did not result in surface tensions approximating zero, which are characteristic of higher surfactant concentrations.Despite decreased surface properties in vitro, the SP-B monomer completely reversed the neonatal lethality in SP-B−/− mice. One explanation for this outcome is that SP-B is present in concentrations in excess of that required for optimal lung function. Consistent with this hypothesis, SP-B hemizygous mice survive and have only subtle changes in lung function; similarly, human carriers of a single null SP-B allele demonstrate no evidence of lung disease (27.Yusen R.D. Cohen A.H. Hamvas A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 159: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− mice, SP-B monomer was present in similar or slightly higher levels compared with wild type mice. The results of in vitro analyses suggest that a decrease in monomer levels to 50% of wild type levels may result in a significant decrease in lung function. An alternative explanation for normal survival of hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− mice is that the role of SP-B in surface tension reduction is partially redundant with a similar role for SP-C (28.Perez-Gil J.

In SP-B null mice, SP-C mature peptide levels were greatly decreased; whereas in hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− mice, SP-C mature peptide was restored to levels comparable to wild type mice. Therefore, mature SP-C protein may be critical for lung function in hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− mice.Incomplete SP-C processing in humans with hereditary SP-B deficiency and mSP-B−/− mice resulted in a relative deficiency of mature SP-C peptide in the airways. Lamellar body formation in Type II cells was also disrupted, indicating that SP-B plays an important role in the intracellular processing and packaging of pulmonary surfactant. The mechanisms of lamellar body formation and processing of surfactant proteins B and C in the multivesicular body are unknown, although it is likely that SP-B plays a pivotal role. In vitro studies demonstrated that the SP-B mature peptide is both fusogenic and lytic, and these properties may contribute to lamellar body formation (29.Hawgood S. Derrick M. Poulain F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). SP-B dimerization occurs concomitantly with protein processing in the multivesicular body, suggesting that SP-B dimer may be necessary for packaging of surfactant phospholipids during the transition from MVB to lamellar body. However, this study demonstrated that lamellar bodies formed in the absence of SP-B dimers and processing of SP-C to the mature peptide was complete in hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− mice. Since the SP-B monomer was sufficient for correction of both lamellar body formation and SP-C proprotein processing, it is likely that the primary function of SP-B dimerization is related to surface tension reduction.Previous work in this laboratory suggested that SP-B must be expressed in all Type II cells to restore normal lung structure and function (4.Lin S.

In the current study, one transgenic line was established that demonstrated expression of human SP-B monomer in a subset of Type II cells (A line, data not shown). In hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− mice from this line, there were two populations of Type II cells, one with normal lamellar bodies and one with abnormal lipid inclusions that resembled those found in SP-B−/− mice. The SP-C processing intermediate that accumulates in the absence of SP-B was detected in lungs from hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− mice in this transgenic line. Lungs of adult hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− offspring from this line had altered lung structure, with greatly widened air spaces. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that SP-B production is required in all Type II cells, and that this requirement cannot be met through the presence of exogenous (i.e. airway) surfactant. A model has been proposed in which alveoli containing Type II cells deficient in SP-B have a tendency to collapse due to surfactant with poor surface activity (4.Lin S. Na C. Akinbi H.T. Apsley K.S. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19168-19174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).In summary, expression of SP-B monomer reversed the neonatal lethality and restored SP-C processing and lamellar body formation in SP-B−/− mice. Monomer rescued mice revealed no overt phenotype, bred successfully, and experienced normal longevity. These results indicate that formation of SP-B dimers is not essential for surfactant function. However, hSP-B monomer was associated with altered lung hysteresisin vivo and altered surface properties in vitro. Taken together, these studies indicate a role for SP-B dimer in establishing normal lung hysteresis, and suggest that SP-B dimerization may be required for optimal lung function. Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and proteins synthesized and secreted by the alveolar Type II epithelial cell. Pulmonary surfactant insufficiency leads to respiratory distress syndrome in newborn infants, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among neonates worldwide. Substantial benefit is derived from treating affected infants with surfactant replacement preparations, particularly those containing the hydrophobic surfactant protein (SP-)1 B or SP-C (1.Robertson B. Halliday H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 346-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Hereditary SP-B deficiency in human infants results in intractable respiratory distress syndrome at birth and death shortly thereafter (2.Nogee L.M. DeMello D.E. Dehner L.P. Colten H.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice in which both SP-B alleles were disrupted (SP-B−/−) rapidly developed lethal, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (3.Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Pulmonary compliance was dramatically decreased in SP-B−/− neonates and intracellular packaging of surfactant phospholipids was disrupted, resulting in a virtual absence of lamellar bodies, the intracellular storage granule for surfactant. Intracellular processing of the surfactant protein C proprotein was disrupted, leading to accumulation of an SP-C processing intermediate (M r ∼ 8,000) and reduced levels of SP-C mature peptide (M r ∼ 3,500) in the alveolar surfactant pool. Collectively, these observations indicate that SP-B plays a critical role in the maintenance of pulmonary surfactant homeostasis. SP-B is synthesized as a 381-amino acid preproprotein in Type II cells and Clara cells of the distal respiratory epithelium. Ablation of SP-B expression in Clara cells does not affect lung funtion whereas ablation of SP-B expression in Type II cells results in lethal, neonatal respiratory dysfunction (4.Lin S. Na C. Akinbi H.T. Apsley K.S. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19168-19174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Type II cells, SP-B proprotein is routed to the multivesicular body where amino- and carboxyl-terminal peptides are sequentially cleaved to produce the 79-amino acid mature SP-B peptide (5.Weaver T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mature peptide shares sequence homology with saposin proteins A-D, placing it in the saposin-like protein (SAPLIP) family. Members of the SAPLIP family share a common secondary structure characterized by three conserved intramolecular cysteine bridges (6.Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). SP-B differs from other members of this family in that it is more hydrophobic and forms sulfhydryl-dependent homodimers (7.Johansson J. Curstedt T. Jornvall H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6917-6921Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The SP-B proprotein, M r ∼ 42,000, and its major processing intermediate, M r ∼ 25,000, are never detected in oligomeric form, consistent with dimerization of the SP-B mature peptide following proprotein processing. In humans and mice, the mature peptide is detected exclusively as a homodimer (M r ∼ 16,000), suggesting that dimerization may be important for pulmonary surfactant structure and/or function. The current study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that formation of SP-B homodimers is critical for SP-B function in transgenic mice. DISCUSSIONThe SP-B mature peptide is detected exclusively as a homodimer in humans and mice. It is the only member of the SAPLIP family that forms disulfide-dependent dimers, suggesting that dimerization of SP-B may be critical for its role in surface tension reduction at the alveolar air-liquid interface. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mouse lines were generated that expressed SP-B monomer in the distal respiratory epithelium. Under oxidizing conditions that maintained cysteine bridge integrity, transgenic protein was detected as a monomer, M r ∼ 8,000. This result confirmed the prediction from in vitro analyses that SP-B cysteine residue 248 participates in an intermolecular disulfide bridge and mediates SP-B homodimerization (7.Johansson J. Curstedt T. Jornvall H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6917-6921Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). No overt phenotype was observed in hSP-Bmon, mSP-B+/+ mice, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that expression of human SP-B did not alter lung structure or function in wild type mice (4.Lin S. Na C. Akinbi H.T. Apsley K.S. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19168-19174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10.Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Ikegami M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9640-9647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Expression of SP-B monomer protein in SP-B−/− mice completely reversed the neonatal lethality associated with SP-B deficiency. Normal longevity was restored in these mice, indicating that the formation of SP-B dimer was not essential for survival in unchallenged animals. The role of SP-B dimerization in lung function was assessed by generation of pressure-volume curves. The hysteresis area of lungs containing only SP-B monomer was significantly decreased when compared with lungs containing equivalent amounts of SP-B dimer on a weight basis. This indicates that there was a loss of function in the absence of SP-B dimer that could not be compensated for by the presence of SP-B monomer. These data indicate that SP-B dimer is important in establishing normal lung hysteresis, likely due to an important role in surfactant function.To further investigate the role of SP-B dimerization in surfactant film formation and surface tension reduction, the surface properties of large aggregate surfactant fractions isolated from hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/−, and wild type mice were testedin vitro. As predicted from pressure-volume studies, surfactant from hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− mice was less able to reduce surface tension forces compared with wild type surfactant. Two explanations are possible: SP-B dimers contribute directly to the surface tension reducing properties of pulmonary surfactant, or SP-B dimerization is critical in the Type II cell for formation of an optimal surfactant protein-lipid complex. To distinguish between these possibilities, SP-B monomer and dimer were isolated from mice that produced large quantities of human SP-B dimer (hSP-Bdimer, mSP-B−/−, GM-CSF−/−) or human SP-B monomer (hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/−, GM-CSF−/−) and used to reconstitute synthetic surfactant preparations for in vitro analyses. Surfactant from GM-CSF−/− mice has been shown to have surface properties similar to equivalent amounts of wild type surfactant, providing a useful model for generating large quantities of functional surfactant proteins and lipids (14.Ikegami M. Ueda T. Hull W. Whitsett J.A. Mulligan R.C. Dranoff G. Jobe A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L650-L658Google Scholar). SP-B levels for both transgenic lines in the GM-CSF−/− background were increased more than 100-fold when compared with wild type mice (data not shown). When equal masses (2% w/w) of monomer or dimer were combined with a DPPC/POPG mixture, the monomer preparation exhibited surface properties that were not significantly different from lipid alone. Since SP-B dimer consists of two covalently linked mature peptides, there were twice as many molecules of SP-B monomer than SP-B dimer. Increasing the concentration of SP-B monomer 2-fold (four times the molar quantity) resulted in normal surface activity. These data suggest that increased levels of SP-B monomer can compensate for diminished protein function.The surface tension reducing properties of surfactant are very dependent upon concentration (26.Ikegami M. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Bruno M.D. Wert S.E. Wada K. Jobe A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L247-L254PubMed Google Scholar). The current study utilized low concentrations of surfactants (25 μg/μl) in order to better identify differences between the surface activities of SP-B dimer and SP-B monomer. At this dilution, the surfactant containing 2% SP-B monomer had relatively poor surface activity. However, it should be noted that at such low concentrations, even surfactant containing SP-B dimer did not result in surface tensions approximating zero, which are characteristic of higher surfactant concentrations.Despite decreased surface properties in vitro, the SP-B monomer completely reversed the neonatal lethality in SP-B−/− mice. One explanation for this outcome is that SP-B is present in concentrations in excess of that required for optimal lung function. Consistent with this hypothesis, SP-B hemizygous mice survive and have only subtle changes in lung function; similarly, human carriers of a single null SP-B allele demonstrate no evidence of lung disease (27.Yusen R.D. Cohen A.H. Hamvas A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 159: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− mice, SP-B monomer was present in similar or slightly higher levels compared with wild type mice. The results of in vitro analyses suggest that a decrease in monomer levels to 50% of wild type levels may result in a significant decrease in lung function. An alternative explanation for normal survival of hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− mice is that the role of SP-B in surface tension reduction is partially redundant with a similar role for SP-C (28.Perez-Gil J. Keough K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In SP-B null mice, SP-C mature peptide levels were greatly decreased; whereas in hSP-Bmon, mSP-B−/− mice, SP-C mature peptide was restored to levels comparable to wild type mice.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae this transcriptional induction is mediated by an increase in the synthesis of the transcription factor Hac1p. The transmembrane receptor Ire1p/Ern1p containing a Ser/Thr protein kinase and endoribonuclease activity transmits the unfolded protein response (UPR) from the ER to the nucleus. Activation of Ire1p kinase induces its endoribonuclease activity to cleave unspliced HAC1 mRNA and generate exon fragments that are subsequently ligated by tRNA ligase (RLG1). Whereas unspliced HAC1 mRNA is poorly translated, spliced HAC1 mRNA is efficiently translated. Subunits of the yeast transcriptional co-activator complex SAGA also play a role in the UPR. Deletion of GCN5,ADA2, or ADA3 reduces, and deletion ofADA5 completely abolishes, the UPR. AlthoughHAC1 mRNA requires only Ire1p and Rlg1p in vitro, we demonstrate that ADA5 is required for theIRE1/RLG1-dependent splicing reaction ofHAC1 mRNA in vivo. In addition, Ada5p interacts with Ire1p. These results suggest that subcomponents of transcriptional co-activator complexes may be involved in RNA processing events.

It is the primary site for folding of secretory and transmembrane proteins that constitute about one-third of all cellular proteins. The ER lumen provides an oxidizing environment and contains a number of resident chaperones, such as BiP (GRP78), that facilitate protein folding. These chaperones are proposed to catalyze protein folding and/or prevent aggregation of folding intermediates. Perturbation of the protein folding machinery in the ER leads to an accumulation of unfolded proteins. Cells respond to unfolded protein in the ER by up-regulating the synthesis of resident chaperones, thereby increasing the folding capacity in the ER compartment. This cellular response is termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) and is conserved in all eukaryotic organisms (1.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes that are transcriptionally activated in response to unfolded proteins in the ER contain a 22-base pair cis-acting promoter element, termed the UPRE, that is necessary and sufficient to mediate the transcriptional induction (2.Mori K. Sant A. Kohno K. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2583-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The UPREs in these genes contain a partially palindromic sequence (CAGCGTG) with a spacer of one nucleotide that is required for the transcriptional induction (3.Mori K. Ogawa N. Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thetrans-acting factor that binds the UPRE is a basic leucine zipper protein (bZIP) called Hac1p (4.Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 5.Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that activation of the UPR is dependent upon the cellular levels of Hac1p. HAC1 is constitutively transcribed independently of the protein folding status in the ER. In the absence of unfolded proteins in the ER, HAC1 mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm and engaged with ribosomes, but translation is stalled. A 252-nucleotide fragment near the 3′ end of HAC1 mRNA acts as a translational attenuator to limit Hac1p synthesis (6.Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 7.Chapman R.E. Walter P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 850-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of unfolded proteins in the ER, the translational attenuator in HAC1 mRNA is removed by an unconventional splicing reaction that does not utilize the cellular spliceasomal machinery. HAC1 mRNA splicing allows efficient translation of Hac1p and subsequent transcriptional activation of genes regulated by the UPR. Perhaps the most important component of the UPR pathway is Ire1p/Ern1p (8.Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 9.Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Ire1p is a type 1 transmembrane protein of the ER that is a bifunctional enzyme. The cytosolic domain contains both a serine/threonine kinase (10.Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18181-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11.Shamu C.E. Walter P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3028-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) and a site-specific endoribonuclease activity (12.Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). In response to unfolded proteins in the ER, Ire1p forms oligomers that mediate trans-autophosphorylation to activate the site-specific endoribonuclease activity that cleaves at the splice site junctions within the 3′ end of HAC1 mRNA. The cleaved 5′ and 3′ exons of HAC1 mRNA are ligated together by the tRNA ligase RLG1, generating a new mRNA species that is efficiently translated (13.Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Because permanent activation of the UPR pathway is detrimental to cell growth (11.Shamu C.E. Walter P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3028-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 14.Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), the UPR needs to be tightly regulated. Upon phosphorylation, Ire1p recruits a serine/threonine phosphatase, PTC2, that dephosphorylates Ire1p and down-regulates the UPR (15.Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The transcriptional co-activator Gcn5p was isolated as a specific interactor with Ire1p in a yeast two-hybrid screen (16.Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4289-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, transcriptional activation requires functional interaction between the activators that bind upstream activating sequences and the basal factors that occupy the TATA box. It is proposed that functional interaction between these two classes of transcription factors is mediated by transcriptional co-activators. Gcn5p along with other transcriptional co-activators, including Ada1, Ada2p, Ada3p, Spt3p, Spt7p, Spt8p, and Ada5p/Spt20p, constitute a 1.8-mDa SAGA complex that is responsible for histone acetylation during transcriptional activation (17.Georgakopoulos T.

Mutations in the ADA genes were isolated as suppressors of the lethality induced by over-expression of the herpes simplex virus potent acid transcriptional activator VP-16 (19.Horiuchi J. Silverman N. Marcus G.A. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SPT genes were isolated as suppressors of Ty transposon insertions (23.Roberts S.M. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3206-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Both sets of genes are required for maximal transcriptional activation from TATA-containing promoters. Yeast strains lacking Gcn5p, Ada2p, and Ada3p are partially defective in transcriptional activation of genes encoding ER protein chaperones in response to unfolded proteins in the ER. In contrast, cells lacking Ada5p are completely defective for the UPR but contain an intact heat shock response, demonstrating a specific requirement for Ada5p in the UPR (16.Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4289-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role of ADA5 in the UPR pathway. We found that apart from its function as a transcriptional co-activator in the UPR pathway, ADA5 is also required for HAC1mRNA processing, a hitherto novel function for a transcriptional co-activator. Moreover, our data reveal the molecular basis for the defective UPR in Δada5 cells. The Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for the propagation of plasmids. The genotype of the S. cerevisiae strain used in this study was BWG1-7a, Matα leu2::3,112 his4–519 ade1–100 ura3–52 (19.Horiuchi J. Silverman N. Marcus G.A. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genetic methods and standard media were previously described (25.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1986Google Scholar). The construction of pAW65 (16.Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4289-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), pGEM4Z-ACT1 (15.Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the fusion protein containing the Ire1p cytoplasmic (10.Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18181-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) domain with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) were previously described. To construct GST-HAC1 fusion constructs, PCR amplified fragments from the wild-type HAC1 were subcloned into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of the bacterial expression vector, pGEX1λT (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The expression GST-Hac1p fusion product was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-GST antibodies. To construct pGEM4Z-HAC1, a 240-base pair fragment from HAC1was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-ccctctagacttcaagtcgactctgcctcc-3′ and 5′-tcaaagcttgcaacaaaagcgtcgtggc-3′ and subcloned into theXbaI and HindIII sites of pGEM-4Z. Similarly, a 206-base pair fragment from IRE1 was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-gagctgggaattcactcttatg-3′ and 5′-aataagcttggggaatgtcggagaaaccc-3′ and subcloned into theEcoRI and HindIII sites of pGEM-4Z to derive pGEM4Z-IRE1. Construction of plasmid pJC835 containingHAC1 i was described previously (4.Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The yeast strain carrying the null allele of HAC1 was created by the method of one step gene disruption (26.Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). BGW1-7a cells were transformed with BamHI digested pHAKO1 (4.Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Transformants containing the disrupted hac1 were selected for uracil prototrophy and the gene disruption was confirmed by PCR and Southern/Northern blot analyses. The construction of Δire1and Δada5 strains was described previously (16.Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4289-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Yeast cell lysates were prepared according to Williams et al. (27.Williams F.E. Varanasi U. Trumbly R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3307-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed by standard procedures (28.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1988Google Scholar) using anti-Hac1p primary antibodies (generously provided by Dr. Peter Walter, University of California, San Francisco) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc.). Bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified using NIH image software. Total protein and β-galactosidase activity were measured using commercially available kits from Bio-Rad and Promega (Madison, WI), respectively. Plasmids carrying GCN5, ADA2, ADA3, and ADA5 under the T7 promoter (generously provided by Dr. Leonard Guarente, Massachusetts Institute of Technology) were used in coupled in vitro transcription and translation assays to create [35S]methionine labeled products. Equal amounts of each recombinant protein were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing equal amounts of either GST-Ire1p cytoplasmic domain or GST-Hac1p fusion protein at 4 °C for 2 h in the binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA). As a control, beads containing comparable amounts of GST were used. Beads were recovered, washed sequentially with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol and 1, 0.5, and 0.05% Triton X-100, and boiled for 3 min in 1× Laemmli buffer (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Extracts were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, treated with En/Hance (NEN Life Science Products), and analyzed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager scanning (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Total RNA was isolated according to Schmitt et al. (30.Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar) from cells treated with or without Tm for 90 min for analysis using an RNase protection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). pGEM-4ZHAC1, pGEM-4ZIRE1, and pGEM-4ZACT1 were linearized with XbaI, and antisense RNA probes were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [α32P]CTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A DNA sequencing ladder from a known template was used as size markers. GCN5, ADA2, ADA3, and ADA5 are required for the maximal transcriptional induction of genes encoding ER resident chaperones including KAR2/BiP in response to protein misfolding in the ER (16.Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4289-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, the SAGA complex is not required for the heat-mediated transcriptional activation of KAR2 (16), suggesting that these co-activators play a specific role in the UPR as opposed to global transcriptional induction. Among these co-activators, Ada5p is the most interesting because cells lacking Ada5p are completely defective in responding to unfolded proteins in the ER and are inositol auxotrophs, the two phenotypes associated withΔire1 and Δhac1 cells. To elucidate the mechanistic role of the SAGA complex in the UPR pathway, we asked whether the defective UPR in cells lacking these co-activators results from inefficient HAC1 transcription. HAC1 encodes the bZIP transcription factor Hac1p, which is essential for transcriptional induction of genes responding to the UPR. The levels ofHAC1 mRNA were measured in Δada5 cells by an RNase protection assay. In this assay, the presence ofHAC1 mRNA (both processed and unprocessed) should protect a 240-base pair nucleotide fragment from the internal labeled probe. ACT1 mRNA served as an internal control for the amount of RNA in the reaction. The results show that HAC1was transcribed in Δada5 as well as in Δire1cells. The level of HAC1 transcription in these cells was comparable with that in the wild-type cells with or without tunicamycin (Tm) treatment, a drug that inhibits N-linked glycosylation and therefore disrupts protein folding in the ER (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–4 and6–7). These results demonstrate that Δada5cells efficiently transcribe HAC1. Therefore, theΔada5 cells are similar to Δire1 cells where the abrogated UPR does not arise from defective HAC1transcription. The cellular level of Hac1p regulates the UPR. Although HAC1is constitutively transcribed, only the processed transcripts are translated. HAC1 mRNA processing requires the activity of the site-specific endoribonuclease, Ire1p. We therefore asked whether IRE1 transcription is reduced in Δada5cells. An RNase protection assay demonstrated that both wild-type andΔada5 cells had comparable levels of IRE1mRNA, indicating that IRE1 is efficiently transcribed inΔada5 cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4). Therefore, the defective UPR in these cells is not due to reducedIRE1 transcription. Gcn5p was identified as a component in the UPR by its interaction with Ire1p, detected by the yeast two-hybrid system and by co-immunoprecipitation from cells co-expressing Gcn5p and Ire1p (16.Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4289-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To identify the component(s) of this complex that interact directly with Ire1p, in vitro affinity adsorbption experiments were performed with [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro transcription-translation products of GCN5,ADA2, ADA3, and ADA5. Hac1p and Ire1p were produced as soluble GST fusion proteins (GST-Hac1p, GST-Ire1p) inE. coli and purified by adsorption to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Beads containing either GST-Hac1p or GST-Ire1p fusion proteins were used to capture the Gcn5p, Ada2p, Ada3p, or Ada5p translation products from reticulocyte lysates. As a control, Sepharose beads bound to equimolar amounts of GST were used. In these in vitropull-down assays, the amounts of Ada2p, Ada3p, and Ada5p bound to GST-Hac1p were not significantly different from that obtained with control GST beads (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8 and 10–12). In contrast, GST-Hac1p brought down a 4.5-fold greater amount of Gcn5p than the GST control (Fig. 2,lane 5 versus 9), indicating a direct interaction between the two proteins. GST-Ire1p, on the other hand, interacted with Ada2p and Ada5p (4.1- and 3.1-fold more than the GST control, respectively) (Fig. 2, lanes 14 and 16) but not with Gcn5p or Ada3p (Fig. 2, lanes 13 and15). The specificity for the interaction with Ada5p was further demonstrated by the enrichment of the full-length Ada5p translation products by GST-Ire1p. These results indicate that Ire1p directly interacts with Ada2p and Ada5p and suggest that the original yeast two-hybrid interaction detected between Ire1p and the SAGA complex was mediated through Ada2p and Ada5p but not through Gcn5p. Therefore, the original interaction between Gcn5p and Ire1p detected in yeast was likely indirect and due to endogenous levels of Ada2p and Ada5p that could bridge Gcn5p with Ire1p. The site-specific endoribonuclease activity of Ire1p is required for theHAC1 mRNA processing event that leads to the generation of a translatable form of HAC1 mRNA and subsequent activation of the UPR. The direct interaction between Ire1p and some components of the SAGA complex suggested that the SAGA complex might play a role in HAC1 mRNA processing. To test this hypothesis, we used a HAC1 probe to perform Northern blot analysis on RNA isolated from different yeast strains. In wild-type cells, upon Tm treatment, the majority of the HAC1 mRNA was processed to a smaller RNA species (HAC1 i, Fig.3A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, upon Tm treatment of Δire1 cells, processedHAC1 mRNA was not generated, indicating a complete absence of UPR-activated Ire1p-dependent HAC1mRNA processing in these cells (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). Deletion of GCN5, ADA2, and ADA3 had no effect on the Ire1p-dependentHAC1 mRNA processing, as similar amounts ofHAC1 i mRNA were detected after ER stress compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 3 A, lane 2 versus lanes 6, 8, and 10). Like theΔire1 cells, Δada5 cells were completely defective in HAC1 mRNA processing upon activation of the UPR (Fig. 3 A, lanes 11 and 12), demonstrating that Ada5p plays a critical role in this mRNA processing reaction. To substantiate the evidence for defective HAC1 mRNA processing in Δada5 cells, Western blot analysis was performed to measure the steady state levels of Hac1p before and after ER stress. An antibody that specifically recognizes the carboxyl terminus of Hac1ip can distinguish Hac1up from Hac1ip because they differ in the carboxyl-terminal amino acids due to the Ire1p-mediated splicing reaction. Upon Tm treatment, Hac1ip was increased 5-fold in wild-type cells (Fig.3 B, lanes 4 and 8) but not inΔada5 cells (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and5) or Δire1 cells (Fig. 3 B,lanes 3 and 7). In this blot, a co-migrating background band was observed in all strains includingΔhac1 without Tm treatment (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2 and 6). These results are consistent with the observation that Δada5 cells are defective inHAC1 u mRNA processing and are therefore incapable of generating a translatable form of HAC1 i mRNA. The data presented thus far suggest that the abrogated UPR in Δada5 cells result from defective HAC1 mRNA processing. We therefore asked whether the UPR could be restored upon expression ofHAC1 i in Δada5 cells. To evaluate the UPR, cells were transformed with a centromere-containing reporter plasmid harboring a lacZ reporter gene under the control of a single 22-base pair UPRE. The resultant transformed wild-type cells turned blue on plates containing X-gal and Tm, indicating an intact UPR pathway. In contrast, Δada5 strains harboring the UPRE-lacZ vector remained white, demonstrating a defective UPR pathway. However, after the introduction ofHAC1 i, both the wild-type and Δada5strains turned blue and light blue, respectively, on media containing X-gal plus Tm (data not shown). The amount of HAC1 mRNA detected in Δada5 cells harboring theHAC1 i plasmid was greater than in the wild-type cells (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2 and9 and 10). This observation further strengthens the notion that the defective UPR in Δada5 cells is not the result of abrogated HAC1 transcription. Quantification of the UPR by liquid assay, revealed that the basal level of β-galactosidase expression from the 22-base pair UPRE was reduced 3.5-fold in the Δada5 strain compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and5). Upon Tm treatment, induction of β-galactosidase was reduced 20-fold compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 6). Expression of HAC1 i increased the basal of β-galactosidase activity by 10- and 6-fold in the wild-type andΔada5 strains, respectively (Fig. 4,lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). However, β-galactosidase expression in HAC1 i -expressingΔada5 cells was reduced 6-fold compared withHAC1 i -expressing wild-type cells (Fig. 4,lanes 3 and 7). On the other hand, Tm induction of β-galactosidase activity was comparable in both wild-type andΔada5 strains expressing HAC1 i, at 6- and 8-fold respectively (Fig. 4, lanes 3, 4,7, and 8). Therefore, expression of Hac1ip restored induction, although the basal expression level was reduced. Taken together, these results suggest that both transcriptional co-activator and RNA processing functions ofADA5 are essential for maximal transcriptional activation from the UPRE. Upon accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER, Ire1p initiates a novel mRNA splicing reaction. The endoribonuclease activity of Ire1p cleaves the 5′ and 3′ splice site junctions within HAC1 mRNA. Each splice site junction is composed of a simple structure, a stem with a seven-member loop. Only 4 bases within the loop are apparently required for specificity of the cleavage reaction (31.Gonzalez T.N. Sidrauski C. Dorfler Walter P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3119-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The 5′ and 3′ exons of HAC1 mRNA are tethered together by base pairing and joined by tRNA ligase (RLG1). Whereas precursor HAC1 u mRNA is not translated well, the product HAC1 i mRNA is efficiently translated. This splicing reaction was reconstitutedin vitro with only two components, Ire1p and Rlg1p (12.Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). However, data suggest that the HAC1 u mRNA processing reaction is more complex in vivo. First, the low degree of specificity for the stem-loop structure inHAC1 u mRNA would indicate that other cellular mRNAs may be nonspecifically cleaved by the Ire1p endoribonuclease. This notion is consistent with the observation that oligonucleotides consisting of the stem-loop structures are less efficient substrates than a 600-base pair substrate that contains both 5′ and 3′ splice site junctions (12.Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Second, when the intron within the 3′ end ofHAC1 u mRNA was placed into the 3′ untranslated region of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker gene, GFP was not translated (7.Chapman R.E. Walter P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 850-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the proposed role of the intron as a translational attenuator (6.Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, upon induction of the UPR, the HAC1 intron within the GFP mRNA was not removed, indicating that Ire1p does not simply recognize the stem-loop and intron sequence within HAC1 u mRNA. Fourth, although human Ire1αp can cleave the 5′ splice site of yeastHAC1 mRNA in vitro, yeast HAC1mRNA was not cleaved when expressed in mammalian cells (32.Foti D.M. Welihinda A.J. Kaufman R.J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30402-30409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Finally, using a temperature-sensitive mutant of RNA polymerase, it was shown that only newly transcribed HAC1 mRNA is processed by Ire1p (13.Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Although the majority of human Ire1p was localized within the ER membrane, a subpopulation preferentially associated with the nuclear envelope and possibly the nuclear pore complex (33.Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), suggesting both cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic localization of the carboxyl terminus. It was proposed that Ire1p cleaves HAC1mRNA at the nuclear envelope as it is transported to the cytoplasm for translation. This hypothesis is consistent with detection of Rlg1p at the nuclear pore complex (34.Clark M.W. Abelson J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1515-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide data that demonstrate a requirement forADA5 in the Ire1p-mediated cleavage of HAC1mRNA in S. cerevisiae. First, whereas the UPR transcriptional induction is reduced severalfold in the Δada2, Δada3, and Δgcn5 strains, it is completely absent in the Δada5 strain. Second, upon activation of the UPR, HAC1 i mRNA was produced in the Δada2, Δada3, and Δgcn5strains, but not in the Δada5 strain. As previously demonstrated, cleaved HAC1 mRNA products that are not ligated by the tRNA ligase accumulate in the cytoplasm (35.Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1802-1807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, these products were not detected in the Δada5 strain, supporting a role for Ada5p in HAC1 u mRNA cleavage and not in Rlg1p-mediated exon-exon ligation. Third, upon activation of the UPR, the levels of IRE1 mRNA andHAC1 mRNA were not altered, and Hac1ip was not detected. Finally, an in vitro pull-down assay detected an interaction between Ire1p and both Ada5p and Ada2p, but not Ada3p and Gcn5p, consistent with a role of Ada5p in Ire1p-mediated cleavage. The requirement for ADA5 in the HAC1 mRNA cleavage reaction can explain both the UPR defect and the inositol requirement observed for the Δada5 strain. These two phenotypes are identical to those observed in the Δire1, Δhac1, and rlg1–100 strains (36.Cox J.S. Chapman R.E. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). These results implicate a novel mRNA processing role for Ada5p, a subunit of the transcriptional co-activator SAGA. Our experimental data support the proposed notion that Gcn5p interacts with the basic leucine zipper protein, Hac1p, to maximally activate the UPR (16.Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4289-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In vitro pull-down assays described here suggest that Gcn5p directly interacts with Hac1p. These findings are not surprising because another bZIP protein, Gcn4p, interacts with Gcn5p for maximal activation of amino acid biosynthetic genes under conditions of amino acid starvation (17.Georgakopoulos T. Thireos G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4145-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 21.Marcus G.A. Silverman N. Berger S.L. Horiuchi J. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4807-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We have incorporated the results of our study into a model for SAGA function in activation of the UPR (Fig.5). Within the SAGA complex, Gcn5p has histone acetyltransferase activity that is required for opening chromatic structures for transcriptional activation. Disruption ofADA2, ADA3, or GCN5 destroys the histone acetyltransferase activity of the complex and reduces transcriptional activation of UPR-responsive genes by severalfold (16.Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4289-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because Δada2 cells, Δada3 cells, andΔgcn5 cells grow without inositol and can spliceHAC1 mRNA to activate the UPR, they are not required for the UPR. Gcn5p interacts with the bZIP transcription factor Hac1p to enhance transcriptional induction of ER stress-responsive genes.ADA5/SPT20 and SPT7 are required to maintain the integrity of the SAGA complex (24.Sterner D.E. Grant P.A. Roberts S.M. Duggan L.J. Belotserkovskaya R. Pacella L.A. Winston F. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Ire1p is localized to the inner leaflet of the nuclear envelope, adjacent to the nuclear pore. Both Ada2p and Ada5p interact with Ire1p, although only Ada5p function is required to promote Ire1p-mediated cleavage of HAC1mRNA. Although we have not demonstrated that Ada5p acts directly in this reaction, the finding that Ada5p interacts with Ire1p would suggest that Ada5p may function to increase the efficiency ofHAC1 mRNA processing by Ire1p. We thank Dr. Leonard Guarente for providing yeast strain BWG1-7a and plasmids containing GCN5, ADA2, ADA3, and ADA5 and Dr. Peter Walter for plasmid pHAKO1 and anti Hac1ip antibodies.

E. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 34992–34999). Here we have modified T30695 by introducing a hydrophobic bulky group, propynyl dU, or a positively charged group, 5-amino dU, into the bases of T residues of the loops, and by substitution of the T-G loops by T-T loops. Physical measurements have demonstrated that the substitution of propynyl dU or 5-amino dU for T in the T residues of the loops did not alter the structure of T30695, and these derivatives also formed an intramolecular G-quartet structure, which is an essential requirement for anti-HIV activity. Measured IC50 and EC50values show that these substitutions did not induce an apparent decrease in the ability to inhibit HIV-1 integrase activity and in the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in cell culture. However, the substitution of T-T loops for T-G loops induced a substantial decrease in both thermal stability and anti-HIV activity. The data analysis ofT30695 and the 21 derivatives shows a significant, functional correlation between thermal stability of the G-tetrad structure and the capacity to inhibit HIV-1 integrase activity and between thermal stability of the G-tetrad structure and the capacity to inhibit HIV-1 replication, as assessed with the virus strains HIV-1 RF, IIIB, and MN in cell culture. This relationship between thermostability and activity provides a basis for improving the efficacy of these compounds to inhibit HIV-1 integrase activity and HIV-1 replication in cell culture.

These 2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside analogues act as competitive inhibitors of the reverse transcriptase, thus stopping the viral replication cycle at the reverse transcription step. Although the combination therapy, which uses two or more drugs simultaneously to inhibit HIV1 activity, can reduce HIV load to undetectable levels in the blood of many HIV-positive patients, the viruses in T cells are still capable of replicating and infecting other cells (7.Chun T.W.

However, unintegrated HIV-1 DNA seems to be relatively unstable in vitro with a short half-life in vivo. Thus, development of new drugs against the HIV enzyme called integrase could be a major advance in the treatment of HIV infection because it may eliminate HIV-1 from intracellular sites. Integrase is the only enzyme that catalyzes the integration of the HIV-1 proviral DNA into a host chromosome, which is an essential step in HIV-1 viral replication. The recently reported candidates for pharmaceutical inhibition of HIV-1 integrase had IC50 values in the micromolar range for inhibition of HIV-1 integrase activity (10.Mazumder A. Neamati N. Sommadossi J.-P. Gosselin G. Schinazi R.F. Imbach J.-L. Pommier Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 621-628PubMed Google Scholar). A family of G-tetrad-forming oligonucleotides was recently developed as potential anti-HIV therapeutic drugs (11.Rando R.F. Ojwang J. Elbaggari A. Reyes G.R. Tinder R. McGranth M.S. Hogan M.E. J.

These compounds have shown a strong interaction with HIV-1 integrase in vitro, and to inhibit the integration of viral DNA into host DNA. In previous studies (12.Mazumder A. Neamati N. Ojwang J.O. Sunder S. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13762-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13.Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the most potent inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase were found to be T30695, 5′-g*ggtgggtgggtggg*t-3′, and T30177, 5′-g*tggtgggtgggtggg*t-3′. IC50 values of inhibition for HIV-1 integrase 3′ processing and strand transfer, obtained from a gel-based method, were 47 and 24 nm for T30695 and 79 and 49 nm for T30177. Compared with T30177, T30695 forms an even more stable and orderly G-quartet fold. Our NMR and kinetic data demonstrated that in response to K+ binding, T30695 folded into a stable and symmetric G-tetrad complex (13.Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14.Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. Dynamics. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The folding has been shown to be a two-step process, which is dependent on the nature of the alkaline metal ion. The first step of the process involves the coordination of one K+ ion, which competes with a Li+ ion to bind within the core of two G-quartets. The second step involves the binding of two additional K+ ions to the loop domains. NMR and optical analysis have shown that the second binding step is associated with substantial ordering of the oligonucleotide fold. NMR data and molecular modeling have determined (14.Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. Dynamics. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15.Jing N. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34992-34999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) that T30695 in the absence of K+ (with Li+ ions) forms an intramolecular G-quartet structure with the opened loop structures. Upon coordination with three K+ions, the loop structure is rearranged, and the bases of loops are folded onto the underlying G-quartets. The structure of T30695 in the presence of K+ becomes symmetric and compact. The inhibition of HIV-1 integrase activity was found to greatly increase upon K+ binding to the loops. Thus, the folding of the loop domains of these oligonucleotides plays an important role in the function of G-tetrad-forming oligonucleotides. To investigate the structure and activity of these tetrad-forming oligonucleotides and to improve inhibition of HIV-1 integrase activity and/or inhibition of HIV-1 replication in cell culture, we have designed derivatives by adding positively charged or large hydrophobic groups into T30695. The derivatives were designed to replace T residues in the loop domains with 5-amino dU or with 5-propynyl dU or to substitute G in the loop domains with T. The derivatives were monitored for melting temperature (T m), inhibition of HIV-1 integrase activity (IC50), and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in cell culture (EC50). Based upon these measurements, we propose a relationship between thermal stability of the G-quartet structure and its ability to inhibit the activity of HIV-1 in cell culture, which could be useful as the basis for improvement of these oligonucleotides as anti-HIV drug candidates. Oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Inc. DNA synthesizer, model 380D or 394, using standard phosphoramidite chemistry or fast deblocking expedite chemistry on a Milligen synthesizer as described previously (11.Rando R.F. Ojwang J.

Purification was accomplished by preparative anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography on Q-Sepharose, followed by pressure filtration in H2O (Amicon) to remove metal ions. Product purity was confirmed by analytical Q-Sepharose chromatography and by denaturing electrophoresis of 32P-labeled oligomers on a 20% polyacrylamide/bis-acrylamide (19/1), 7 m urea gel matrix. Oligomer folding was monitored by native gel electrophoresis on a 15% acrylamide (19:1) matrix in Tris-borate EDTA. 5-Propynyl dU was obtained from Glenn Research and was used in oligonucleotide synthesis. Oligonucleotides at 7 μmin strand equivalents (20 mmLi3PO4, pH 7) were heated to 90 °C for 5 min and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of KCl at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mm. Subsequent to the incubation step, thermal denaturation profiles of the oligonucleotides were obtained at a rate of 1.25 °C/min over a range of 20–90 °C. Absorbance was measured at 240 nm by an HP8452A (Hewlett-Packard) diode array spectrophotometer using an HP 89090A temperature regulator. The thermal denaturation curves of the oligonucleotides were analyzed by an intramolecular folding equilibrium (16.Longfellow C.E. Kierzek R. Turner D.H.

In our analysis study, the values of ς are in the range of 0.9–0.999, determined by a optimized fitting program. Values forT m and ΔG were obtained on the basis of the fitting procedure, which inputs the values of ΔH°, ΔS°, A rc, andA st estimated from the experimental measurements and then uses an optimized fitting program to search for the best fit. The G-rich oligonucleotides, T30695 and its derivatives, plus 10 mm KCl in 20 mmLi3PO4, pH 7, were labeled by 32P, using 5′-end labeling procedure and purified using Microspin G-25 columns. The oligonucleotide solution was heated 90 °C for 5 min and cooled at 4 °C for 30 min. 20% polyacrylamide gels (with 10 × Tris-borate EDTA, 10% ammonium persulfate, and 30 μl ofN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine) in 1× TBA buffer was precooled in a 4 °C cold room for an hour. Then the gels with loaded samples were run for 4–6 h in the 4 °C cold room. Anti-HIV integrase activity was determined utilizing a 96-well scintillation proximity assay (SPA) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, each test reaction contained 1) tritiated oligonucleotide substrate in assay buffer supplemented with 50 mm MnCl2 (pH was adjusted according to the experimental protocol), 2) diluted test material, and 3) diluted integrase enzyme (final concentration, ∼50 nm) in a total of 100 μl; the total mixture contained a final concentration of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide. Following incubation for 1 h at 31–33 °C, the reaction was stopped with 50 mm EDTA, pH 8, and 110 μl of SPA bead/denaturing reagent was added to each well and mixed gently. Plates were sealed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min; all compounds were tested in duplicate. The degree of integrase-catalyzed oligonucleotide strand transfer was then quantified with a Wallac MicroBeta scintillation counter, and the resulting data were utilized to calculate the IC50 value for each test compound. Virus culture assays for inhibition of the HIV-1 cytopathicity induced by the three HIV-1 virus strains, IIIB, MN, and RF, in MT-4 cells were carried out as described elsewhere (17.De Clercq E. Yamamoto N. Pauwels R. Baba M. Schols D. Nakashima H. Balzarini J. Debyser Z. Murrer B.A. Schwatz D. Thornton D. Bridger G. Fricker S. Henson G. Abrams M. Picker D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

T30695, 5′-g*ggtgggtgggtggg*t-3′, forms an extremely stable intramolecular G-quartet structure in the presence of K+ via a two-step process that involves the binding of one K+ ion to a central pair of G-quartets and two additional K+ ions to loops (Fig. 1, A andB). NMR data and molecular modeling (14.Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. Dynamics. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15.Jing N. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34992-34999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that T30695 in the presence of Li+ forms an asymmetric, less stable G-quartet structure with twisted G-quartet plates and opened loops, referred to as the Li+ form structure (Fig. 2). Upon coordination with three K+ ion equivalents, the structure of T30695becomes symmetric and compact (15 Å width and 15 Å length), referred to as the K+ form structure (Fig. 2). This coordination greatly increases the thermal stability of the molecular structure ofT30695 and its activity on HIV-1 integrase inhibition. As seen in Tables I—III, theT m of T30695 increased as a function of K+ concentration, e.g. 46.3 °C at 0.1 mm KCl, 59.7 °C at 0.5 mm KCl and 69.8 °C at 1.0 mm KCl. The free energy, ΔG°, of the molecular structure of T30695 decreased from −4.06 kcal/mol at 0.1 mm KCl to −9.35 kcal/mol at 1.0 mm KCl.Figure 2The molecular structure of T30695 in the absence of K+, referred to as the Li+ form, and in the presence of K+, referred to as the K+form.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34992-34999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Comparing the two structures with each other, Li+ form structure is an intramolecular G-quartet with twisted G-quartet plates and opened loops.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34992-34999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) suggest that several features of the structure of T30695 should be considered when attempting to rationalize the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase, even though the molecular structure of the integrase-T30695 complex is not available yet. The K+ form structure of T30695 lacks a groove, and its two ends are nearly planar. This cylindrical symmetry and large surface area may increase the probability of T30695 binding to HIV-1 integrase. The base planes of all G and T residues of T30695are coordinated with K+ ions, and the coordination greatly increases the thermal stability of the structure while greatly decreasing its capacity for dimers or higher aggregate formation. The higher stability and lowered capacity for aggregation may enhance the ability to resist nuclease degradation and for its efficient delivery into cells. Three unhydrated K+ ions are bound to T30695, creating a cylinder with positive charges inside and negative charges on the surface, which also could be a factor for enhanced interaction between T30695 and HIV-1 integrase. NMR data also showed that upon binding K+ ions, the bases of T-G-T-G loop domains of T30695 folded into an approximate plane aligned with the G-quartets. The formation of the hydrogen bonds in the loop structure greatly increased the thermal stability of G-quartet structure of T30695. When the bases of T-G-T-G loop domains fold in an approximate plane, each of the T methyl groups (CH3) is pointed out of the folded plane and faces the solution (Fig.3). That special orientation for the eight T methyl groups of T30695 provides potential sites for the substitution of other chemical groups, such as bulky groups or charged groups, without disruption of loop structure. In this study, a set of T30695 derivatives were synthesized to investigate the relationship between sequence and thermal stability and the relation between the thermal stability of the oligomers and their anti-HIV activity. One oligonucleotide set (T30925–T30928) was derived from T30695 by replacing one T of the loop domains with a propynyl dU, whereas T30929 and T30924 were derived by the substituting two and three propynyl dUs (TablesTable I, Table II, Table III and Fig. 1 D). Thermal denaturation of these oligonucleotides was measured optically at three K+ ion concentrations (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mm KCl), and the resulting absorbanceversus temperature curves were analyzed by curve fitting, using a two-step formalism for the folding equilibrium proposed by Longfellow et al. (16.Longfellow C.E. Kierzek R. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Fig.4 A shows a representative analysis of T m for T30927 in 1.0 mmKCl. The data points are UV absorbance values at 240 nm, and the solid line is a curve fitting to the data points with a fitting coefficient of 0.9996, based upon the relationships derived by Longfellow et al. (16.Longfellow C.E. Kierzek R. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Coefficients of the other members of the set were also in the 0.99 or higher range. The free energy ofT30927 folding in 1.0 mm KCl at 295 K, ΔG° = −10.85 (kcal/mol), was obtained from this analysis (Table III), as were equivalent values for the other oligonucleotides of this family.Table IIIThe oligonucleotides with 1.0 mm KCl in 20 mmLi3PO4, pH 7OligomerSequenceT mΔH °ΔS °ΔG ° (T = 295K)Fitting coefficient°Ckcal/mol(cal/K · mol)(kcal/mol)T306955′-g*ggtgggtgggtggg*t-3′69.8−66.97−195.32−9.350.9963T309255′-g*ggTgggtgggtggg*t-3′68.8−77.90−227.92−10.660.9997T309265′-g*ggtgggTgggtggg*t-3′69.1−68.27−199.60−9.390.9991T309275′-g*ggtgggtgggTggg*t-3′68.7−79.40−232.38−10.850.9996T309285′-g*ggtgggtgggtggg*T-3′71.1−74.95−217.83−10.690.9996T309295′-g*ggTgggtgggTggg*t-3′66.4−80.41−236.90−10.530.9994T309245′-g*ggTgggTgggTggg*t-3′65.0−77.81−230.23−9.890.9984*, PT linkages; T, propynyl dU. Open table in a new tab *, PT linkages; T, propynyl dU. As seen from these data, the substitution of propynyl dU in the loops does not induce a substantial change in the thermal stability of the G-quartet based folding when compared with T30695 (Tables Table I, Table II, Table III). The average T m and ΔG of these oligonucleotides were 50.1 ± 3.8 °C and −5.32 ± 1.54 kcal/mol) in 0.1 mm KCl (Table I), 60.9 ± 3.3 °C and −8.86 ± 2.11 kcal/mol in 0.5 mm KCl (Table II), and 67.9 ± 3.2 °C and −10.24 ± 0.89 kcal/mol in 1.0 mm KCl (Table III). The slope of a linear regression of ΔG° versus log[K+] for T30695and its derivatives was 5.3 ± 0.5 (independent of propynyl substitution) with fitting coefficients of 0.96 to 1.0 (Fig.4 B). The Δn(=ΔΔG°/2.3RTΔLog10[K+]) values of T30695, T30924, T30925, and T30929 (3.8, 4.2, 3.5, and 3.8, respectively) demonstrate that three or more K+ equivalents are released from the folded structures upon the melting of T30695 and each of the propynyl dU derivatives. The K+-induced loop folding of T30695 by binding three K+ ions was previously confirmed by NMR titration study (13.Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the loop folding of T30695plays a key role in structure stability and in inhibition of HIV integrase activity (15.Jing N. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34992-34999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The plots in Fig. 4 B show that both thermal stability and K+-induced loop folding are not significantly affected by the propynyl substitution. Interestingly,T m values of T30928 suggest that propynyl dU at the 3′-end may lead to a higher thermal stability (Tables Table I, Table II, Table III).Table IThe oligonucleotides with 0.1 mm KCl in 20 mmLi3PO4, pH 7OligomerSequenceT mΔH °ΔS °ΔG ° (T = 295K)Fitting coefficient(°C)kcal/mol(cal/K · mol)(kcal/mol)T306955′-g*ggtgggtgggtggg*t-3′46.3−53.29−166.90−4.060.9995T309255′-g*ggTgggtgggtggg*t-3′51.0−64.49−199.02−5.770.9995T309265′-g*ggtgggTgggtggg*t-3′51.1−64.17−197.98−5.760.9992T309275′-g*ggtgggtgggTggg*t-3′51.6−64.64−199.15−5.890.9997T309285′-g*ggtgggtgggtggg*T-3′53.7−70.25−215.01−6.820.9991T309295′-g*ggTgggtgggTggg*t-3′48.6−62.79−195.24−5.190.9996T309245′-g*ggTgggTgggTggg*t-3′48.7−45.59−141.72−3.780.9994*, PT linkages; T, propynyl dU.

This set of T30695 derivatives was designed to investigate the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase activity by a G-tetrad structure with added positive charge in the loop domains, using the substitution of 5-amino dU for T 5-methyl (CH3).T40101–T40103 possess one such substitution, so that the loop with a 5-amino dU will carry one positive charge. T40104 and T40105 have two such substitutions in the two T-G-T-G loop domains (top and bottom).T40106 has two positive charges in a single T-G-T-G loop domain (Fig.1 E). T40107 was designed by substituting three T methyls with three 5-amino dUs. The thermal denaturation measurements in TableIV show that in 1.0 mm KCl,T m values of T40101–T40107 are in the range of 66–70 °C, the same as T m of T30695. The ΔG° values of T40101–T40105 are also in the same range of ΔG° of T30695. T40106 and T40107 have a slight lower ΔG°, which could result from the two substitutions of 5-animo dU in a single T-G-T-G loop domain.Table IVThe oligonucleotides with 1.0 mm KCl in 20 mmLi3PO4, pH 7OligomerSequenceT mΔH °ΔS °ΔG ° (T = 295K)Fitting coefficient°Ckcal/mol(cal/K · mol)(kcal/mol)T401015′-gggIgggtgggtgggt-3′69.2−73.37−214.43−10.120.993T401025′-gggtgggIgggtgggt-3′69.5−64.11−187.18−8.890.998T401035′-gggtgggtgggIgggt-3′69.3−59.33−173.33−8.200.996T401045′-gggIgggIgggtgggt-3′69.6−71.74−209.42−9.960.997T401055′-gggtgggIgggIgggt-3′67.2−82.68−243.04−10.990.996T401065′-gggIgggtgggIgggt-3′65.9−50.80−149.89−6.580.995T401075′-gggIgggIgggIgggt-3′69.2−49.30−144.88−6.690.993I, 5-amino du(3C). Open table in a new tab I, 5-amino du(3C). To confirm the obtained T m values of T30695 and its derivatives, we determined the influence onT m by employing a different heating rate in the melting studies. We found that upon alteration of heating rate from 0.5 to 2.5 °C/min, the T m values of these G-quartet structures shifted less than 1 °C whenT m was in the range of 60–80 °C (data not shown). Our results suggest that the T m values of these G-tetrad-forming oligonucleotides are independent of the heating rate in the range of 0.5–2.5 °C/min. The previous kinetic studies of T30695 and TBA demonstrated that in the presence of K+ the first folding step, forming a self-associated G-quartet structure, is very fast (15.Jing N. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34992-34999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In melting measurements UV absorption at 240-nm wavelength mainly monitors the disordered and reordered G-quartet structures of these oligonucleotides. The fact thatT m values of T30695, TBA, and derivatives are independent of heating rate in the range of 0.5–2.5 °C/min could result from a fast forming G-quartet structure. The structural stability of T30695 derivatives, T30924–T30929, and T40101–T40107, were thoroughly measured, and T m values of these derivatives did not show significantly different from that of T30695(Tables Table I, Table II, Table III, Table IV). T30924–T30929 were also estimated to have the same ion binding equivalents with T30695 (Fig. 4 B). Hence it was suggested that T30695 derivatives T30924–T30929 and T40101–T40107form an intramolecular G-quartet structure the same as that of T30695. Further evidence to support the suggestion was provided by running nondenaturating gels at 4 °C. T30695 and TBA were used as controls because the structures of T30695 and TBA have been determined to form an intramolecular G-quartets with two G-quartets in central by NMR (15.Jing N. Hogan M.E. J.

To investigate the role of PTPα in activation of the Src kinase in more detail we tried to overexpress this phosphatase in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Although PTPα has been overexpressed in rat embryonic fibroblasts and in embryonic carcinoma cells and should increase mitogenic responses we were not able to achieve a detectable overexpression. In contrast, expression of partially (C442S) or completely inactive (C442S,C732S) PTPα or of phosphatase active PTPα containing mutation Y781F or Y798F was possible. The level of expression, however, was reduced to background after several passages of lines expressing PTPαC442S,C732S and PTPαY781F. When employed in a focus formation assay, only infection with virus encoding PTPαY798F induced Src-dependent formation of foci. In immunofluorescence studies, PTPαC442S and PTPαY781F but not PTPαY798F colocalized with proteins found in focal adhesion plaques. Treatment of PTPαC442S-overexpressing cells with vanadate abolished this colocalization and led to proteolytic processing of the phosphatase. We conclude that tyrosine 798 in PTPα is important for localization at focal adhesion plaques. Inhibition of phosphatases by vanadate treatment releases PTPα from focal adhesions.

Inhibition of phosphatases by vanadate treatment releases PTPα from focal adhesions. protein-tyrosine phosphatase peroxovanadate Tyrosine phosphorylation regulates many cellular signaling pathways including those involved in mitogenesis, differentiation, and metabolic processes. Transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinases are activated by extracellular signals and generate phosphorylated tyrosines, either by auto- or substrate phosphorylation. These serve as docking sites or change the catalytic activity of the phosphorylated protein, respectively. The family of tyrosine kinases is rather large and comprises more than 100 genes that are expressed either ubiquitously or in specific tissues (1.van-der-Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Putative antagonists of kinases are protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs),1 and more than 80 members of this family have been identified (2.Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Although initially the assumed role of phosphatases was to deactivate cellular signaling, examples are emerging where the phosphatase is necessary for activation of signaling pathways. This was documented in experiments where overexpression of a catalytically inactive form of the SH2 domain containing phosphatase SHP-2 interfered with signal transduction from the insulin receptor (3.Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Similarly, the leukocyte-specific transmembrane PTP CD45 dephosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue of the Lck kinase and thereby mediates the activation of the T-cell receptor (5.Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23517-23520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and the transmembrane phosphatase PTPα has been shown to regulate the activity of the Src kinase by dephosphorylating its carboxyl-terminal tyrosine (6.Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 7.den-Hertog J. Pals C.E. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de-Laat S.W. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanisms of these regulatory events, however, have not been identified. PTPα is a ubiquitously expressed phosphatase with a small extracellular domain and two intracellular phosphatase domains. The extracellular domain consists of 123 or, in a splice variant with 9 additional amino acids next to the transmembrane sequence, 132 amino acids that are heavily glycosylated (8.Kaplan R. Morse B. Huebner K. Croce C. Howk R. Ravera M. Ricca G. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7000-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9.Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). No soluble or cell surface-anchored ligands are known to bind to the PTPα extracellular domain. For the intracellular domain a splice variant with a 36-amino acid insert in the amino-terminal phosphatase domain was found in mouse (10.Matthews R.J. Cahir E.D. Thomas M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4444-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This phosphatase domain harbors the main activity of the phosphatase, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain probably has a more regulatory role (11.Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12.Lim K.L. Lai D.S. Kalousek M.B. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PTPα can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C in the juxtamembrane domain, and this will enhance its activity (13.Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14.den-Hertog J. Sap J. Pals C.E. Schlessinger J. Kruijer W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on tyrosine residues occurs at the very carboxyl terminus of PTPα and leads to the binding of the adaptor protein grb2. The kinase probably responsible for this phosphorylation was identified as c-Src in in vitro andin vivo assays (15.den-Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). No insight, however, has been gained into the physiological consequences of tyrosine phosphorylation and grb2 binding. We have shown recently that, in addition to the activation of c-Src, PTPα is capable of down-regulating the insulin signal in baby hamster kidney cells (16.Moller N.P. Moller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Hoppe E. Wiberg F.C. Sures I. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23126-23131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the system used in that study, stimulation of the overexpressed insulin receptor led to growth reduction, rounding of cells, and finally detachment from the dish surface. Cooverexpression of PTPα but not an activated form of c-Src reestablished the normal phenotype, indicating that the effect of PTPα was not mediated by activation of c-Src but probably was directly at the level of the insulin receptor. Obviously, the physiological effects of PTPα are rather complex and can involve different signaling pathways. We therefore decided to investigate the role of PTPα in more detail by establishing NIH3T3 cell lines overexpressing PTPα and PTPα mutants. We found that PTPα concentrates at focal cell substratum adhesion sites and that this association is abolished by mutation of the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue or treatment of cells with vanadate. PTPα and its mutant forms have been described before (17.Lammers R. Moller N.P. Ullrich A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); the kinases csk andhyl were of human origin, whereas c-src was of murine origin and was generously provided by T. Hunter, San Diego. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine, BOSC 23 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium with the same supplements. To establish the overexpressing NIH3T3 cell lines, all cDNAs were cloned into the retroviral expression vector pLXSN. Cesium chloride gradient-purified DNA was transfected into BOSC 23 cells, retrovirus-containing supernatant harvested, and used to infect NIH3T3 cells as described by Pear et al. (18.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). G418-resistant cells were tested for expression of the donor genes, and positive clones were expanded and used for experiments. Antibodies used to detect PTPα were a rabbit polyclonal serum α-CT, directed against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide representing the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids, or D2, a mouse monoclonal IgG2 directed against an epitope in the intracellular domain of PTPα which is not affected by grb2 binding to the phosphatase. Antibodies for detection of c-Src, Csk, and Hyl were also generated against keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptides representing the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of the proteins, whereas antibodies against paxillin and vinculin were obtained from Transduction Laboratories and Sigma, respectively. Phosphotyrosine was detected by mouse monoclonal antibody 5E.2 (19.Fendly B.M. Winget M. Hudziak R.M. Lipari M.T. Napier M.A. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1550-1558PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies for use in Western blotting experiments were from Bio-Rad. Cells were grown to confluence, made quiescent by changing the serum content to 0.5% for 24 h, and treated with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate for 1–2 h. They were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgC12, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 mmsodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) per 10-cm dish, the lysate centrifuged for 2 min at 12,500 × g, and proteins immunoprecipitated from the supernatant for 4 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel in the presence of 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the respective antibodies. Precipitates were washed, Laemmli buffer added, boiled for 5 min, size separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and analyzed by immunoblotting. NIH3T3 cells (75,000) were seeded into a six-well dish and 24 h later infected with 105virus in the presence of 6 μg/ml Polybrene. 36 h later, cells were trypsinized and seeded into a 10-cm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4% fetal calf serum. The medium was changed every other day for 3 weeks, and the cells were then stained with crystal violet. NIH3T3 cells were grown on uncoated glass coverslips and fixed for 30 min with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.12 m sucrose. Autofluorescence was quenched with phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 mm glycine and 26 mm borohydrate. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and unspecific antibody binding blocked for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.45% fish gelatin. Incubation with primary antibody was done at room temperature for 2 h after dilution in 0.45% fish gelatin (1:50 for the polyclonal and 1:200 for the monoclonal anti-PTPα, 1:200 for anti-vinculin and anti-paxillin antibody). For double labeling experiments antibody decoration was done consecutively. After three washes with 0.45% fish gelatin, the primary antibody was detected with an isotype-specific secondary antibody fluorescein isothiocyanate (5-([4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl]amino)fluorescein)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) or Cy3-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:300, Jackson Laboratories). Controls were incubated with either species-specific nonimmune serum or without primary antibody under otherwise identical conditions. Glass coverslips were mounted on microscope slides under glycerol with 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane and were viewed with appropriate filter blocks for fluorescein and rhodamine on an LSM 410 laser scanning microscope (Zeiss) using a 40 × oil immersion objective of aperture 1.3. Images were recorded with a voxel size of 0.083 μm. In some experiments a gray scale transmission image (pseudophase contrast) and the two individual laser confocal images were superimposed to visualize the localization of antibody and cellular morphology simultaneously. Coimmunolabeled cells were recorded at the identical exposure, brightness, and contrast settings. Previous reports suggested a role for PTPα in the regulation of Src kinase and found PTPα to be constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated and bound to the adaptor protein grb2. In addition, overexpression in rat embryo fibroblasts led to cell transformation. We wanted to investigate the role of PTPα in the transformation of NIH3T3 cells using a cell line that was selected to exhibit a flat nontransformed morphology. Our approach involved initially the mutation of those amino acid residues in PTPα which may be important for phosphatase function or regulation. Exchange of amino acid 442 from cysteine to serine leads to inactivation of the amino-terminal phosphatase domain where the main activity is localized, whereas mutation of cysteine 732 to serine inactivates the second phosphatase domain (the numbering of residues is according to Kaplanet al. (8.Kaplan R. Morse B. Huebner K. Croce C. Howk R. Ravera M. Ricca G. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7000-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)). By homology to a similar sequence motif found in CD45 (20.Autero M. Saharinen J. Pessa M.T. Soula R.M. Oetken C. Gassmann M. Bergman M. Alitalo K. Burn P. Gahmberg C.G. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell.

The phosphatase activity of the different mutants has been analyzed previously (17.Lammers R. Moller N.P. Ullrich A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and was comparable to wild type activity in vitro and in intact cells for the mutants C732S, Y781F, and Y798Y whereas the mutation C442S abolished phosphatase activity. For expression in 3T3 cells the cDNAs were cloned into a retroviral expression vector. Subsequently, recombinant retroviruses were generated and used to infect 3T3 cells. To our surprise we were not able to overexpress the native PTPα in 3T3 cells although we could demonstrate that the expression construct and the retroviruses were functional in a baby hamster kidney-insulin receptor cell rescue experiment (16.Moller N.P.

Transfection into 3T3 cells of a cytomegalovirus promoter-based PTPα expression plasmid used in the transient expression system also was not successful. Similar results were obtained with the closely related PTPε. The completely inactive PTPαC442S,C732S was overexpressed only weakly, and expression decreased over time. PTPαY781F was expressed, but the level was reduced with increasing passage number. Only PTPαC442S containing the inactive amino-terminal phosphatase domain and PTPαY798F lacking the grb2 binding site were present in the cells permanently and at high level. The reason for this differential expression is unclear, but it probably reflects growth-inhibiting or toxic effects of PTPα in this cell line which are not exerted by the mutant PTPs. Interestingly, other transmembrane PTPs could also not be overexpressed in this system (PTPs μ, κ, LAR, and CD45), whereas several intracellular PTPs were expressed well (PTPs 1B, TC, SHP-1, and STEP; data not shown). The cell lines were grown confluent, made quiescent, and left untreated or stimulated for 2 h with 1 mm vanadate. The cells were then lysed, and PTPα was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody D2, directed against the intracellular domain. In theupper panel of Fig. 1 the phosphotyrosine content of PTPα mutants was evaluated and showed a strong increase of tyrosine phosphorylation in PTPα upon vanadate treatment in all cell lines. The different expression levels found for the PTPα mutants in the different cell lines are shown in thelower panel of Fig. 1. When comparing the expression levels of PTPαY798F versus C442S or Y781F the phosphorylation of Y798F was clearly reduced. This indicates that tyrosine 798 represents the major tyrosine phosphorylation site in PTPα, but it also reveals that other sites are phosphorylated in 3T3 cells, as has been shown previously by den-Hertog et al. (15.den-Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cooverexpression of PTPαC442S with c-Src, Csk, or Hyl led to an increased phosphorylation of the phosphatase in the absence of vanadate. The candidate sites for these kinases would be tyrosine 798 for c-Src and tyrosine 781 for Csk and Hyl. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPα by Csk has also been shown in transient expression experiments (data not shown). Because activation of endogenous c-Src by overexpressed PTPα has been found in rat embryo fibroblasts and P19 embryonal carcinoma cells (6.Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 7.den-Hertog J. Pals C.E. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de-Laat S.W. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) we wanted to investigate whether overexpression of PTPα or its mutant forms activates c-Src in the established cell lines. However, none of the cell lines formed foci or grew in soft agar so that activation of endogenous c-Src seemed not to be sufficient for transformation of the host cell. We therefore generated an NIH3T3 cell line overexpressing a moderate amount of murine c-Src. This cell line did not form foci or grow in soft agar either. When these cells were infected with equal amounts of retroviruses encoding PTPα, PTPαY781F, or PTPαY798F, foci were formed only upon infection with retrovirus encoding PTPαY798F (Fig. 2). The reason for this differential behavior is unclear. As discussed before, native PTPα could not be overexpressed in 3T3 cells, and this would be a simple explanation for the failure to form foci. On the other hand, PTPαY781F is catalytically active and can be overexpressed in 3T3 cells at least for several passages, therefore the phosphatase activity itself cannot be toxic, and the mutant should behave like the native phosphatase with respect to c-Src activation. We conclude that different from results obtained in REF or P19 cells, the mitogenic role of PTPα in 3T3 cells apparently is tightly controlled, and this control is reduced upon mutation of tyrosine 798. PTPα binds with its phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal tyrosine to the SH2 domain of the adaptor protein grb2 (21.den-Hertog J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22.Su J. Yang L.T. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28086-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It has been shown earlier that the SH3 domains of grb2 mediate association to intracellular structures (23.Bar S.D. Rotin D. Batzer A. Mandiyan V. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1993; 74: 83-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to know whether PTPα could localize to distinct structures at the cell surface and undertook immunolocalization studies using laser confocal microscopy. Subconfluent 3T3 cells overexpressing PTPαC442S, PTPαY798F, or PTPαY781F were grown on glass discs and stained with rabbit polyclonal antiserum against PTPα. As shown in Fig.3 A, the perinuclear region and streak-like structures in the periphery of the PTPαC442S and PTPαY781F cells were identified. The staining in the cell periphery suggested a localization of PTPα to focal cell-substratum adhesions. In none of the cells overexpressing PTPαY798F were the streak-like structures detected, indicating a different cellular localization of the phosphatase with a mutated grb2 binding site. The use of the monoclonal antibody D2 directed against a different intracellular epitope of PTPα stained the same structures in the cell. To confirm the localization of PTPα to focal adhesion sites, cells were double stained using a mouse monoclonal antibody against paxillin, a typical focal adhesion protein, in addition to the rabbit polyclonal PTPα antiserum (Fig. 3 B). Secondary antibodies coupled to different fluorescent tags allowed monitoring of PTPα and paxillin at the same time and revealed the staining of identical structures in the cell. Again, PTPαY798F did not localize to focal adhesions although focal adhesions were still found in the cell. A similar staining pattern for antibodies directed against PTPα was also found when A431 cells were investigated (data not shown). These data suggest that PTPα localizes preferentially to focal adhesion complexes in the basal plasmalemma and that an intact carboxyl-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation site but not phosphatase activity is required for this localization. We have, however, not been able in immunoprecipitation experiments to identify a protein that interacts with PTPα and mediates its association with the focal adhesion complex (data not shown). Treatment of cells with the phosphatase inhibitor peroxovanadate (POV) strongly increases the cellular phosphotyrosine content. Because POV also causes an increase in the phosphotyrosine content of PTPα and an increase in size and number of focal adhesions (24.Volberg T. Zick Y. Dror R. Sabanay I. Gilon C. Levitzki A. Geiger B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) we wanted to investigate its effect on the distribution of PTPα. The cell line overexpressing PTPαC442S was grown subconfluently on glass discs, treated with POV as indicated, and stained with antibodies against PTPα and vinculin, another protein typically found in focal adhesion sites. As can be seen in thetop panel of Fig. 4, POV treatment abolishes the streak-like staining in the cell periphery found with the antibody specific for PTPα. The staining of the focal cell-substratum adhesions with the antibody against vinculin, however, was not reduced by POV treatment (Fig. 4, middle panel). This is also illustrated in the lower panel where pictures from the staining with both antibodies (vinculin, red; PTPα, green) are superimposed, and the yellow streaks in the cell periphery document the colocalization of PTPα and vinculin at focal contacts. After POV treatment, only the red staining of the focal adhesion protein vinculin was detected, indicating the dissociation of PTPα from these structures. To investigate the effect of POV on the PTPα protein we grew PTPαC442S-overexpressing cells to confluence, made the cells quiescent, and left them untreated or treated with POV. PTPα was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with monoclonal antibody D2 directed against the cytoplasmic domain that does not interfere with the association of proteins to phosphorylated tyrosine 798. Alternatively, the polyclonal antiserum generated against the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids of PTPα was used which can bind only when no protein is associated with the phosphorylated tyrosine 798. The immunoprecipitates were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with antibody D2. As shown in Fig. 5, the staining pattern of PTPα was dependent on the antibody used for immunoprecipitation. Antibody D2 detected the 130-kDa form of PTPα; however, POV treatment decreased the amount of the 130-kDa form and reduced its mobility, as expected when additional residues are phosphorylated. Furthermore, a second form of PTPα was detected only after POV treatment which had an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa. By contrast, immunoprecipitation of PTPα with the polyclonal serum was possible only after POV treatment, and no reduced size form was detected. At the bottom of the figure and around 100 kDa in the lanes representing the immunoprecipitates with the polyclonal serum, IgG is decorated by the secondary antibody. We conclude that PTPα is localized to focal adhesion plaques in the cell and that after POV treatment a part of the PTPα population is proteolytically cleaved. This fragment still is phosphorylated (data not shown) and associated with a protein bound to the carboxyl terminus because it is not detected by the antiserum recognizing the carboxyl terminus. The intact form of PTPα is no longer associated with a protein bound to the carboxyl terminus, and therefore immunoprecipitation with the polyclonal serum is possible. In this paper we have investigated the function of PTPα in NIH3T3 cells. Despite the previously reported positive regulatory function, we were not able to overexpress native PTPα but only mutant forms. From these mutants only PTPαY798F was able to activate Src and transform the 3T3 cells. The mutation of the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue also led to a different intracellular localization: the phosphatase inactive mutant and the mutant PTPαY781F were found at focal adhesion sites, and this localization was abolished by treatment of cells with POV. The Y798F mutant, however, was dislocated from focal adhesion sites. In our hands, not only PTPα but also several other receptor-type PTPs could not be overexpressed in 3T3 cells. Recently, Weng et al. (25.Weng L.P. Yuan J. Yu Q. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 247-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) described the overexpression of native PTPLAR in rat embryonic fibroblast cells which was only possible to a level exceeding the endogenous phosphatase 2–3-fold. Higher protein levels were found when they used an inducible expression system, and cells underwent apoptosis after induction of LAR overexpression. However, PTPα has been successfully overexpressed in several cell lines already having a detectable level of endogenous PTPα (6.Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 7.den-Hertog J. Pals C.E. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de-Laat S.W. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 26.Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the antibodies available in our hands we had no problem detecting endogenous PTPα in 293, A431, or baby hamster kidney cell lines but could not do so in our NIH3T3 cells, suggesting an extremely low level of endogenous PTPα in these cells (data not shown). This could indicate a specific sensitivity of our 3T3 cells toward the activity of PTPα. However, because native PTPα and its tyrosine mutants do not show a clear difference in their phosphatase activity (17.Lammers R. Moller N.P. Ullrich A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a toxic effect of the phosphatase activity should not be the sole physiological basis for the differential expression. This is demonstrated by the overexpression of the Y798F and the Y781F mutants, although the latter could only be overexpressed for a limited number of passages. The intermediate toxicity of the Y781F mutant compared with the native phosphatase or the Y798F mutant could be caused by a change in the structure of the carboxyl terminus of PTPα which would reduce the tyrosine phosphorylation and the subsequent binding of grb2 or other proteins without having a major impact on the phosphatase activity. Another consequence could be a weaker or differently regulated association with the focal adhesion sites. This phosphorylation, protein binding, or localization mediated by the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue is not required for the Src activating function of PTPα because the mutant PTPαY798F was capable of generating Src-dependent foci. Moreover, the focus formation experiment even indicates that this residue may have a down-regulating function in the native PTPα. 10–20% of the cellular PTPα is constitutively associated with the adaptor protein grb2 and therefore tyrosine phosphorylated in NIH3T3 cells (15.den-Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26.Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of tyrosine phosphorylation in PTPα not associated with grb2 is probably down-regulated by the autodephosphorylating activity of PTPα. It is therefore conceivable that inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases by treatment with vanadate increases the degree of phosphotyrosine in the different mutant forms, as shown in Fig. 1. The finding of enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation in 3T3 cells also overexpressing the tyrosine kinases Csk and Hyl indicates the potential role of these proteins for the regulation of PTPα activity. By coimmunoprecipitation experiments we have tried to identify the focal adhesion protein that associates with PTPα. However, we failed to detect any association with the major focal adhesion site proteins. Therefore, PTPα must bind to an as yet unidentified protein, or the interaction with focal adhesion proteins is not stable under lysis conditions. Other transmembrane PTPs have also been shown to localize to special areas at the cell surface: PTPs PCP-2 (27.Wang H. Lian Z. Lerch M.M. Chen Z. Xie W. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2555-2562PubMed Google Scholar), μ (28.Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and LAR (29.Kypta R.M. Su H. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 30.Aicher B. Lerch M.M. Muller T. Schilling J. Ullrich A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 681-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) were found at sites of cell-cell adhesion, whereas PTPLAR has also been described as localizing to focal adhesion sites (31.Serra P.C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). For none of these PTPs was a correlation of localization with phosphatase activity possible so far. Because PTPα can activate the tyrosine kinases of the Src family and these kinases also localize to the focal adhesion sites, a role of PTPα in the regulation of Src-like kinases is an intriguing hypothesis. Two recent reports have also suggested a recruitment of PTPα to the focal adhesion sites: in nerve growth cones plating on laminin leads to an enhanced association of PTPα to the adhesion sites (32.Helmke S. Lohse K. Mikule K. Wood M.R. Pfenninger K.H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2465-2475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, vanadate treatment did not abolish the association of PTPα with focal adhesion points. This may be caused by the different cellular systems used or by the use of vanadate instead of POV. However, because in the particular experiment the cytoskeletal fraction of the growth cones was analyzed by immunoblotting, a relocalization of PTPα cannot be excluded. Harderet al. (33.Harder K.W. Moller N.P. Peacock J.W. Jirik F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31890-31900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have found that in A431 cells overexpression of PTPα increases cell-substratum adhesion (33.Harder K.W. Moller N.P. Peacock J.W. Jirik F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31890-31900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In an in vitro assay they could show that Csk was able to phosphorylate PTPα, supporting our data showing enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPα in Csk overexpressing 3T3 cells. However, it is difficult to understand how a PTPα-mediated activation of the Src kinase complies with the enhanced cell-substratum adhesion. Treatment with POV not only abolished association of PTPα with the focal adhesion sites, it also led to a proteolytic processing of the phosphatase. POV-dependent cleavage of the receptor tyrosine kinase erbB-4 has recently been described by Vecchi et al. (34.Vecchi M. Rudolph O.L. Brown C.L. Dempsey P.J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Using specific inhibitors these authors showed that metalloproteases are responsible for this cleavage. The released extracellular part of a metalloprotease-processed protein can act as a diffusible growth factor, lead to reduced adhesion, or increase migration. Whether a metalloprotease is responsible for cleavage of PTPα is currently under investigation. In addition to the processing, POV also changed the binding of intracellular proteins to the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of PTPα. Intact and unprocessed phosphatase was no longer associated with this protein but only the 75-kDa processing product. Because metalloproteases cleave their target in the juxtamembrane region of the extracellular domain this would mean that both populations of the phosphatase are cell surface-anchored. Both forms would be able to move to different sites on the cell surface and could therefore be involved in down-regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of cell surface proteins. In conclusion, we have shown that PTPα lacking a grb2 binding site has an enhanced potential to activate the Src kinase and that this activated state correlates with a change in its intracellular localization. Furthermore, the change in localization can also be induced by POV treatment. It will be interesting to see what the physiological regulators of the association of PTPα with the focal adhesion plaques are. We are grateful to Drs. T. Hunter for providing murine c-src and I.

Nature. 1989; 341: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), and an array of unrelated proteins such as Pseudomonas exotoxin, lactoferrin, and β-amyloid precursor protein. It is therefore not surprising that LRP is critical for life (7.Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and may be involved in the normal regulation of both proteinase and lipid metabolism. All members of the LDLR family are mosaic proteins composed of the same building blocks and with similar topological organizations (8.Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). These components are two classes of cysteine-rich small domains (epidermal growth factor-like repeats and complement-like repeats (abbreviated here as CR)), clusters of six domains containing YWTD motifs (9.Springer T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 837-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), a single transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic domain that contains one or two copies of the NPXY motif, which is a common internalization signal. The major structural differences between family members are in the size of the protein and therefore the number of constituent domains. LRP is the largest member of the family identified so far, with molecular mass of ∼600 kDa, compared with a molecular mass of only 180 kDa for LDLR itself. It contains 31 CR domains, which occur in four clusters of 2, 8, 10, and 11 repeats, counted from the N terminus. As with other LDLR family members, it is believed that protein ligands bind primarily to these clusters of CR domains. In contrast to LRP, LDLR contains only a single cluster of seven of these repeats. Although the basic organization of these repeats is the same, consisting of about 40 residues with three conserved disulfides and acidic residues that form a tight calcium binding site, there is much variation in the remainder of the primary structure (Fig. 1), so that the outer surfaces presented by different repeats are likely to vary considerably and presumably underlie the ability of these receptors to bind a wide array of proteins. This emphasizes, however, that to understand the specificity of binding of a given ligand to one family member rather than another and to one cluster of CR domains rather than another within the same receptor, it is necessary to determine both the structures of the CR domains involved in binding and to identify the contact residues involved in the binding interface. Because the receptor binding domain of human α2M is relatively small (138 residues) and contains the binding epitope of the whole α2M-proteinase complex (10.Nielsen K.L. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Thøgersen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12909-12912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it represents one of the simplest LRP protein ligands that might be studied with a view to elucidating specific ligand-LRP interactions at the molecular level. Furthermore, studies on LRP mini-receptors and LRP fragments suggest that α2M-proteinase complexes bind to the second cluster of CR domains that contains eight repeats, CR3-CR10, and most probably to the more N-terminal part of this cluster (11.Horn I.R. Van den Berg B.M.M. Van der Meijden P.Z. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13608-13613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have expressed the extreme N-terminal repeat from this cluster, CR3, and determined its three-dimensional structure in solution using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. This has allowed us to also examine the specificity of interaction between CR3 and receptor binding domain (RBD). We found that CR3 binds to RBD using residues on one face of the domain, and with a K d of ∼140 μm. This is the first report at the molecular level of a specific binding interaction between a member of the LDLR family and a protein ligand. CR3 was cloned as described previously (12.Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 13C/15N-labeled CR3 was expressed in minimal medium containing 0.6% basal medium Eagle vitamin solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mmMgSO4, 1 g liter−1(15NH4)2SO4, and 2 g liter−1 13C-labeled glucose, as described previously (12.Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Optimal yield was achieved by harvesting the cells 6 h after induction. Glutathione S-transferase-complement repeat fusion protein was purified according to Ref. 13.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar, cleaved with thrombin (1/1000 w/w, 5–10 min at 20 °C), and rechromatographed on reduced glutathione-Sepharose. Refolding was performed as described (12.Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Correct folding was indicated by the ability of the protein to bind calcium tightly, as shown by tryptophan fluorescence change and to give sensitized terbium fluorescence emission when terbium was bound (12.Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 5500 m−1cm−1 estimated from the amino acid composition (14.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar). The 138-residue RBD from human plasma α2M was prepared and purified as described previously, by proteolytic cleavage of methylamine-treated plasma α2M with papain at pH 4.5 and gel filtration on S200 HR (15.Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. Van Leuven F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). RBD was further purified by Mono Q ion exchange chromatography to remove any residual traces of papain. Concentrations of RBD were determined using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 7800m−1 cm−1 based on the amino acid composition. NMR spectra were recorded on a four channel Bruker DRX600 equipped with a pulsed-field-gradient accessory and operating at 600.13 MHz for 1H. NMR data were processed and analyzed using Triad 6.3 software (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Experiments used to make resonance assignments and establish NOE connectivities were carried out on 2 mm13C/15N-labeled CR3 in 20 mmd3-acetate, pH 5.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 10% D2O. For experiments to determine slowly exchanging amide protons, freeze-dried CR3 was reconstituted into D2O in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 and 20 mm d3-acetate at pH 5.5. For the titration of plasma RBD into labeled CR3, 15N-HSQC spectra of 100 μm13C,15N-labeled CR3 were recorded in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1% NaN3 after the addition of 10% D2O. RBD, in the identical buffer, was added to stoichiometries between 0.25 RBD:1 CR3 and 4.0 RBD:1 CR3. Standard NMR pulse sequences, as described previously for determination of the structure of the related LRP domain CR8 (16.Huang W. Dolmer K. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14130-14136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), were used for sequence assignment and determination of distance constraints. The center frequencies were 4.70 ppm, 118 ppm, and 43 ppm for 1H, 15N, and 13C, respectively. Sensitivity enhancement gradient pulses were employed (17.Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 103: 203-216Crossref Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 18.Palmer III, A.G. Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 93: 151-170Google Scholar). The stucture of CR3 was determined using the same approach and experiments used for our earlier structure determination of the related LRP domain CR8 (16.Huang W. Dolmer K. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14130-14136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In brief, sequence assignments were made by combining data from 15N-total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC and HBHA(CO)NH experiments with those from 13C-HCCH-total correlation spectroscopy and CBCA(CO)NH experiments. The residue-specific assignments were later checked using an HNCA experiment. The 13C-HCCH-total correlation spectroscopy experiment was also used for completion of the side chain assignments. Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified from two15N-HSQC spectra collected sequentially after dissolving the protonated freeze-dried CR3 into D2O buffer at pH 5.5. Distance constraints were obtained from 15N-NOESY-HSQC and13C-HCCH-NOESY experiments. Cross-peaks were classified as strong, medium, or weak and assigned to inter-proton separations of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 Å, respectively, for backbone-backbone interactions and to separations of 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 Å for side chain-backbone and side chain-side chain interactions. The three disulfides that are conserved in all of the CR domains of LRP and other members of the LDLR family were used as additional constraints. For CR3 these were between residues 6 and 18, 13 and 31, and 25 and 42. As the structures converged during annealing simulation, it became evident from systematic NOEs and from the presence of hydrogen bonds that there are two short stretches of β-strand (residues 11–13 and 17–19) and one turn of α-helix (residues 20–24). Accordingly, five φ torsion angle constraints (for residues 11, 12, 17–19) and six hydrogen bonds were therefore added based on the presence of this secondary structure. At a later stage, an additional four hydrogen bonds were identified and added. For the calcium binding site, 9 constraints were added between oxygen atoms of expected calcium-coordinating side chains. Calculations were carried out both without and with the Ca2+ distance restraints. For calculation of the final family of structures, 602 NOE distance constraints, nine calcium binding site constraints (three medium and six long range), three disulfide bonds between residues 6 and 18, 13 and 31, and 25 and 42, 10 hydrogen bonds and five angle constraints were used as input for DYANA (version 1.5 (19.Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar)). The resulting family of structures was without constraint violations >0.4 Å. A similar set of calculations was also carried out without inclusion of the nine calcium-oxygen constraints and again gave no constraint violations >0.5 Å. From 12,000 steps of simulated annealing the 40 best conformers from 400 calculated were used as input for energy minimization using AMBER (version 5.0 (20.Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Ross W.L. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Ferguson D.M. Radmer R.J. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER 5. University of California, San Francisco1997Google Scholar)), together with the constraints used as input for DYANA. Energy minimization was carried out for steps up to a maximum of 0.5 ps, except for the first step, which was for 0.01 ps. Force constants of 32 kcal mol−1 Å−1 for distance constraints and 50 kcal mol−1 radian−2 for dihedral angle constraints were employed. The constraint energy given in Table I is a measure of the mean energy violation, based on the force constants and using the relationship constraint energy = force constant × (current interatom separation − target interatom separation)2.

Open table in a new tab Sepharose 4B, MonoQ (HR5/5), and HiPrep S200 HR (26/60) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Terbium peroxide and D2O were from Sigma. Terbium peroxide was dissolved in concentrated HCl to give the trichloride. 99.997% CaCl2was from Johnson Matthey, Ltd. (15NH4)2SO4 and [13C]glucose were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. We have previously shown for CR3 and CR8 that Ca2+ binds tightly at a stoichiometry of 1:1 and induces an ordered structure in both of these complement-like repeats (12.Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As a result, there is a large increase in chemical shift dispersion for both 15N and 1H resonances in the presence of Ca2+. The structural studies reported here are for the Ca2+-bound CR3 complex. With the exception of the four prolines and the N-terminal glycine, all backbone nitrogen resonances and amide protons were assigned by standard NMR experiments, as described. A single set of well defined resonances was observed in the HSQC spectrum, with a range of chemical shifts of 3.32 ppm in the proton dimension (from 6.61 ppm for Ala38 to 9.93 ppm for Asp26) and 19.9 ppm in the 15N dimension (from 109 ppm for Ser16 to 128.9 ppm for Ala12), consistent with a compact, well ordered globular module. Assignments were made for all Hα and side chain protons and for most of the side chain carbons. Evidence for coordination of backbone carbonyls to calcium was sought from the amide15N chemical shifts of residues immediately C-terminal to putative coordinating carbonyls. The basis for this is that the electron-withdrawing effect of the positively charged calcium deshields both the carbonyl carbon and the attached nitrogen of the preceding residue (21.Biekofsky R.R. Martin S.R. Browne J.P. Bayley P.M. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7617-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As was the case for CR8, the amide chemical shifts of the residues immediately C-terminal to Trp23 and Asp28 were strongly downfield shifted, indicating that the tryptophan and aspartate carbonyls are ligands to the calcium. Thus, the amide 15N chemical shift of Lys24 was 126.2 ppm compared with a random coil value of 121.5 ppm and the chemical shift for Asn29 was 124.6 ppm compared with a random coil value of 119.5 ppm (22.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). We also attempted to identify which carboxyl side chains were coordinated to the metal ion from the chemical shifts of the carboxyl carbons, determined from an HA(CA)CO experiment. However, no marked deviations from normal chemical shifts were seen (range from 179.1 to 181.2 ppm for aspartates and from 181.2 to 183.6 for glutamates), making it impossible to use this criterion to establish which were the coordinating carboxyls. Instead, we made the assumption that the four completely conserved carboxyls, Asp26, Asp30, Asp37, and Glu38 (Fig. 1) that are ligands in LB5 (23.Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and CR8 (16.Huang W. Dolmer K. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14130-14136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), are also ligands in CR3. The definite involvement of the carbonyls of Trp23 and Asp28as ligands to the calcium (as with CR8), together with the ability to obtain a family of energy minimized structures with few violations (Table I), lend support to the correctness of this assumption. Ten hydrogen bonds were identified from an exchange experiment into D2O. Of these, four involved residues that formed the two-strand mini β-sheet, three were associated with the one turn α-helix (20–23, 21–24, and 10–21), and the remaining three were close to the calcium binding site. A total of 602 distance constraints were identified from NOE experiments, of which 264 were intraresidue, 168 were sequential, 74 were medium range, and 96 were long range (Table I). Using these NOE constraints, 9 calcium binding site distance constraints, the 10 hydrogen bonds, and the three disulfides, as well as five φ torsion angle constraints for residues in the β-sheet as input, a family of 400 structures was calculated by simulated annealing using DYANA. The 40 best structures from this output together with the calcium ion were used as input for energy minimization by AMBER. The 20 best structures gave no angle constraint violations and an average of 4.6 distance restraint violations/structure of less than 0.4 Å, with no violations greater than 0.4 Å (Table I). The quality of the family of best structures was very good for the core of the domain,i.e. from the first to the last cysteine, with root mean square deviation from the mean structure of only 0.42 Å for backbone and 0.88 Å for all heavy atoms. This increased to 1.50 and 1.93 Å when the additional 5 N-terminal and 3 C-terminal residues were included. This is expected given that the N-terminal dipeptide is not present in intact LRP, and the remaining N- and C-terminal residues must act as flexible linkers to the domains on either side. Calculations were also carried out without using any calcium-oxygen distance constraints. Minimal differences were found between these structures and those obtained using the calcium constraints (Table I), again suggesting that the calcium binding sites in CR3 and CR8 are homologous in location and in coordinating ligands. The family of 20 best structures obtained after energy minimization (Fig. 2) shows the same basic fold that has been found in domain CR8 from LRP and from three complement-like domains from LDLR (16.Huang W. Dolmer K. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14130-14136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23.Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 24.Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The structure consists of two loops connected at the bottom of the loops by a short α-helix and at the top by a disulfide. Each of the loops is itself closed at the bottom by a disulfide (Fig. 2). The left hand loop contains the two short strands in β-conformation, whereas the right hand loop contains the calcium binding site. The overall dimensions of the domain are approximately 20 × 20 × 27 Å. One of the slowly exchanging amide protons is for glutamate 21, which is positioned to form a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl side chain of glutamate 10, thus capping the N-terminal end of the short α-helix. Only a small hydrophobic core is possible in this small domain and is composed of phenylalanine 11, which is strongly conserved in these domains, as well as isoleucine 19, which is also strongly conserved. As noted above, definitive evidence for calcium binding ligands was only obtained for the carbonyls of Trp23 and Glu28. However, the energy minimized structures result in a calcium site that is very similar to that of CR8, with additional ligands from the carboxyls of aspartates 26, 30, and 36 and of Glu37. The absence of well defined secondary structure in this region, together with the high density of negatively charged residues may account for the need for calcium in this and other complement-like domains to lock the domain into a single conformation, through “cross-linking” the two sides of the right hand loop and by burying and neutralizing several of the negative charges. We have previously noted in our structure determination of CR8 that the high variability of the primary structure of these complement-like repeats, with the exception of the six conserved cysteines and a few other residues (see Fig. 1), together with the high surface area to volume ratio, result in a surface that varies markedly in charge and hydrophobic residue distribution from one repeat to another. At the time of determining the structure of CR8 no structures of repeats from LRP had been carried out, so our comparison then was between the surfaces of CR8 and of LB1, LB2, and LB5 from LDLR. We are now in a position to compare the surface of CR3 with that of CR8,i.e. two complement-like repeats from the same cluster within LRP. As with the comparison with repeats from LDLR, each of these repeats shows a very different distribution of positive, negative, and uncharged residues on both front and back faces of the domain (Fig. 3). On the front face of CR3 only a single patch of positive charge, from Arg22, is present, whereas there are four basic residues on the equivalent face in CR8. Conversely, there is more positive charge on the back face of CR3, Arg17, and Arg22, compared with CR8, which presents only Arg14 at the bottom of the domain. Equally distinct is the pattern of negatively charged residues, with much higher density on the back face of CR8 than on the equivalent face of CR3. Such major differences should not be surprising given the wide repertoire of protein ligands that LRP is capable of binding and the likely need for quite distinct binding sites for each. The 138-residue RBD of human α2-macroglobulin is thought to contain the whole of the epitope responsible for the binding of α2M-proteinase complexes to intact LRP. Furthermore, a binding site for such complexes has been localized to the N-terminal portion of cluster II of the complement-like repeats. Thus, whereas we have previously examined the interaction of RBD with CR8, which is in the C-terminal part of this cluster of repeats, and found no evidence for a specific interaction (12.Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we thought it possible that CR3 would show evidence for specific binding to RBD. Both to establish whether such specific interaction occurs and, if it does, to estimate the affinity of the interaction, we monitored the 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of15N-labeled CR3 as a function of added human plasma RBD, over a range of RBD from 0 to 4 equivalents, and with a CR3 concentration of 100 μm. We found that there was specific binding, as evidenced by selective perturbation of cross-peaks in the spectrum (Fig. 4). The perturbed peaks were all in fast exchange, suggesting that the interaction was not extremely tight. The titration also showed saturation behavior as more RBD was added. Residues that were most strongly affected were, in decreasing order, Gln20, the indole side chain of Trp23, Glu21, Asp30, and Phe11. Smaller perturbations were seen for Cys31, Leu32, Ile19, and Lys24. None of the perturbations were large, indicating that the interaction did not induce a conformational change within the domain and most likely involves contacts with the side chains. Using the largest perturbations, i.e. those for Glu21and Trp23, we estimated the affinity of the interaction by fitting the change in chemical shift to a single binding site model, and obtained a K d of ∼140 μm. Although this is much weaker than the binding of RBD (∼125 nm) or α2M-proteinase complexes (0.5 nm) to LRP (26.Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Roche P.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1406-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it is in keeping with our hypothesis of how LRP is able to bind an extremely wide range of ligands. We propose that pairs, or possible triplets of complement-like repeats, come together to form a ligand binding site, with interactions contributed by each of the participating domains. If an overall dissociation constant of 1 nm were desired for a pair of interactions (equivalent to a binding energy of 12.4 kcal mol−1) and each domain contributed equally to the affinity, each contribution of 6.2 kcal mol−1 would represent a dissociation constant of 32 μm, i.e. of similar magnitude to what we observe here. Because such pairwise interactions need not involve contiguous domains, the number of combinations and thus distinct ligand binding sites could be high in a protein such as LRP that has 31 such repeats. All of the perturbed residues map to a contiguous region of CR3 (Fig.5). These residues form a continuous surface from the top to the bottom of the “back” face of the domain, with the exception of Phe11, which is part of the hydrophobic “core,” and lies behind Trp23, which is itself strongly perturbed. Furthermore there is a gradation in the magnitude of the chemical shift perturbations, such that residues at the top of the domain are less affected than those at the bottom, suggesting that the strongest interactions occur toward the bottom of the domain. This is again consistent with the full binding site for RBD in intact LRP being formed by CR3 together with a second complement-like repeat docked against CR3, with the docking site being at the bottom edge of CR3 in the representation of Fig. 5 and continuing into the second, adjacent, domain. The nature of the residues that form the putative binding surface is of great interest given the reported involvement of two lysines on the outer face of RBD in binding to LRP (10.Nielsen K.L. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Thøgersen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12909-12912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although there are two acidic residues in CR3 perturbed by RBD binding, one, Asp30, is a ligand to the calcium ion and also shows only a small perturbation of the backbone amide. It is therefore not likely to be involved in an ionic interaction with lysine on RBD. In contrast, Glu21, at the very bottom of CR3 is very strongly perturbed and may well interact with a lysine on RBD. This would then require a second acidic residue in a second complement-like repeat to complete the ionic interactions with RBD. Other residues on CR3 that are perturbed are uncharged and either polar or hydrophobic. This is also consistent with observations made upon elucidation of the crystal structure of bovine RBD that, surrounding the α-helix that bears the two critical lysines, is a hydrophobic region that might therefore also be involved in receptor binding (27.Jenner L. Husted L. Thirup S. Sottrup-Jensen L. Nyborg J. Structure. 1998; 6: 595-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In our NMR structure of human RBD the same distribution of basic and hydrophobic residues occurs (28.Huang W. Dolmer K. Liao X. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 1089-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By determining the NMR structure of CR3 from LRP and using the assignments to monitor the solution interaction with RBD from human α2M we have been able to map the first specific interactions between a member of the LDLR family of receptors and a protein ligand. The relatively low affinity of the interaction and restricted physical extent of major chemical shift perturbations of surface residues are consistent with ligand binding sites on LDLR family members being composed of contiguous surface patches from more than one complement-like repeat that are generated by docking of such repeats for which flexible linker regions between domains are required."

Its human homolog, Pmp34, is also known. In this study, we characterized the role of Pmp47 in fatty acid metabolism and peroxisome proliferation using thePMP47-deleted strain of C. boidinii (strainpmp47Δ). The wild-type strain grew well on a middle-chain fatty acid, laureate, as the single carbon source, and mild peroxisome proliferation was observed during its growth. The pmp47Δstrain could not grow on laureate but could grow on long-chain fatty acids including palmitate, myristate, and oleate. The levels of laureate oxidation activity in intact cells and in semi-permeabilized cells of strain pmp47Δ were lower than the respective level in the wild-type strain, although the level of laureate oxidation activity in the cell lysate and the level of lauroyl-CoA oxidation in semi-permeabilized cells of strain pmp47Δ were indistinguishable from the respective level in the wild-type strain. When lauroyl-CoA was provided in the cytosol of strainpmp47Δ through expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Faa2p (lauroyl-CoA synthetase) in which its peroxisome targeting signal was deleted, the growth of strain pmp47Δon laureate was recovered to the level of growth of the wild-type strain. Laureate is converted to its CoA form in peroxisomes by the action of lauroyl-CoA synthetase. These results suggested that Pmp47 is involved in the transport of a small molecule (possibly ATP) required in the conversion of laureate to its CoA form in peroxisomes and that the absence of Pmp47 causes impairment of laureate metabolism, which results in the inability of pmp47Δ cells to grow on laureate. In addition, Pmp47 may be involved in peroxisome proliferation, because the pmp47Δ strain contained a reduced number of peroxisomes, as judged from the fluorescence analysis of cells expressing green fluorescent protein tagged with the peroxisome targeting signal 1 (GFP-AKL).

Peroxisomal matrix enzymes are transported to peroxisomes by their cis-acting signal, i.e. peroxisome targeting signals (PTSs), PTS1, PTS2, and mPTS, and a subset of trans-acting proteins involved in peroxisomal protein transport called peroxines. Metabolism within the peroxisome requires not only proper enzyme localization but also proper transport (import and export) of various metabolites. The roles that various peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) play in peroxisome assembly have begun to be elucidated; many peroxines,e.g. Pex2p, Pex3p, Pex10p, and Pex12p, are integral PMPs (1.Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). On the other hand, knowledge regarding roles of PMPs in metabolic functions is limited. Biochemical experiments using purified peroxisomes have been difficult to perform because of the fragile nature of peroxisomes. Early studies led to the hypothesis that peroxisomal membranes are freely permeable to compounds of low molecular weight (2.Van Veldhoven P.P. Just W.W. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4310-4318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, some metabolites are unable to permeate the peroxisome membrane (3.Van Roermund C.W.T. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6773-6781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Sakai Y. Saiganji A. Yurimoto H. Takabe K. Saiki H. Kato N. J.

The carbon source on which C. boidinii is grown induces the expression of a metabolic enzyme(s) that is specific to that particular carbon source; however, various peroxisome-inducing carbon sources induce the expression of two PMPs, Pmp47 and Pex11p (7.Sakai Y. Yurimoto H. Matsuo H. Kato N. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9.Goodman J.M. Trapp S.B. Hwang H. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 193-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that Pmp47 and Pex11p are not metabolism-specific peroxisomal proteins but that they are general PMPs responsible for basic peroxisomal function. Also, both Pmp47 and Pex11p have putative homologs in mammalian cells (10.Passreiter M. Anton M. Lay D. Frank R. Harter C. Wieland F. Gorgas K. Just W.W. J.

Biochem. 1998; 258: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Pmp47 is a peroxisomal integral membrane protein that shows the highest similarity to a yeast mitochondrial ATP/ADP exchanger (13.Jank B. Habermann B. Schweyen R.J. Link T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 427-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 14.Kuan J. Saier M.H.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Interestingly, the Pmp47 protein in the peroxisomal membrane is situated in the opposite orientation than that of the mitochondrial ATP/ADP exchanger, which suggests that the role of Pmp47 is to transport ATP from the cytosol into the peroxisome. In our previous study (6.Sakai Y. Saiganji A. Yurimoto H. Takabe K. Saiki H. Kato N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we suggested that the low molecular weight compound transported by Pmp47 into the peroxisome is involved in the transport/folding of a peroxisome matrix enzyme, dihydroxyacetone synthase (DHAS), in peroxisomes. However, our analysis was limited to cells grown on methanol as the carbon source, on which the growth ofpmp47Δ cells was clearly inhibited. Because the level of β-oxidation of fatty acids in yeast peroxisomes varies depending on the length of the fatty acid chain, we investigated the metabolism of fatty acids of various lengths in thepmp47Δ and wild-type strains to determine the role of Pmp47 in peroxisome function. In S. cerevisiae, laureate, a middle-chain fatty acid (MCFA), is converted to lauroyl-CoA in the peroxisome by lauroyl-CoA synthetase (Faa2p); on the other hand, long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), e.g. oleate, can be converted to their CoA form outside the peroxisome, and the CoA form is subsequently transported into the peroxisome by the ABC transporters, Pat1p/Pat2p (4.Hettema E.H. van Roermund C.W.T.

Therefore, if Pmp47 is involved in the transport of ATP from the cytosol into the peroxisome, the reaction catalyzed by lauroyl-CoA synthetase is expected to be inhibited in strainpmp47Δ. In this paper, we show both genetic and biochemical evidence that laureate metabolism in strainpmp47Δ is inhibited at the step in which laureate is converted to its CoA form. Furthermore, we found that the absence of Pmp47 affects peroxisome proliferation. C. boidiniiwild-type strain GC (16.Sakai Y. Rogi T. Yonehara T. Kato N. Tani Y. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), strain pmp47Δ (6.Sakai Y. Saiganji A. Yurimoto H. Takabe K. Saiki H. Kato N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and strainpex5Δ (7.Sakai Y. Yurimoto H. Matsuo H. Kato N. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were grown on various fatty acids, and their growth was assayed. C. boidinii strainpmp47Δura3 was constructed as described previously (6.Sakai Y. Saiganji A. Yurimoto H. Takabe K. Saiki H. Kato N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,17.Sakai Y. Tani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5988-5993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a pSPR-derived URA3-cassette was inserted between the flanking sequences of PMP47, yielding the PMP47-disruption vector, pMP47SPR. pMP47SPR was introduced into strain TK62 (ura3) (18.Sakai Y. Kazarimoto T. Tani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7458-7463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the inserted URA3 cassette was deleted by 5-fluoroorotidic acid selection (17.Sakai Y. Tani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5988-5993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain was named strain D47-U. Proper gene disruption was confirmed by Southern analysis. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged with PTS1 (GFP-AKL) expression plasmid, pGFP-AKL, was introduced into strain D47-U, yielding strain GFP-AKL/D47 (7.Sakai Y. Yurimoto H. Matsuo H. Kato N. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Strain GFP-AKL/wt (7.Sakai Y. Yurimoto H. Matsuo H. Kato N. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used as the wild type for comparison of peroxisome morphology. Synthetic MI medium was used as the basal medium on which C. boidinii was cultivated (19.Sakai Y. Nakagawa T. Shimase M. Kato N. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5885-5890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One or more of the following was used as the carbon source in each experiment: 1% glucose (w/v), 1% methanol (v/v), 0.5% lauric acid (v/v), 0.5% myristic acid (v/v), 0.5% palmitic acid (v/v), or 0.5% oleic acid (v/v). Tween 80 was added to the fatty acid medium at a concentration of 0.05% (v/v). The initial pH value of the medium was adjusted to 6.0. The complex yeast extract/peptone medium containing 2% bactopeptone and 1% yeast extract (Difco) was also used as the basal medium in some experiments. YPD contains 2% glucose, yeast extract/peptone/methanol/glycerol contains 0.5% methanol and 0.5% glycerol, and yeast extract/peptone/oleic acid/Tween 80 contains 0.5% oleic acid and 0.05% Tween 80 as the carbon sources. The C. boidinii were incubated aerobically at 28 °C under reciprocal shaking, and the growth of the yeast was followed by measuring the optical density at 610 nm (OD610). The experiment in which the pex5Δ strain was grown on oleate was performed by transferring YPD-grown cells to oleate/MI medium at an OD610 of 0.5, and incubating the cells for 16 h.Escherichia coli DH5α (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) was routinely used for plasmid propagation. The level of acyl-CoA synthetase activity was determined by the method of Ichihara and Shibasaki (21.Ichihara K. Shibasaki Y. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1709-1712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of reaction product, bicyclic leteroaromatic dye, was determined at the absorbance of 550 nm. The levels of CTA and cytochrome coxidase activity were determined and defined as described previously (22.Bergmeyer H.U. Biochem. Z. 1955; 327: 255-258PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Tolbert N.E. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 734-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Protein quantitation was performed using the method of Bradford (24.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Oleate-induced cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 30 °C for 10 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of a solution of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 50 mm EDTA and 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The cells were again centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 30 °C for 10 min and then washed once in 20 ml of a solution of 1 m sorbitol and 20 mm KHPO4, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 20 ml of a solution of 1 m sorbitol and 20 mmKHPO4, pH 7.5. Zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) was added at 1 mg/150 OD610 units of cells. The cells were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. The spheroplasted cells were lysed according to the method of Goodmanet al. (25.Goodman J.M. Scott C.W. Donahue P.N. Atherton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8485-8493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the pelleted cells were suspended in a solution of 1.0 msorbitol and 5 mm MES, pH 5.5, containing 1 mmPMSF and then osmotically lysed by adding 1.0–1.5 volumes of a solution of 0.25 m sorbitol and 5 mm MES, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm PMSF. The lysate was osmotically adjusted back to 1.0 m sorbitol by adding a solution of 1.75 m sorbitol and 5 mm MES, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm PMSF. Unlysed cells, nuclei, and other cell debris were removed carefully from the lysate by centrifugation at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min to obtain a crude pellet containing mainly peroxisomes and mitochondria. To prepare a continuous Nycodenz (Sigma) gradient solution, a step gradient of 10.6 ml (1.3 ml of 60% Nycodenz, 2 ml of 50% Nycodenz, 4 ml of 35% Nycodenz, and 3.3 ml of 28% Nycodenz (w/v)) was frozen once in liquid nitrogen and then thawed. Then, the organellar suspension was layered on top of the 10.6-ml gradient, and the samples were spun at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C in a VTi 65.1 vertical rotor (Beckman Instruments). The gradients were fractionated from the bottom. Each fraction was assayed for acyl-CoA synthetase, CTA, and cytochrome c oxidase activities. To measure the level of β-oxidation of laureate and palmitate in intact cells, oleate-grown cells were washed with water and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to an OD610 of 1.0. [1-14C]Laureate (55 mCi/mmol) and [1-14C]palmitate (56 mCi/mmol) (Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA), each dissolved in ethanol, were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and dissolved in a solution of PBS by sonication. An aliquot of 25 μl of cell suspension was mixed with 0.2 ml of PBS containing 2 nmol of radiolabeled laureate or palmitate. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, 0.65 ml of cold PBS, 0.15 ml of 10% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 0.2 ml of 3m perchloric acid were added to the incubation mixture, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice. The solution was centrifuged at 10000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The unreacted fatty acids were removed by extraction 3 times with 3 ml of hexane. The acid-soluble radioactivity in the aqueous layer was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter (26.Imanaka T. Aihara K. Takano T. Yamashita A. Sato R. Suzuki Y. Yokota S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11968-11976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To measure the level of β-oxidation of laureate and palmitate in cell lysates, spheroplasted cells were centrifuged at 1,000 ×g at 4 °C for 20 min, and the collected cells were lysed by the addition of 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF. An aliquot of 25 μl (5–10 μg of protein) of cell extracts was mixed with 0.2 ml of a solution of 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCN, 0.1 mm FAD, 1 mm NAD, 1 mm CoA, 0.005% Triton X-100 (w/v), 1 milliunits/ml acyl-CoA synthetase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 2 nmol [1-14C]laureate or 2 nmol [1-14C]palmitate. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C. The level of 14C-labeled acid-soluble radioactivity was determined as described above. To measure the level of β-oxidation of laureate, lauroyl-CoA, palmitate, and palmitoyl-CoA in semi-permeabilized cells, 25 μl of spheroplasts (OD610 of 1.0–2.0) were incubated for 10 min with 25 μl of digitonin (100–200 μg/ml) in spheroplast buffer (1.4m sorbitol and 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5). Subsequently, 0.2 ml of spheroplast buffer containing 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCN, 0.1 mm FAD, 1 mm NAD, 1 mm CoA, and 0.2 nmol [1-14C]laureate, [1-14C]palmitate, [1-14C]lauroyl-CoA (55 mCi/mmol), or [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA (60 mCi/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products) was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C. The level of 14C-labeled acid-soluble radioactivity was quantified. [1-14C]Lauroyl-CoA was synthesized as described previously by Yamashita et al.(27.Yamashita A. Watanabe M. Tonegawa T. Sugiura T. Waku K. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, [1-14C]lauroyl chloride was prepared by incubating 70 μCi of [1-14C]laureate (55 mCi/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals) with oxalyl chloride (2 ml) overnight. To synthesize [1-14C]lauroyl-CoA, [1-14C]lauroyl chloride dissolved in dried terahydrofuran was incubated in CoA solution (10 mg CoA in terahydrofuran:0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, (2:1, v/v)). During the incubation, the pH value in the solution was maintained at 8 by the addition of NaOH. [1-14C]Lauroyl-CoA was purified by sequential chromatographies using Sep-Pak Plus C18 cartridges (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) and thin-layer chromatography (Silica gel 60, Merck). The purity of [1-14C]lauroyl-CoA was over 97%. TheS. cerevisiae FAA2ΔPTS1 expression plasmid consisted of the C. boidinii PMP47promoter, 2H. Yurimoto, T. Komeda, C.-R. Lim, T. Nakagawa, K. Kondo, N. Kato, and Y. Sakai, manuscript in preparation. polymerase chain reaction-amplified ScFAA2ΔPTS1 gene, theC. boidinii AOD1 terminator, and the C. boidinii URA3 gene as the selective marker. The primers used for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the ScFAA2ΔPTS1gene were N-primer, 5′AGATCTAAAATGGCCGCTCCAGATTATGC3′ and C-primer, 5′ACTAGTCTATGTCTTAACTAATGAACCTCC3′. The obtained polymerase chain reaction product was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis using a PRISM DyeDeoxy Terminator cycle sequencing kit and an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer (Foster City, CA). The plasmid was linearized with EcoT22I and introduced into C. boidiniistrain pmp47Δ ura3. A multicopy integrated transformant was selected as an overexpressing clone and used for the analysis. Green fluorescent protein tagged with PTS1-sequence was expressed in strain pmp47Δ using the plasmid pGFP-AKL as described previously (7.Sakai Y. Yurimoto H. Matsuo H. Kato N. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were placed on a microscope slide and examined under a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a Plan-NEOFLUAR X100, 1/30 (oil) objective and Nomarski attachments and set at the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel. Images were acquired using a charge-coupled device camera (Zeiss ZVS -47DE) and a CG7 Frame Grabber (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). The number of peroxisomes per cell was counted in a total of at least 350 cells in random fields. Wild-typeC. boidinii grew well when grown on the three media containing laureate (C12:0), myristate (C14:0), or palmitate (C16:0), and PMP47 expression in the wild-type strain grown on each of the three media was confirmed (data not shown). During their growth, peroxisome proliferation was observed more in the cells cultured in laureate than in those cultured in glucose (Fig.1, A and B). On the other hand, the pmp47Δ strain had no ability to grow on the medium where laureate was the sole carbon source (Fig.1 C), whereas the pmp47Δ strain showed growth comparable with that of the wild-type strain when grown on medium where myristate or palmitate was used as the sole carbon source. Expression of the PMP47 gene restored the ability of strainpmp47Δ to grow on laureate (data not shown). Thepex5Δ strain that lacks the PTS1 receptor (Pex5p) could not grow on any of the fatty acids tested, confirming that normal protein transport to peroxisomes is essential for C. boidinii to grow on MCFA (laureate) and on LCFAs (myristate and palmitate). These results show that proper peroxisome assembly is necessary for C. boidinii to grow on MCFA and on LCFAs. Pmp47 is indispensable for C. boidinii to grow on MCFAs. However, Pmp47 is not indispensable for C. boidinii to grow on LCFAs. The step in MCFA metabolism that strainpmp47Δ lacks was investigated by quantification of [1-14C]labeled β-oxidation products. In intactpmp47Δ cells and wild-type cells incubated with laureate or palmitate, the quantity of labeled acid-soluble degradation products derived from laureate and that derived from palmitate increased linearly up to 10 min in both strains. Thereafter, the level of laureate β-oxidation in the intact pmp47Δ cells decreased, and the amount of [1-14C]labeled β-oxidation products in the intact pmp47Δ cells was 34% of that in the intact wild-type cells, whereas the level of β-oxidation of palmitate in intact pmp47Δ cells remained essentially the same as that in the intact wild-type cells (Fig.2 A). Next, the level of β-oxidation of laureate and palmitate in the cell lysate of thepmp47Δ and wild-type strains in which the peroxisomes had been disrupted by adding 0.1% Triton X-100 was compared. In these experiments, the levels of β-oxidation of both laureate and palmitate in the pmp47Δ strain were slightly higher than the respective level in the wild-type strain (Fig. 2 B). These results showed that Pmp47 is essential for laureate metabolism in intact cells but that the total activity of β-oxidation involved in laureate metabolism was unaffected by the absence of Pmp47. Next, the level of β-oxidation of laureate, lauroyl-CoA, palmitate, and palmitoyl-CoA in digitonin-permeabilized wild-type andpmp47Δ cells was measured using 14C-labeled substrates. Under our experimental conditions, approximately 50% of the CTA activity was recovered in the cell pellet at a digitonin concentration of 25–50 μg/ml, and 100% release of CTA required 200 μg/ml of digitonin (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3, the level of β-oxidation of laureate in pmp47Δ cells was markedly lower than that in the wild-type cells. On the other hand, the levels of β-oxidation of lauroyl-CoA, palmitate, and palmitoyl-CoA in pmp47Δ cells were essentially the same as the respective level in the wild-type. These biochemical results suggested that whereas the transport of lauroyl-CoA is not affected by the absence of Pmp47, the conversion of laureate to lauroyl-CoA is impaired in strain pmp47Δ. In S. cerevisiae,Faa2p, the only acyl-CoA synthetase that catalyzes the conversion of laureate to lauroyl-CoA, is exclusively localized within peroxisomes, whereas the other acyl-CoA synthetases are not peroxisomal enzymes (4.Hettema E.H. van Roermund C.W.T. Distel B. van den Berg M. Vilela C. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar,28.Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16348-16356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we tried to induce the production of ScFaa2p in the cytosol of strain pmp47Δ to prove that the conversion of laureate to lauroyl-CoA is the only defective step that underlies the inability of strain pmp47Δ to grow on laureate. If the lauroyl-CoA produced in the cytosol of the constructed strain (strain D47-FAA2ΔPTS1) is transported into peroxisomes, the growth defect ofpmp47Δ should be corrected. The truncated form of FAA2, in which the PTS1 sequence, glutamate-lysine-leucine, was deleted from its carboxyl-terminal, was placed under the PMP47 promoter and introduced into C. boidinii strain D47-U. The level of lauroyl-CoA synthetase activity in the cell lysate of strain D47-FAA2ΔPTS1 (0.95 ± 0.12 units/mg protein) was considerably higher than that in the cell lysate of strain pmp47Δ (0.12 ± 0.08 units/mg protein). The cytosolic portion of lauroyl-CoA synthetase activity in strain D47-FAA2ΔPTS1 was 87%. These results confirmed that FAA2ΔPTS1 was expressed in the cytosol of this C. boidiniistrain. Next, the ability of the FAA2ΔPTS1 strain to grow on laureate was examined. Although strain pmp47Δ could not grow on laureate, the growth of strain D47-FAA2ΔPTS1 on a laureate medium was comparable with that of the wild-type strain (Fig.4). This genetic experiment confirmed the results of the biochemical experiments that, although strainpmp47Δ cannot metabolize laureate, it can metabolize lauroyl-CoA if lauroyl-CoA is provided in the cytosol. Our results indicated that the reaction catalyzed by lauroyl-CoA synthetase is inhibited in strain pmp47Δ. Because the absence of Pmp47 induces aggregation of the inactive form of a peroxisomal matrix enzyme, DHAS, in the cytosol of methanol-induced cells (6.Sakai Y. Saiganji A. Yurimoto H. Takabe K. Saiki H. Kato N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), inhibition of the conversion of laureate to lauroyl-CoA in strain pmp47Δ may be due to inactivation of the lauroyl-CoA synthetase enzyme. The other possibility is that although lauroyl-CoA synthetase is active, the import of one of the substrates required in the enzyme reaction into the peroxisome is inhibited. If we could show that lauroyl-CoA synthetase is localized exclusively in the peroxisomes in the wild-type strain and that the enzyme is in the active form in the peroxisomes of strain pmp47Δ, the former possibility could be excluded. First, the localization of lauroyl- and oleoyl (C18:1)-CoA synthetase activity was analyzed by subjecting each strain to differential centrifugation, which separated the cells into a cytosolic supernatant (S) and an organelle-pellet fraction (P) consisting mainly of peroxisomes and mitochondria (Fig.5). In the wild-type cells, nearly 90% of the lauroyl-CoA synthetase activity was localized in the organelle-pellet fraction (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, more than half of the oleoyl-CoA synthetase activity was localized in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 5 A). Isopycnic centrifugation on a continuous Nycodenz gradient revealed that the intracellular localization of lauroyl-CoA synthetase activity coincided with the localization of peroxisomal CTA activity and was distinct from the localization of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity (Fig. 5 B). In strain pmp47Δ, a significant proportion of the intracellular lauroyl-CoA synthetase and CTA activities were in the organelle-pellet fraction (Fig. 5 C). Again, lauroyl-CoA synthetase in the organelle-pellet fraction was localized in the peroxisomes by Nycodenz fractionation (Fig. 5 D). These results show that in strain pmp47Δ, approximately half of the lauroyl-CoA synthetase is normally transported into the peroxisomes and that lauroyl-CoA synthetase is in the active form.

https://openalex.org/W2029632594,"The pyelonephritis-associated pili (pap) operon in Escherichia coli is regulated by an epigenetic mechanism involving the formation of specific DNA methylation patterns characteristic of transcriptionally active (phase ON) and inactive (phase OFF) cells. The formation of papDNA methylation patterns in vivo was previously shown to require the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) and DNA adenine methylase (Dam). To monitor the binding of Lrp to pap DNA, an in vitro methylation protection assay was developed. Binding of Lrp to a Dam target site proximal to the papBApromoter (designated GATCprox) blocked methylation of this site and specifically repressed transcription. The DNA methylation pattern and transcription state are identical to those observedin vivo in phase OFF cells. To determine if binding of Lrp at GATCprox was necessary for repression ofpapBA transcription, we analyzed a pap mutation (pap-13) that reduced the affinity of Lrp for the GATCprox region. Binding of Lrp to pap-13 DNA was shifted to a promoter distal Dam target site (designated GATCdist). Lrp blocked methylation of GATCdistin the pap-13 mutant, but did not repress papBAtranscription. Together, these results show that binding of Lrp to the GATCprox region is sufficient for the establishment of the phase OFF DNA methylation pattern and repression of papBAtranscription."
https://openalex.org/W2090055664,"The B-subunits of cholera toxin (CTB) andEscherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LTB) are structurally and functionally related. However, the carbohydrate binding specificities of the two proteins differ. While both CTB and LTB bind to the GM1 ganglioside, LTB also binds toN-acetyllactosamine-terminated glycoconjugates. The structural basis of the differences in carbohydrate recognition has been investigated by a systematic exchange of amino acids between LTB and CTB. Thereby, a CTB/LTB hybrid with a gain-of-function mutation resulting in recognition of blood group A and B determinants was obtained. Glycosphingolipid binding assays showed a specific binding of this hybrid B-subunit, but not CTB or LTB, to slowly migrating non-acid glycosphingolipids of human and animal small intestinal epithelium. A binding-active glycosphingolipid isolated from cat intestinal epithelium was characterized by mass spectrometry and proton NMR as GalNAcα3(Fucα2)Galβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glc NAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer. Comparison with reference glycosphingolipids showed that the minimum binding epitope recognized by the CTB/LTB hybrid was Galα3(Fucα2)Galβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAcβ. The blood group A and B determinants bind to a novel carbohydrate binding site located at the top of the B-subunit interfaces, distinct from the GM1 binding site, as found by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The B-subunits of cholera toxin (CTB) andEscherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LTB) are structurally and functionally related. However, the carbohydrate binding specificities of the two proteins differ. While both CTB and LTB bind to the GM1 ganglioside, LTB also binds toN-acetyllactosamine-terminated glycoconjugates.

The glycosphingolipid nomenclature follows the recommendations by the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN) (CBN for Lipids (1977) Eur. J. Biochem. 79, 11–21 3347–3351 13–18). It is assumed that Gal, Glc, GlcNAc, GalNAc, NeuAc, and NeuGc are of the d-configuration, Fuc of thel-configuration, and all sugars present in the pyranose form. Enterotoxins produced by Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are causative agents of diarrheal diseases leading to millions of deaths annually (1.Black R.E. Holmgren J. Lindberg A. Möllby R. Proceedings of the 11th Nobel Conference. Studentlitteratur, Lund, Sweden1985: 23-32Google Scholar). Both cholera toxin (CT)1 andE. coli type I heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) are oligomeric proteins with one A-subunit and five B-subunits (2.Spangler B.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 622-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A-subunits have ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, while the B-subunits mediate binding to receptors on the eukaryotic cell surface. LT type I B-subunits originating from porcine and human isolates of enterotoxigenic E. coli (pLTB and hLTB, respectively) share 96% sequence identity with each other, but only approximately 80% with CTB (3.Domenighini M. Pizza M. Jobling M.G. Holmes R.K. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1165-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Despite great similarity between the carbohydrate binding sites of the B-subunits, evidenced by recent crystal complexes (4.Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. van Zanten B.A.M. Berghuis A.M. Hol W.G.J.

The structural basis of the differences in carbohydrate binding between CTB and hLTB have been investigated by construction of a number of CTB/hLTB hybrids, having CTB amino acids substituted with heterologous amino acids of hLTB (12.Bäckström M. Shahabi V. Johansson S. Teneberg S. Kjellberg A. Miller-Podraza H. Holmgren J. Lebens M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By introducing hLTB residues in the 1–25 region and at positions 94 and 95 of CTB, a hybrid B-subunit (designated LCTBH) was created, withN-acetyllactosamine-binding properties almost indistinguishable from hLTB. These studies have now been extended by re-substitution of single amino acids of LCTBH back to the original CTB residues. By re-substituting from Ser4 to Asn, a daughter hybrid with reduced N-acetyllactosamine-binding capacity was obtained. However, this daughter hybrid had a novel carbohydrate binding specificity, as described in the present paper. All recombinant B-subunits were produced from plasmids derived from pML-CTBtac, essentially as described (13.Lebens M. Johansson S. Osek J. Lindblad M. Holmgren J. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 1574-1578PubMed Google Scholar). pML-LCTBtacK was obtained by introduction of synthetic oligonucleotides between the uniqueSacI and PstI sites in pML-LCTBtacH. The mutated plasmid was electroporated into the classical 01 V. cholerae strain JS1569 (DctxA). The structure of the hybrid gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing using Sequenase 2.0 from USB (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, United Kingdom). Oligonucleotides were from KEBO Lab, Spånga, Sweden, and restriction enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or New England Biolabs, and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant B-subunits were produced and purified as described (12.Bäckström M. Shahabi V. Johansson S. Teneberg S. Kjellberg A. Miller-Podraza H. Holmgren J. Lebens M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Purified B-subunits were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford's protein assay (14.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Sequential Edman degradation was performed on a Procise 492 protein sequencer (Perkin Elmer). Glycosphingolipids were isolated and characterized by mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, and degradation studies, as outlined in (8.Ångström J. Teneberg S. Karlsson K.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mixtures of glycosphingolipids (20–40 μg/lane) or pure compounds (0.1–4 μg/lane) were separated on aluminum-backed silica gel 60 high-performance thin-layer chromatography plates (Merck), using chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, by volume) as solvent. Chemical detection was done with anisaldehyde (15.Waldi D. Stahl E. Dünnschicht-Chromatographie. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1962: 495-515Google Scholar). Binding of B-subunits to glycosphingolipids on thin-layer chromatograms or adsorbed in microtiter wells were performed as described (8.Ångström J. Teneberg S. Karlsson K.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chromatogram binding assays with monoclonal antibodies directed against blood group A, B, and H determinants (Dakopatts a/s, Glostrup, Denmark) were done as described (16.Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.-A. Larson G. McKibbin J.M. Blaszczyk M. Herlyn M. Steplewski Z. Koprowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4091-4097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 125I-labeled anti-mouse antibodies for detection. A total non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction (64 mg) was obtained from pooled epithelial cell scrapings from the small intestines of 12 cats by standard methods (17.Karlsson K.-A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The non-acid glycosphingolipids (50 mg) were first separated on a silicic acid column, stepwise eluted with increasing amounts of methanol in chloroform. The fractions containing triglycosylceramides and larger glycosphingolipids were pooled, giving 45 mg, and further separated by HPLC on a Kromasil 5 Silica column (2.12 × 25 cm, inner diameter; particle size, 5 mm; Skandinaviska Genetec, Kungsbacka, Sweden) eluted with a linear gradient of chloroform/methanol/water 80:20:1 to 40:40:12 (by volume) during 180 min with a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Each 4-ml fraction was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography using anisaldehyde for detection. The fractions containing tetraglycosylceramides and larger glycosphingolipids were tested for binding of LCTBK using the chromatogram binding assay. The binding-active compound eluted in tubes 151–158, and after pooling of these fractions 0.4 mg was obtained. For electron ionization mass spectrometry, aliquots of the isolated glycosphingolipid were permethylated (18.Larson G. Karlsson H. Hansson G.C. Pimlott W. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 161: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), or permethylated and reduced with LiAlH4 (19.Karlsson K.-A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3643-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed on a JEOL SX-102A mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) using the in-beam technique (20.Breimer M. Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.-A. Larson G. Leffler H. Pascher I. Pimlott W. Samuelsson B.E. Quayle A. Advances in Mass S pectrometry. 8. Heyden & Son, London1980: 1097-1108Google Scholar). The analyses of both derivatives were performed with an electron energy of 70 eV, trap current of 300 μA, and acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The temperature was raised from 150 °C to 410 °C, by increases of 10 °C/min. 1H NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian 500-MHz spectrometer at 30 °C. Samples were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide-d 6/D2O (98/2, by volume) after deuterium exchange. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2Extreme workstation using the Quanta97/CHARMm22 software package (Molecular Simulations Inc., Waltham, MA), whereas the A pentasaccharide (GalNAcα3(Fucα2)Galβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAcβ) initially was constructed using Biograf software package (Molecular Simulations Inc.) before transferring the structure to the aforementioned program. The glycosidic dihedral angles of the CHARMm-refined structure deviated insignificantly from literature values (21.Imberty A. Mikros E. Koca J. Mollicone R. Oriol R. Perez S. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All protein structures were constructed from the crystal structure of the pLT-lactose complex (Ref. 4.Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. van Zanten B.A.M. Berghuis A.M. Hol W.G.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank entry1LTT): two whole B-subunits (G and H) were thus used in the construction of corresponding subunits of hLTB and the hybrid mutants listed in Table I following procedures outlined earlier (22.Moreno E. Teneberg S. Adar R. Sharon N. Karlsson K.-A. Ångström J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4429-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The root-mean-square deviations for the main chain atoms of energy-refined hLT, LCTBK, and LCTBK in complex with the A pentasaccharide (snapshot at 180 ps) relative to the pLT crystal structure were 0.55, 0.86, and 0.94 Å, respectively. A comparison between LCTBK and its complex with the A pentasaccharide yielded root-mean-square values of 0.38 Å for the backbone atoms and 0.62 Å when all atoms were considered. Of the several starting structures for subsequent dynamics runs that were generated through manual docking of the A pentasaccharide into the putative LCTBK binding site, only a few very similar orientations of the pentasaccharide gave a satisfactory surface complementarity as well as involving the amino acid side chains implicated in the binding studies. Vacuum dynamics simulations at 300 K using a distance-dependent dielectric constant (ε = 6r) and a 2-fs time step were performed as described (22.Moreno E. Teneberg S. Adar R. Sharon N. Karlsson K.-A. Ångström J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4429-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The final 1-ns run lasted for 380 CPU h. In these runs, 70 residues surrounding the binding site were allowed freedom of movement, whereas in energy minimization the whole dimer was movable.Table IAmino acid sequences of the recombinant CTB, human LTB, and hybrid B-subunitsPositionaOnly the amino acids which are non-homologous between CTB and LTB are shown.rCTBbThe recombinant CTB has an alanine instead of a threonine at position 1 (39).hLTBcThe sequence of human LTB is from strain H74–114 (40).LCTBHLCTBK1AlaAlaAlaAla4AsnSerSerAsn dThe CTB amino acids in the hybrids LCTBH and LCTBK are in bold.7AspGluGluGlu10AlaSerSerSer18HisTyrTyrTyr20LeuIleIleIle25PheLeuLeuLeu31LeuMetLeuLeu38AlaValAlaAla44AsnSerAsnAsn75AlaThrAlaAla80AlaThrAlaAla82ValIleValVal83GluAspGluGlu94HisAsnAsnAsn95AlaSerSerSer102AlaGluAlaAlaa Only the amino acids which are non-homologous between CTB and LTB are shown.b The recombinant CTB has an alanine instead of a threonine at position 1 (39.Sanchez J.

Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 73-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).d The CTB amino acids in the hybrids LCTBH and LCTBK are in bold. Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequences of the B-subunits utilized in this study are summarized in Table I. The daughter hybrid designated LCTBK was obtained by re-substituting from Ser (found in hLTB) to Asn (found in CTB) at position 4. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of LCTBK indicated that it formed stable pentamers. It also appeared identical to LCTBH in terms of reactivity with CTB- and LTB-specific monoclonal antibodies (23.Lebens M. Shahabi V. Bäckström M. Houze T. Lindblad M. Holmgren J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, identification of the 14 N-terminal amino acids of LCTBK by sequential Edman degradation confirmed the presence of Asn at position 4. The microtiter well assay showed that all B-pentamers bound to GM1 with similar affinities (Fig.1, A), demonstrating that the mutations introduced had not affected the ability to interact with the GM1 ganglioside. Half-maximal binding of all B-subunit proteins occurred at approximately 5 pmol/well. As reported previously hLTB and LCTBH, but not CTB, bound to the N-acetyllactosamine-terminated glycosphingolipids neolactotetraosylceramide (Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1 Cer; Fig. 1 B) (12.Bäckström M. Shahabi V. Johansson S. Teneberg S. Kjellberg A. Miller-Podraza H. Holmgren J. Lebens M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Linear neolactohexaosylceramide (Galβ 4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer; data not shown) and branched neolactohexaosylceramide (Galβ4GlcNAcβ6 (Galβ4GlcNAcβ3)Galβ4Glcβ1Cer; Fig.1 C) were also bound by hLTB and LCTBH. However, the level of binding of LCTBK toN-acetyllactosamine-terminated compounds was reduced virtually to the level of CTB. Furthermore, while hLTB and LCTBH bound to gangliotetraosylceramide (Galβ3Gal NAcβ4Galβ4Glcβ1Cer), no binding of CTB or LCTBK to this glycosphingolipid was observed (data not reproduced). In accordance with the results from the microtiter well assay, the hybrid B-subunits bound to the GM1 ganglioside on thin-layer chromatograms (Fig. 2, lane 9, and present in lane 8). By binding of B-pentamers to glycosphingolipids from small intestinal epithelium of single human individuals on thin-layer chromatograms, an aberrant behavior of LCTBK was detected. Unlike the other B-pentamers, LCTBK bound selectively to slowly migrating non-acid glycosphingolipids present in some individuals (Fig. 2 C,lanes 3 and 4). LCTBK-specific binding to slowly migrating glycosphingolipids was also detected in the non-acid fractions of rabbit (Fig. 2 C, lane 1), rat, dog, pig, and cat intestine and human meconium (data not shown). The non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction from epithelial cells of cat small intestine was separated by chromatography on a silicic acid column, followed by HPLC on straight-phase silica gel. The fractions containing the LCTBK-binding compound were pooled, giving 0.4 mg, which was used for structural characterization by electron ionization mass spectrometry and proton NMR spectroscopy. The mass spectrum of the permethylated LCTBK-binding glycosphingolipid isolated from cat intestinal epithelial cells (Fig.3 A) has ions characteristic of a terminal blood group A determinant: terminal HexNAc (m/z260), terminal fucose (m/z 189), and A trisaccharide (HexNAc(Fuc)Hex; m/z 638 and 606). The next ions that can be attributed to the carbohydrate chain are seen at m/z 1056 and 1024, indicating a HexNAc(Fuc)Hex(Fuc)HexNAc pentasaccharide. The next carbohydrate units toward the reducing end is a Hex (hexasaccharide ions at m/z 1261 and 1229), followed by a HexNAc (heptasaccharide ions at m/z 1506 and 1474), a Hex (octasaccharide ions at m/z 1710 and 1678), and a Hex (nonasaccharide ions at m/z 1914 and 1882). The concluded sequence was supported by the ion at m/z 1988, containing the whole carbohydrate chain and part of the fatty acid, and by molecular ions at m/z 2596, 2624 and 2652 (nonasaccharide with phytosphingosine and hydroxy 20:0, 22:0 and 24:0 fatty acids, respectively). The major long chain base is phytosphingosine (m/z 396), and the ceramide composition is given by the ions at m/z 694 and 722, indicating phytosphingosine combined with hydroxy 22:0 and 24:0 fatty acids, respectively. The mass spectrum of the permethylated and reduced glycosphingolipid (Fig. 3 B) has a series of prominent immonium ions (F-fragments), formed by loss of part of the long chain base, atm/z 2200–2312. These ions give information about the number and type of sugars, and the fatty acid composition, and in the present case demonstrate the presence of a saccharide composed of two fucoses, three N-acetylhexosamines, and four hexoses, combined with hydroxy 16:0 to 24:0 fatty acids. Carbohydrate sequence ions are found at m/z 189 (terminal fucose), m/z 246 (terminal HexNAc), m/z 624 (terminal A trisaccharide), m/z1028 (HexNAc(Fuc)Hex(Fuc)HexNAc pentasaccharide), m/z 1233 and 1201 (hexasaccharide), and m/z 1668 (octasaccharide). A prominent ion at m/z 182 is present in the mass spectra of both derivatives. This ion is due to rearrangement of GlcNAc, and is only found in spectra of glycosphingolipids with a type 2 core (Hexβ4HexNAc) (24.Karlsson K.-A. Witting L.A. Glycolipid Methodology. American Oil Society, Champaign, IL1976: 97-122Google Scholar, 25.Karlsson K.-A. Prog. Chem. Fats Other Lipids. 1978; 16: 207-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The proposed carbohydrate sequence has HexHexNAc at two positions, either of which could have a type 2 core. However, further information may be obtained from the spectrum of the permethylated and reduced derivative. In glycosphingolipids having a Hex in 1–3 linkage to a HexNAc (type 1 core), a series of rearrangement ions derived from the immonium ions are found (26.Karlsson K.-A. Larson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9311-9316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These ions are obtained by fragmentation of the Hex1–3HexNAc linkage and rearrangement of the GlcNAc with loss of the acetamido group of 58 mass units. A type 1 linkage at the non-reducing HexHexNAc would give rise to a series of ions at m/z 1502–1614 (F − 640 − 58), while a type 1 linkage of the HexHexNAc close to the reducing end would produce a series at m/z 893–1005 (F − 1249 − 58). The absence of both ion series thus suggests that the LCTBK-binding glycosphingolipid has type 2 core chains at both positions. Thus, by mass spectrometry, the LCTBK-binding glycosphingolipid was tentatively identified as a nonaglycosylceramide with a terminal A trisaccharide and a HexNAc(Fuc)Hex(Fuc)HexNAcHexHexNAcHexHex sequence, with two type 2 linkages (Hexβ4HexNAc). The 1H NMR spectrum at 30 °C of the fraction containing the nonaglycosylceramide with a terminal A trisaccharide (not shown) displayed anomeric proton signals, which could easily be assigned on the basis of earlier published spectra. Thus, the signals at 5.10 ppm (Fucα2), 5.08 ppm (GalNAcα3), 4.86 ppm (Fucα3), 4.66 ppm (GlcNAcβ3), and 4.45 ppm (Galβ4) confirm the presence of an ALey determinant as in the A7 type 2 glycosphingolipid (27.Elson C.O. Kiyono H. Ogra P.L. McGhee J.R. Mucosal Vaccines. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1996: 59-72Crossref Google Scholar) whereas the signals at 4.26, 4.72, 4.28, and 4.22 ppm are consistent with the internal sequence Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1 (28.Levery S.B. Nudelman E.D. Andersen N.H. Hakomori S. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 151: 311-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29.Clausen H. Levery S.B. McKibbin J.M. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3578-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Combined with the data from mass spectrometry the identity of the LCTBK-binding glycosphingolipid can thus be established as GalNAcα3 (Fucα2)Galβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer,i.e. the A9 type 2 glycosphingolipid. Binding to the A9 type 2 glycosphingolipid from cat small intestine in microtiter wells (Fig.4 A) confirmed that this glycosphingolipid was preferentially recognized by LCTBK, with a half-maximal binding at approximately 20 pmol/well. Next, the binding of LCTBK to a number of glycosphingolipids with structures related to the A9 type 2 glycosphingolipid was tested in microtiter wells (summarized in TableII). LCTBK, but not the other B-subunits, bound to the A7 type 2 glycosphingolipid (GalNAcα3(Fucα2)Galβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAcβ3 Galβ4Glcβ1Cer) with a half-maximal binding at approximately 40 pmol/well (Fig.4 B). No binding of LCTBK to the A7 type 1 glycosphingolipid (GalNAcα3(Fucα2)Galβ3(Fucα4)GlcNAcβ3 Galβ4Glcβ1Cer), the A6 type 2 glycosphingolipid (Gal NAcα3(Fucα2)Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer), or the Y6 glycosphingolipid (Fucα2Galβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer) was obtained.

Docking a blood group A pentasaccharide (GalNAcα3(Fucα2)Galβ4(Fucα3) GlcNAcβ) into the LCTBK hybrid and ensuing molecular dynamics simulations (1 ns) of the complex yields the picture shown in Figs.Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9. The pentasaccharide lies in a shallow depression of the protein surface at the subunit interfaces with the fucoses exposed to the solvent. In addition to an excellent protein-saccharide surface complementarity, critical hydrogen bond interactions with the side chains of Gln3, Asn4, Ser26, Thr28, Thr41, Thr47, Glu83, and Lys84 as well as with the peptide backbone are found involving all five sugars (Figs. 7 and 9). The electrostatic potential energy surfaces for the LCTBKbinding site (Fig. 7), generated by a water probe, and the corresponding surface for the pentasaccharide (partially shown in Fig.8), reveal several regions of advantageous complementary potentials of opposite sign. This is particularly evident for the interactions of the GalNAcα3 and Fucα3 residues, which are essential for binding to occur (see Table II). Due to its rigid nature (21.Imberty A. Mikros E. Koca J. Mollicone R. Oriol R. Perez S. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), conformational changes of the pentasaccharide are very minor. Protein conformational changes are small as well, being restricted to re-orientation of the Leu25 and Glu83 side chains in order to accommodate the pentasaccharide. Other changes include movement of Ser26 approximately 1.2 Å toward Galβ4 and an average downward movement of the 42–46 loop by 2 Å compared with the pLT crystal structure (4.Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E.

The terminal GalNAc residue of the A pentasaccharide is pointing to theright, whereas the GlcNAc at the reducing end is seen to point to the left.

The electrostatic potential energy surface of the pentasaccharide, generated by a 1.4-Å water probe, is color-coded corresponding to the LCTBK surface shown in Fig. 7, whereas the van der Waals surface of the amide moiety of Asn4 is colored using standard atom colors. Note the groove, formed by the GalNAcα3 acetamido moiety, the Galβ4 4-CH, 4-OH, and 6-CH2 groups and the Fucα3 3-OH (the two latter groups are located just below the border of the figure), into which the amide moiety of Asn4 fits precisely. For clarity, the contribution of the Asn4 CβH2group to the van der Waals surface was omitted but makes the side chain fit even tighter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The significance of the Ser4 → Asn mutation in LCTBK lies partly in the additional hydrogen bonds formed between the Asn4 side chain and the Galβ4 4-OH and the Fucα3 3-OH, and partly in the very snug fit of this side chain against the carbohydrate surface (Fig. 8). The orientation of the amide of the Asn4 side chain differs by 180° from that observed in CTB (5.Merritt E.A. Sarfaty S. van den Akker F. L'Hoir C. Martial J.A. Hol W.G.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 6.Merritt E.A. Kuhn P. Sarfarty S. Erbe J.L. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 1043-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This is due to the nearby Glu7 in LCTBK, as opposed to the shorter Asp7 in CTB, which favors the opposite configuration. This also results in a preference of the hydroxyl group of Thr6 side chain to point downward to hydrogen-bond to Asn4 (Figs. 7 and8). Another significant difference between LCTBK and CTB is Leu25, which in CTB is a phenylalanine. In CTB Phe25 forms a hydrophobic patch with the methyl group of Thr41 as does Leu25 of pLT (4.Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. van Zanten B.A.M. Berghuis A.M. Hol W.G.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, in LCTBK Leu25 is too far from Thr41due to a re-orientation of the Leu25 side chain that appears necessary when the pentasaccharide complex is formed. In CTB, Phe25 is locked in the crystal conformation, suggesting that its side chain would partially block access to the binding site by sterically interfering with the Fucα2 residue and also unfavorably interact with the 6-OH of the GlcNAcβ residue. The combination of these factors and the unfavorable orientation of Asn4probably account for the absence of binding of CTB to the blood group A/B determinant. The model also accounts for the relatively weak binding of A9–2 by hLTB and LCTBH since the Ser4 side chain present in these molecules is unable to provide the favorable carbohydrate interactions observed for the Asn4 side chain of LCTBK. The binding of the B-subunits of CT and LT to receptor glycoconjugates on the small intestinal epithelial cells is a prerequisite for the following steps in toxin action leading to diarrhea. In addition, both CT and LT elicit strong immune responses, and are among the most potent mucosal adjuvants yet identified (30.Hakomori S. Nudelman E. Levery S.B. Kannagi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4672-4680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,31.Dickinson B.L. Clements J.D. Kiyono H. Ogra P.L. McGhee J.R. Mucosal Vaccines. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1996: 73-87Crossref Google Scholar). The immunogenicity, and to some extent the adjuvant activity, are also dependent on receptor binding, as shown by recent studies using the Gly33 [arrow] Asp mutant of LT, which is devoid of GM1 binding capacity (32.Nashar T.O.

Immunology. 1998; 94: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The binding of the B-subunits of cholera toxin to the GM1 ganglioside is a paradigm for protein-carbohydrate interactions. However, in the CTB/LTB hybrid LCTBK, with blood group A- and B-binding capacity, the blood group determinants are accommodated in a novel carbohydrate binding site, distinct from the GM1 binding site. This novel binding site is located at the top of the B-subunit interfaces as found by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Changes of carbohydrate binding specificities by substitutions of specific amino acids within the carbohydrate binding sites have previously been reported for E-selectin, P-selectin, and mannose-binding protein (35.Kogan T.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7289-7292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but this is the first report of the creation of a novel binding site in a carbohydrate-binding protein. The reason for the lost ability of LCTBK to bind toN-acetyllactosamine-terminated glycosphingolipids and gangliotetraosylceramide is, however, at present not apparent. An additional observation is that also CTB exhibits a weak binding to branched neolactohexaosylceramide, but does not bind to linear toN-acetyllactosamine-terminated glycosphingolipids (Fig. 1). Docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that this is due to additional interactions between the the β6-linked branch and amino acid residues outside the GM1 binding site, i.e. van der Waals interactions between the -CβH2group of His13 and the terminal galactose, and between Asn14 and the 3-OH of this galactose, in addition to the interactions described earlier for neolactotetraosylceramide (10.Teneberg S. Hirst T.R. Ångström J. Karlsson K.-A. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 2S. Teneberg, A. Berntsson, and J. Ångström, manuscript in preparation. The Galβ4GlcNAcβ6(Galβ3GlcNAcβ3)Galβ element of branched neolactohexaosylceramide is found also in the carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins. However, CTB does not bind to human small intestinal glycoproteins on blotting membranes, and hLTB binds only after de-sialylation (38.Karlsson K.-A. Teneberg S. Ångström J. Kjellberg A. Hirst T.R. Bergström J. Miller-Podraza H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996; 4: 1919-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), indicating that certain substitutions on the Galβ4GlcNAcβ6 (Galβ3GlcNAcβ3)Galβ core obliterates the binding. An important further step will be to analyze whether the novel mode of binding of LCTBK, with recognition of carbohydrate receptors different from the GM1 ganglioside, will allow the toxin to exert its biological effects. The location of the binding site and the direction of the carbohydrate residues at the reducing end suggest that LCTBK may bind “upside down” with the GM1 binding sites directed away from the surface. The next step will thus be to produce an LCTBK holotoxin, where the presence of the A-subunit will prevent the upside down binding. This holotoxin should not bind to the relatively short glycosphingolipids tested here, but may bind to longer glycosphingolipids or A/B determinants on glycoproteins, and will be a novel tool for dissection of the relation of the binding event to the biological functions of the toxins. Thereafter, a holotoxin with an LCTBK/G33D mutation in the B-subunits will be constructed, giving a toxin that binds only to blood group A and B determinants. This hybrid toxin will allow further insights into how the biological activities of the toxins are related to recognition of different carbohydrate receptors. In addition, efforts to crystallize LCTBK, alone and in complex with A pentasaccharide, are currently under way.

The responses of cells to FGF-2 are mediated through a dual receptor system consisting of high affinity transmembrane receptors and lower affinity cell surface and extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycans (13.Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The FGF prototypes, FGF-1 (acidic) and FGF-2 (basic), lack a classical signal sequence for secretion through the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway. Despite the absence of a signal sequence, the growth factors are released and localized in the extracellular matrix of different tissue types. The mechanism by which FGF-1 and FGF-2 are released from cells remains to be elucidated. Evidence has been presented suggesting that FGF-1 is released after heat shock (14.Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and that FGF-2 is released through its association with HSP27 (15.Piotrowicz R.S. Martin J.L. Dillman W.H. Levin E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7042-7047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Four forms of FGF-2 exist in vivo because of alternative translation initiation within a single mRNA species. The translation of the three high molecular weight forms (HMW FGF-2) is initiated at three CUG codons located 5′ to an AUG codon, which initiates the translation of the 18-kDa low molecular weight form (LMW FGF-2). The HMW FGF-2 polypeptides (apparent molecular masses 22 (short form), 22.5 (middle form), and 24 kDa (long form)) contain varying lengths of N-terminal sequence in addition to the LMW FGF-2 sequence. Although the LMW form remains mostly cytoplasmic, the HMW FGF-2 forms localize predominantly in the nucleus (16.Renko M. Quarto N. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 144: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 17.Bugler B. Amalric F. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 18.Yu Z.-X.

Florkiewicz R. Stachowiak E.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 203-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Chimeric proteins consisting of the N-terminal region of HMW FGF-2 fused to a normally cytoplasmic protein enter the nucleus (11.Quarto N. Finger F.P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17.Bugler B. Amalric F. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that the nuclear accumulation of HMW FGF-2 can be explained by the existence of a nuclear localization signal in the N-terminal region. The overexpression of different FGF-2 forms confers unique cellular phenotypes on transfected cells (12.Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 20.Klein S. Bikfalvi A. Birkenmeier T.M. Giancotti F.G. Rifkin D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 37: 22583-22590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Increased expression of LMW FGF-2 changes cell shape, enhances cell motility, increases saturation density in normal serum conditions, supports growth in soft agar, down-regulates FGF receptor levels, and alters integrin expression. Although HMW forms also increase the saturation density of cells grown under normal serum conditions and support growth in soft agar, their expression does not affect these other properties. However, a unique function of HMW FGF-2 overexpression is its ability to reduce the serum requirement for growth such that, in the presence of 1% fetal calf serum, the growth of cells producing HMW FGF-2 is much higher than that of cells expressing LMW FGF-2. The coexpression of a dominant negative FGF receptor reverts the phenotype of cells transformed by LMW FGF-2 but has no effect on the phenotype of cells transfomed by HMW FGF-2. Thus, different forms of FGF-2 affect the cell phenotype through autocrine FGF receptor-dependent or intracrine FGF receptor-independent pathways. These observations have focused our interest on the mechanisms that determine the nuclear localization of the HMW FGF-2 forms. By pulse-chase experiments, newly synthesized HMW FGF-2 forms were shown to accumulate rapidly in the nucleus of transfected NIH 3T3 cells and displayed a gradual increase in their apparent molecular weight (21.Pintucci G. Quarto N. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The molecular weight increase was dependent on the presence of methionine, the precursor of the methyl donorS-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). In addition, the transmethylation inhibitor 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine abolished the modification of HMW FGF-2, indicating that the post-translational increase in molecular weight was due to methylation. Moreover, inhibition of protein methylation by 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine treatment decreased the nuclear accumulation of HMW FGF-2 (21.Pintucci G. Quarto N. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that post-translational methylation is critical for the proper nuclear transport or retention of HMW FGF-2. Sommer et al. (22.Sommer A. Moscatelli D. Rifkin D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed by limited amino acid sequence analysis that guinea pig brain-derived HMW FGF-2 contained nonstandard phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives at three positions where the human cDNA sequence predicts arginine residues. Burgess et al.(23.Burgess W.H. Bizik J. Mehlman T. Quarto N. Rifkin D.B. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) later demonstrated that these amino acids, at positions −22, −24, and −26, numbering from the initiator methionine for the LMW FGF-2, were methylated arginines. Arginine methylation is a post-translational modification found in nuclear proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), nucleolin, and fibrillarin (24.Beyer A.L.

Chem. 1985; 260: 14304-14310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hnRNPs are proposed to function in all known steps of mRNA maturation including pre-mRNA packaging, splicing, and mRNA nuclear export. The nucleolar proteins nucleolin and fibrillarin are involved in pre-rRNA transcription and in pre-rRNA maturation, respectively. Furthermore, both of these proteins are implicated in ribosome biogenesis. A distinctive feature of the N-terminal extension of HMW FGF-2 is the high percentage of arginine and glycine residues (57% in the 54-amino acid extension of the longest form) including six arginines flanked by glycyl residues on each side. The Gly-Arg-Gly motif is a general sequence recognized by arginine methyltransferases in vitroand in vivo (27.Rawal N. Rajpurohit R. Lischwe M.A. Williams K.R. Paik W.K. Kim S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This suggests that the HMW FGF-2 N-terminal region may contain more than the three methylation sites originally described (23.Burgess W.H. Bizik J. Mehlman T. Quarto N. Rifkin D.B. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of methylation in nuclear accumulation and HMW FGF-2 function, the degree and position of methylation must first be determined. We purified HMW FGF-2 from transfected NIH 3T3 cells, and, using mass spectrometry and protein sequencing approaches, characterized the post-translational modifications present in the N-terminal region. Recombinant human FGF-2 (18 kDa) was a gift from Amgen, Inc. (Boulder, CO) and Scios Nova (Mountain View, CA). Aprotinin was a gift from Bayer AG (Wuppertal, Germany). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the Zip-neo vector containing the human 1.1-kilobase FGF-2 cDNA encoding only for the 24–22-kDa FGF-2 and the pCEP4 vector (clone 365/365c14) and cultured as described previously (11.Quarto N. Finger F.P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12.Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells (clone 365/365c14) were washed and scraped on ice with phosphate-buffered saline containing aprotinin (50 μg/ml). The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, containing leupeptin (10 μg/ml) (Sigma), aprotinin (50 μg/ml), and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl-fluoride, hydrochloride (Sigma), sonicated, and centrifuged at 7,000 rpm in an SS34 rotor for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 24,000 rpm in a Ti60 rotor for 45 min at 4 °C. This supernatant was loaded on a 1 ml of fast protein liquid chromatography heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the column was washed with 0.5 and 0.8 m NaCl, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0. The 1.5 m eluate was diluted with 20 mmMES, pH 6.0, and bound to a second heparin-Sepharose column. This column was washed with 0.5 and 0.8 m NaCl in 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, and HMW FGF-2 was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.8–2.0 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions were analyzed by dot blot and Western blot with anti-FGF-2 antiserum (diluted 1:500). Fractions containing HMW FGF-2 were pooled and loaded on a reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) C8 column (RP300, 2.1 × 30 mm) (Michrom Bioresources UMA System, Auburn, CA). HMW FGF-2 was eluted using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer A) and 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile (buffer B) with a linear gradient of 5–95% buffer B in 60 min. HMW FGF-2 samples from reverse-phase HPLC were dried, resuspended in 100 mmNH4HCO3, and digested either with Lys-C protease (9 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 4 h at room temperature or V8 protease (45 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 16 h at room temperature. For some experiments, the Lys-C digest was subjected to a second digestion with Asp-N protease (24 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 16 h at room temperature. Protein and peptide samples were prepared for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry using the dried droplet method (28.Hillenkamp F. Karas M. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1991; 63: 1193A-1203ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The matrix used was recrystalized α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma). The sample was added to a saturated solution of matrix prepared 2:1 aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid:acetonitrile at room temperature so that the final sample concentration was 1–10 μm. 0.5 μl of the solution was placed on the probe of the mass spectrometer and allowed to dry. The sample was analyzed using a linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a 1-m flight path and a single-field acceleration region (+40 kV). Ions were formed using a nitrogen laser (LSI 337ND, Newton, MA) as the light source. For the spectra shown, 100 scans were averaged. Automated Edman degradation of HMW FGF-2 proteins was performed on a 492 protein sequencer, and the resulting phenylthiohydantoin derivatives identified using an on-line phenylthiohydantoin derivative analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The peptides GGRGRGRAPERVGGRG (F1), GDRGRG-RALPGG (F2), and GGRGGFGGRGGFGGRGGF (R3) were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems model 431A peptide synthesizer and small scale Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) cycles supplied by the manufacturer. Peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC and characterized by amino acid analysis and mass spectroscopy. The peptide ALAQAPPVYLDVLG (C-) was kindly provided by John Alberta (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). The E. coli pGST-HMWFGF-2 expression vector was constructed by subcloning the XhoI/EcoRI fragment from vector CUG24kDFGF-2 (29.Arese M. Chen Y. Florkiewicz R.Z. Gualandris A. Shen B. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1429-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) into the NcoI site of the expression vector pGEX.EF (a gift from Mindong Ren, New York University Medical School). The bacterial strain HB101 was transformed with the plasmid pGST-HMWFGF-2, and fusion protein expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for 6 h at 30 °C. The recombinant protein was purified using Bulk GST Purification Module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the eluted fraction was diluted 5-fold with 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, dialyzed against the same buffer, and loaded onto an fast protein liquid chromatography heparin Sepharose column. The column was washed with 0.8 m NaCl, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, and protein was eluted with 2 mNaCl, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and precipitated with 2 m NaCl. The precipitated protein was redissolved in dialysis buffer containing 7 m urea and renatured by dialysis using decreasing concentrations of urea. Recombinant Npl3p, produced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity, was kindly provided by Ethan Ford and Adrian Krainer (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). Methylation reactions were performed as described previously (30.Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). 40-ml reactions contained 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 300 mmNaCl, 30 μm SAM, 5.5 μCi of [methyl-3H]-SAM (NEN Life Science Products, 80 Ci/mmol), and substrate protein. Soluble E. coli extracts were added at 10 μg/reaction, whereas purified substrate proteins were supplemented at 1 μg/reaction. Reactions were initiated by the addition of either human HRMT1L2 or yeast Hmt1p (hnRNPmethyltransferase 1 protein) and incubated at 30 °C for 40 min. Competition reactions were performed in the same manner except for the presence of the R1, F1, F2, or C-, peptides (500 μm). Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining and fluorography. To characterize the extent and position of arginine methylation in HMW FGF-2, we purified HMW FGF-2 proteins from NIH 3T3 cells (clone 365/365FGFc14) stably transfected with cDNA encoding exclusively HMW FGF-2 forms. HMW FGF-2 proteins were isolated from NIH 3T3 cell extracts by chromatography on two consecutive fast protein liquid chromatography heparin-Sepharose columns followed by HPLC as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 1 A(inset) shows a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel of an aliquot of the purified HMW FGF-2 proteins. Fig. 1 Billustrates the amino acid sequences of these forms based upon the cloned cDNA (31.Prats H. Kaghad M. Prats A.C. Klagsbrun M. Lelias J.M. Liauzun P. Chalon P. Tauber J.P. Amalric F.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). MALDI mass spectrometry, in conjunction with enzymatic degradation, was used to determine the accurate molecular mass, amino acid sequence, and the extent of post-translational modification of the HMW FGF-2 proteins. Fig. 1 A shows the MALDI mass spectrum of the purified forms of HMW FGF-2. The molecular mass of the short form of HMW FGF-2 was 21,170 Da (Fig. 1 C). N-terminal sequencing of the protein (data not shown) indicated that the first residue, encoded by the CUG initiation codon, is missing from the protein. Therefore, the measured molecular mass of the short form of HMW FGF-2 is 158 Da higher than the theoretical molecular mass of 21,012 Da calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence minus the first amino acid (Fig. 1 C). To determine the cause of the mass increase, enzymatic digestion and analysis of the peptides generated by MALDI mass spectrometry was performed. The mixture of HMW FGF-2 forms was first digested with Lys-C, which cleaves specifically at the C-terminal side of lysine (Fig. 1 B), and the Lys-C digest mixture was subjected to mass spectrometry. Following Lys-C digestion, the N-terminal fragments, the largest peptides in the digestion mixture (illustrated in the peptide map in Fig. 5 A), are clearly separated from the remainder of the HMW FGF-2 peptides on the mass spectrum. Fig.2 (A and B) shows the predicted sequences of the N-terminal peptides from the digest and the resulting MALDI mass spectrum of the peptides. The peaks labeledP1 and P2 at m/z 6527 and 6570 correspond to modified forms of the N-terminal peptide of the short form of HMW FGF-2. The smallest peptide P1 differs from the expected mass by 142 Da (Fig. 2 C), indicating a post-translational modification present in the N-terminal region of the protein. In addition, the difference in mass between P1 and P2 (43 Da) approximates the mass of a single acetyl group (42 Da), suggesting that an additional fraction of the short form of HMW FGF-2 is acetylated.Figure 2Predicted sequence and mass spectrometric analysis of N-terminal Lys-C and Glu-C peptides of HMW FGF-2 proteins. A, the predicted sequences of the N-terminal peptides derived from a Lys-C digestion of HMW FGF-2. Residue 1 is an alanine, which was substituted for the initiator methionine of the LMW FGF-2 to allow exclusive expression of HMW FGF-2 forms. B, mass spectrum of the molecular ion region corresponding to peaks: P1 and P2 (short form), P3 (middle form), and P4 (long form).C, theoretical and measured masses of peptides P1, P2, P3, and P4. D, the predicted sequence of the N-terminal peptides derived from a Glu-C digestion of HMW FGF-2. E, corresponding mass spectrum of peptides P5 and P6 (short form), P7 (middle form), and P8, P9, and P10 (long form). F, the theoretical and measured masses of the Glu-C peptides. The difference in theoretical versus measured mass found is due to modifications. The additional peaks observed are due to expected proteolytic peptides from the rest of the protein. 4 Me andAc indicate the addition of four methyl groups and one acetyl group to the peptide, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To localize the sites of modification, the mixture of the three forms of HMW FGF-2 was subjected to Glu-C digestion with V8 protease, which cleaves at the C-terminal side of glutamic acids (Fig. 1 B). There are nine sites of cleavage in the protein, one of which is present in the N-terminal extension containing the nuclear localization sequence (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 2 (D and E) illustrates the predicted sequences of the N-terminal peptides from a Glu-C digest of HMW FGF-2 and the mass spectrum showing the N-terminal peptides of all three forms of HMW FGF-2. Consistent with the results from the Lys-C digest, the two forms of the smallest peptide (P5 and P6), differing by 42 Da, indicate that a portion of the short form of HMW FGF-2 is acetylated at the N terminus. Moreover, the 56-Da difference between the measured and theoretical mass of the P5 peptide (at m/z 1068; Fig. 2 F) predicts that four methyl groups (each 14 Da) are located in the peptide. The mass of larger peptides was determined by examining a different region of the mass spectrum. The peptide illustrated in Fig.3 A representing amino acids −30 to +14 derived from a Glu-C digest is common to all three forms of HMW FGF-2 and contains seven arginines, three of which are flanked by glycines. The mass spectrum (Fig. 3 B) reveals that the peptide (P11 at m/z 4219) is 83 Da higher than the theoretical mass of the expected peptide (Fig. 3 C) and suggests that six methyl groups, equal to 84 Da, are present in the peptide. Together, the mass spectrometry data of the Glu-C digest support the presence of a total of 10 methyl groups (four in peptide P5 and six in peptide P11) in the N-terminal extension of the short form of HMW FGF-2. This analysis covers the sequence −40 to +14. To identify unambiguously the position of the 10 methyl groups, the mixture of intact HMW FGF-2 proteins was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to Edman degradation. The short and middle forms do not have coincidental Arg residues that would be generated in the same cycle. In addition, as the long form is blocked at the N terminus (see below), methylated Arg residues can be subscribed to their respective HMW FGF-2 form during sequencing. This analysis confirmed the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal extension (Gly−40 through Thr1) of the short form and identified 5 of the 10 arginines having methyl groups. The mass spectrometry analysis of the mixture of intact HMW FGF-2 mixture also revealed that the middle form of HMW FGF-2 differs from the theoretical mass by 131 Da (minus the first amino acid; Fig. 1,A and C). Furthermore, proteolytic fragments obtained by Lys-C digestion demonstrated that the 143-Da mass increase was due to post-translational modification located in the N-terminal region of the protein (peak P3 at m/z 7009; Fig.2 B). Consistent with the pattern of methylation in the short form of HMW FGF-2, the N-terminal peptide derived from Glu-C digestion (peak P7 at m/z 1549; Fig. 2 E) showed a 55-Da increase in mass corresponding to four methyl groups (Fig.2 F). For the long form of HMW FGF-2, mass spectrometry of the mixture of intact proteins showed a 252-Da difference with respect to the theoretical mass of the protein lacking the first amino acid (Fig. 1,A and C). Lys-C digestion indicated that the post-translational modifications in the long form were present in the N-terminal peptide (P4 at m/z 8063; Fig.2 B) Interestingly, mass spectrometry of the Glu-C digest showed that the N-terminal peptide of 24 amino acids exists as three species (P8, P9, and P10), differing in mass of a single methyl group (Fig. 2, E and F). This result indicated that the methylation of the peptide is heterogeneous. N-terminal sequencing of the intact protein was not possible, indicating that the first residue contains a blocking group. To determine the nature of the blocking group, the mixture of HMW FGF-2 forms were subjected to Glu-C digestion followed by digestion with Asp-N protease, which cleaves at the N terminus of aspartic acids (Fig. 1 B). The mass region corresponding to the long form before and after digestion with Asp-N protease is shown in Fig. 4 (Band C). The shift in mass corresponds to an acetylated glycine equaling 99 Da. Consequently, the masses of peptides P12, P13, and P14 (Fig. 4 D) differ from the masses of the related peptides P8, P9, and P10 (Fig. 2 F) by the absence of 42 mass units corresponding to an acetyl group. Therefore, by subtraction of mass, the N-terminal Glu-C peptide must contain 8–10 methyl groups as well as an acetyl group. To determine the position(s) of the heterogeneity in methylation, the N-terminal peptide of the long form was purified by reverse-phase HPLC after Asp-N digestion of the mixture of HMW FGF-2 forms and sequenced. The sequence analysis revealed that the only arginine that is heterogeneous in its methylation is Arg−48, which contains 0–2 methyl groups (data not shown). Thus, a total of 14–16 methyl groups (8–10 methyl groups in peptides P8, P9, and P10 (Gly−54 through Glu−31; Fig. 4 B) and 6 methyl groups in peptide P11 (Arg−30 through Glu14; Fig. 3)) are post-translationally added to the long form of HMW FGF-2. As another means to verify the primary structure of the intact HMW FGF-2 proteins, a peptide mass map was generated for the three HMW FGF-2 forms digested with Lys-C protease (Fig.5 A). The measured mass of peptide 1, which corresponds to the N terminus of the long form, matches the theoretical mass (8056.9 Da) adjusted by the addition of one acetyl group and fifteen methyl groups. Peptides 2 and 3, which correspond to the N termini of the middle and short forms, respectively, match their theoretical masses (7005.8 and 6525.2 Da) when 10 methyl groups are added to each peptide mass. The measured masses of peptides 4–10, which correspond to the remaining 70% of the protein, confirm the predicted sequence without modifications. A second mass map was generated from a Glu-C digest of the mixture of HMW FGF-2 forms (Fig. 5 B). The mass of peptide 1, which corresponds to the N terminus of the long form, matches the theoretical mass (2599.9 M r) when one acetyl and nine methyl groups are added. The masses of peptides 2 and 3, which correspond to the N termini of the mid"

Two peptides were used, IK29C and MY27C, containing residues from Ile25 to Lys53 and from Met1 to Tyr27 of the human and chicken caldesmon sequence, respectively, plus an added cysteine at the C terminus. In cells clamped at pCa 6.7, both peptides increased basal tone. Pretreatment of cells atpCa 6.7 with IK29C or MY27C decreased the amplitude of subsequent phenylephrine-induced contractions but not microcystin-racemic mixture-induced contractions. In all cases the effects of the peptides were concentration-dependent, and IK29C was more potent than MY27C, in agreement with their relative affinity toward myosin. The peptides were ineffective after the phenylephrine contraction was established. MY27C did not further increase the magnitude of contraction caused by a maximally effective concentration of IK29C, consistent with the two peptides having the same mechanism of action. Neither polylysine nor two control peptides containing scrambled sequences of IK29C, which do not bind myosin, had any effect on basal or phenylephrine-induced force. Our results suggest that IK29C and MY27C induce contraction by competing with the myosin-binding domain of endogenous caldesmon. Digital imaging of fluoroisothiocyanate-tagged IK29C confirmed the association of the peptide with intracellular filamentous structures. The results are consistent with a model whereby tethering of actin to myosin by caldesmon may play a role in regulating vascular tone by positioning the C-terminal domain of caldesmon so that it is capable of blocking the actomyosin interaction.

In particular, with respect to tonic contractile responses, many examples of dissociation between force levels, LC20 phosphorylation levels, intracellular Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i), and cross-bridge cycling rates have been reported (2.Horowitz A.

Although the precise mechanism involved in this additional regulatory system has not yet been identified, one likely candidate for mediating this regulation is the thin filament-associated protein caldesmon. Smooth muscle caldesmon consists of three parts (Fig. 1), N-terminal, C-terminal, and an elongated central spacer region (6.Bryan J. Imai M. Lee R. Moore P. Cook R.G. Lin W.-G. J. Biol.

The C-terminal portion of the molecule contains binding sites for actin and tropomyosin and inhibits actin-activated ATPase activity of myosinin vitro (8.Bartegi A. Fattoun A. Derancourt J. Kassab R.

Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17.Wang C.-L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The N-terminal portion of the molecule also contains a binding site for myosin that may be involved in tethering actin to myosin (18.Velaz L. Ingraham R.H. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 265: 2929-2934Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Evidence that caldesmon is involved in the regulation of contraction has been reported from several groups using different approaches. We have previously reported the effect of a peptide, GS17C, that contains residues from Gly651 to Ser667 of the C-terminal caldesmon sequence. The peptide binds actin but does not inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity and when used in saponin-permeabilized single ferret aortic and portal vein cells produced a sustained contraction (19.Katsuyama H. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14555-14558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was postulated that the contraction was due to competition with and partial displacement of endogenous caldesmon, resulting in disinhibition of myosin ATPase activity (19.Katsuyama H. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14555-14558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that extraction of caldesmon from a permeabilized smooth muscle preparation increased the Ca2+sensitivity of force development (20.Malmqvist U. Arner A. Makuch R. Dabrowska R. Pfluegers Arch. 1996; 432: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and, conversely, that addition of caldesmon or a C-terminal fragment to permeabilized chicken gizzard fibers inhibited contraction (21.Szpacenko A. Wagner J. Dabrowska R. Rüegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1985; 192: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22.Pfitzer G. Strauss J.D. Rüegg J.C. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 58: 23-28Crossref Google Scholar). It has also been reported recently that, in arterial strips made caldesmon-deficient by the use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, increased basal cross-bridge cycling rates are inhibited by the addition of caldesmon (23.Earley J.J. Su X. Moreland R.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Most investigations into the possible role of caldesmon in smooth muscle contractility have focused on the role of the C-terminal part of caldesmon. However, because caldesmon contains both actin (C-terminal) and myosin (N-terminal) binding domains, both have been postulated to play a role in force maintenance in smooth muscle through a tethering effect that may maintain contractile force in the absence of cross-bridge cycling (24.Hemric M.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1878-1885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As an alternative hypothesis, tethering has also been postulated to function as in a structural manner, keeping the contractile filaments in register (25.Wang Z. Jiang H. Yang Z.Q. Chacko S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11898-11904Google Scholar). However, at the present time, direct evidence is still lacking for a role of the N-terminal part of caldesmon in the contraction of smooth muscle cells. Thus, we synthesized a 29-residue peptide, IK29C, 2Y. Li, S. Zhuang, K. Mabuchi, R. C. Lu, and C.-L. Albert Wang, unpublished results. Co-sedimentation experiments showed that both MY27C and IK29C bind smooth muscle myosin. The scrambled peptides, IK29CX1 and IK29CX2, however, did not appreciably co-sediment with myosin. and a 27-residue peptide, MY27C (26.Zhuang S. Wang C.-L.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 156Google Scholar, 27.Zhuang S. Wang C.-L.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 281Google Scholar), which contain residues from Ile25to Lys53 and from Met1 to Tyr27, derived from the myosin-binding domain of human and chicken caldesmon sequence, respectively, with an added cysteine at the C terminus. Both peptides have been shown to bind to smooth muscle myosin, but IK29C binds more strongly than does MY27C.2 To test the hypothesis that tethering of caldesmon may function as a physiological regulator of vascular tone, we determined the effects of IK29C, MY27C, and related peptides on contractility in a single hyperpermeable cell system (28.Brozovich F.V. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. 1990; 416: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29.Collins E.M. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H754-H762PubMed Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that IK29C and MY27C induce contraction by competing with the myosin-binding domain of endogenous caldesmon and, furthermore, that tethering of caldesmon may play a role in regulating vascular tone by properly positioning the C terminus of caldesmon so that it can maximally inhibit the actin-activated myosin ATPase. All peptides were synthesized as amides on an automated peptide synthesizer (ABI-431A) on a 0.25-mmol scale using the “FastMoc” method (30.Wang E. Wang C.-L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a procedure similar to the Fmoc protocol except the activation is performed with 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, instead of by carbodiimide-mediated reactions. 1.2 g of Rink (4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)-phenoxy) resin (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY)) was used for each synthesis. After synthesis the peptides were cleaved from the resin according to a trifluoroacetic acid-based protocol in a solution containing 0.75 g of phenol, 0.25 ml of 1,2-ethanedithiol, 0.5 ml of thioanisole, 10.0 ml of trifluoroacetic acid, and 1.0 ml of H2O at room temperature. To ensure complete removal of the protecting group (2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-chroman-6-sulfonyl chloride) for Arg residues, the reaction time was increased to 4 h for IK29C and its variants. After cleavage/deprotection reaction the peptide was precipitated upon dropwise addition of the reaction mixture into cold diethyl ether. The peptide was then spun down, washed by ether, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. The peptides were first examined by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography using an analytical C-8 column (Si-O-Si-(CH2)7-CH3 from Phenomenex, Torrance, CA; length, 250 mm; internal diameter, 4.6 mm; particle size, 5 mm). About 100 μl of 2 mg/ml of peptide solution (in water) was injected each time, and the column was eluted with a 0–60% acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The peptides were eluted with increasing concentrations of Solution B (100% acetonitrile plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The peptides were then purified using a semi-preparative C-8 column (length, 250 mm; internal diameter, 10 mm; particle size, 5 mm) with an injection volume of 500 μl (of 2 mg/ml) and a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The bulk of each peak was collected, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. All peptides thus purified were confirmed by both amino acid composition and partial sequence analyses and were further checked by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Perspective Biosystems, Voyager RP) to ascertain the purity and complete removal of protecting groups. In each case a single major peak was obtained; their respective masses (m/z) were 3817.72 (IK29C), 3815.96 (IK29CX1), 3814.79 (IK29CX2), and 3765.95 (MY27C). The following drugs were used: PE, creatine kinase, phosphocreatine, and microcystin-LR (all from Sigma). General laboratory reagents were of analytical grade or better and were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Ca2+ buffers were prepared according to an iterative computer program that calculates the amounts of stock solutions required for a given set of free ion concentrations, taking into consideration the binding constants for the ionic species present, temperature, and ionic strength (28.Brozovich F.V. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. 1990; 416: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Ionic strength was set at 0.2m, and MOPS was used to buffer the pH at 7.0. The concentrations of the constituents were as follows: Ca2+, 1 nm to 0.1 mm; Mg2+, 1 mm; K+, 135 mm; MgATP, 3 mm; EGTA, 15 mm; MOPS, >15 mm; phosphocreatine, 15 mm; and creatine kinase (approximately 20 units/ml), added daily before the experiments. The major anion was propionate. Krebs solution (used only for dissection of the tissue) contained (in mm) 120 NaCl, 5.9 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4, and 11.5 dextrose at pH 7.4 when bubbled with 95% O2 + 5% CO2. The Ca2+-Mg2+-free Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) used for cell isolation contained (in mm) 137 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.44 KH2PO4, 4.17 NaHCO3, 0.42 NaH2PO4, and 5.5 dextrose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. All procedures were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Ferrets were euthanized with chloroform, and the portal vein was quickly removed to a dissection dish filled with oxygenated Krebs solution. The tissue was cleaned of connective tissue and opened longitudinally, and the endothelium was removed by gentle abrasion of the inner surface of the tissue with a rubber policeman. The tissue was cut into 2–3-mm-wide strips, and wet weight was determined. Single vascular smooth muscle cells from ferret portal vein were isolated using a modification of a previously published method (29.Collins E.M. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H754-H762PubMed Google Scholar). The portal vein was cut into small pieces (2 × 2 mm) and placed in a siliconized flask containing digestion medium. For each 50 mg of portal vein (wet weight), the digestion medium A consisted of 4.2 mg of CLS 2 collagenase (type II, 228 units/mg; Worthington) and 4 mg of elastase (Grade II, 3.65 units/mg; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 7.5 ml of Ca2+-Mg2+-free HBSS and 1% bovine serum albumin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The tissue pieces were incubated in a shaking water bath at 34 °C under an atmosphere of 95% O2 + 5% CO2 for 45 min. The pieces were then filtered on a nylon mesh, rinsed with 10 ml of Ca2+-Mg2+-free HBSS, and reincubated for 20 min in digestion medium B, i.e. the same digestion solution except for a decrease in the amount of collagenase to 2.1 mg and addition of 5,000 units of soybean trypsin inhibitor (type II-S; Sigma). The tissue pieces were filtered and rinsed in 10 ml of Ca2+-Mg2+-free HBSS. The filtrate containing the dissociated cells was poured over unsiliconized glass coverslips and further incubated for 20 min in digestion medium B. After filtering and rinsing with 10 ml of Ca2+-Mg2+-free HBSS, the dissociated cells were plated onto another set of coverslips. Coverslips were stored on ice for 1–5 h until use. Cells were not centrifuged or aspirated by pipette. The isolated cells were assayed daily to confirm that they shortened in response to 10−5m PE in 2.5 mm Ca2+-HBSS. The coverslips were placed on the movable stage of a Nikon inverted microscope. Ferret portal vein cells were exposed to a relaxing solution (pCa 9) containing 30 μg/ml saponin for 5 min, and then the solution was changed to saponin-free pCa 6.7 solution. Permeabilized cells were chosen according to the following criteria: diminished phaseluscence under phase-contrast optics; a visible nucleus; length ≥ 100 μm; and firm attachment to the coverslip. We have previously found that our permeabilization method results in cells that retain receptor-coupled function (29.Collins E.M. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H754-H762PubMed Google Scholar) and does not cause a detectable loss of molecules such as calmodulin (28.Brozovich F.V. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. 1990; 416: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Microtools (Glass 1, Life Technologies, Inc., W/FIL 1.0 mm, 1B100F-4, 12773–08H, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) were prepared by the use of a micropipette puller (Industrial Science Associates, Inc. Ridgewood, NY), and the diameters of the tip of the microtool were < 5 μm. The microtools were placed with their tips touching the top surface of the cell (microtools approached the coverslip at an angle of approximately 45°), and the cells were left undisturbed for 2–3 min. We have found that mammalian vascular smooth muscle cells prepared in this manner have the important advantage of sticking to glass and, therefore, readily attach to the glass microelectrodes. The microtool attached to the transducer (Cambridge model 400A) was lifted so that the end of the cell was raised off the coverslip. The other microtool was gently pressed down to immobilize the other end of the cell, which was stretched to approximately 110% of its original length. Control recordings confirmed the drift of the transducer was negligible over the course of the recording. At least one recording was made daily with a cell attached to the microtool in the absence of added drugs to confirm that the base line drifted ≤10 μg over the time course of an experiment. Additionally, base-line recordings of 3–5 min were obtained for each cell before experimental manipulations were performed. Agonist-induced increases or decreases in force were assumed to have reached a plateau when no further increase or decrease occurred over a 2–3-min period. Force records were quantitated by placing a ruler on the trace through the midpoint of the noise level. All experiments were performed at 20–21 °C. Isolated portal vein cells were incubated in pCa 6.7 solution containing FITC-labeled IK29C peptide (5 μm) and saponin (30 μg/ml) for 10 min. The cells were then rinsed with pCa 6.7 solution several times, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and mounted with Fluorosave (Calbiochem) before analysis. Images were obtained using a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon X-40 oil immersion objective (NA 1.3). Filters used were 470 ± 20 nm (excitation), 505 nm (dichroic), and 535 ± 20 nm (emission) for FITC-labeled cells. Images were recorded with a liquid cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (photometrics CH250) via Photometrics Microsoft-compatible Image-processing Software (PMISTM). For the comparison of LC20 phosphorylation levels, cells were co-stained with a monoclonal (mouse) antibody (1:500) specific for phosphorylation of LC20 at the MLCK sites, which was a gift from Drs. Y. Sasaki and M. Seto (Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Fuji, Japan) and has been previously characterized (31.Sakurada K. Seto M. Sasaki Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1563-C1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with rhodamine phalloidin (1:2000, Molecular Probes) to label actin. For data analysis, a region was identified containing a filament bundle, and fluorescence for both LC20 phosphorylation and actin were quantitated and integrated, and the ratio of LC20phosphorylation fluorescence/actin fluorescence was calculated. Normalization of phosphorylation values by the actin content compensated for any differences in cell thickness, etc., between cells. The anti-phospho-LC20 signal was visualized with an Oregon Green-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500, Molecular Probes). The Oregon Green signal was excited at 485 ± 5.2 nm, and emission was measured through a dichroic filter at >500 nm and an emission filter at 515 ± 4 nm. The rhodamine signal was excited at 546 ± 12 nm, and emission was measured through a dichroic filter at >580 nm and a barrier filter at >590 nm. Cells labeled only with Oregon Green were viewed with the rhodamine filter set, and cells labeled only with rhodamine were viewed with the Oregon Green filter set to confirm that there was no significant cross-talk between channels at the gain settings used. Both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated recombinant gizzard HMM (expressed in insect cells from a clone kindly given by Dr. M. Ikebe) were used. For myosin phosphorylation, to purified HMM (0.97 mg/ml) in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol were added: 50 μl of recombinant rabbit smooth muscle MLCK (6.36 μm; a gift from Dr. Z. Grabarek), 1.2 μl of calmodulin (267 μm), 5.25 μl of ATP (0.2 m, pH 7.4), 0.2 μl of CaCl2 (1 m), 1.05 μl of MgCl2 (1 m), at room temperature; total volume 1 ml; the mixture was incubated for 2 h and stored on ice. Immediately before the ATPase assay, phosphorylated HMM was passed through a gel filtration column at room temperature to remove ATP. ATPase was assayed by a continuous spectrophotometric method using 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside/purine nucleoside phosphorylase reaction to detect the released inorganic phosphate (EnzChek Kit from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (32.Melki R. Fievez S. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12038-12045Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Reaction conditions are as follows: 30 mm NaCl, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 25 °C; 10–30 μg/ml phosphorylated or unphosphorylated HMM, 4 μm actin, 0.57 μm tropomyosin; total volume = 0.5 ml. All values given in the text are mean ± S.E. Differences between mean were evaluated using Student'st test. Significant differences were taken at thep < 0.05 level. The values given represent numbers of cells used in each experiment. Peptide IK29C contains 29 amino acid residues, IAYQRNDDDEEEAARERRRRARQERLRQK, which correspond to the human caldesmon sequence from Ile25 to Lys53 (Fig.1), plus a cysteine residue added at the C terminus. Peptide MY27C contains 27 amino acid residues, MDDFERRRELRRQKREEMRLEAERLSY, which corresponds to the chicken caldesmon sequence from Met1 to Tyr27 (Fig. 1), and a C-terminal cysteine residue. The effects of these peptides on resting tension of single permeabilized ferret portal vein cells are illustrated in Fig. 2. In cells in which Ca2+ was clamped at pCa 6.7, both peptides induced a gradual but sustained increase in contractile force (Fig. 2,A and B). The mean steady-state increase in force in response to IK29C was 74 ± 7.5 μg (n = 5) at 1 μm, 142 ± 6.1 μg (n = 6) at 2.5 μm, 254 ± 17.1 μg (n = 6) at 5 μm, 258 ± 11.4 μg (n = 5) at 10 μm, and 257 ± 10.6 μg (n = 5) at 20 μm. In the case of MY27C, the mean steady-state amplitude of contraction was 22 ± 9.7 μg (n = 5) at 1 μm, 83 ± 12 μg (n = 6) at 2.5 μm, 134 ± 14 μg (n = 5) at 5 μm, 200 ± 10.9 μg (n = 5) at 10 μm, and 206 ± 14.5 μg (n = 3) at 20 μm. In both cases, the peptide-induced contractions were concentration-dependent, but IK29C was more potent and more effective than MY27C. The maximal force developed by the peptides was 258 ± 11.4 μg for IK29C and 206 ± 14.5 μg for MY27C, respectively. The 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of IK29C and MY27C were 1.98 and 3.4 μm, respectively. The effects of PE and microcystin-LR on the contractility of single permeabilized ferret portal vein cells are illustrated in Fig.3. As shown in Fig. 3 A1, a maximally effective concentration of PE (10−5m) evoked a gradual but sustained contraction of permeabilized portal vein cells clamped at pCa 6.7. The mean steady-state increase in force in response to PE was 266 ± 20.2 μg (n = 7) (Fig. 3 B1). When portal vein cells were stimulated by PE, the subsequent addition of mycrocystin-LR (1 μm) caused a further increase in force generation above that induced by PE (Fig. 3 A1), and the mean steady-state increase was 206 ± 27.2 μg (n = 7) (Fig. 3 B1). We have previously shown that ferret portal vein and aortic cells contract in response to PE at near resting [Ca2+]i levels in the absence of changes in LC20 phosphorylation, and this contraction is associated with activation of protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphorylation of the C-terminal half of caldesmon (29.Collins E.M. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H754-H762PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Khalil R.A. Morgan K.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 455: 585-599Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34.Khalil R.A.

Physiol. 1998; 275: C1081-C1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, it is known that microcystin-LR is an inhibitor of myosin light chain phosphatase that causes contraction by increasing LC20 phosphorylation levels (37.Gong M.C. Cohen P. Kitazawa T. Ikebe M. Masuo M. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14662-14668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that microcystin-LR provokes a contraction in single permeabilized ferret cells independent of activation of protein kinase C (38.Katsuyama H. Morgan K.G. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The additivity of the PE and microcystin-LR responses is consistent with their having different mechanisms of action. It is of interest that when mycrocystin-LR was added first, it induced a larger contraction (284 ± 12.1 μg, n = 5, Fig. 3 B3, p = 0.04) than when microcystin-LR was added after PE contraction was established (206 ± 27.2 μg,n = 7, Fig. 3 B1). Similarly, post-treatment of cells with PE after the induction of a microcystin-LR contraction evoked an average, smaller contraction (222 ± 12 μg,n = 5, Fig. 3 B3, p = 0.102) than that caused by PE alone (266 ± 20.2 μg, n= 7 Fig. 3 B1), although the difference did not reach statistical significance. When the sum of the PE and microcystin-LR contractions was compared across the different protocols (Fig.3 B1, 2, and 3), it was noticed that the total force produced was remarkably similar, between 480 and 500 μg. Thus, it appears that there is a “ceiling” of about 500 μg on the total force that a single ferret portal vein cell can generate. The effects of pretreatment of single permeabilized ferret portal vein cells with IK29C or MY27C on the PE- or microcystin-LR-induced contraction are illustrated in Fig. 3. Pretreatment of the cells with IK29C or MY27C decreased the amplitude of PE-induced contractions but not that of microcystin-LR-induced contractions. As shown in Fig. 3 A, as the concentration of IK29C or MY27C increased, the effect on basal tension also increased but the amplitude of the subsequent PE-induced contraction decreased. In contrast, increasing concentrations of the peptides had no effect on the magnitude of the microcystin-LR-induced contraction.

Initiation of dimer assembly involves strong binding between complementary motifs near the actin-binding end of the dimer. In this study, the mechanism of lateral spectrin association at this dimer nucleation site was investigated using the analytical ultracentrifuge to analyze heterodimers formed from recombinant peptides containing two or four homologous motifs from each subunit (α20–21/β1–2; α18–21/β1–4). Both the two-motif and four-motif dimer associations were weakened substantially with increasing salt concentration, indicating that electrostatic interactions are important for the dimer initiation process. Modeling of the electrostatic potential on the surface of the α20 and β2 motifs showed that the side of the motifs comprising the A and B helices is the most favorable for association, with an area of positive electrostatic potential on the AB face of the β2 motif opposite negative potential on the AB face of the α20 motif and vise versa. Protease protection analysis of the α20–21/β1–2 dimer showed that multiple trypsin and proteinase K sites in the A helices of the β2 and α21 motifs become buried upon dimer formation. Together, these data support a model where complementary long range electrostatic interactions on the AB faces of the triple-helical motifs in the dimer nucleation site initiate the correct pairing of motifs, i.e. α21-β1 and α20-β2. After initial docking of these complementary triple-helical motifs, this association is probably stabilized by subsequent formation of stronger hydrophobic interactions in a complex involving the A helices of both subunits and possibly most of the AB faces.

In erythrocytes, spectrin is the major component of the membrane skeleton, a network of spectrin oligomers cross-linked with short actin filaments that is bound to the membrane and provides cell membrane stability. The most common form of spectrin on intact cell membranes is the tetramer, which is formed by the “head-to-head” association of two elongated heterodimers, each comprising an α subunit and a β subunit with molecular masses of 280 kDa (1.Sahr K.E.

Both the α and β subunits consist largely of a series of homologous motifs, each approximately 106 residues in length (3.Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T.

The antiparallel lateral association of the α and β subunits to form a heterodimer is initiated near the actin-binding end of the molecule at a dimer nucleation site, where complementary motifs from each subunit form a high affinity association (9.Speicher D.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A minimum of two motifs from each monomer (α20–21 and β1–2) is thought to be necessary for association (11.Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), although it has been proposed that small sections of the non-homologous domains at the tail end of the dimer are also required (10.Viel A. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10839-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Between β1 and β2, and between α20 and α21, are 8-residue inserts that are not part of the typical 106-residue motif. Increasing or decreasing the length of these inserts abolished binding, indicating that the relative register of the two motifs from each subunit is important for association (10.Viel A. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10839-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Larger recombinant peptides containing additional homologous motifs exhibited stronger binding, indicating that each additional laterally associated pair of motifs contributed to the overall binding affinity between the subunits (11.Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with an earlier study (9.Speicher D.W. Weglarz L. DeSilva T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14775-14782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which proposed that spectrin dimers assemble in a zipper-like mechanism, in which the initial binding at the nucleation site is followed by weaker binding along the length of the dimer. The nature of the molecular forces that contribute to the lateral association of α and β subunits is unknown. Although the motifs required for binding at the nucleation site have been identified, the specific regions on the surfaces of these triple-helical motifs that bind to the complementary subunit and the nature of the molecular interactions has not been elucidated. Similarly, the associations between non-nucleation motifs further along the subunit that moderately increase dimer affinity are poorly understood. Determining the nature of lateral α/β associations should contribute to our understanding of spectrin's structural and functional properties, including the basis of spectrin's elasticity, the apparent differences in the morphology and self-association of erythroid and nonerythroid isoforms, and the possible effects of the subunits on each other during interactions with other molecules. For example, lateral interactions between the subunits may be involved in the down-regulation of brain spectrin self-association by calpain I and Ca2+/calmodulin (12.Harris A.S. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3009-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The ionic strength-dependent dissociation of erythroid and brain spectrin oligomers to dimers and then to monomers (13.Cole N. Ralston G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14.Begg G.E. Morris M.B. Ralston G.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6977-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) indicates that electrostatic interactions play an important role in the lateral association of the intact subunits. However, it is not known whether electrostatic interactions are directly involved in lateral associations, or indirectly involved via control of subunit flexibility, possibly via electrostatic interactions between consecutive motifs. Furthermore, it is not known whether electrostatic interactions are important for the initial association at the dimer nucleation site or for a subsequent step in dimer assembly, such as the weaker non-nucleation site lateral interactions or closing the hairpin loop at the head end of the molecule. Spectrin subunits can also be dissociated at pH > 9.5, though this dissociation is accompanied by ∼10% unfolding of the secondary structure (15.Fujita T. Ralston G.B. Morris M.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the role of electrostatic interactions during spectrin dimer nucleation and identify the regions of the triple-helical motifs that contact the complementary motif on the paired subunit. The contribution of electrostatic interactions to the dimer nucleation site association was determined using sedimentation equilibrium analyses. Modeling of the electrostatic potential on the surface of two laterally opposed nucleation site motifs, as well as two opposed non-nucleation motifs, revealed regions of complementary electrostatic potential on the AB faces of the triple-helical bundles that were predicted to be the dimer interface region. Finally, this model was tested using protease protection analyses to probe the spectrin dimer nucleation site region before and after lateral association, in order to experimentally identify regions that are buried upon dimer formation. The following recombinant peptides were used in this study: α20–21 (motifs 20 and 21 of the α subunit, comprising residues 2033–2259), α18–21 (motifs 18–21; residues 1818–2259), β1–2 (motifs 1 and 2 of the β subunit; residues 293–528), and β1–4 (motifs 1–4; residues 293–743). The nomenclature for spectrin motifs is that described by Winkelmann et al. (2.Winkelmann J.C. Chang J.-G. Tse W.T. Scarpa A.L. Marchesi V.T. Forget B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11827-11832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where β1 refers to the first homologous motif of the β subunit. The motifs described are structural motifs with the phasing of Yan et al. (4.Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The design and construction of the α18–21, β1–2, and β1–4 pGEX-2T expression plasmids have been described (11.Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The α20–21 plasmid was constructed in the same manner, except that the clone was inserted into the SmaI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T. All expression plasmids were transformed into the DH5α strain ofEscherichia coli. The spectrin-GST1 fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described (11.Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), except that β1–2, β1–4, and α18–21 were expressed at 30 °C, α20–21 was expressed at 18 °C, and all of the proteins were purified from the soluble fraction after cell lysis. Peptides were cleaved from the GST molecule using bovine thrombin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 3 h. The optimal thrombin cleavage conditions were: α20–21 and α18–21, 2 units/mg protein; β1–4, 17 units/mg; and β1–2, 8 units/mg. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 150 mm (β1–4) and 500 mm (β1–2) to decrease the formation of secondary cleavage products. The cleaved spectrin peptides were purified by rechromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose column. The α20–21 peptide was then separated from residual GST by anion-exchange chromatography on a 1-ml HiTrap-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The α20–21 was bound to the column in Buffer A (65 mmNaCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 75 μm PMSF, pH 7.3), washed with Buffer A, and eluted with Buffer B (1 m NaCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 75 μm PMSF, pH 7.3). The final purification step for all spectrin peptides was HPLC gel filtration on two preparative (21.5 × 600 mm) TSK-gel columns (G3000SW + G2000SW) in series (Toso-Haas) in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm PMSF, 0.05% sodium azide, pH 7.3). The purified α20–21 and β1–2 peptides were dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate and 130 mmNaCl, pH 7.3. Protein concentration was determined using the absorbance at 280 nm and molar extinction coefficients calculated from the amino acid sequence using the SEDNTERP program. 2The program SEDNTERP was written by T. Laue, J. Hayes, and J. Philo and is available on the RASMB web site. NONLIN, MATCH, and REEDIT are available from the Analytical Ultracentrifugation Facility at the University of Connecticut via the FTP site. To form the α/β heterodimer, α and β peptides were combined in a 1:1 molar ratio and incubated at 0 °C for 60 min. The monomer and dimer samples were adjusted to a single protein concentration (between 0.4 and 0.6 mg/ml) before digestion with trypsin at a 1:10 (w/w) enzyme:substrate ratio for 10 min at 0 °C, or with proteinase K at a 1:50 enzyme:substrate ratio for 15 min at 0 °C. The proteases were inactivated by the addition of diisopropyl fluorophosphate to a final concentration of 2 mm. The samples were stored at 0 °C for 48 h to allow for complete inhibition of the protease, before analysis by SDS-PAGE or other methods. Protease cleavage was monitored by Tricine SDS-PAGE using 14% slab gels (16.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the peptides were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (17.Mozdzanowski J. Hembach P. Speicher D.W. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The membranes were stained with Amido Black, and the bands of interest were excised and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems model 494 sequencer. The trypsin or proteinase K cleavage products were separated on a Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm) with a guard column containing the same resin, using a linear gradient of 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in 95% acetonitrile against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peak detection was via absorbance at 215 nm. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry was carried out on a Voyager RP spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). Peptide solutions were diluted 1:1 with a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 33% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and allowed to air-dry on the sample target before analysis. Alternatively, 0.5 μl of sample was dried onto a sample target pre-coated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid/nitrocellulose matrix (18.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar), washed briefly with water, and air-dried. Cytochrome c and Protein A were used as external standards. To form the spectrin α/β heterodimer, α and β peptides in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm PMSF, 0.05% sodium azide, 1 mm TCEP, pH 7.3) were combined in a 1:1 molar ratio and incubated on ice for 60 min. The α/β heterodimer was separated from excess or inactive monomers by gel filtration on two analytical (7.8 × 300 mm) TSK-gel columns (G3000SWXL + G2000SWXL) in series (Toso Haas) equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-Cl, 130 mmNaCl, 1 mm TCEP, pH 7.5). Fractions at the leading edge of the dimer peak (to ensure no contamination with monomers) were pooled and dialyzed for 24 h at 4 °C against Tris-buffered saline containing 0.3–1.0 m NaCl. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 4 °C in an Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge, using either the interference optics or the absorbance optics at 280 nm to measure the protein concentration gradient. When using absorbance optics, each ultracentrifuge cell was fitted with a six-channel 12-mm Yphantis-style centerpiece and loaded with three concentrations of the protein sample (typically 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 mg/ml). For each scan, data were acquired every 0.001 cm with 5 replicates in continuous scan mode. When the interference optics were used, the cells were assembled with double-sector 12-mm centerpieces and sapphire windows. A blank scan of distilled water was taken before the run, to correct for the effects of window distortion on the fringe displacement data (19.Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). All sample volumes were 110 μl. Absorbance or fringe displacement data were collected every 4–6 h until equilibrium was reached, as determined by comparison of successive scans using the MATCH v.7 program,2 and the data were edited using the REEDIT v.9 program.2 Analysis of sedimentation equilibrium data was performed using the NONLIN program2 (20.Johnson M.L. Correia J.A. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The reduced molecular weight, ς, of a protein is defined as ς = M(1 −ῡρ)ω2/RT, where M andῡ are the molecular weight and the partial specific volume of the protein, respectively, ρ is the density of the solvent (19.Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar), ω is the angular velocity in radians/s, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. In this study, the program SEDNTERP was used to calculate M and ῡ (from the amino acid composition of the recombinant peptides), and the ρ of the solvent. As the difference in ς for the α and β peptides (ςα − ςβ) was <0.3 at all rotor speeds used, the 1:1 heteroassociation of the α and β peptides was modeled as an ideal monomer-dimer association, where ς of the theoretical monomer was calculated using the weight-average molecular weight of the two peptides (21.Luckow E.A. Lyons D.A. Ridgeway T.M. Esmon C.T. Laue T.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2348-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). At least three data sets from different loading concentrations and/or rotor speeds were fitted simultaneously. All of the experimental data were fitted well by either an ideal single species model, or an ideal monomer-dimer model. Goodness of fit was determined by examination of the residuals and minimization of the variance. The association constants returned by NONLIN from the monomer-dimer fits were converted to the molar scale using either the calculated molar extinction coefficient of the peptide, for the absorbance data, or the sequence molecular weight of the peptide and a specific fringe displacement of 3.26 fringes (liters/g) for interference data (21.Luckow E.A. Lyons D.A. Ridgeway T.M. Esmon C.T. Laue T.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2348-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Models of the Drosophilaβ8, α20, and β2 motifs were constructed using the atomic coordinates of the α14 crystal structure. The structure of the monomer of the Drosophila α14 motif (Dα14) was derived from the crystal structure of the Dα14 dimer as described by Yanet al. (4.Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The Dα14 model was then refined by constrained energy minimization with Discover® software (Biosym Technologies) using the all-atom constant valence force field. Partial charges were assigned to all atoms at pH 7.0. Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg side chains were ionized. Histidines were neutral, as were the N and C termini of the motif (as each motif is part of a larger polypeptide in the native protein). Minimization was performed using 200 iterations of steepest descent, followed by 500 iterations of conjugate gradient for the BC loop side chains alone, then for the entire loop. The x-ray crystal structure was then relaxed using 200 iterations of steepest descent, followed by 500 iterations of conjugate gradient, first for the hydrogen atoms, then the side chains, and finally for all atoms except the Cα atoms of the helical residues, as described (22.Seto M.H. Harkins R.N. Adler M. Whitlow M. Church W.B. Croze E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To model Dβ8, Dα20, and Dβ2, the residues of Dα14 were replaced with those of the motif to be modeled using Biopolymer software (Biosym Technologies), which conserves the original position of the backbone atoms, as well as any side chain atoms common to the two residues. The models were then refined with energy minimization using the constant valence force field as described above. Calculations of electrostatic potential mapped to the accessible surface of the motif were performed using the program GRASP (23.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig H. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The program maps a molecule onto a three-dimensional cubic grid, and calculates the electrostatic potential at each grid point using a finite difference solution to the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation (24.Gilson M.K. Sharp K.A. Honig B.H. J. Comput. Chem. 1988; 9: 327-335Crossref Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 25.Nicholls A. Honig B. J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Crossref Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). The accessible surface area of the motifs was defined as the surface mapped out by the center of a probe of radius 1.4 Å rolled around the van der Waals surface of the protein. The ionic strength was 130 mm, and an ionic radius of 2.0 Å was used. The dielectric was 2 for the protein interior and 80 for the surrounding solvent. Charges were assigned to the ionized groups of Asp and Glu (−1) and Lys and Arg (+1). Histidine and termini residues were neutral. The salt dependence of the lateral association of two- and four-motif nucleation site recombinants was investigated using sedimentation equilibrium. Each of the four recombinants was tested alone, and in all cases the sedimentation equilibrium data were fitted well by a single ideal species model with an estimated molecular weight within 4% of the calculated sequence mass, demonstrating that each recombinant is stable and monomeric (data not shown). Experiments were then performed on the α20–21/β1–2 or α18–21/β1–4 heterodimers, in salt concentrations of 0.1–1.0 m. For all heterodimer samples, the data were described well by a model describing an ideal monomer-dimer reaction, enabling estimation of the association constant. Representative data are shown in Fig.1. The salt dependence of each association is shown in Fig. 2 and compared with previously published data on the association of whole spectrin subunits (13.Cole N. Ralston G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For both the two-motif and four-motif nucleation peptides, there is a marked weakening of the association with increasing salt that is substantially greater than the effect on whole erythroid spectrin subunits. The salt dependence of the lateral association is the same for the two-motif and four-motif heterodimers, although the strength of the association increases with the number of motifs. At all salt concentrations, the association of α18–21/β1–4 was about 3-fold stronger than that of α20–21/β1–2, consistent with the hypothesis that motifs other than those in the minimum nucleation site (α20–21/β1–2) make slight contributions to the strength of dimer assembly.Figure 2Salt dependence of heterodimer assembly.Binding affinities of nucleation site heterodimers α20–21/β1–2 (circles) and α18–21/β1–4 (triangles) are compared with data on intact spectrin subunits (squares) from Cole and Ralston (13.Cole N. Ralston G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Each point represents the mean natural logarithm of the equilibrium constant from n experiments (n < 5), with each equilibrium constant derived from the global fitting of an ideal monomer-dimer model to at least three data sets. The error bars represent the standard deviation where n > 1. The solid lines represent linear regression fits to the data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Many protein associations have been shown to involve the interaction of surfaces with complementary electrostatic potential (26.Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar, 27.McCoy A.L. Epa V.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 570-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Electrostatic potential is generated by the charge distribution of the macromolecule and depends on several factors including the location and magnitude of the charges, the solvent ionic strength, the dielectric constant of the macromolecule and the solvent, and the shape of the molecule, which defines the dielectric boundary and thus has an important effect on the electrostatic potential generated (26.Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). The electrostatic potential of a protein can be calculated using a numerical procedure to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, such as that contained in the programs Delphi (24.Gilson M.K. Sharp K.A. Honig B.H. J. Comput. Chem. 1988; 9: 327-335Crossref Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 25.Nicholls A. Honig B. J. Comput.

The weakening of lateral association between intact spectrin subunits and the nucleation site peptides with increasing ionic strength indicates that attractive electrostatic interactions between the subunits are likely to play an important role in lateral association. Identification of areas of complementary electrostatic potential on the surface of opposing motifs should help to identify the faces of the triple-helical motifs involved in subunit-subunit association. In the present study, models of four Drosophila motifs that are laterally paired in the dimer, α20 and β2 (in the dimer nucleation site) and α14 and β8 (11.Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M.

Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Although the nucleation motifs show reduced homology to the general spectrin motifs, and are closer to the motifs of α-actinin, alignment of the nucleation motif sequences with that of α14 shows that the homology of α20 and β2 to typical spectrin motifs is greater than that of the other nucleation motifs, α21 and β1 (10.Viel A.

https://openalex.org/W2153392210,"Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs), orphan members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, play a key role in the regulation of organogenesis, neurogenesis, and cellular differentiation during embryogenic development. COUP-TFs are also involved in the regulation of several genes that encode metabolic enzymes. Although COUP-TFs function as potent transcription repressors, there are at least three different molecular mechanisms of activation of gene expression by COUP-TFs. First, as we have previously shown, COUP-TF is required as an accessory factor for the complete induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription by glucocorticoids. This action is mediated by the binding of COUP-TF to the glucocorticoid accessory factor 1 (gAF1) and 3 (gAF3) elements in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene glucocorticoid response unit. In addition, COUP-TF1 binds to DNA elements in certain genes and transactivates directly. Finally, COUP-TF1 serves as a coactivator through DNA-bound hepatic nuclear factor 4. Here we show that the same region of COUP-TFI, located between amino acids 184 and 423, is involved in these three mechanisms of transactivation by COUP-TFI. Furthermore, we show that GRIP1 and SRC-1 potentiate the activity of COUP-TFI and that COUP-TFI associates with these coactivators in vivo using the same region required for transcription activation. Finally, overexpression of GRIP1 or SRC-1 does not convert COUP-TFI from a transcriptional repressor into a transcriptional activator in HeLa cells."

Hale L.P. Kaufman R.E. Genomics. 1998; 47: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as being directly 5′ of the locus encoding the humanCD7 gene on human chromosome 17 (2.Osada S.

The 3′ end of theK12 gene is about 5 kilobases upstream of the start of the human CD7 gene; both genes are transcribed in the same direction (1.Slentz-Kesler K.A. Hale L.P. Kaufman R.E. Genomics. 1998; 47: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The human K12 protein has been shown to be primarily expressed in spleen, prostate, testis, small intestine, and in peripheral blood leukocytes (1.Slentz-Kesler K.A. Hale L.P. Kaufman R.E. Genomics. 1998; 47: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Several features of the protein encoded by the K12 gene suggested to its discoverers that it might be cytokine-like. One feature is that K12 encodes a transmembrane protein, a trait that is shared with a number of growth factors including flt3 ligand (3.Lyman S.D. James L. Vanden Bos T. de Vries P. Brasel K.

The other notable feature of K12 is that the extracellular domain is similar in some, but not all, respects to an immunoglobulin-like domain. However, immunoglobulin-like domains in proteins are generally associated with receptors for cytokines (e.g. c-kit, KDR, FGFR), not the cytokines themselves. We have cloned the cognate of K12 to establish what its biological function might be, and discovered that K12 is a binding partner for CD7, the protein encoded by its neighboring gene. We have also cloned the mouse homologue of the K12 gene, found that it binds to mouse CD7, but not human CD7, and mapped its location near the mouseCD7 gene on mouse chromosome 11. These studies lay the groundwork for determining the activities as well as the interactions of CD7 and K12 in the immune system. The human K12 protein was cloned based on the published sequence (1.Slentz-Kesler K.A. Hale L.P. Kaufman R.E. Genomics. 1998; 47: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using reverse transcriptase-PCR1from mRNA prepared from the K562 erythroleukemia cell line. A mouse protein related to the human K12 sequence was identified as an EST (AA734402) from a proximal colon cDNA library. The EST was purchased and sequenced in its entirety. Encoded within the cDNA is a 212-amino acid transmembrane protein that shares 36% overall amino acid identity over its entire length with the human K12 protein. The mouse CD7 gene was cloned using PCR from an EL4.6 λ Zap library. All cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands to confirm no amino acid changes had been introduced by PCR into the published CD7 sequence (9.Yoshikawa K. Seto M. Ueda R. Obata Y. Fukatsu H. Segawa A. Takahashi T. Immunogenetics. 1993; 37: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 10.Yoshikawa K. Seto M. Ueda R. Obata Y. Aoki S. Takahashi T. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 159-161PubMed Google Scholar). Both the human and mouse K12-Fc fusion proteins were made by using Sew-PCR to attach the Fc portion of human IgG1 to that part of the gene encoding the extracellular domain of K12 (amino acids 1–145 in the human clone (1.Slentz-Kesler K.A. Hale L.P. Kaufman R.E. Genomics. 1998; 47: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), amino acids 1–160 in the mouse clone). The fusion proteins were transiently expressed in CV-1/EBNA cells and purified from the conditioned medium using protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The human peripheral blood T cell library cDNA expression library was constructed in the pDC409 vector using methods previously described (11.McMahan C.J. Slack J.L. Mosley B. Cosman D. Lupton S.D. Brunton L.L. Grubin C.E. Wignall J.M. Jenkins N.A. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Cannizzarro L.A. Benjamin D. Dower S.K. Spriggs M.K. Sims J.E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2821-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) and contains about 0.5 × 106 cDNA clones. Approximately 78% of clones in the library contain inserts, and the average insert size is about 1.2 kilobases. The human K12-Fc fusion protein was used to screen the library essentially as described previously (3.Lyman S.D. James L. Vanden Bos T. de Vries P. Brasel K. Gliniak B. Hollingsworth L.T. Picha K.S. McKenna H.J. Splett R.R. Fletcher F.F. Maraskovsky E. Farrah T. Foxworthe D. Williams D.E. Beckmann M.P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1157-1167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Two positive pools of approximately 1600 cDNAs each were identified. These positive pools were subdivided into smaller and smaller groups until individual cDNAs could be picked and tested. Once individual clones were identified, full double stranded sequencing of the clones was obtained. Primary human NK cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were radiolabeled overnight with 50 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine/methionine) (ProMix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radiolabeled cells were lysed with 1 ml of RIPA E lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Triton). 150 μl of lysate were incubated with 1 μg of human K12-Fc or a control Fc fusion protein for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitated proteins were collected onto Protein-A-Sepharose and loaded separated on a 4–20% Tris glycine gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) under denaturing, reducing conditions. The gel was fixed, treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed to XAR-5 film. COS-1 cells were transfected with full-length human CD7, mouse CD7, or vector only cDNA using DEAE dextran. Two days post-transfection the cells were assayed for the capacity to bind human K12-Fc or mouse K12-Fc as described previously (3.Lyman S.D. James L. Vanden Bos T. de Vries P. Brasel K. Gliniak B. Hollingsworth L.T. Picha K.S. McKenna H.J. Splett R.R. Fletcher F.F. Maraskovsky E. Farrah T. Foxworthe D. Williams D.E. Beckmann M.P.

The binding media (RPMI 1640, 1% FBS, 0.02% sodium azide, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.2) was modified to include 1 mmMnCl2. In some experiments, the transfected cells were incubated with zero, 20 μg/ml, or 2 mg/ml of ConA in BM/MM prior to binding with the Fc proteins. Following incubation for 30 min at room temperature and the continued presence of ConA, 1 μg/ml of either human K12-Fc or mouse K12-Fc was then added to the appropriate slides. Binding of the Fc protein was detected with 125I-mouse anti-human Fc antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (3.Lyman S.D. James L. Vanden Bos T. de Vries P. Brasel K. Gliniak B. Hollingsworth L.T. Picha K.S. McKenna H.J. Splett R.R. Fletcher F.F. Maraskovsky E. Farrah T. Foxworthe D. Williams D.E. Beckmann M.P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1157-1167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). After binding the iodinated antibody, the cells were washed and then the radioactivity quantified by Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The chromosomal location of the putative mouse K12 protein was determined using the Jackson Laboratory radiation hybrid panel mapping resource (12.Flaherty L. Herron B. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Human NK cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of normal human donors. Two hundred ml of heparinized blood were collected by venipuncture, then diluted 1:1 with room temperature PBS. Forty ml of blood solution was underlayered with 10 ml of Isolymph (Gallard-Schlesinger, Carle Place, NY), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation for 20 min at 2200 rpm. The interface containing the peripheral blood mononuclear cells was removed and diluted 1:1 in room temperature PBS. The samples were spun for 15 min at 1800 rpm. The pellets were then washed twice with PBS, spun 10 min at 1500 rpm, and resuspended in RPMI containing 5% FBS. Adherent cells were removed from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by incubation at less than 5 × 106/ml for 1 h at 37 °C in a T175 tissue culture flask in RPMI containing 5% FBS (supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 550 nml-arginine, 272 nml-asparagine, 13.6 nm folic acid, 10 mm Hepes, 20 μg/ml gentamycin, 50 nm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.210 mg/ml penicillin/streptamycin/glutamine). Further enrichment for NK cells then occurred by incubating the non-adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cell fractions with anti-CD3-biotin, anti-CD19-biotin, and anti-HLA-DR-biotin for 1 h at room temperature. The antibody-coated cells were then washed and incubated with 15 μl of streptavidin/Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) per 10 × 106 cells, with constant gentle agitation for 20 min at room temperature. The beads were then removed (with their attached cells) using a Dynal magnet. This negative selection process was repeated once more, resulting in a highly enriched NK cell population, as identified by FACS (75–92% CD56+, CD16+). Enriched NK cells were cultured in 6-well plates that had previously been coated with human and/or murine IgG, human CD7 mAb (clone 8118.1) or human K12-Fc at 2.5 μg/ml in PBS. The human NK cells were added at 2 × 106/ml in RMPI containing 5% FBS and incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were harvested by aspiration and washed in PBS containing 2% FBS and 0.1% azide, then resuspended in a FACS blocking buffer of PBS containing 10% FBS, 10% normal goat serum, 10% normal rabbit serum, and 0.1% azide. A maximum of 1 × 106 cells was incubated with the indicated mAb-fluorochrome conjugates for 1 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 100 μl. The cells were then washed in 2 ml of PBS containing 2% FBS and 0.1% azide and resuspended in 300 μl of PBS containing 2% FBS, 0.1% azide, and propidium iodide. Following resuspension, the cells were analyzed for fluorescent antibody binding on a FACScan flow cytometer using Cellquest Software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Antibodies directed against human CD7 were purchased from the following sources: clone M-T701, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA; clone 8118.1, Immunotech, Westbrook, ME; clone 4H9, Becton Dickinson; and clones RFT-2a, WM31, and CLB-3A1, Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ. Other antibodies used were: PE-conjugated anti-huCD69 (clone FN50), PE-conjugated anti-huCD25 (clone M-A251), PE-conjugated anti-huCD56 (clone B159), PE-conjugated IgG1 control, biotin-labeled anti-huCD3 (clone UCHT1), and biotin-labeled anti-huCD19 (clone B43), all from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), and PE-conjugated anti-huCD54 (clone 84H10), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-huCD16 (clone 3G8), biotin-labeled anti-huHLA-DR (clone B8.12.2) all from Immunotech (Westbrook, ME). Purified human IgG was obtained from Sigma, and purified mouse IgG was obtained from Caltag (Burlingame, CA). To identify with which molecule(s) the K12 protein might interact, we made a protein comprising the extracellular domain of human K12 (amino acids 1–145) fused in-frame with the Fc portion of human IgG1. The K12-Fc fusion protein was then used in flow cytometry experiments to determine which cell types might express on their cell surface a binding partner, or cognate, for the K12 protein. High levels of K12-Fc binding were detected on primary human T cells, either resting cells or cells treated with ConA (Fig. 1, panels A and B). Human NK cells also displayed high levels of K12-Fc binding (data not shown). In contrast, a number of other human and mouse cell lines failed to bind the K12-Fc protein (data not shown). Primary human NK cells were radiolabeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine for 4 h, then washed, lysed, and incubated with the K12-Fc fusion protein in an effort to precipitate a cognate protein. A single protein band of approximately 40 kDa was precipitated from the NK cells (Fig.2), suggesting that expression cloning might be a viable way to identify the K12 cognate. As a result of the T cell binding data, we screened a cDNA expression library made from human peripheral blood T cells that had been stimulated with PHA. Fifty pools of approximately 1600 cDNAs each were transfected into CV-1/EBNA cells, and 2 days later the transfected cells were tested for their capacity to bind the K12-Fc fusion protein. Two positive cDNA pools (numbers 85 and 129) were found that conferred on the CV-1/EBNA cells the capacity to bind K12-Fc. These cDNA pools were subsequently subdivided into smaller and smaller groups until single positive cDNA clones were isolated from each original pool. Sequencing of these cDNAs and comparison with public DNA data bases revealed that the cDNA from each positive pool encoded a full-length clone of the human CD7gene. The size of the protein precipitated from NK cell lysates (40 kDa) is consistent with the reported size of human CD7 (13.Haynes B.F. Immunol. Rev. 1981; 57: 127-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar,14.Aruffo A. Seed B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3313-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Six commercial antibodies to the extracellular domain of human CD7 were purchased and tested for their capacity to block the binding of K12-Fc to Jurkat cells, which express high levels of CD7. The antibodies blocked the binding of the K12-Fc fusion protein to the cells to varying degrees (Table I). Along these same lines, the human K12-Fc fusion protein blocked the binding of each member of the panel of monoclonal antibodies to CD7 (TableI).Table IBinding of a panel of anti-human CD7 monoclonal antibodies to Jurkat cells (a human T cell leukemia cell line), and the effect of K12-Fc on that bindingSection 1NonblockedPreblocked with HuK12FCPositive cellsMFIPositive cellsMFIPrimary antibodyAnti-CD7 clone M-T70178%2712%19Anti-CD7 clone 8118.178%278%24Anti-CD7 clone 4H988%384%19Anti-CD7 clone RFT-2a71%239%18Anti-CD7 clone WM3162%2211%18Anti-CD7 clone CLB-3A180%3063%24IgG isotype control3%18Section 2NonblockedPreblocked with various anti-CD7 AbsPositive cellsMFIPositive cellsMFIPrimary proteinHuK12-Fc98%956%16 - (clone M-T701)62%23 - (clone 8118.1)85%30 - (clone 4H9)80%27 - (clone RFT-2a)12%17 - (clone WM31)73%27 - (clone CLB-3A1)97%94 - IgG isotype controlControl Fc protein3.4%18IgG control3.6%17Section 1 shows the reductions in the percentage of positive cells and mean fluorescence intensity that occur when Jurkat cells are preincubated with human K12-Fc fusion protein prior to staining the cells with the antibodies.

Open table in a new tab Section 1 shows the reductions in the percentage of positive cells and mean fluorescence intensity that occur when Jurkat cells are preincubated with human K12-Fc fusion protein prior to staining the cells with the antibodies. Section 2 shows that, in a similar fashion, preincubation of the Jurkat cells with the six anti-human CD7 antibodies blocks the binding of human K12-Fc to the cells. The human K12 amino acid sequence was compared with amino acid translations of both public and proprietary EST data bases in an effort to identify a mouse homologue of K12. A single EST sequence was identified (AA734402) from a mouse proximal colon library that encoded a protein that appeared to be related to human K12. The EST was purchased and sequenced in its entirety. Encoded within the cDNA is a 212-amino acid transmembrane protein that overall shares 36% amino acid identity over its entire length with the human K12 protein (Fig.3). Focusing on just the extracellular regions, the amino acid identity between these putative human and mouse homologues is 44%. A second EST clone (971012tram001354ht) from a proprietary high throughput sequencing project contained essentially the same sequence as AA734402. One key difference was that this second cDNA contained an apparent intron after amino acid residue 134. This position corresponds to the position of an intron within amino acid 135 of the human K12 protein (15.Yoshikawa K. Seto M. Ueda R. Obata Y. Notake K. Yokochi T. Takahashi T. Immunogenetics. 1991; 33: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and supports the idea that the putative mouse K12 protein is either the true mouse homologue of the human protein, or is a closely related family member. In contrast to the human K12 protein, which has a single potential site for N-linked glycosylation, the putative mouse K12 protein contains four such sites, one of which is conserved in the location of the single glycosylation site in the human protein (Fig. 3). The position of two cysteine residues in the extracellular domains of human and mouse K12 also appear to be conserved. The sequence of the human K12 cytoplasmic domain contains a di-acidic signal (DXE) required for selective export from the endoplasmic reticulum (16.Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, the cytoplasmic domain of the putative mouse K12 protein does not contain this motif. A mouse K12-Fc fusion protein was constructed from the extracellular domain of the mouse gene and was tested for its capacity to bind to mouse lymph node T cells (Fig. 4,panels A and B). The mouse K12-Fc fusion protein specifically bound to the mouse lymph node T cells, although the intensity of the binding was not nearly as strong as seen with human K12-Fc on human peripheral blood T cells (Fig. 1, panels Aand B). The humanK12 gene is adjacent to the human CD7 gene on human chromosome 17 (1.Slentz-Kesler K.A. Hale L.P. Kaufman R.E. Genomics. 1998; 47: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The chromosomal location of the putative mouseK12 gene was determined by radiation hybrid mapping (12.Flaherty L. Herron B. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mouse K12 gene is localized just proximal to theCD7 locus on mouse chromosome 11 (17.Lee D.M. Watson M.L. Seldin M.F. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 289-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) with a LOD of 21.0 (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Thus, in mice, as in humans, the K12 gene is located near the CD7 gene. As noted above, human K12 and the putative mouse K12 proteins share only 44% amino acid identities in their extracellular domains. Similarly, human and mouse CD7 are 54% identical overall, but share only 49% identity in their extracellular domains (analyzed by the GCG GAP program). Thus, the percentage of amino acid sequence identity of the extracellular domains of mouse and human K12 proteins (44%) is very similar to that seen between the extracellular domains of mouse and human CD7 proteins (49%). To determine whether mouse K12-Fc binds to mouse CD7, PCR was used to clone the full-length mouseCD7 cDNA into an expression vector, which was then transfected into COS-1 cells. The transfected cells were then tested for their capacity to bind either human or mouse K12-Fc fusion proteins. The human K12-Fc protein binds strongly to cells transfected with the human CD7 cDNA, but does not bind to the surface of cells transfected with the mouse CD7 cDNA (Fig. 5). In contrast, mouse K12-Fc bound to transfected cells expressing the mouse CD7 protein, but was not capable of binding to human CD7 (Fig. 5). Thus, K12 and CD7 proteins bind each other in a species-specific manner. The human K12-Fc fusion protein was radiolabeled and used in binding experiments to determine its affinity for Jurkat cells (a human T cell leukemia cell line) or KG-1 cells (a human myelogenous leukemia cell line), both of which express CD7. In preliminary experiments, the binding affinity (K a) of human K12-Fc for human CD7 was estimated to be in the range of 1 × 108m−1 on both cell types (data not shown). Slentz-Kesler and co-workers (1.Slentz-Kesler K.A. Hale L.P. Kaufman R.E. Genomics. 1998; 47: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported that the human K12 protein was found both inside the cell and in medium conditioned by the cells, but that it was not seen on the cell surface. We examined the capacity of soluble mouse and human CD7-Fc fusion proteins (made by fusing the full-length extracellular domains of the proteins to the Fc region of human IgG1) to bind to cells transfected with either mouse or human full-length K12 cDNAs (Fig.6). Human CD7-Fc bound to the surface of cells transfected with a full-length human K12 cDNA, and mouse CD7-Fc bound to cells transfected with a full-length mouseK12 cDNA. No cross-species binding was observed. These experiments show that the K12 protein can be expressed on the cell surface, at least on transfected cells. However, using flow cytometry with human CD7-Fc we confirmed the finding (1.Slentz-Kesler K.A. Hale L.P. Kaufman R.E. Genomics. 1998; 47: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that K12 protein is not detectable on the surface of the K562 and MDA-231 cell lines, even though these cells express K12 mRNA (data not shown). The mouse K12-Fc fusion protein was tested for its capacity to inhibit the proliferation of BALB/c lymph node cells that had been stimulated with either ConA (Fig.7 A) or immobilized anti-TcR α/β (Fig. 7 B). The K12-Fc fusion protein inhibited ConA-induced proliferation of the cells in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on anti-TcR-induced cell proliferation. Since ConA is known to bind to a number of proteins, including CD7, the inhibition of ConA-induced T cell proliferation by K12-Fc could simply be due to K12 blocking of ConA binding to CD7. We therefore examined whether ConA could inhibit K12-Fc binding to COS-1 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding CD7. No blocking of either human K12-Fc (added at a concentration of 1 μg/ml) to human CD7 (Fig.8 A) or mouse K12-Fc (added at a concentration of 1 μg/ml) to mouse CD7 (Fig. 8 B) was seen when the cells were preincubated with 20 μg/ml ConA. When the amount of ConA in the medium was raised to 2 mg/ml, human K12-Fc binding was inhibited approximately 30% (Fig. 8 A) and mouse K12-Fc binding was inhibited about 90% (Fig. 8 B). Given that the concentration of ConA used in the cell proliferation experiment was 1 μg/ml, it seems unlikely that the inhibitory effect of K12-Fc on the proliferation of lymph node cells was due to the blocking of ConA binding to the cells.Figure 8The effect of ConA on the binding of human K12-Fc to human CD7 (panel A) or mouse K12-Fc to mouse CD7 (panel B). The cells were transfected with the indicated CD7 cDNAs (or vector only, designated pDC409), preincubated with the indicated concentrations of ConA, and then incubated with the indicated K12-Fc fusion protein (each at a concentration of 1 μg/ml) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The capacity of K12 to induce human NK cell activation through its interaction with CD7 was analyzed by examining the expression of surface molecules associated with cellular activation. Flow cytometric analysis showed that resting NK cells cultured with immobilized human and mouse IgG expressed very low levels of CD25, CD69, and the adhesion molecule, CD54. After overnight culture with immobilized anti-CD7, increases in both CD25 and CD54 expression on NK cells were observed (Table II). Overnight culture of NK cells with immobilized human K12-Fc resulted in increases in CD25, CD69, and CD54 expression (Table II). The increase in surface molecule expression induced by K12-Fc-mediated cross-linking of CD7 ranged between 4–6-fold over control, and the increase induced by anti-CD7 mAbs ranged between 2–4-fold over control. The activity of the K12-Fc and the anti-CD7 mAbs on NK cells are roughly equivalent on a molar basis at the concentrations tested. CD7 cross-linking also increased CD69 expression in some experiments (data not shown). Addition of anti-CD7 antibodies or K12-Fc in solution (not immobilized) to NK cultures did not result in enhancement of cell surface molecule expression (data not shown).Table IIEffect of CD7 cross-linking on human NK cell activation as determined by flow cytometryCulture conditionaNK cells were cultured in the presence of plate-bound molecules listed under culture condition; the huCD7 mAb was clone 8118.1.

Expression of either the individual N- or C-terminal domain in a baculovirus expression system did not lead to glibenclamide binding activity, although studies with green fluorescent protein fusion proteins showed that both half-molecules were inserted into the plasma membrane. However, significant glibenclamide binding activity was observed when the half-molecules were co-expressed (even when NBD2 was deleted from the C-terminal half-molecule). Simultaneous expression of Kir6.2 resulted in enhanced glibenclamide binding activity. We conclude that the glibenclamide-binding site includes amino acid residues from both halves of the molecule, that there is strong interaction between different regions of SUR1, that NBD2 is not essential for glibenclamide binding, and that interactions between Kir6.2 and SUR1 participate in ATP-sensitive potassium channel assembly. Investigation of NBD1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein distribution inside insect cells expressing C-terminal halves of SUR1 demonstrated strong interaction between NBD1 and NBD2. We also expressed and purified NBD1 from Escherichia coli. Purified NBD1 was found to exist as a tetramer indicating strong homomeric attractions and a possible role for NBD1 in SUR1 assembly. We have investigated protein interactions involved in pancreatic β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel assembly. These channels, which are of key importance for control of insulin release, are a hetero-oligomeric complex of pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) subunits with two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2).

ATP-sensitive potassium ATP-binding cassette nucleotide-binding domain(s) sulfonylurea receptor transmembrane green fluorescent protein A central component of transmembrane signaling in the pancreatic β-cell is the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP)1 channel that couples changes in plasma glucose concentration to insulin secretion and is also the target for the sulfonylurea drugs used to treat type I diabetes (1.Ashcroft S.J.H.

Petersen O.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Metabolic regulation of KATP channels in response to an elevation of blood glucose is mediated by an increased rate of metabolism of the sugar within the β-cell and a consequent increase in intracellular [ATP]/[ADP] ratio; ATP blocks the channels whereas MgADP activates them. Closure of KATP channels in response to sulfonylureas and opening of the channels by diazoxide involves direct binding of the drugs to the channel. The β-cell KATP channel contains two subunits, Kir6.2, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, and SUR1, which contains the high affinity sulfonylurea-binding site and whose presence in the complex is essential for regulated channel activity (4.Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P. Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 5.Inagaki N.

Channel closure is thought to be mediated by effects of ATP on Kir6.2 (6.Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) whereas SUR1 endows the KATP channel with sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of sulfonylureas and the stimulatory effects of MgADP and potassium channel openers (7.Nichols C.

Studies on fusion constructs with fixed SUR1:Kir6.2 ratios suggest that the native channel has a (SUR1∼Kir6.2)4 stoichiometry (9.Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Seino S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10.Clement J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). A topographical model for SUR1 based on hydrophobicity plots proposes that SUR1 contains two tandem repeats of six transmembrane helices, each set followed by a large cytosolic loop, plus an additional N-terminal hydrophobic region containing five transmembrane helices (11.Tusnady G.E. Bakos E. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). SUR1 is classified as a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, and the two cytosolic loops, each containing a Walker A and Walker B motif (12.Walker J. Saraste M. Runswick M. Gah N. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4234) Google Scholar), are suggested to function as nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). Disruption of either NBD results in the unregulated insulin secretion found in hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinaemia of infants (13.Thomas P.M. Cote G.J. Wohllk N. Haddad B. Mathew P.M. Rabl W.

Genet. 1996; 59: 510-518PubMed Google Scholar). Only limited information is available on the regions of SUR1 and Kir6.2 important for channel assembly and ligand binding. Photoaffinity labeling of both SUR1 and Kir6.2 by radioactive sulfonylurea provided evidence for close association between the two channel subunits (10.Clement J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), and a direct physical association was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (15.Lorenz E. Alekseev A.E. Krapivinsky G.B. Carrasco A.J. Clapham D.E. Terzic A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The proximal C terminus of Kir6.2 has been shown to be important for interaction with SUR1 (16.Giblin J.P. Leaney J.L. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22652-22659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Such an association has been suggested to facilitate insertion of channel-containing vesicles into the plasma membrane or to stabilize channels once inserted into the plasma membrane (17.Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3369-3374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). There is evidence that both N and C termini of Kir6.2 cooperate to form the ATP-binding site (18.Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Studies on SUR1-SUR2A chimeras have shown that the C-terminal set of transmembrane domains of SUR1 is implicated in binding of sulfonylureas (19.Ashfield R. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and that the first five transmembrane (TM) domains and the C terminus specify the spontaneous bursting pattern and sensitivity to inhibition by ATP, respectively (20.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that functional KATP channels can be expressed in insect cells using baculovirus (21.Mikhailov M.V. Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used the baculovirus system to express, both independently and in combination, the N- and C-proximal halves of SUR1, containing NBD1 and NBD2, respectively. We showed that neither half-molecule alone gave rise to detectable glibenclamide binding activity although using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged constructs we were able to show that both half-molecules were targeted to the plasma membrane. Co-expression of both half-molecules, however, resulted in the appearance of significant glibenclamide binding activity, which was further increased by the simultaneous expression of Kir6.2. Deletion of the second NBD from the C-proximal half did not prevent assembly of the two halves to form a glibenclamide-binding site. These data indicate that there are strong interactions between two different regions of SUR1 that make possible self-association. Using GFP-tagged NBD1 we were able to provide evidence that such interactions occur between NBD1 and NBD2. We also demonstrated that NBD1 forms a tetramer, suggesting that homomeric interactions of this domain may be important in channel assembly. Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells were propagated at 28 °C in TC100 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were infected by each recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10, and expressed products were analyzed 2 days after infection. For virus stocks, Sf9 cells were infected by each recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1, and the supernatant was collected 5 days later. Penta-His antibody (QIAGEN) was used in Western blots for analysis of recombinant protein expression. We constructed transfer vectors containing DNA fragments encoding rat SUR1 (4.Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P. Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar) and mouse Kir6.2 (22.Sakura H. Ämmälä C. Smith P.A. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) under control of the polyhedron promoter in the pAcYM1 vector. We designed a transfer vector for expression of the N-terminal half of SUR1 (pAcCas1) containing a SUR1 sequence (amino acids 1–55), an adapter containingBamHI and NotI sites, and sequences encoding a C-terminal His6 tag. The GFP gene (23.Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Gene. 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar) was inserted at theNotI site (by NotI–EagI) to create pAcCas1G to obtain a GFP fusion protein. pAcNSUR1 and pAcNSUR1G transfer vectors were obtained by cloning a polymerase chain reaction copy of the SUR1 amino acid 55–1042 sequence in pAcCas1 and pAcCas1G, respectively. For cloning of the C-terminal part of SUR1 we constructed a transfer vector (pAcCas2) containing a SUR1 leader sequence (amino acids 1–27), NotI restriction sites for cloning, and a C-terminal His6 tag. The GFP gene was also incorporated in this vector to give pACas2G so that GFP fusion proteins were obtained. A polymerase chain reaction product coding for amino acids 1042–1580 of SUR1 was cloned in both vectors to obtain pAcCSUR1 and pAcCSUR1G transfer vectors. A truncated version of the C-terminal part of SUR1 without NBD2 (amino acids 1042–1299) was cloned in pAcCas2 to obtain pAcCSUR1tr transfer vector. NBD1 (amino acids 616–982) and NBD2 (amino acids 1317–1580) were cloned in the BamHI site of pAcYM1 byBglII digestion from a polymerase chain reaction product providing a C-terminal His6 tag and an additionalBamHI site for cloning. The GFP gene was inserted in that site to obtain pAcNBD1G and pAcNBD2G transfer vectors. Transfer vectors were used for co-transfection of Sf9 cells together withAutographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV PAK6) (24.King L. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman & Hall, London1992Crossref Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses AcNPVNSUR1, AcNPVNSUR1G, AcNPVCSUR2, AcNPVCSUR1, AcNPVCSUR1tr, AcNPVNBD1G, and AcNPVNBD2G were obtained by using the corresponding transfer vectors, plaque purified three times, and used for infection of Sf9 cells. The same fragment of NBD1 was inserted in the BamHI site of pET24d (Novagen) to obtain expression of His-tagged NBD1 in Escherichia coli. Sf9 cells resuspended at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in TC100 were incubated at room temperature for 90 min with [3H]glibenclamide (10 nm) and test substances in a final volume of 400 μl. The incubation was stopped by rapid separation on Whatman GF/C filters previously soaked in TC100 for 30 min. Filters were washed, and specific binding was determined as described previously (25.Niki I. Kelly R.P. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1989; 415: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). His-tagged NBD1 was expressed inE. coli according to the Novagen manual. Cells were disrupted by ultrasonication, and cleared lysate was used for nickel affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA agarose, QIAGEN) according to the supplier's manual. After elution from Ni-NTA agarose with 200 mm imidazole in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) the solution was changed to buffer A using a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gel filtration on a HiLoad 16/60, Superdex 200 pg column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to obtain highly purified protein. Protein concentration was measured by UV adsorption (predicted absorption of 0.1% NBD1 at 278 nm is 0.812 mg−1cm−1) on a U2010 spectrophotometer (Hitachi). Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to characterize the oligomerization of NBD1. 0.5 ml of purified NBD1 (1 mg/ml) was loaded on a linear 5–30% sucrose gradient in buffer A and centrifuged (20,000 rpm for 16 h) using a TST 41.14 rotor in a Centricon T-1055 ultracentrifuge. 1-ml fractions were collected, and protein concentration was measured by UV adsorption. Bovine serum albumin (M r 66,000), β-galactosidase (M r 116,000), and urease (M r 272,000) were centrifuged under the same condition and used for calibration. GFP-expressing insect cells were grown on coverslips and viewed with a LEITZ DMIRB fluorescent microscope (Leica Microscopie und Systeme GmbH). Ionvision III software was used for analyzing images. Fig.1 illustrates the predicted topology of SUR1 and the regions of SUR1 expressed by vectors used in this study. The N-proximal half-molecule, designated NSUR1, contained the first two sets of putative TM domains, NBD1 and the first TM helix of the second 6-TM set. A variant of this construct, designated NSUR1G, had a C-terminal GFP tag. The C-proximal half-molecule, designated CSUR1, contained the last five putative TM helices and NBD2 and had an artificial leader sequence to facilitate membrane insertion. The leader sequence was identical to that of SUR1 itself. A truncated variant, CSUR1tr, lacked NBD2. An N-terminal GFP tag and leader sequence were added to CSUR1 to produce CSUR1G. We also prepared the two nucleotide-binding domains, NBD1 and NBD2, with C-terminal GFP tags (NBD1G and NBDG). All recombinant proteins were designed to contain a His6 tag. Fig. 2 shows Western blots (using Penta-His antibody) of Sf9 insect cells expressing the recombinant proteins. The positions of the main bands on the Western blot correspond to those predicted from amino acid sequences.Figure 2Western blot of lysed Sf9 insect cells expressing SUR1 and SUR1 fragments with anti-His6antisera.

Fluorescence microscopy of Sf9 cells expressing recombinant proteins is shown in Fig. 3. GFP itself (Fig. 3 A) was randomly distributed inside the insect cell and did not bind to the plasma membrane. Fig. 3 Bshows that NBD1G was also randomly distributed inside the insect cell. In contrast to NBD1G, NBD2G forms inclusion bodies (Fig.3 C). Fig. 3, D and E show that the N- and C-terminal halves of SUR1 tagged with GFP were both expressed at the plasma membrane of Sf9 insect cells infected with the corresponding recombinant baculovirus. These data show that individual regions of SUR1 possess plasma membrane insertion abilities. NBD1 expressed in Sf9 cells as a GFP fusion protein was distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 3 B). After co-expression of NBD1G and the C-terminal half-molecule CSUR1, NBD1G was found mostly near the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 F). This effect disappeared after deletion of NBD2 from the C-terminal part of SUR1, i.e. when NBD1G was co-expressed with CSUR1tr (Fig. 3 G). These data indicate strong interaction between NBD1 and NBD2. Co-expression of NBD1G with Kir6.2 did not localize NBD1G to the plasma membrane (Fig.3 H) suggesting a lack of strong interactions between Kir6.2 and NBD1. As we have previously demonstrated (21.Mikhailov M.V. Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), Sf9 cells infected with SUR1 express glibenclamide binding activity (Fig. 4). The specific binding activity at 10 nm [3H]glibenclamide amounted to approximately 2.5 × 106 binding sites per cell, more than 1000-fold greater than the density of sulfonylurea-binding sites in pancreatic β-cells. When Sf9 cells expressed either the N-terminal SUR1 half-molecule, NSUR1, or the C-terminal half-molecule, CSUR1, glibenclamide binding was not significantly greater than in cells infected with the parent baculovirus. However, in cells co-infected with both NSUR1 and CSUR1 a substantial increase of glibenclamide binding activity was demonstrated. There was no significant decrease in observed glibenclamide binding activity in cells co-infected with NSUR1 and CSUR1tr indicating that NBD2 is not essential for assembly of SUR1 and formation of the glibenclamide-binding site(s). Co-expression of Kir6.2 with NSUR1 and CSUR1 (as well as with NSUR1 and CSUR1tr) increased the density of glibenclamide-binding sites suggesting that Kir6.2 facilitates SUR1 assembly. The studies described above using GFP-tagged NBD1 showed that NBD1 can take part in KATP channel assembly. We found that the expression level of NBD1 in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system was too low for large scale NBD1 purification. Therefore we cloned NBD1 inE. coli as a His-tagged protein. A high expression level of NBD1 was observed, and after purification by nickel affinity chromatography and gel filtration we obtained highly purified NBD1 protein, as illustrated in Fig.5 A. From gel filtration under non-denaturing conditions, we found that the purified NBD1 exists primarily in an oligomeric form (Fig. 5 B). To verify the exact number of molecules in the complex we carried out analytical ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient of the protein obtained from the main peak. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the mobility of NBD1 corresponds to a M r of 167,000. Because the predicted M r of NBD1 is 41,000 we conclude that under non-denaturing conditions NBD1 exists as a tetramer. Many ABC transporters contain four structural domains that include two sets of TM regions and two cytosolic NBDs (26.Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In prokaryotic ABC transporters the TM and NBD regions are often separate polypeptides. Moreover some ABC proteins contain only a single set of six TM helices and one NBD. It has been suggested, therefore, that many members of the ABC superfamily have evolved by duplication or fusion of previously autonomous half-molecules (27.Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3350) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein consists of two homologous halves, each composed of 6 putative TM helices and an NBD. Either half-molecule, when expressed in Sf9 cells, exhibited ATPase activity that was not stimulated by drugs (28.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, drug stimulation of ATPase activity was present following co-expression of both halves of P-glycoprotein, indicating the ability of the two fragments to associate and couple ATPase activity to drug binding. The predicted topology of SUR1 and other ABC transporters such as the multidrug resistance protein is not consistent with such a symmetrical arrangement because of the large additional N-terminal extension containing several additional TM segments. Nevertheless when the multidrug resistance protein was divided into two, each half-molecule expressed in Sf9 cells was able to integrate into the plasma membrane and associate to form a functional transporter (29.Gao M. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27782-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have now applied such a complementation approach to SUR1. We divided SUR1 at position Pro-1042 into two halves. These N- and C-terminal half-molecules were expressed separately and together in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus system that we have previously applied to the expression of active KATP channels (21.Mikhailov M.V. Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both half-molecules, when expressed in Sf9 cells as GFP-tagged proteins, were concentrated at the plasma membrane. However, glibenclamide binding activity could not be detected in cells expressing either half-molecule. When the two half-molecules were co-expressed, however, substantial glibenclamide binding activity was found. These data indicate that the two halves of SUR1 interact and that the glibenclamide-binding site requires residues from both halves of the molecule. This latter conclusion is consistent with the findings from a study of chimeric SURs, which concluded that glibenclamide interacts with two high affinity sites on SUR1 (19.Ashfield R. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We can exclude NBD2 from a significant contribution to the glibenclamide-binding site(s), because co-expression of NSUR1 with the truncated C-terminal half-molecule lacking NBD2 also resulted in expression of glibenclamide binding activity. This suggests interaction between the TM domains of the C-terminal half of SUR1 with either cytosolic or TM domains in the N-terminal half-molecule. The increased glibenclamide binding observed when Kir6.2 was co-expressed with NSUR1 and CSUR1 or CSUR1tr is indicative of interaction between SUR1 half-molecules and Kir6.2 to facilitate SUR1 assembly. There is evidence that the C-terminal region of Kir6.2 may be important in this interaction (16.Giblin J.P. Leaney J.L. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22652-22659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The density of glibenclamide-binding sites in cells co-expressing the two half-molecules was approximately 25% of that in cells expressing full-length SUR1. This may indicate that the binding activity of the reconstituted protein is less than that of the intact molecule. However, it is more likely to be attributable to heterogeneity of the infected cell population. We cannot determine the stoichiometry with which the half-molecules are expressed in individual cells; therefore the lower glibenclamide binding may reflect the proportion of half-molecules able to heterodimerize. NBD1 is the major cytosolic domain in NSUR1. It therefore seemed possible that NBD1 interacted with CSUR1 to facilitate formation of functional SUR1. The GFP fusion protein NBD1G was used to test this possibility. NBD1G was distributed throughout the cell when expressed alone. However, when co-expressed with CSUR1 there was significant localization of NBD1G to the plasma membrane. Because this localization was not observed in cells co-expressing CSUR1tr we conclude that there is also interaction between NBD1 and NBD2 in assembly of SUR1. In cells co-expressing Kir6.2 and NBD1G there was no detectable membrane localization of NBD1G, suggesting that NBD1 does not strongly interact with Kir6.2. When purified NBD1 was studied in vitro this protein domain was found to exist as a tetramer. Because four SUR1 molecules are believed to be present in the active KATP channel this observation suggests that homomeric NBD1 interactions may play a key role in channel assembly. The complementation approach described here has been applied to several membrane proteins. For example, when C- and N-terminal halves of the GLUT1 glucose transporter were co-expressed in Sf9 cells, a ligand-binding site was formed (30.Cope D.L. Holman G.D. Baldwin S.A. Wolstenholme A.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fragments of the human red cell anion exchanger (band 3; AE1) that individually were not competent for transport, were able to assemble to form a functional anion transporter when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes (31.Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32.Wang L. Groves J.D. Mawby W.J. Tanner M.J. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) receptors have also been reconstituted from co-expressed N- and C-terminal domains. These studies have been interpreted in terms of a two-stage model for the process whereby polytopic integral membrane proteins attain their folded structure within the membrane (35.Popot J.L. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4031-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, transmembrane α-helixes fold independently on insertion into the membrane where they are stabilized by main chain hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with the lipid bilayer. Subsequently these independent α-helical domains associate to form the final structure without significant secondary structure rearrangement. Our results with SUR1 are consistent with such a model."

In the present study, we tried to identify the interaction site of the Ca2+-bound form of S-modulin to Rk. First, we mapped roughly the interaction regions by using partial peptides of S-modulin. The result suggested that a specific region near the amino terminus is the interaction site of S-modulin. We then identified the essential amino acid residues in this region by using S-modulin mutant proteins: four amino acid residues (Phe22, Glu26, Phe55, and Thr92) were suggested to interact with Rk. These residues are located in a small closed pocket in the Ca2+-free, inactive form of S-modulin, but exposed to the surface of the molecule in the Ca2+-bound, active form of S-modulin. Two additional amino acid residues (Tyr108 and Arg150) were found to be crucial for the Ca2+-dependent conformational changes of S-modulin.

Neurobiology and Clinical Aspects of the Outer Retina. Chapman & Hall, London1995: 105-131Crossref Google Scholar, 2.Pugh Jr., E.N. Nikonov S. Lamb T.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The decrease in the cGMP concentration induces closure of the cGMP-gated cation channel in the plasma membrane and suppression of the inward current. The resultant hyperpolarization is the signal of light detection by a rod. A rod not only detects light but also adapts to environmental light conditions by changing both the operating range and the light sensitivity (2.Pugh Jr., E.N. Nikonov S. Lamb T.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These modulations are attained by changes in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (3.Matthews H.R. Murphy R.L.W. Fain G.L. Lamb T.D. Nature. 1988; 334: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 4.Nakatani K. Yau K.-W. Nature. 1988; 334: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the dark, the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in a rod is in a range of several hundred nanomolar (5.McCarthy S.T. Younger J.P. Owen W.G. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 1991-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6.Sampath A.P. Matthews H.R. Cornwall M.C. Fain G.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Under this condition, the photoresponse saturates at low levels of light and the light sensitivity is high. In the light, the Ca2+ concentration decreases to ∼0–30 nm under a very bright light (5.McCarthy S.T. Younger J.P. Owen W.G. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 1991-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6.Sampath A.P. Matthews H.R. Cornwall M.C. Fain G.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Under light-adapted conditions, the operating range shifts to a brighter region and the light-sensitivity decreases. S-modulin in the frog (7.Kawamura S. Murakami M. Nature. 1991; 349: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8.Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), or its bovine homologue, recoverin (9.Dizhoor A, M. Ray S. Kumar S. Niemi G. Spencer M. Brolley D. Walsh K.A. Philippov P.P. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Science. 1991; 251: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), is an EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein found in rod photoreceptors. So far, S-modulin is thought to be one of the proteins which modulate the light sensitivity of a rod in a Ca2+-dependent manner. S-modulin was first found as a protein that increases the efficiency of light activation of the cGMP phosphodiesterase at high Ca2+ concentrations (7.Kawamura S. Murakami M. Nature. 1991; 349: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and later this regulation was found to be mediated by inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation (8.Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase (Rk) is the first quenching mechanism of R* (10.Miller J.L. Fox D.A. Litman B.J.

At high Ca2+concentrations in the dark, S-modulin binds two Ca2+ (15.Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. Mckay D.B.

The Ca2+-bound form of S-modulin binds to Rk and inhibits its activity (17.Gorodovikova E.N. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18.Chen C.-K.

(Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Since rhodopsin phosphorylation is very likely the reaction that determines the lifetime of R*, we can expect that its inhibition by S-modulin lengthens the lifetime of R* (8.Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 20.Whitlock G.G. Lamb T.D. Neuron. 1999; 23: 337-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in a rod in the dark at high Ca2+ concentrations. In the light, the Ca2+concentration decreases so that the rhodopsin phosphorylation is not inhibited by S-modulin. As a result, the lifetime of R* decreases, which probably sets the onset of the recovery earlier and decreases the magnitude of a response to a light flash. In other words, the regulation of the lifetime of R* by S-modulin is a likely mechanism of the light-sensitivity control in a rod (2.Pugh Jr., E.N. Nikonov S. Lamb T.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8.Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Actually, the rising phase of a flash response is not affected by the intensity of the background light but the onset of the recovery starts earlier as the intensity increases (2.Pugh Jr., E.N. Nikonov S. Lamb T.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although the Ca2+-bound form of S-modulin has been shown to bind to Rk (17.Gorodovikova E.N. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18.Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the interaction site has not been known yet. In the present study, we tried to identify the amino acid residues in S-modulin responsible for the interaction with Rk. For this purpose, first we mapped roughly the regions necessary for the interaction by using S-modulin partial peptides, and based on the result obtained, we expressed S-modulin mutant proteins to identify the amino acid residues responsible for the interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis was done according to the method of Matsuda et al. (21.Matsuda S. Hisatomi O. Ishino T. Kobayashi Y. Tokunaga F. J. Boil. Chem. 1998; 273: 20223-20227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with some modification. We used following oligonucleotides and their complementary oligonucleotides as primers for site-directed mutagenesis: 5′-GGAGGAGGCGCAGCTGAACACC-3′ for L16A, 5′-GCAGCTGAACGCCAAATTTACCCAGG-3′ for T20A, 5′-CTGAACACCAAAGCTACCCAGGAGG-3′ for F22A, 5′-CCCAGGAGGCACTGTGCACCTGGTAC-3′ for E26A, 5′-GAACTGTGCACCGCGTACCAGTCTTTC-3′ for W30A, 5′-GCATTTACTCCAAGGCCTTTCCAGAC-3′ for F55A, 5′-CTCCAAGTTCGCTCCAGACGCTG-3′ for F56A, 5′-GGAATACATGATAGCGGCACATATGACC-3′ for L89A, 5′-CGCTACATATGGCCTCATCTGGCAAAG-3′ for T92A, 5′-CCTCATCTGGCGCAGCCAACCAGAAAC-3′ for K96A, 5′-GCCAACCAGGCACTGGAGTGGG-3′ for K100A, 5′-GCCTTCTGTTTAGCCGATGTGGATGG-3′ for Y108A, 5′-CAGAGAAGGCGACAAATAAAATATGGGTCTAC-3′ for R150A, 5′-CAGAGAAGAGGACAAATAAAGCATGGGTCTAC-3′ for I154A, and 5′-CAAGAACAAAGAAGCTTTGCGTCTAATCC-3′ for I181A. A DNA fragment encoding each mutant was inserted between the NcoI andXhoI site of a pET-16b (Novagen) plasmid vector. The sequence of the insert was checked before transfection toEscherichia coli (BL21DE3) by using ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). The cell was co-transfected with pBB131, an expression vector of N-myristoyltransferase, kindly provided by Prof. Jeffrey I. Gordon (22.Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Myristoylated S-modulin and its mutant proteins were expressed according to the method of Hisatomi et al. (23.Hisatomi O. Ishino T. Matsuda S. Yamaguchi K. Kobayashi Y. Kawamura S. Tokunaga F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Expressed proteins were purified according to the method of Sato and Kawamura (19.Sato N. Kawamura S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After the purification, each protein was concentrated and the buffer solution was replaced with a potassium-gluconate buffer (K-gluconate buffer: 115 mm potassium-gluconate, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The purified fractions contained >98% of S-modulin or its mutant judging from the Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and >95% S-modulin was myristoylated judging from our reversed-phase column chromatography. The sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Peptides were designed as described under “Results and Discussion,” and purchased from Sawady Technology, Tokyo. The purity of a peptide was >93%. ROS membranes of a frog (Rana catesbeiana) were isolated as described previously (19.Sato N. Kawamura S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, ROSs were brushed off the retinas into the K-gluconate buffer and fragmented. Then, ROS membranes were washed twice with the K-gluconate buffer and stored overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm EGTA to eliminate endogenous S-modulin. The next day, the membranes were washed twice with the K-gluconate buffer and suspended in the same buffer so that the concentration of rhodopsin was 50 μm. The sample was aliquoted and stored at −20 °C until use. All of these procedures were done in complete darkness with the aid of an infrared image converter (NVR 2015, NEC). S-modulin, its mutant or a partial peptide of S-modulin was mixed with ROS membranes in complete darkness. The free Ca2+ concentration in the mixture was adjusted by adding the K-gluconate buffer supplemented with 5 mmCaCl2 or 10 mm EGTA. Then, the mixture was placed on ice and irradiated with a 100-watt tungsten-halogen lamp for 1 min (∼100% bleach), and incubated at room temperature for 9 min so that the reactions in the mixture were quasi-equilibrated. The phosphorylation reaction was started by mixing 15 μl of the mixture with 10 μl of the K-gluconate buffer containing 0.25 mm[γ-32P]ATP (24 MBq/μmol) and 1.25 mm GTP. The resultant reaction mixture contained 10 μm rhodopsin, 5 μm expressed protein or 2 mm peptide, 0.1 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm GTP. The concentration of the peptides (2 mm) was decided by measuring the dose-effect relation and it was a saturating concentration of the effective peptides. In a measurement using a peptide, 0.002% (w/v) Tween 80 was always added to the sample, because some of the peptides were not freely soluble. The addition of this detergent caused a negligible effect on rhodopsin phosphorylation: 5 ∼ 10% decrease of the phosphorylation was observed in a control experiment using S-modulin. After 2 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by adding 150 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min), the precipitate was washed with 500 μl of the K-gluconate buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of32P incorporated into rhodopsin was quantified by using an image analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Film). Ca2+ binding assay was done according to the method of Matsuda et al.(21.Matsuda S. Hisatomi O. Ishino T. Kobayashi Y. Tokunaga F. J. Boil. Chem. 1998; 273: 20223-20227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, 0.2–0.4 ml of S-modulin or its mutant protein solution was dialyzed against a ∼100 times excess volume of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 3 h × 6 times to remove EGTA and Ca2+. Then each protein solution (20 μm protein) was mixed with an equal volume of buffer A supplemented with 0.2 mm45CaCl2(21.5 kBq/ml) in a Microcon-10 concentrator (Amicon). The membrane of the concentrator had been extensively washed by Milli-Q water. Then the sample was centrifuged and the pass-through was collected, and 15 μl of it was blotted on a laminated paper (Advantec MFS). As a control, 0.2 mm45CaCl2 solution (21.5 kBq/ml) mixed with an equal volume of buffer A was also blotted. The paper was dried, and the 45Ca activity was quantified by using an image analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Film). The quantity of Ca2+ bound to the protein was calculated from the difference between the 45Ca activity of the pass-through and that of the control. An expressed protein in the K-gluconate buffer (100 μm protein, 20 μl) was diluted with 180 μl of buffer B (20 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) supplemented with 233 μm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA, and loaded to an optical cell of 1-mm light path. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco 720W recording spectrophotometer. All scans were recorded at a bandwidth of 1 nm, scan speed of 10 nm/min, response time of 8 s, and at 20 ± 0.1 °C. CD spectrum of each sample was measured 6 times and averaged. First, we tried to map roughly the region(s) necessary for the inhibition of Rk by using partial peptides of S-modulin. The entire amino acid sequence of S-modulin was divided into 11 portions (Fig. 1), and a peptide corresponding to each portion was synthesized. We determined the length of a peptide so that each peptide consisted of ∼20 amino acid residues as well as α-helices in the Ca2+-bound form of bovine S-modulin (recoverin; Ref. 24.Ames J.B. Isima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) were almost intact. Rat/chicken VILIP1, one of the S-modulin family protein, lacks 10 amino acid residues at the COOH terminus (Val192-His201), but yet it does inhibit Rk as S-modulin does (25.De Castro E. Nef S. Fiumelli H. Lenz S.E. Kawamura S. Nef P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This fact indicates that this portion does not participate in the interaction with Rk. For this reason we eliminated this portion in the following study. On each peptide, we examined whether it inhibits rhodopsin phosphorylation by itself (Fig. 2). If such a peptide is present, this peptide probably appears on the surface of the Ca2+-bound form of S-modulin to interact with Rk. Fig. 2 summarizes the effects of the synthesized peptides on rhodopsin phosphorylation. Without S-modulin (Fig. 2, no S-mod), rhodopsin was phosphorylated independently on the Ca2+concentration, while with S-modulin present (Fig. 2, S-mod), rhodopsin phosphorylation was inhibited at a high Ca2+concentration (200 μm, filled bar). Namely, at high Ca2+ concentrations, S-modulin binds Ca2+and the Ca2+-bound form of S-modulin binds to RK to inhibit its activity. As can be seen in the figure, peptides 2, 5, 6, and 9 inhibited the phosphorylation independently on the Ca2+concentration and the other peptides did not show pronounced effects on the phosphorylation. These results suggested that the regions corresponding to peptides 2, 5, 6, and 9 are the site for the interaction with Rk. The half-effective peptide concentrations were ∼0.5 mm (peptide 2) and <0.25 mm (peptides 5, 6, and 9). At a saturating concentration (2 mm), peptides 5, 6, and 9 were almost as effective as the wild-type S-modulin but the effect of the peptide 2 did not seem to be complete (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 illustrates the localization of peptides 2, 5, 6, and 9 in a three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+-free form (A; Ref. 26.Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and the Ca2+-bound form (B; Ref. 24.Ames J.B. Isima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) of bovine S-modulin. As can be seen in the figure, the localization of the four peptides does not seem to be well organized in the Ca2+-free form, but in the Ca2+-bound form, three of the peptides (peptides 2, 5, and 6) come close to each other and form a cluster. Because these peptides by themselves have the ability to inhibit rhodopsin phosphorylation (Fig. 2), it is likely that this is a region of S-modulin to interact with Rk. Although peptide 9 inhibited rhodopsin phosphorylation as the other three did, this peptide seems to be different from the others. Peptide 9 does not participate in the formation of the cluster in the Ca2+-bound form (see below). In the next step, we tried to identify the amino acid residues responsible for the interaction with Rk by using S-modulin mutant proteins. First, we decided amino acid residues to be mutated based on the criteria shown below, and then obtained expressed mutant proteins in which alanine substituted one of these amino acid residues. Then, we measured the effect of each mutant on rhodopsin phosphorylation. We decided the amino acid residues to be mutated based on the following criteria. Amino acid residues that are: 1) highly conserved among eight S-modulin homologues which are known to have the S-modulin activity (25.De Castro E. Nef S. Fiumelli H. Lenz S.E. Kawamura S. Nef P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27.Kawamura S. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 20: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28.Kawamura S. Kuwata O. Yamada M. Matsuda S. Hisatomi O. Tokunaga F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21359-21364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); 2) located in or near the regions corresponding to peptides 2, 5, 6, or 9 and on the surface in the three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+-bound form of bovine S-modulin (24.Ames J.B. Isima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar); 3) not present in the EF-hand structure (to exclude the possibility of the loss of the Ca2+-binding site); 4) not glycine or proline (to avoid the effect of the mutation on the structure of the peptide backbone). Fig. 4 shows the amino acid sequences of peptides 2, 5, 6, and 9 in the eight S-modulin homologues which are known to have the S-modulin activity. Based on the above criteria, we selected 11 amino acid residues (Fig. 4, boxed residues). In addition, Leu16, Phe55, Phe56, and Ile181 were selected: they are conserved among the eight S-modulin homologues and are located near peptides 2, 5, 6, and 9 in the three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+-bound form of bovine S-modulin. Thus, we obtained a total of 15 S-modulin mutants and examined the effect of each mutant on rhodopsin phosphorylation. Fig. 5 summarizes the effects of S-modulin and its mutants on rhodopsin phosphorylation. At a saturating Ca2+ concentration (100 μm, filled bars), rhodopsin phosphorylation was inhibited by addition of S-modulin or its mutants, but the inhibitory effect of each mutant protein was dependent on the mutation. Some of the mutants inhibited the phosphorylation as efficiently as wild-type S-modulin (L16A, W30A, L89A, K96A, I154A, and I181A). The other nine mutants (indicated byasterisks) caused weaker inhibition than wild-type S-modulin. The results indicated that these mutants partially lost the S-modulin activity and that the substituted amino acid residues in these mutants were necessary for S-modulin activity. Therefore, these nine residues were the candidates of the interaction sites. Among the nine effective amino acids (asterisks in Fig. 5), seven of them are present in peptides 2 (Thr20, Phe22, and Glu26), 5 (Thr92), 6 (Lys100and Tyr108), or 9 (Arg150), and two additional amino acid residues (Phe55 and Phe56) are present near the cluster formed in the Ca2+-bound form of S-modulin (see below). There are many possible mechanisms that account for the loss of the S-modulin activity in a given mutant. We thought the following possibilities: 1) total or a partial loss of the Ca2+binding; 2) inability to change the molecular conformation to the active form of S-modulin; 3) mutation of amino acid residues responsible for the interaction with Rk. To identify the amino acid residues responsible for the interaction with Rk, we needed to know the mechanisms of the loss of the S-modulin activity. Therefore, in all of the 15 mutants, we first measured the Ca2+ binding to know the extent of Ca2+ binding and then circular dichroism to detect Ca2+-dependent conformational changes. Fig.6 shows the Ca2+ binding of all of the S-modulin mutants generated. We also measured the binding of S-modulin and two S-modulin mutants, E84M and E120M as controls: wild-type S-modulin binds two Ca2+ at EF-2 and EF-3 (24.Ames J.B. Isima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), while E84M binds one and E120M almost none (21.Matsuda S. Hisatomi O. Ishino T. Kobayashi Y. Tokunaga F. J. Boil. Chem. 1998; 273: 20223-20227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The results showed that most of the mutants bind an equal amount of Ca2+ as wild-type S-modulin, but that two mutants (Y108A and R150A) bind less. The binding efficiencies of Y108A and R150A are ∼50 and ∼60% relative to that of wild-type S-modulin, respectively, and are almost the same as that of E84M. These results indicate that Y108A and R150A bind only one Ca2+. To detect Ca2+-dependent conformational changes, we measured CD spectra of S-modulin or its mutants at a low (<1 nm) and a high (200 μm) Ca2+concentration. As shown in Fig.7 A, on Ca2+binding, wild-type S-modulin (wt) increased the negative CD signal at 220–224 nm and decreased the signal at 206–212 nm in agreement with previous reports (22.Duronio R.J.

Acta. 1997; 1342: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The increase in the negative signal was approximately 10%. In some of the mutants, the CD spectral change was almost the same as that of the wild-type (Fig. 7 B), but in some of them, the change was very small (Fig. 7 C). Fig. 7 D summarizes the Ca2+-induced CD spectral changes at 220–224 nm in all of the mutants generated. In the 15 mutants, six of them (F22A, E26A, W30A, F55A, T92A, and I154A; indicated by asterisks) showed similar CD spectral changes to that of wild-type S-modulin, which suggested that normal Ca2+-dependent conformational changes took place in these mutants. The other mutants showed decreased spectral changes, although the degree of the decrease differed greatly among the mutants. In all of the mutants, the CD spectrum of the Ca2+-free form resembled that of the Ca2+-free form of the wild-type. Fig.8 compares the results of measurements of the Ca2+ binding (Fig. 6), rhodopsin phosphorylation (Fig.5), and the CD spectral changes (Fig. 7). In this figure, the 15 mutants generated can be classified into three groups. The mutants classified in group A (Y108A and R150A) showed only one Ca2+ binding (Fig. 8, left panel) and they lost the S-modulin activity (Fig. 8, middle panel). The mutants in group B (I154A, W30A, K96A, I181A, L89A, and L16A) bound two Ca2+ and inhibited rhodopsin phosphorylation at a high Ca2+ concentration as wild-type S-modulin did. The members in group C (F55A, E26A, F56A, F22A, K100A, T20A, and T92A) bound two Ca2+ and partially lost the S-modulin activity. In the following, based on the results shown in Fig. 8, we will try to analyze the mechanism of the effect of each mutation to identify the amino acid residues responsible for the interaction with Rk. One point to be mentioned here is that in the present study we did not attempt to discriminate between the binding site and the inhibition (functional) site of the Ca2+-bound form of S-modulin to Rk. In the following, we use the term of “interaction site” which includes both the binding and the inhibition site. The members in group A bind only one Ca2+. In a previous study by Matsuda et al. (21.Matsuda S. Hisatomi O. Ishino T. Kobayashi Y. Tokunaga F. J. Boil. Chem. 1998; 273: 20223-20227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), they showed that the Ca2+ binding to EF-3 induces the second Ca2+binding to EF-2 and this second Ca2+ binding is essential in eliciting the S-modulin activity. Therefore, the loss of the S-modulin activity in this group would be due to the inability of the second Ca2+ binding. In other words, Tyr108 and Arg150 mutants bind one Ca2+ but probably cannot undergo conformational changes after the first Ca2+binding so that the interaction site of S-modulin to Rk is not formed properly. In Y108A, the CD spectral change at 220–224 nm was very small (Fig. 8, right panel), which indicates that the overall structural change of this mutant is very small even though one Ca2+ binds. In R150A, it was more than 60% of the wild-type, which suggests that the conformational change of this mutant takes place on one Ca2+ binding but yet is not enough to induce the second Ca2+ binding. In group B, the S-modulin activity was not affected appreciably by the mutations, which suggested that these mutations do not affect the interaction between the Ca2+-bound form of S-modulin and Rk. Therefore, although the amino acid residues Leu16, Trp30, Leu89, Lys96, Ile154, and Ile181 are conserved among S-modulin family proteins, these do not seem to be essential in the interaction. However, caution must be taken: alanine may have substituted functionally. In the cases of I154A, W30A, and K96A, the S-modulin activity was enhanced comparing with that of wild-type S-modulin. To elucidate the mechanism of this, further studies are needed. Even though the S-modulin activity was similar as that of the wild-type in group B mutants, the conformational (CD spectral) change induced by two Ca2+ binding varied depending on the mutation. In I154A and W30A, the change was almost the same as that of the wild-type, but in L16A, the change was small. In group C mutants, the S-modulin activity was lost and therefore the amino acid residues in this group are the candidates as the essential amino acid residues responsible for the interaction between the Ca2+-bound form of S-modulin and Rk. When one concludes that a certain amino acid residue is responsible for the interaction, there must be certain criteria to be fulfilled. The simplest case is that such a mutant should: 1) bind two Ca2+; 2) lose the S-modulin activity; and 3) change the conformation in a Ca2+-dependent manner to a similar extent as the wild-type. All of the members in group C fulfill criterion 1 and 2. Even though the CD spectrum gives structural information of whole molecule but not local (that is, the interaction site), four of the mutants in this group, F55A, E26A, F22A, and T92A, showed similar CD spectrum changes as S-modulin and seem to fulfill criterion 3. Therefore, we conclude that these four residues are the “interaction” sites with Rk. One line of the supportive evidence for this is that these four mutants bound to ROS membranes at a high Ca2+ concentration (100 μm) as efficiently as wild-type S-modulin (data not shown). Thus, the loss of the S-modulin activity in these four mutants are not caused by the loss of the Ca2+-dependent binding ability to ROS membranes. The other three in this group (F56A, K100A, and T20A) showed small CD spectrum changes (Fig. 8, right panel). It is not certain at present whether the losses of the S-modulin activity in these three are due to mutations of responsible residues or incomplete conformational changes derived from the mutation. For this reason, we tentatively conclude that these three residues are “possible” interaction sites. Fig. 9 shows the localization of the mutated amino acid residues in the three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+-free form (A) and the Ca2+-bound form (B) of bovine S-modulin. The interaction (red) and the possible (purple) sites are present in a closed pocket in the Ca2+-free form of S-modulin (A), but they appear on the surface around the edge of a groove in the Ca2+-bound form (B). It is interesting that the possible interaction sites are situated near the interaction sites in the Ca2+-bound form. Even though the area around this groove has been speculated as the interaction site to target proteins (24.Ames J.B. Isima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 30.Vijay-Kumar S. Kumar V.D. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), all of the conserved amino acid residues in this region do not always seem to be essential in the interaction. For example, substitution of Trp30, Leu89, or Lys96 (green in Fig.9 B) with alanine did not bring about the loss of the S-modulin activity. However, since alanine may possibly substitute the mutated amino acid residue functionally, we need future study for a complete understanding of the interaction sites. Since the interaction and the possible interaction sites are composed of mainly hydrophobic amino acid residues, it is possible that the interaction site of rhodopsin kinase also has hydrophobic residues. In the present study, all of the effective amino acid residues were localized either in or near the peptides 2, 5, and 6 (Fig. 9). In the study of S-modulin partial peptides, however, peptide 9 inhibited rhodopsin phosphorylation (Fig. 2), but yet we could not identify the effective residues in this peptide. One possibility is that we did not properly select the amino acid residues to be mutated in peptide 9. However, it is also possible that the effect of peptide 9 is not specific. Peptide 9 is very hydrophobic and the inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation by this peptide was irreversible (data not shown), which suggested that peptide 9 irreversibly denatured Rk to reduce rhodopsin phosphorylation. GCAP1 is an activator of photoreceptor guanylate cyclase. It activates the cyclase at low Ca2+concentrations but inhibits it at high Ca2+ concentrations (31.Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32.Dizhoor A.M. Boikov S.G. Olshevskaya E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17311-17314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Recent findings showed that a mutation at Y99C in GCAP1 induces a constitutive activation of guanylate cyclase (32.Dizhoor A.M. Boikov S.G. Olshevskaya E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17311-17314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Clinically, this mutation causes autosomal dominant cone dystrophy in a British family (33.Payne A.M. Downes S.M. Bessant D.A.R. Taylor R. Holder G.E. Warren M.J. Bird A.C. Bhattacharya S.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although GCAPs do not have the S-modulin activity and most of the interaction and possible sites detected in the present study are not conserved in GCAPs, their amino acid sequences show some homology to S-modulin. It is therefore expected that some of the three-dimensional structure of GCAP1 is similar as that of S-modulin. Interestingly, Tyr99 in GCAP1 corresponds to Tyr108 in S-modulin. Since the Y108A mutant of S-modulin probably cannot bind the second Ca2+ necessary for the conformational change (Fig. 6), Tyr99 mutant in GCAP1 may also bind only one Ca2+. It is therefore possible that the Tyr99 mutant of GCAP1 stays at the Ca2+-free form to activate the cyclase constitutively. After the finding of S-modulin and its bovine homologue, recoverin, many S-modulin-like proteins have been reported. However, in most of the cases, their functions and functional mechanisms are not known. In the present study, we identified the interaction sites of S-modulin. As indicated in the text, most S-modulin family proteins have the S-modulin activity, and therefore, the present finding on the interaction site will provide a general structural mechanism of the action of S-modulin family proteins. We thank Prof. Tokunaga for providing the expression vectors of wild-type S-modulin and mutant proteins (E84M and E120M)."

In view of evidence that the His107 residue of hGSTM1a-1a is important for catalysis (Patskovsky, Y. V., Patskovska, L. N., and Listowsky, I. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 1193–1202), the cognate Arg107 residue of the hGSTM2 subunit was replaced (R107N or R107H) and arginine residues were also incorporated into position 107 of hGSTM1 (H107R) and hGSTM4 (S107R) subunits. The major distinguishing kinetic properties invariably associated with enzymes containing an Arg107 residue include an inverse dependence ofk cat on viscosity and lowerK mGSH values relative to enzymes with other residues at that position. Moreover, affinities for GSH thiolate anion binding are greater for enzymes containing Arg107, with K d values of 20–50 μm that are consistent with theK mGSH values (10–25 μm) obtained by steady-state kinetic analyses. Both thermodynamic and kinetic and data indicate that the Arg107residue is specifically involved in enhancing the binding affinity of GSH thiolate anion relative to that of the protonated form. These enzymes therefore, can be more effective at lower GSH concentrations. Combined mutations indicate that both Arg107 and Tyr6 residues are required for thiolate anion formation and stabilization. The three-dimensional structure of ligand-free hGSTM2-2 determined by x-ray crystallography suggests that Arg107maintains an electrostatic interaction with the Asp161 side chain (3 Å apart), but is distant from the GSH-binding site. However, an alternative energetically favorable model places the guanidino group 4 Å from the sulfur atom of bound GSH. It is suggested therefore, that in solution, motion of the positively charged arginine into the catalytic pocket could provide a counter ion to promote ionization of the sulfhydryl group of GSH, thereby accounting for the observed greater affinity of enzymes containing Arg107 for binding of thiolate anion.

Biol. 1998; 281: 323-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have provided insight into their catalytic mechanisms. GSTs characteristically are highly specific for GSH as the nucleophile but are notably nonspecific with regard to structurally diverse electrophilic second substrates (4.Hayes J.D. Pulford D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3227) Google Scholar,17.Mannervik B. Danielson V.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). Because the proteins are not designed to accommodate any particular substrate, and each form exhibits broad specificity for binding of substrates and non-substrate ligands (18.Listowsky I. Tavolini N.N. Berk P.D. Hepatic Transport and Bile Secretion. Raven Press, New York1993: 397-405Google Scholar), catalysis by GSTs is in many ways unique. Therefore, the activation of GSH for reaction with diverse types of electrophilic centers is important for the function of GSTs. A general feature of catalysis appears to be enhancement of nucleophilicity of the sulfhydryl group of enzyme-bound GSH. It has been suggested that the phenolic hydroxyl group of a conserved tyrosine residue at the GSH-binding site (G-site) of certain GSTs (Tyr8 for Alpha, Tyr6 for Mu, Tyr7 for Pi classes) that is within hydrogen bonding distance of the sulfhydryl group, lowers the pK a of GSH by stabilizing a deprotonated thiolate anion (19.Liu S.

The His107 residue of hGSTM1a-1a was recently shown to function as a general base for catalysis of nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions; and a single reciprocal replacement of Ser107 of hGSTM4-4 with histidine results in a substantial increase of catalytic efficiency for the mutated GST (27.Patskovsky Y.V. Patskovska L.N. Listowsky I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, other human Mu class GSTs (hGSTM2-2 and hGSTM3-3) and all rodent enzymes of this class contain an Arg107 instead of a histidine residue (4.Hayes J.D. Pulford D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3227) Google Scholar) and no acceptors for the thiol proton have been identified for these enzymes. Accordingly, a series of recombinant human Mu class GSTs were engineered to evaluate functions of the Arg107 residue. The data indicate that the residue at position 107 has a marked influence on the catalytic properties of the GSTs, and that Arg107functions in concert with Tyr6 to activate the bound GSH.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe following substrates were used. 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB), ethacrynic acid (EA), and 4-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (CDNBA) were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) was obtained from Cayman Chemical Co.

The resultant amplified fragments were subcloned into a pET3a vector (Stratagene), their sequences determined, and the vectors used for GST expression and purification. GSTs were purified by affinity chromatography using GSH-agarose columns (30.Jensson H. Alin P. Mannervik B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The fidelity of DNA sequencing procedures was confirmed by ESI-MS analysis of the protein products as described previously (31.Rowe J.D. Nieves E. Listowsky I. Biochem.

Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and CDNBA substrates, were determined by steady-state kinetic analyses. The concentration of GSH and the second substrate were varied independently in the ranges of 0.002–5.0 mm and 0.005–2.5 mm, respectively, in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (or 0.1 m sodium acetate, or 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl) buffers in the pH range between 4.0 and 9.0. The apparent kinetic constants,k cat, KmS, and KmGSH for each enzyme were calculated from experimental data obtained from double reciprocal plots of initial velocities versus substrate concentrations using a Milton Roy Co. (Rochester, NY) software program package. The enzyme concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (at 280 nm) or by use of a Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The values of kcatS for each enzyme and for each substrate were finally recalculated on a per-subunit basis. All measurements were made in triplicate in buffers equilibrated at constant temperature. Assuming that values of dissociation constants for all substrates are equal to their Michaelis constants, the apparent kinetic constants determined for all enzymes tested were consistent with a random sequential or a random equilibrium bisubstrate mechanism of catalysis. The limiting values of rate constants were determined from plots of log k cat versus pH. The influence of viscosity on kinetic parameters was determined with CDNB and GSH substrates in the presence of 0–30% sucrose over a pH range between 5.0 and 9.0 (33.Johnson W.W. Liu S. Ji X.

The relatively low pH values and low concentrations of each compound were chosen because of the higher rates of nonenzymatic reactions with these two substrates. 4-HNE cannot be used effectively at high concentration because of a high molar extinction coefficient for the product of about 19,000m−1 cm−1 at 226 nm and relatively slow rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction.Specific activities with DCNB as substrate were measured in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DCNB, and 2.0 mm GSH. Since the rate of the uncatalyzed reaction between DCNB and GSH was determined to be very slow (the value of second-order rate constants are less than 0.0001m−1 s−1), a higher pH was used to determine enzymatic activities. Because of the limited solubility of this substrate and the relatively high apparent KmDCNB value (usually greater than 2 mm), the calculated apparent kinetic constants were not precise.Stopped-flow spectrophotometric measurements were performed as described (27.Patskovsky Y.V. Patskovska L.N. Listowsky I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The concentrations of reactants were varied (GSH, 2–200 μm, and CDNB, 50–1000 μm) for the pre-steady state kinetics. Protein concentrations were between 4 and 20 μm to ensure that any initial burst increase of absorbance could be readily detected.Detection of Thiolate Anion FormationGSH thiolate anion formation was detected spectrophotometrically by absorbance changes at 240 nm (36.Chen W.J. Graminski G.F. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The appropriate amount of GSH was added to a buffered solution that contained the indicated GST at a fixed concentration of 20 μm (calculated per monomer). Aliquots of GSH were added to final concentrations of 1 to 1000 μm, and solutions of the same concentrations of GSH were used as blanks. A molar extinction coefficient of 4 × 103m−1 cm−1 was used for calculation of molar ratios of protein-bound GSH thiolate anion (see Fig. 2, legend).Solution of Ligand-free hGSTM2-2 Crystal Structure and Modeling ToolsDetails of hGSTM2-2 purification, crystallization, and x-ray data collection were summarized in a previous report (29.Patskovska L. Federov A.A. Patskovsky Y.V. Almo S.C. Listowsky I. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 54: 458-460Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a ligand-free enzyme was determined by molecular replacement methods using X-PLOR (version 3.851 (37.Brunger A.T. XPLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and TOM software (38.Cambillau C. Horjales E. J. Mol. Graph. 1987; 5: 174-177Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and the hGSTM2-2(W214F) crystal structure was used as a starting model (PDB accession number 1HNA (39.Raghunathan S. Chandross J. Kretsinger R.H. Alliston T.J. Penington C.J. Rule G.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 815-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)). Experimental details of the structure solution were submitted into the Brookhaven protein data base (PDB accession number 2GTU). The progress of refinement was monitored using cross-validation methods. The P1 21 1 monoclinic crystal form of hGSTM2-2 contained two protein monomers or a whole dimer per asymmetric unit. The overall RMSD between backbone atoms of two monomers was about 0.14 Å. Thus, the two monomers are virtually identical. The crystallographic R-factor for 11,894 reflections between 10.0 and 2.55 Å with F>2ςF is 0.20 (R-free is 0.26) with root mean square deviations in bond lengths and angles of 0.011 Å and 1.4°, respectively. All models were designed using an INSIGHTII program package (Biosym Inc.) and SETOR software.The models of the GSH-filled hGSTM2-2 with different configurations of the Arg107 side chain were constructed on the basis of the alignment of three-dimensional structures of hGSTM2-2(W214F) with bound GSH (39.Raghunathan S. Chandross J. Kretsinger R.H. Alliston T.J. Penington C.J. Rule G.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 815-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and unliganded hGSTM2-2 described in this report. Therefore, the starting models for refinement procedures had coordinates of ligand-free hGSTM2-2 and coordinates of GSH fitted in the G-site of the enzyme. The relative coordinates and stereochemical parameters for GSH atoms were taken from the PDB entry 1HNA. This analysis was feasible because atomic coordinates determined for amino acid residues (including side chains, see below) involved in the maintenance of G-site structures for liganded and ligand-free enzymes are practically identical. RMSD between backbone atoms of G-site residues of these two crystal forms was about 0.2 Å, a figure lower than the estimated coordinate error of 0.25 Å determined for hGSTM2-2. On the basis of the initial model, several secondary models were generated with only the atomic coordinates of Arg107 side chain different between them (potentially different rotamers). These models were refined using a fast cooling protocol (time step = 0.2 fs, temperature range 1500–300° K); these were then used for an additional positional refinement employing structure factors determined for hGSTM2-2 and a resolution range of 3.0–10.0 Å. These energy minimization procedures allowed an improved geometry of side chain atoms and for maintenance of optimal distances. From the starting potential models, only two structures selectively met all necessary criteria mentioned above. Further details of the structure solution and modeling are discussed below.DISCUSSIONThe two major steps of GST catalysis, namely GSH thiolate anion formation and the conjugation reaction with the electrophilic substrate, should be considered independently to interpret the results in this report. The conversion of enzyme-bound GSH to its thiolate anion is not affected by, nor does it require, the presence of the second substrate. The kinetic parameter that primarily reflects the activation of enzyme bound GSH to thiolate is the KmGSH value. The reaction of GSH with the second substrate is reflected by k catand KmS values. Accordingly, there are a number of distinctive properties that are invariably associated with the presence of an Arg107 residue for natural or mutant human Mu class GSTs. These include the lower KmGSH values relative to those for enzymes containing other residues at position 107 (Tables I and IIand Fig. 1, C and F) and lower apparentK d values for GSH thiolate anion formation when that occurs (Fig. 2B). The KmGSHvalues depend on the enzyme variant and not on the second substrate (Tables I and II). These forms of the enzyme thus are more effective at lower GSH levels that may occur under conditions of oxidative stress. In that context it is noteworthy that brain and testis have among the highest tissue levels of hGSTM2 subunits (28.Rowe J.D. Patskovsky Y. Patskovska L.N. Novikova E. Listowsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9593-9601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, turnover numbers for all Arg107-containing enzymes are sensitive to solvent viscosity whereas replacement of this residue of hGSTM2-2 with histidine or asparagine eliminates the viscosity dependence (TableI).On the basis of crystallographic and biochemical data, the hydroxyl group of Tyr6 which is near the active site of Mu class GSTs, has been considered to be a crucial functional group for catalysis by electrophilic stabilization of the thiolate anion of enzyme-bound GSH (22.Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Studies on rat GSTs with fluorotyrosyl residues to increase the acidity of the phenolic hydroxyl groups (rGSTM1-1) (42.Parsons J.F. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2295-2296Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and hGSTA1-1 (43.Thorson J.S. Shin I. Chapman E. Stenberg G. Mannervik B. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 20: 451-452Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), reinforce the view that the hydroxyl groups of active-site tyrosine residues of the natural enzymes function by stabilizing thiolate. It is significant, however, that thiolate anion had never been detected in crystal structures of GSTs complexed with GSH (19.Liu S. Zhang P. Ji X. Johnson W.W. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Ji X. Armstrong R.N. Gilliland G.L.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11938-11944Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22.Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 39.Raghunathan S.

The data presented in this report suggest that Tyr6 functions together with Arg107 in GST catalysis in at least two different ways. The positive charge of the arginine could promote the ionization of the sulfhydryl group of GSH. The hydroxyl group of Tyr6 indeed could then participate in the stabilization of the GSH thiolate anion. Evidently, however, Tyr6 alone does not effectively stabilize thiolate; the presence of Arg107 or His107 side chains near the active site pocket are also required (Fig. 2). An alternative mechanism for the Tyr6 side chain involvement in catalysis may be deduced from comparison of kinetic constants of wild-type and certain mutant enzymes. In this respect, the most notable results are that an R107N mutant of hGSTM2-2 does not lower the apparent pK a for GSH thiolate anion (Fig.2 B), yet the kinetic pK a with CDNB as substrate is much lower than the pK a for thiolate formation. The apparent inconsistency between the pK a measured by kinetics (pK a of about 6.0, Fig. 1, A, B, and C) and the pK a of thiolate formation of the enzyme bound GSH (≥8.0, Fig. 2 A) suggest that in that case, above a certain pH (the apparent enzymatic pK a, Fig. 1,A and B) the rate of the chemical step of the reaction between GSH thiolate and the electrophilic substrate is no longer rate-limiting. Since the rate of proton transfer from GSH is very fast (>108 s−1), and based on pre-steady state rapid kinetics for all GST variants product release is not rate-limiting, it is likely that binding and productive reorientation of the second substrate for reaction with the GSH nucleophile (transition-state formation) is rate-limiting for catalysis. With CDNBA as substrate, however, the R107N mutant has a kinetic pK a (8.2) close to that of free GSH in solution, so the rate-limiting step for that substrate is probably the conversion of enzyme substrate complex into product. The Y6F mutant has a very low catalytic efficiency with the CDNB second substrate, and the apparent KmCDNB value is increased compared with that of the wild-type enzyme (Table I). A primary function of Tyr6, therefore, could be the binding and orientation of the second substrate as well as for transition state stabilization.Substitutions of the Arg107 residue by His or Asn, causes a decrease ofk cat/ KmGSHand an increase of KmGSH values (see Tables I and II and Fig. 1, C and F). Both KmGSH values, and apparentK d values calculated for thiolate anion formation (see Fig. 2 B) are contingent upon the nature of the side chain of residue 107. Evidently, residue 107 can participate in catalysis by being involved (or not) in thiolate anion stabilization.Binding of GSH and thiolate anion formation at equilibrium may be viewed in terms of the basic thermodynamic cycle shown in Scheme 1, E+GSH ⇌ K1 E+GS(−)+H+ K3⥯⥮K2E·GSH (I)⇌K4 E·GS(−) (II)+H+ SCHEME 1The estimated three log unit pK a difference between that of free GSH in solution (K 1 of approximately 10−9m) and of GSH bound to the GST (K 4 of near 10−6m) is observed for hGSTM2-2 and other Arg107-containing variants (see Fig. 2 A). The overall equilibrium constant for enzyme-GSH thiolate anion formation (structure II, Scheme 1) is 2–5 × 104m−1 from the data in Fig. 2 B. Enzyme-bound GSH thiolate may form by either pathway shown in Scheme 1; therefore K 1 ×K 2 or K 3 ×K 4 should equal 2–5 104m−1 for the Arg107 containing enzymes (Fig. 2 B). That value is also reflected by the respective KmGSH values for these forms of the enzyme (Tables I and II). The apparent equilibrium constant for GSH thiolate anion binding (K 2 of Scheme 1) is therefore greater than that for binding of the protonated GSH (K 3 of Scheme 1). These pathway-independent relationships suggest that after a protonated GSH binds to the enzyme its affinity increases as a consequence of thiolate anion formation and the involvement of the positively charged arginine.Replacement of Arg107 by asparagine in hGSTM2-2 apparently shifts the equilibrium of the enzyme bound GSH toward that of the protonated form (Fig. 2 A). In fact the pK a of the enzyme-bound GSH (K 4) is probably no more than one log unit lower than that of free GSH in solution (K 1). Indeed in that case, the KmGSH values are nearly 50-fold greater than those of the Arg107variants (Tables I and II); however, as discussed above, neither limiting values of turnover numbers nor KmCDNB values are affected. For the R107H substitutions (natural hGSTM1a-1a and chimera), a different mechanism involving a proton transfer reactions on the protein is operative (27.Patskovsky Y.V. Patskovska L.N. Listowsky I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The hGSTM2-2 Y6F mutant has a KmGSH value very similar to that of wild-type enzyme, and apparently significant amounts of GSH thiolate anion do not form as a consequence of binding at pH 7.0 (Fig.2 A). The affinity for the protonated GSH relative to thiolate thus increases with a Y6F substitution, and accounts for the 10,000-fold lower catalytic efficiency.Studies on other forms of the enzyme indicated that a human Alpha class GST h"

Here we analyzed 40 kilobases of the 5' end region of the utrophin gene searching for new utrophin regulatory elements in muscle cells. By transient transfection of utrophin genomic fragments in front of a reporter gene, we identified a new enhancer that maps downstream of the transcription start site within the second intron and co-localizes with a DNase I-hypersensitive site. By deletion analysis it was mapped to a sequence of 128 base pairs that retains the whole activity. Linker scanning mutagenesis showed that most of the enhancer sequence is essential for its transcriptional activity. Binding analysis with nuclear cell extracts demonstrated that the enhancer regulatory elements, identified by mutagenesis, are protected from DNase I digestion. Because utrophin can functionally substitute dystrophin, the identification and characterization of new regulatory elements provide new targets for possible therapies of Duchenne muscular dystrophy aiming at the up-regulation of the utrophin expression in muscle cells."

DRAG had <2% activity with oxidized R. rubrum Fe protein relative to activity with reduced Fe protein. The activity of DRAG with oxygen-denatured Fe protein or a low molecular weight substrate,N α-dansyl-N ω-(1,N6-etheno-ADP-ribosyl)-arginine methyl ester, was independent of redox potential. The redox midpoint potential of DRAG activation of Fe protein was −430 mVversus standard hydrogen electrode, coinciding with the midpoint potential of the [Fe4S4] cluster from R. rubrum Fe protein. DRAT was found to have a specificity opposite that of DRAG, exhibiting low (<20%) activity with 87% reduced R. rubrum Fe protein relative to activity with fully oxidized Fe protein. A mutant of R. rubrum in which the rate of oxidation of Fe protein was substantially decreased had a markedly slower rate of ADP-ribosylation in vivo in response to 10 mm NH4Cl or darkness stimulus.

The oxidation states and reduction potentials of these metalloproteins have been the subjects of extensive research in the nitrogenase field (1.Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The nitrogenase enzyme itself is composed of two highly conserved iron-sulfur proteins, designated Fe protein1 and MoFe protein. Fe protein is a 64-kDa homodimer, containing a single [Fe4S4] cluster, bound between the subunits by symmetrical cysteinyl ligation (2.Hausinger R.P. Howard J.B. J. Biol.

MoFe protein is a 230-kDa α2β2 tetramer, containing two [Fe8S7] clusters (P-clusters) located at the interface of each αβ dimer and two molybdenum-iron-sulfur-homocitrate clusters (iron-molybdenum cofactor), the presumed sites of substrate reduction (4.Kim J.

Science. 1984; 224: 1095-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), electron transfer is coupled with the hydrolysis of at least two MgATP molecules per electron (9.Ljones T. Burris R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 275: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the details of the nitrogenase catalysis model continue to be debated, there is general agreement on the basic sequence of the cycle, based on data obtained with both the Klebsiella pneumoniaesystem and the Azotobacter vinelandii system. Fe protein, containing the reduced (1+) form of the [Fe4S4] cluster, binds two MgATP molecules (10.Ashby G.A. Thorneley R.N. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The binding of this nucleotide shifts the redox potential of the [Fe4S4]2+/1+ couple from about −300 mV to nearly −450 mV (11.Zumft W.G. Mortenson L.E. Palmer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12.Watt G.D. Wang Z.-C. Knotts R.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8156-8162Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and also elicits a specific conformational change in Fe protein (13.Stephens P.J. McKenna C.E. Smith B.E. Nguyen H.T. McKenna M.C. Thomson A.J. Devlin F. Jones J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2585-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), promoting its association with MoFe protein. An additional conformational change apparently occurs upon complex formation, shifting the Fe protein redox potential by an additional −200 mV (14.Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12976-12983Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and allowing the transfer of a single electron from the Fe protein to a iron-molybdenum cofactor of MoFe protein, via a P-cluster (15.Lowe D.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27007-27013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Coupled to electron transfer is the hydrolysis of the two MgATP molecules bound to Fe protein to MgADP and Pi. ATP hydrolysis apparently serves to prevent the reverse flow of electrons, rather than to drive electron transfer (17.Lanzilotta W.N. Parker V.D. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), as single electron transfer without MgATP hydrolysis has been observed in a tight-binding complex of MoFe protein with a variant of Fe protein from an A. vinelandii mutant (18.Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Oxidized ([Fe4S4]2+) Fe protein, stabilized by the two MgADP molecules still bound (19.Miller R.W. Eady R.R. Gormal C. Fairhurst S.A. Smith B.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), dissociates from one-electron-reduced MoFe protein in what is generally thought to be the rate-limiting step of the cycle (20.Thorneley R.N. Lowe D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To complete the cycle, Fe protein is reduced by a low potential electron donor (a ferredoxin or flavodoxin in vivo) and the MgADP molecules are exchanged for two MgATP molecules. The catalytic cycle is repeated until a sufficient number of electrons have been transferred to completely reduce the FeMoco-bound substrate (21.Hageman R.V. Burris R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). As can be seen in the catalysis description, the multifunctional Fe protein (which also has roles in MoFe protein metallocluster synthesis (22.Robinson A.C. Dean D.R. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14327-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) exists in several distinct redox and conformational states during a single enzyme turnover event. In the nitrogen-fixing, photosynthetic, facultative anaerobeRhodospirillum rubrum, nitrogenase can be rapidly, reversibly inactivated by mono-ADP-ribosylation of nitrogenase Fe protein (24.Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1989; 30: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This modification event occurs in response to environmental conditions of fixed nitrogen sufficiency or of darkness, when the energy-expensive nitrogenase reaction is undesirable (24.Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1989; 30: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The ADP-ribosylation of a specific arginine residue (Arg-101 in R. rubrum Fe protein) is catalyzed by dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyltransferase (DRAT), using NAD+ as the ADP-ribose donor (25.Pope M.R. Murrell S.A. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3173-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26.Lowery R.G. Saari L.L. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 513-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ADP-ribosylated Fe protein cannot reduce MoFe protein, although the [Fe4S4] cluster is still accessible to small redox-active molecules. DRAT acts as a 30-kDa monomer with high specificity toward MgADP-bound Fe protein, possessing no measurable activity with other arginine residues or water as the ADP-ribose acceptor (27.Lowery R.G. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4956-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28.Lowery R.G. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16714-16719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the Fe proteins fromK. pneumoniae and A. vinelandii (which lack thedra operon) are better substrates for R. rubrumDRAT than the R. rubrum Fe protein itself. There are no measurable reverse or glycohydrolytic reactions catalyzed by DRAT. The removal of the ADP-ribose group is instead catalyzed by dinitrogenase reductase-activating glycohydrolase (DRAG), which restores fully active Fe protein with an intact Arg-101 side chain. DRAG is a 32-kDa monomeric binuclear manganese enzyme that is capable of cleaving the α-N-glycosidic bond of a number of analogs of ADP-ribosylarginine (29.Saari L.L. Triplett E.W. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15502-15508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Pope M.R. Saari L.L. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, only the MgATP-bound form (not the MgADP-bound or nucleotide-free forms) of ADP-ribosylated Fe protein is a substrate for DRAG (31.Saari L.L. Pope M.R. Murrell S.A. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4973-4977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the exact modes of interaction of DRAT and DRAG with Fe protein are unknown, it is believed that each binds the same surface of Fe protein as does MoFe protein, as evidenced by the inhibition of cellular nitrogenase activity by overexpressed DRAT (32.Grunwald S.K. Lies D.P. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 628-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the means by which DRAT and DRAG are each regulated are not well understood, it is known that the activity of each enzyme is regulated in vivo (33.Kanemoto R.H. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 713-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Liang J.H. Nielsen G.M. Lies D.P. Burris R.H. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6903-6909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the in vivoactivation and inactivation rates are reflected by in vitroassay rates using purified components, it is believed that the regulatory signals involve either negative effectors or known assay components. As noted above, DRAT and DRAG have opposite specificities for MgADP- and MgATP-bound Fe protein. However, cellular fluctuations in ATP and ADP levels during inactivation/activation cycles are insufficient to account for the dramatic nitrogenase activity regulation (35.Paul T.D. Ludden P.W. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The cellular NAD+ concentration has also been suggested as a possible positive effector for DRAT (36.Noren A. Nordlund S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 37.Noren A. Soliman A. Nordlund S. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Similarly, studies proposing regulation of DRAG via membrane sequestration or activation have not yielded persuasive data (38.Noren A. Nordlund S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7872-7874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Halbleib C.M. Ludden P.W. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 172: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the redox state of Fe protein controls the activity of DRAT and DRAG. The alteration of in vivo DRAT activity in a R. rubrum mutant in which Fe protein is trapped in the reduced state is shown. We also discuss the ramifications of these findings on the understanding of the ADP-ribosylation and nitrogenase catalytic models. R. rubrum strains UR2 (wild-type, Smr (40.Fitzmaurice W.P.

Nitrogenase MoFe protein was purified from UR2 (wild-type R. rubrum) cells (broken by the French press method) as described (43.Ludden P.W. Burris R.H. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylated Fe protein was purified from UR2 cells by a modification of the described method (44.Grunwald S.K. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3277-3283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which a G-75 Sephadex gel filtration column (2.5 × 70 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used instead of the preparative gel step. Unmodified (active) Fe protein was purified from UR212 (DRAT−) cells with an identical protocol. DRAG was purified from UR276 (draG overexpresser) cells as described (39.Halbleib C.M. Ludden P.W. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 172: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). DRAT was purified as described (44.Grunwald S.K. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3277-3283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), from UR356 (draTGB overexpresser) cells broken by the French press method. N α-Dansyl-N ω-(1,N 6-etheno-ADP-ribosyl)-arginine methyl ester (ε-ADPR-DAME) was synthesized and purified as described previously (30.Pope M.R. Saari L.L. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Pope M.R. Saari L.L. Ludden P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Fe protein, containing 1.7 mm sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4; Fluka) as isolated, was oxidized by indigo carmine (Sigma) bound to a Dowex chloride anion exchange column (10.Ashby G.A. Thorneley R.N. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In a VAC Atmospheres anaerobic glove box, an AG1-X8 Dowex chloride column (2 ml; Bio-Rad) was carefully poured on top of a small layer of G-25 Sephadex resin (0.2 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Indigo carmine (1 ml of 20 mm) was bound to the AG1-X8 resin. The column was equilibrated with 20 volumes of anaerobic 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.8. Fe protein (1–5 mg; 3–10 mg/ml) was passed over the column, eluting in the equilibration buffer. The white color of the G-25 layer of the column allowed visualization of the brown Fe protein band eluting from the column. Indigo carmine-oxidized Fe protein was found to be >95% active. DRAG activity was determined by a modification of the nitrogenase-coupled DRAG assay (29.Saari L.L. Triplett E.W. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15502-15508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which the removal of ADP-ribose was differentiated from the acetylene reduction reaction. The standard demodification step was conducted in an anaerobic, stoppered vial containing 5 mm ATP, 25 mm phosphocreatine, 50 μg of creatine phosphokinase (Sigma), 25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmMnCl2, 10 mmNa2S2O4, 20–40 μg of ADP-ribosylated Fe protein, 350 ng of DRAG, and 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, in a 500-μl total volume under nitrogen headspace. Na2S2O4 or ATP were excluded from some assays. After a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, 2 mmADP-ribose (Sigma) was added to inhibit further DRAG activity. The acetylene reduction step was initiated by the addition of any components excluded from the demodification step, along with 75 μg of MoFe protein and 10% acetylene in the headspace. After a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The headspace was analyzed for C2H4 content by gas chromatography. Reactions were conducted in 50-μl volumes in microcentrifuge tubes inside anaerobic, N2-filled vials. Inside the vials, but outside the reaction tubes, 0.5 ml of 100 mm Na2S2O4 was present to act as an oxygen scavenger (26.Lowery R.G. Saari L.L. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 513-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Component concentrations were identical to those in the decoupled DRAG assays described above, with the following exceptions: creatine phosphokinase (2.5 μg), ADP-ribosylated Fe protein (35 μg), and DRAG (200 ng). The reactions were incubated 10 min at 30 °C and then were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. A sample (20 μl) of each stopped assay was loaded onto a 10% acrylamide (0.6% bis-acrylamide) SDS minigel. After electrophoresis, each gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 stain (Sigma). The relative amounts of the Fe protein upper band (ADP-ribosylated) and lower band (unmodified) were quantitated by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). A standard correction was made in each assay for a contaminant of creatine phosphokinase, which comigrated with the upper band of Fe protein. Note that only one subunit of the Fe protein homodimer becomes ADP-ribosylated, and thus a 1:1 ratio of upper to lower band represents completely modified (inactive) Fe protein dimer. A continuous assay for DRAG cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond of ε-ADPR-DAME has been described (45.Pope M.R. Saari L.L. Ludden P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in 5-mm (outer diameter) × 3.5-cm sealed quartz tubes. Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, 1 mmMnCl2, 50 μm ε-ADPR-DAME, and 150 ng of purified DRAG in a total volume of 250 μl. Reactions were conducted anaerobically in the presence or absence of 0.5 mmNa2S2O4. The reactions were irradiated with 304 nm UV light, and the fluorescence emission at 405 nm was monitored. Reactions were initiated by the addition of DRAG. After 3.5 h, 1 μg of phosphodiesterase (Sigma) and 0.5 mm MgCl2 were added to completely cleave all ADP-ribosylarginine bonds. Finally, each reaction was exposed to air for 20 min, to react away dithionite, before obtaining the final fluorescence intensities. The extent of DRAG activity toward ADP-ribosylated Fe protein was determined in reactions poised at varied redox potentials. In an anaerobic glove box, DRAG decoupled assays (500 μl total volume) were set up, as described above, containing 1 mm benzyl viologen (Sigma). High concentrations of indigo carmine-oxidized ADP-ribosylated Fe protein (100–300 μg/reaction) were required in these assays. Reactions were poised by the addition of Na2S2O4, and the redox potentials were measured by direct potentiometry, using a saturated Ag/AgCl2 electrode (E m°′ = +199 mV versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) as a reference. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 150 ng of DRAG. After a 10-min incubation, the redox potentials were again measured, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 mmADP-ribose. Because benzyl viologen inhibits nitrogenase reactions at concentrations greater than 0.1 mm, portions of the stopped assays (50 μl) were diluted 10-fold into acetylene reduction reactions. The acetylene reduction assays contained 5 mmATP, 25 mm phosphocreatine, 50 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmADP-ribose, 10 mmNa2S2O4, 75 μg of MoFe protein, and 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, under a headspace of 10% acetylene in nitrogen. The reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and then were stopped by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The headspace was analyzed for C2H4 content by gas chromatography. The midpoint potentials for modified and unmodified R. rubrum Fe protein were determined by dye-mediated, visible spectrum-monitored redox titration. Two solutions in matched glass cuvettes were prepared, containing 50 μm Fe protein, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, 3 mm MgATP, and 15 μm methyl viologen (MV) (Sigma). The spectral differences between the cuvettes were recorded as 2-μl aliquots of 2 mmNa2S2O4 were added to one cuvette. The redox potential of the titrated solution was determined from the intensity of the absorption at 608 nm due to reduced MV. The fraction of Fe protein in the reduced ([Fe4S4]1+) state was determined from the change in the characteristic Fe protein absorbance at 420 nm (46.Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 47.Ljones T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 321: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An assay for DRAT activity by 32P-NAD radiolabeling of Fe protein has been described (28.Lowery R.G. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16714-16719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction mix contains 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, 1 mm ADP, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.25 mm [α-32P]NAD (20 μCi/μmol), 80 μg of indigo carmine-oxidized, unmodified Fe protein, and DRAT in a volume of 50 μl. To this mix were added 10 μm MV and 4 μg of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) from R. rubrum. To produce reducing conditions, the headspace of the reaction vial was filled with CO, which was oxidized to CO2 by CODH with a concomitant reduction of MV. Assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C and then were stopped with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated protein was collected on nitrocellulose filters, and the amount of [α-32P]ADP-ribose incorporated into Fe protein was determined by a Packard Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation counter. R. rubrum strains UR2 (wild-type) and UR145 (nifD::kan (48.Ludden P.W. Lehman L. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5210-5211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) were grown on supplemented malate-ammonium medium (40.Fitzmaurice W.P. Saari L.L. Lowery R.G. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each strain was inoculated into malate-glutamate medium (33.Kanemoto R.H. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 713-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a 65-fold dilution. After illuminated, anaerobic growth for 2 days, for derepression of Fe protein, the cells were treated with darkness or 10 mm NH4Cl, as described (33.Kanemoto R.H. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 713-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted quickly by a trichloroacetic acid precipitation method (49.Zhang Y. Burris R.H. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6781-6788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Zhang Y. Burris R.H. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fe protein subunits were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% acrylamide (0.6% bis-acrylamide) SDS minigel. Proteins from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred onto nitrocellulose and then were immunoblotted with polyclonal antibody against A. vinelandii Fe protein and were visualized with ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein bands on the x-ray film were quantitated by ImageQuant software. The activation of ADP-ribosylated Fe protein by DRAG was assayed with oxidized Fe protein or reduced Fe protein by the “decoupled DRAG assay” described under “Materials and Methods.” In both cases, Fe protein was first oxidized as described under “Materials and Methods.” To obtain reduced Fe protein, sodium dithionite was added to the incubation mixture. In the second phase of the decoupled DRAG assay, the extent of activation of Fe protein was determined from acetylene reduction assays conducted in the presence of MoFe protein, excess dithionite, and 10% acetylene in the headspace. In these decoupled assays for DRAG activity, with indigo carmine-oxidized Fe protein from R. rubrum as the substrate, activity in the absence of Na2S2O4was found to be negligible in comparison to activity with the reductant added (Table I). This result was validated by demonstration of the efficacy of the assay system. In the decoupled assays, the addition of 2 mm ADP-ribose completely inhibited DRAG activity but only slightly inhibited the acetylene reduction reaction of Fe protein and MoFe protein (data not shown). The addition of this specific inhibitor stopped DRAG activation of Fe protein, effectively separating the DRAG-dependent activation of Fe protein from the Fe protein-dependent acetylene reduction phase of the assay and thus allowing analysis of the DRAG reaction in isolation. The decoupled assay system was demonstrated to be a linear assay for DRAG. The dependence of the DRAG reaction on the presence of MgATP, first reported by Saari et al. (31.Saari L.L. Pope M.R. Murrell S.A. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4973-4977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was confirmed (Table I). Also, the dependence on reductant was shown to exist regardless of the divalent cation (Mn2+ or Fe2+) present in the assay (data not shown).Table IActivity of DRAG with oxidized and reduced R. rubrum Fe proteinReaction conditions during incubation with DRAGRedox state of Fe protein added to incubationRedox state of Fe protein during incubationnmol C2H4produced min−1 mg Fe protein−1during C2H2 reduction phase of assayaDecoupled assays for DRAG activity were performed, activating Fe protein with DRAG under the following conditions: 10 min at 30 °C, followed by a Fe protein-dependent acetylene reduction phase with 2 mm ADP-ribose (to inhibit DRAG activity), MoFe protein, 10 mmNa2S2O4, and 10% acetylene in the headspace.Complete (350 ng DRAG, 10 mmNa2S2O4, 5 mmMgATP)OxbFe protein was oxidized by indigo carmine affixed to a Dowex chloride anion exchange column.Red848 ± 2CompleteRedcReduced Fe protein was passed over a 5-ml G-25 Sephadex column to remove excess dithionite.Red760 ± 20Minus DRAGOxbFe protein was oxidized by indigo carmine affixed to a Dowex chloride anion exchange column.Red10.2 ± 0.5Minus DRAGRedcReduced Fe protein was passed over a 5-ml G-25 Sephadex column to remove excess dithionite.Red4.7 ± 0.5Minus Na2S2O4OxbFe protein was oxidized by indigo carmine affixed to a Dowex chloride anion exchange column.Ox23 ± 1Minus Na2S2O4RedcReduced Fe protein was passed over a 5-ml G-25 Sephadex column to remove excess dithionite.ReddFe protein was subject to oxidation following removal of Na2S2O4.163 ± 6Minus MgATPePhosphocreatine and creatine phosphokinase were also excluded.OxbFe protein was oxidized by indigo carmine affixed to a Dowex chloride anion exchange column.Red14 ± 1a Decoupled assays for DRAG activity were performed, activating Fe protein with DRAG under the following conditions: 10 min at 30 °C, followed by a Fe protein-dependent acetylene reduction phase with 2 mm ADP-ribose (to inhibit DRAG activity), MoFe protein, 10 mmNa2S2O4, and 10% acetylene in the headspace.b Fe protein was oxidized by indigo carmine affixed to a Dowex chloride anion exchange column.c Reduced Fe protein was passed over a 5-ml G-25 Sephadex column to remove excess dithionite.d Fe protein was subject to oxidation following removal of Na2S2O4.e Phosphocreatine and creatine phosphokinase were also excluded.

https://openalex.org/W2071011164,"The 79-amino acid, mature SP-B peptide contains three intramolecular disulfide bonds shared by all saposin-like proteins. This study tested the hypothesis that the disulfide bond formed between cysteine residues 35 and 46 (residues 235 and 246 of the SP-B proprotein) is essential for proper function of SP-B. To test the role of this bridge in SP-B function <i>in vivo</i>, a construct was generated in which cysteine residues 235 and 246 of the human SP-B proprotein were mutated to serine and cloned under the control of the 3.7-kilobase hSP-C promoter (hSP-B<sub>C235S/C246S</sub>). In two transgenic mouse lines, expression of the mutant peptide in the wild-type murine SP-B background was invariably lethal in the neonatal period. In four additional lines, survival was inversely related to the level of transgene expression. To test the ability of the mutant peptide to functionally replace the wild-type protein, transgenic mice were crossed into the SP-B null background. No animals that expressed hSP-B<sub>C235S/C246S</sub> in the murine SP-B−/− background survived the neonatal period. hSP-B<sub>C235S/C246S</sub> proprotein accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum and was not processed to the mature, biologically active peptide. The results of these studies demonstrate that the intramolecular bridge between residues 235 and 246 is critical for intracellular trafficking of SP-B and suggest that overexpression of mutant SP-B in the wild-type background may be lethal."

All of the highly conserved catalytic site residues (Tyr72, Tyr123, Glu176, and Arg179) are located in the central domain. A deep cleft (“active center cleft”) at the interface between the central and C-terminal domains forms the putative substrate-binding site (16.Ago H. Kataoka J. Tsuge H. Habuka N. Inagaki E. Noma M. Miyano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Structural studies involving complexes of PAP with various ligands (adenine, formycin, and pteoric acid) have helped clarify the nature of the substrate binding site of PAP (15.Monzingo A.F.

Sci. 1999; 8: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and provided valuable information concerning its substrate specificity. However, these studies have largely been limited to single nucleotides or nucleotide analogs in the active site, and details of how PAP binds a larger RNA fragment of the ribosome remain unknown. Recent modeling studies of another member of the RIP family (ricin) have also been useful in suggesting binding modes of RNA fragments in the active site (18.Olson M.A. Proteins. 1997; 27: 80-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on structural, mutagenesis, and biochemical studies of several RIPs (ricin-A chain, trichosanthin, and momorcharin), it has been proposed that the amino acids Tyr72 and Tyr123(PAP numbering) have the role of sandwiching the susceptible adenine ring of ribosomal RNA into the energetically favorable stacking conformation (19.Bravi G. Legname G. Chan A.W. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 20.Montfort W. Villafranca J.E. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Katzin B. Rutenber E. Xuong N.H. Hamlin R.

Subsequently, the side chain of Arg179 can protonate the N-3 atom of the adenine base, whereas Glu176 stabilizes a positive oxocarbonium transition state (15.Monzingo A.F. Collins E.J. Ernst S.R.

J. 1995; 309: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have recently proposed that the N-7 atom of the adenine base can also be protonated by an acidic residue such as Asp92 (PAP numbering) in trichosanthin and momorcharin.We have recently reported the expression of biologically active recombinant PAP in Escherichia coli (22.Correll C.C.

The biological activity of recombinant PAP was virtually identical to that of native PAP purified from the pokeweed plant (22.Correll C.C. Munishkin A. Chan Y.L. Ren Z. Wool I.G. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13436-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The availability of recombinant PAP provides a unique opportunity for structure-activity relationship (SAR) analyses. Furthermore, we have refined the x-ray structure of PAP (17.Kurinov I.V. Myers D.E. Irvin J.D Uckun F.M. Prot. Sci. 1999; 8: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and established a novel model of the PAP-RNA complex using the coordinates of PAP (Protein Data Bank access code1qcg), PAP complexed with formycin 5′-monophosphate (Protein Data Bank access code 1pag), as well as the coordinates of the ribosomal RNA stem loop from the crystal structure of the 29-nucleotide RNA fragment (Protein Data Bank access code 430d) of rat 28 S ribosomal RNA, which contains the sarcin/ricin loop.In the present SAR study, we employed molecular modeling studies using our model of PAP-RNA complexes and site-directed mutagenesis combined with bioassays to evaluate the importance of the residues at the catalytic site and a putative RNA binding active center cleft between the catalytic site and C-terminal domain for the enzymatic deadenylation of ribosomal RNA by PAP. As anticipated, alanine substitutions by site-directed mutagenesis of the PAP active site residues Tyr72, Tyr123, Glu176, and Arg179 that directly participate in the catalytic deadenylation of ribosomal RNA resulted in greater than 3 logs of loss in depurinating and ribosome inhibitory activity. Similarly, alanine substitution of the conserved active site residue Trp208, which results in the loss of stabilizing hydrophobic interactions with the ribose as well as a hydrogen bond to the phosphate backbone of the RNA substrate, caused greater than 3 logs of loss in enzymatic activity. By comparison, alanine substitutions of residues28KD29, 80FE81,111SR112, and 166FL167that are distant from the active site did not significantly reduce the enzymatic activity of PAP. Our modeling studies predicted that the residues of the active center cleft could via electrostatic interactions contribute to both the correct orientation and stable binding of the substrate RNA molecule in the active site pocket. Notably, alanine substitutions of the highly conserved, charged, and polar residues of the active site cleft including48KY49, 67RR68,69NN70, and 90FND92substantially reduced the depurinating and ribosome inhibitory activity of PAP. Our findings presented herein provide unprecedented experimental evidence that besides the catalytic site residues, the conserved charged and polar side chains located at the active site cleft of PAP also play a critical role in the catalytic removal of the adenine base from target ribosomal RNA substrates. Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP)1 is a 29-kDa naturally occurring protein isolated from the leaves of the pokeweed plant,Phytolacca americana (1.Irvin J.D. Arch. Biochem.

The ribosomes depurinated by PAP in this manner are unable to interact with elongation factors 1 and 2 (8.Gessner S.L. Irvin J.D. J. Biol.

Amino acids that contribute to the binding site for [125I]TID in the ion channel have been identified in both the resting and desensitized state of the AChR (White, B. H., and Cohen, J. B. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15770–15783). To characterize further the structure of the NCA-binding site in the resting state channel, we have employed structural analogs of TID. The TID analogs were assessed by the following: 1) their ability to inhibit [125I]TID photoincorporation into the resting state channel; 2) the pattern, agonist sensitivity, and NCA inhibition of [125I]TID analog photoincorporation into AChR subunits. The addition of a primary alcohol group to TID has no demonstrable effect on the interaction of the compound with the resting state channel. However, conversion of the alcohol function to acetate, isobutyl acetate (TIDBIBA), or to trimethyl acetate leads to rightward shifts in the concentration-response curves for inhibition of [125I]TID photoincorporation into the AChR channel and a progressive reduction in the agonist sensitivity of [125I]TID analog photoincorporation into AChR subunits. Inhibition of [125I]TID analog photoincorporation by NCAs (e.g. tetracaine) as well as identification of the sites of [125I]TIDBIBA photoincorporation in the δM2 segment indicate a common binding locus for each TID analog. We conclude that relatively small additions to TID progressively reduce its ability to interact with the NCA site in the resting state channel. A model of the NCA site and resting state channel is presented. 3-Trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]TID) has been shown to be a potent noncompetitive antagonist (NCA) of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR).

NCAs of the AChR are a large and structurally heterogeneous group of compounds that include local anesthetics, long chain alcohols, barbiturates, phencyclidine, ethidium, substance P, and insecticides (4.Arias H.R.

Under equilibrium binding conditions, the majority of NCAs interact preferentially with the AChR when acetylcholine sites are occupied by agonist, that is they bind preferentially to the desensitized state of the AChR.

The uncharged, photoreactive compound 3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]TID) is another NCA that interacts with high affinity with the AChR channel in the resting state. TID is a potent noncompetitive antagonist of the AChR, inhibiting agonist-induced ion flux and binding with micromolar affinity to the channel in both the resting and desensitized states (14.White B.H. Howard S. Cohen S.G. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21595-21607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Wu G. Raines D.E. Miller K.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15375-15381Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). TID is a unique compound in that there are two components to its photoincorporation into the AChR. First, TID is a potent NCA, and one component of [125I]TID photoincorporation is localized to the channel-lining M2 segments of each receptor subunit. [125I]TID photoincorporation into the M2 segment of each AChR subunit is inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by TID itself as well as by other noncompetitive antagonists (14.White B.H. Howard S. Cohen S.G. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21595-21607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol.

In addition to “specific” photoincorporation into amino acids in the M2 segments of each AChR subunit, [125I]TID also photoincorporates into amino acids in the M1, M3, and M4 transmembrane segments of each receptor subunit. The extent of [125I]TID photoincorporation into residues in the M1, M3, and M4 segments is not affected by the further addition of an excess of nonradioactive TID or other noncompetitive antagonists, that is the labeling is “nonspecific.” Consistent with the hydrophobic nature of TID, it partitions extremely effectively into the lipid bilayer, and [125I]TID photoincorporation into amino acids in the transmembrane segments M1, M3, and M4 is interpreted as indicating that these residues are situated at the lipid-protein interface of the AChR (18.White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B.

Whereas TID binds with micromolar affinity to the AChR channel in both the resting and desensitized state (14.White B.H. Howard S. Cohen S.G. Cohen J.B. J. Biol.

In the resting state, [125I]TID reacts with homologous aliphatic residues in each M2 segment that are located 9 and 13 amino acid residues carboxyl-terminal to the conserved lysine residue at the amino terminus of the M2 region (e.g.δLeu-265 and δVal-269). These results provide important information about the NCA-binding site and suggest that the conserved leucine residues at position 9 (e.g. δLeu-265) may form a permeability barrier to the passage of ions in the resting state channel (16.White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15770-15783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The work presented here employs analogs of TID to examine further the molecular determinants of the NCA-binding site in the AChR channel in the resting state. The interaction of TID analogs with the NCA-binding site in the resting state channel were assessed in several ways as follows: 1) the ability of nonradioactive TID analogs to inhibit [125I]TID photoincorporation into the M2 segments of the resting state channel; 2) the pattern and agonist sensitivity of [125I]TID analog photoincorporation into AChR subunits in the resting state, as well as direct identification of the binding site of the TID analog, TID-benzylisobutylacetate ([125I]TIDBIBA); 3) the ability of NCAs that interact with the resting state channel to inhibit competitively photoincorporation of [125I]TID analogs into AChR subunits in the resting state. We found that the addition of a primary alcohol group to TID (position 1 of the benzene ring; TIDBA) has no significant effect on the interaction of the compound with the resting state channel. However, conversion of the alcohol function to acetate, isobutyl acetate, or to trimethyl acetate (TIDBAc, TIDBIBA, or TIDBTMAc) leads to rightward shifts (decreased potency) in the [125I]TID inhibition concentration-response curves and a progressive reduction in the agonist sensitivity of [125I]TID analog photoincorporation into AChR subunits. In addition, the ability of NCAs such as tetracaine to inhibit competitively [125I]TID analog photoincorporation into AChR subunits as well as the determination that the sites of [125I]TIDBIBA photoincorporation within the δM2 segment are identical to those of [125I]TID indicate that each of the TID analogs binds to a single site in the resting state channel. We conclude that relatively small structural additions to TID result in a progressive reduction in the TID analogs ability to bind to and photolabel the NCA site in the resting state channel. The structure-activity studies with TID analogs and the AChR lead us to suggest a model for the structure of the resting state channel and the NCA-binding site. AChR-rich membranes were isolated fromTorpedo californica electric organ (21.Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32940-32950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Reactivials were purchased from Pierce, silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates from Merck, and Na125I and [3H]TCP (55 Ci/mmol) from NEN Life Science Products. [125I]TID (∼10 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and stored in 75% ethanol at 4 °C. Organic chemicals including acetic anhydride, isobutyric anhydride, trimethylacetic anhydride, and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) were obtained from Aldrich. Amobarbital, pentobarbital, tetracaine, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)octyl ester (TMB-8), and α-bungarotoxin were purchased from Sigma and Research Biochemicals.l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin came from Worthington, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease from ICN, and Genapol C-100 (10%) from Calbiochem. Prestained low molecular weight gel standards were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [125I]TIDBA and [125I]TID-BE (Fig. 1) were prepared by radioiododestanylation of the tin-based precursors 4′-(3-trifluoromethyl-3H-diazirin-3-yl)-2′-tributylstannylbenzyl alcohol (TTDBA) and 4′-(3-trifluoromethyl-3H-diazirin-3-yl)-2′-tributylstannylbenzyl benzoate (TTD-BE), respectively (10.Blanton M.P. McCardy E.A. Huggins A. Parikh D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14545-14555Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22.Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23.Eichler J. Brunner J. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2188-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The tin-based precursors were a generous gift from Dr. Josef Brunner of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich, Switzerland. Briefly, 45 nmol of TTDBA or TTD-BE in ethanol/toluene (1:1) were added to a 1-ml Reactivial and dried under nitrogen. The dried material was dissolved in 20 μl of acetic acid, 2 mCi of Na125I was then added, and the iodination reaction initiated by the further addition of 5 μl of peracetic acid. After 15 min the reaction was quenched by adding 3 μl of NaI (100 mm) and 200 μl of sodium bisulfite (10% (w/w)). The radioiodinated compound was extracted into 400 μl of ethyl acetate (upper phase), which was removed and dried under nitrogen. The dried material was dissolved in 100 μl of ethanol/toluene (1:1), applied to a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate (5 × 20 cm), and developed with ether/hexane (1:9). The positions of [125I]TIDBA or [125I]TID-BE were determined by autoradiography. [125I]TIDBA (R f = 0.25) and [125I]TID-BE (R f = 0.74) were scraped from the TLC plate, extracted with 1 ml of ethanol, dried under nitrogen, dissolved in 50 μl of ethanol and stored at −20 °C. Nonradioactive stocks of TIDBA and TID-BE were made in nearly identical fashion, and the concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (ε351 nm = 450 (22.Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar)). The TID analogs TTDBAc, TTDBIBA, and TTDBTMAc were made by acylation of the alcohol function of the tin precursor TTDBA (22.Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of TTDBA (1.8 μmol) was added to a 300-μl Reactivial, the solvent removed by a stream of N2 gas, and 4 μmol of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) and 100 μl of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran added. Under anhydrous conditions, 50 μmol of either acetic anhydride, isobutyric anhydride, or trimethylacetic anhydride were added, and the acylation reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at room temperature (in the dark). Following solvent evaporation and resuspension in ethanol, each of the tin precursors were purified by TLC (ether/hexane, 1:9), TTDBAc (R f = 0.58), TTDBIBA (R f = 0.72), and TTDBTMAc (R f = 0.78). The concentration of each purified tin precursor was checked spectrophotometrically (ε364 nm = 450). [125I]TIDBAc, [125I]TIDBIBA, and [125I]TIDBTMAc (Fig. 1) as well as nonradioactive analogs were produced from the corresponding tin precursor and purified in a fashion identical to that described above for [125I]TIDBA. For labeling experiments, Torpedo AChR-rich membranes (1 mg/ml in Vesicle Dialysis Buffer (VDB), 10 mmMOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either [125I]TID, [125I]TIDBA, [125I]TIDBAc, [125I]TIDBIBA, or [125I]TIDBTMAc at a final concentration of ∼1.6 μm (0.4 μm for [125I]TID) and with or without 400 μmcarbamylcholine chloride or drugs at various concentrations (see text). For analytical labeling experiments, approximately 1 mg of AChR membranes were used and 10 mg (per condition) for preparative labelings. Incubations were performed in either glass test tubes or vials and under reduced lighting conditions. The samples were then irradiated with a 365 nm UV lamp (Spectroline EN-280L) for 7 min at a distance of less than 1 cm and centrifuged at 39,000 ×g for 1 h. Pellets were solubilized in electrophoresis sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). For analytical labelings 1.0-mm thick SDS-PAGE gels were used (1.5-mm thick for preparative labeling experiments) containing separating gels composed of 8% polyacrylamide, 0.33% bisacrylamide. Following electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 to visualize AChR subunit bands. Analytical gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat LS film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C (1–3-day exposure). Preparative gels and analytical gels for which receptor subunits were to be subjected to proteolytic mapping were soaked in distilled water overnight, and the bands for α-, β-, γ-, and δ-subunits excised from the 8% gels. Proteolytic mapping of the sites of [125I]TID analog photoincorporation within AChR subunits was performed according to the method of Clevelandet al. (25.Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as described in detail in Blanton et al. (10.Blanton M.P. McCardy E.A. Huggins A. Parikh D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14545-14555Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For preparative gels, AChR subunits were eluted from the excised gel pieces into 15 ml of Elution Buffer (0.1 mNH4HCO3, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.8) for 4 days at room temperature with gentle mixing. The gel suspensions were then filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper and concentrated using a Centriprep-10 (Amicon). Excess SDS was removed by acetone precipitation (∼85% acetone at −20 °C for 12 h). For analytical labeling experiments, [125I]TID photoincorporation into AChR subunits was quantified by cutting out the receptor bands from the dried 8% acrylamide gel and determining the amount of 125I cpm present in each band by γ-counting in a Packard Cobra II gamma counter (10 min counting time/band). For [125I]TID analog competition labeling experiments (Figs.2 and 4), the data points were determined according to Equation 1. %specific [ 125I]TID analog photoincorporation into AChR γ­subunit=Equation 1 (cpm[drug]−cpm[carb]/(cpm[control]−cpm[carb])×100The cpm[drug] is the amount of [125I]TID analog photoincorporation into the AChR γ-subunit at a given concentration of drug; cpm[carb]is the amount of [125I]TID analog incorporated into the γ-subunit in the presence of the agonist carbamylcholine, and cpm[control] is the amount of [125I]TID analog incorporated into the γ-subunit in the absence of any other ligand. Subtracting the cpm incorporated into the γ-subunit in the presence of agonist (carbamylcholine) from the data points restricts the [125I]TID analog labeling to that which is specifically localized to the channel-lining M2 segment (14.White B.H.

The concentration-response data were curve-fitted by nonlinear least squares analysis (one-site competition) using the graphical curve-fitting program Prism (Graphpad).Figure 4The effect of the noncompetitive antagonist TMB-8 on the photoincorporation of [125I]TIDBIBA into AChR-rich membranes. AChR-rich membranes were equilibrated (2 h) with [125I]TIDBIBA (∼1.6 μm) in the absence (1st to 7th lanes) and in the presence (8th lane) of 400 μmcarbamylcholine (agonist) or in the presence of increasing concentrations of the AChR noncompetitive antagonist TMB-8 (2nd to 7th lanes). AChR-rich membranes were then irradiated at 365 nm for 7 min, and polypeptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE. A, shown is the corresponding autoradiograph of the gel containing the competition labeling experiment [125I]TIDBIBA versus TMB-8. The positions of the AChR subunits are indicated on the left. B, for each [125I]TID analog versusTMB-8 competition labeling experiment, individual AChR subunit bands were excised from the dried gel, and the amount of [125I]TID analog photoincorporated into each subunit determined by gamma counting. The data points for [125I]TIDBIBA (●), [125I]TID (○), and [125I]TIDBTMAc (▪) photoincorporation into the AChR γ-subunit are shown and were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For [125I]TIDBIBA and [125I]TID the solid and dashed lines represent, respectively, the nonlinear least squares fit of each of the binding data sets. The IC50 values calculated from these curves are shown in Table IV. For [125I]TIDBTMAc, photoincorporation into the γ-subunit was expressed simply as a percentage of the amount of photoincorporation determined in the absence of any other drug. No significant (>10%) difference in the extent of [125I]TIDBTMAc photoincorporation into the γ-subunit was detected at any concentration of TMB-8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) AChRs were photolabeled with [125I]TIDBIBA (10 mg of AChR-rich membranes per labeling condition) under conditions that favor either the resting state or the desensitized state (i.e. in the presence of the agonist carbamylcholine). AChR subunits were resolved on 1.5-mm thick 8% acrylamide gels, and the δ-subunit was isolated as described above. For digestion with trypsin, acetone-precipitated δ-subunits were resuspended in approximately 300 μl of 0.1m NH4HCO3, 0.02% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% Genapol C-100, pH 7.8 (1–2 mg/ml protein). Trypsin was added at a 20% (w/w) enzyme to substrate ratio, and the digestion was allowed to proceed 4–5 days at room temperature. A small aliquot of each sample was electrophoresed on an analytical (1.0-mm thick) 16.5% T, 6% C Tricine SDS-PAGE gel with at least one reference lane containing prestained low molecular weight protein standards (Life Technologies, Inc). The Tricine gel was stained, destained, and dried for autoradiography. The bulk of the δ-subunit tryptic digests were solubilized in electrophoresis sample buffer and submitted to preparative (1.5-mm thick) scale 16.5% T, 6% C Tricine gel analysis (10.Blanton M.P.

By using the autoradiograph from the analytical Tricine gel in conjunction with the prestained protein standards, an approximately 5-kDa band known to contain the M2 segment of the δ-subunit (δT-5K (13.Blanton M.P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15770-15783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was excised from the gel and eluted into 4 ml of Elution Buffer for 4 days at room temperature. The δT-5K fragment was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a Brownlee Aquapore C4 column (100 × 2.1 mm) with Solvent A (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and Solvent B (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile, 40% 2-propanol). A nonlinear elution gradient was employed (25–100% Solvent B in 80 min), and the elution of peptides was monitored by the absorbance at 210 nm. Collected fractions were counted for radioactivity, and the peak protein/radioactivity-containing fractions were pooled, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and resuspended in 20 μl of 0.1 mNH4HCO3, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, pH 7.8, for protein radiosequence analysis. Amino-terminal sequence analysis was performed on a Beckman Instruments (Porton) model 20/20 protein sequencer using gas phase cycles (Texas Tech University Biotechnology Core Facility). Peptide aliquots (25 μl) were immobilized on chemically modified glass fiber disks (Beckman Instruments), which were used to improve the sequencing yields of hydrophobic peptides. Approximately 20% of the release PTH-derivatives were separated by an on-line PTH-derivative analyzer, and approximately 80% was collected for determination of released 125I cpm by γ-counting of each sample for 20 min. Initial yield (Io) and repetitive yield (R) were calculated by nonlinear least squares regression of the observed release (M) for each cycle (n): M = Io R n (PTH-derivatives of Cys and His were omitted from the fit). In these studies, we wished to examine the molecular determinants of [125I]TID interaction with the AChR channel in the resting state. Nonradioactive analogs of TID (Fig. 1) were first constructed, and their ability to inhibit [125I]TID photoincorporation into the resting state channel was tested. In the absence of agonist (resting state AChR), the majority (>75%) of [125I]TID photoincorporation into individual AChR subunits reflects labeling of amino acid residues in the M2 transmembrane segment, with the M2 segment of each subunit collectively constituting the resting state channel (14.White B.H. Howard S. Cohen S.G. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21595-21607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15770-15783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of the AChR agonist carbamylcholine, or NCAs such as tetracaine or TMB-8, reduces by greater than 75% the photoincorporation of [125I]TID into receptor subunits (16.White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15770-15783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Moore M.A. McCarthy M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), reflecting an identical reduction in the extent of [125I]TID photoincorporation into amino acids in the M2 segment of each receptor subunit. To assay the effect of each TID analog on [125I]TID photoincorporation into the resting state channel, AChR-rich membranes were equilibrated in the absence of agonist with [125I]TID and increasing concentrations of a given TID analog. Following UV irradiation and SDS-PAGE, all four AChR subunits are labeled (Fig. 2 A) with the extent of [125I]TID photoincorporation into the γ-subunit ∼4-fold greater than that into the α-, β-, or δ-subunits (Fig. 2 A, 1st lane). Addition of agonist alone (400 μm carbamylcholine) decreased the extent of [125I]TID photoincorporation into each receptor subunit of the desensitized state AChR by 75% or greater (93% reduction for γ-subunit; Fig. 2 A, 8th lane). As shown representatively by the isobutylacetate analog of TID (TIDBIBA; Fig. 2 A, 2nd to 7th lanes), each TID analog tested reduced the extent of [125I]TID photoincorporation into receptor subunits in a concentration-dependent fashion. The concentration dependence of the reduction of [125I]TID photoincorporation into AChR subunits by each TID analog was quantified by excising the individual AChR subunit bands from the dried polyacrylamide gel and determining the amount of125I cpm present by γ-counting. The extent of [125I]TID photoincorporation into receptor subunits in the presence of high concentrations of NCAs (including TID itself) comp"
https://openalex.org/W2091667391,"Expression of dopamine β-monooxygenase (DBM), the enzyme that converts dopamine into norepinephrine, is limited to adrenal chromaffin cells and a small population of neurons. We studied DBM trafficking to regulated granules by stably expressing rat DBM in AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells, which contain regulated granules, and in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which lack regulated granules. The behavior of exogenous DBM in both cell lines was compared with endogenous DBM in adrenal chromaffin cells. CHO cells secreted active DBM, indicating that production of active enzyme does not require features unique to neuroendocrine cells. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that early steps in DBM maturation followed a similar time course in AtT-20, CHO, and adrenal chromaffin cells. Use of a conformation-sensitive DBM antiserum indicated that acquisition of a folded structure occurred with a similar time course in all three cell types. Cell type-specific differences in DBM trafficking became apparent only when storage in granules was examined. As expected, DBM was stored in secretory granules in chromaffin cells; CHO cells failed to store DBM. Despite the fact that AtT-20 cells have regulated granules, exogenous DBM was not stored in these granules. Thus storage of DBM in secretory granules requires cell type specific factors."
