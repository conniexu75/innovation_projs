To address the question of whether Ras and Raf are involved in the induction of VEGF gene expression by PDGF and TPA, we examined the effects of both factors on NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with v-Ha-ras or v-raf. In serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells, only low levels of mRNA expression can be detected, whereas both ras and raf transformed cell lines express enhanced levels of a 4.3-kilobase VEGF transcript. Stimulation with PDGF or TPA resulted in increased VEGF mRNA in all cell lines, with highest levels found in the transformed cells. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that the elevated VEGF mRNA expression correlated with enhanced protein levels. Positive immunofluorescence signals could be detected in v-Ha-ras or v-raf transformed cell lines but not in unstimulated NIH 3T3 cells. VEGF from conditioned medium of v-raf transformed NIH 3T3 cells was partially purified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose. Biological activity of this VEGF protein was demonstrated by competition with binding of recombinant 125I-VEGF165 to human umbilical vein endothelial cells and by its ability to stimulate proliferation of these cells.

Using the interaction between α5β1 and fibronectin as a model system, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of the effects of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ on ligand binding. Each cation had distinct effects on the ligand-binding capacity of α5β1: Mn2+ promoted high levels of ligand binding, Mg2+ promoted low levels of binding, and Ca2+ failed to support binding. Studies of the effects of different combinations of cations on ligand binding indicated that the cation-binding sites within α5β1 are not all identical, or of broad specificity, but instead each site shows a distinct preference for one or more cations. Ca2+ strongly inhibited Mn2+-supported ligand binding, but this inhibition was noncompetitive, suggesting that Ca2+ recognizes different cation-binding sites to Mn2+. In contrast, Ca2+ acted as a direct competitive inhibitor of Mg2+-supported ligand binding, implying that Ca2+ can displace Mg2+ from the integrin. However, low concentrations of Ca2+ greatly increased the apparent affinity of Mg2+ for its binding site, suggesting the existence of a distinct high affinity Ca2+-binding site. Taken together, our results imply that the ligand-binding capacity of α5β1 can be regulated in a complex manner through separate classes of binding sites for Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+.

Cell adhesion is of fundamental importance to many normal biological processes, including wound healing, embryonic cell migration, and the function of the immune system. Conversely, aberrant cell adhesion contributes to the pathogenesis of a large number of common human disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and tumor cell metastasis in cancer. Many cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are mediated by members of the integrin superfamily of cell-surface receptors. Integrins are αβ heterodimers that have been classified into eight different groups according to the identity of their β subunit. The β1 family is the principal group of cell-matrix receptors (Hynes, 1992, 1994; Ruoslahti et al., 1994). Integrin-ligand interactions are dependent on divalent cations, but the precise role of divalent cations in ligand binding has not yet been elucidated. The N-terminal portion of the integrin α subunits comprises seven homologous, tandemly-repeated domains of ∼50 amino acid residues. Domains 4-7 (or in some subunits, 5-7) contain sequence motifs similar to the Ca2+-binding EF-hands in proteins such as calmodulin. However, the integrin divalent cation-binding motif differs from classical EF-hand sequences in that it lacks an essential oxygenated residue at the -z coordination position. Hence, it has been proposed that integrin ligands, such as RGD, may supply a crucial aspartate residue to complete the coordination geometry of the divalent cation (Corbi et al., 1987; Humphries, 1990). This hypothesis therefore suggests that divalent cations may act as bridge between ligand and receptor. Chemical cross-linking experiments have provided direct evidence for the role of integrin EF-hand-like sites in ligand binding. Specifically, the binding site of a sequence from the fibrinogen γ chain has been mapped to the fifth repeat of αIIb (D'Souza et al., 1990), and a peptide corresponding to the EF-hand-like sequence in this repeat bound to fibrinogen in a divalent-cation-dependent manner (D'Souza et al., 1991). Similarly, cross-linking of an RGD peptide to αVβ3 localized the ligand-binding site between the second and sixth domains of the αV subunit (Smith and Cheresh, 1990). The importance of cation coordination in ligand binding by integrins has been demonstrated directly by the covalent coupling of Co(III) to αvβ3 (Smith and Cheresh, 1991). In addition, a recombinant fragment of αIIb that spans the EF-hand-like domains has been shown to contain multiple Ca2+ binding sites (Gulino et al., 1992), and a modeling study of hybrid integrin-calmodulin EF-hands predicts the integrin loop to support divalent cation chelation (Tuckwell et al., 1992). A highly conserved region is found toward the N terminus of integrin β subunits suggesting that this sequence may be functionally important. Cross-linking studies have shown that this region in the β3 subunit is proximal to the ligand-binding site (D'Souza et al., 1988; Smith and Cheresh, 1988). In addition, mutation of oxygenated residues in this region (Loftus et al., 1990; Bajt and Loftus, 1994) results in a receptor that is deficient in binding both cation and ligand. The sequence containing these residues shows some homology to a cation-binding sequence found in integrin I domains (Michishita et al., 1993; Bajt and Loftus, 1994; Lee et al., 1995). In an important recent advance, a synthetic peptide comprising this region of β3 (residues 118-131) was shown to bind both the Ca2+ analogue Tb3+ and RGD peptides (D'Souza et al. 1994). Ligand binding caused displacement of cation from this peptide, and a similar displacement of cations from αIIbβ3 by ligands was also observed. Based on these results, a mechanism of integrin-ligand binding has been proposed, termed the “cation displacement hypothesis” (D'Souza et al. 1994). In this mechanism, cation, ligand, and receptor initially form a ternary complex in which ligand is bridged to the integrin through the cation, and cation is subsequently displaced from the ligand-binding site. Cation binding by integrins has also been shown to be associated with conformational changes. For example, expression of the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1The abbreviations used are: mAbmonoclonal antibodyCCBDcentral cell-binding domain of fibronectinBSAbovine serum albuminMES4-morpholinoethane-sulfonic acidELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 24 on αLβ2 is dependent on Mg2+ (or Mn2+), and mAb 24 epitope expression correlates with the ability to bind ligand (Dransfield and Hogg, 1989; Dransfield et al., 1992a, 1992b). Hence, an alternative hypothesis for the role of divalent ions in integrin function is that cation binding is required to cause a conformational change in the integrin that renders it competent to bind ligand. monoclonal antibody central cell-binding domain of fibronectin bovine serum albumin 4-morpholinoethane-sulfonic acid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A number of important questions concerning the cation-binding sites on integrins are currently unresolved. First, do the cation-binding sites bind only one type of divalent cation, or do they all have a broad specificity? Second, is there only a single cation-binding site involved in ligand recognition or can occupancy of more than one site support ligand binding? Third, why does Mn2+ confer a much higher ligand-binding affinity on many integrins than Ca2+ or Mg2+ (Gailit and Ruoslahti, 1988; Altieri, 1991; Elices et al., 1991; Dransfield et al., 1992b; Kern et al., 1993; Sanchez-Aparicio et al., 1993)? The extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin has served as a prototype substrate for the study of integrin-ligand interactions, and several regions of the molecule have been shown to be responsible for its adhesive activity. One domain that is recognized by a wide variety of cell types lies close to the center of the fibronectin subunit and contains the tripeptide RGD as a key active site (Pierschbacher and Ruoslahti, 1984; Yamada and Kennedy, 1984). The integrin α5β1 is the major receptor for this central cell-binding domain (CCBD) and is expressed on many cell types. Here we have studied the role of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ in modulating α5β1-fibronectin interactions. We show that either Mn2+or Mg2+, but not Ca2+, can support ligand binding. However, Ca2+ strongly modulates ligand binding supported by Mn2+ or Mg2+ and acts as a direct competitive inhibitor of Mg2+-supported binding but not of Mn2+-supported binding. Our results suggest the existence of distinct classes of cation-binding sites for each divalent ion. Rat mAbs 16 and 13 recognizing the human α5 and β1 integrin subunits, respectively, were produced and purified as described previously (Akiyama et al., 1989). An 80-kDa fragment of fibronectin containing the CCBD was purified from a trypsin digest of plasma fibronectin as described by Garcia-Pardo et al.(1989). The synthetic peptide GRGDS was synthesized using Fmoc (N-9-fluoroenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer and purified as described previously (Humphries et al., 1986, 1987). K562 erythroleukemia cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Porton Down, UK) and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and 2 mM glutamine (all from Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland, UK). Cell attachment assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, High Wycombe, Bucks, UK). Wells were coated for 60 min at room temperature with 100-μl aliquots of 80-kDa CCBD fragment (1 μg/ml) diluted with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and then sites on the plastic for nonspecific cell adhesion were blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 100 μl of 10 mg/ml heat-denatured BSA. Cells were resuspended to 2 × 106/ml in 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Hepes, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice in Hepes-buffered saline (HBS; 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) and resuspended in the same buffer. Aliquots of cells (50 μl) were then added to the microtiter wells and incubated with 50-μl aliquots of Hepes-buffered saline containing 2× the final concentration of divalent cations (MnCl2, MgCl2, or CaCl2) for 20 min at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 6% (v/v) CO2. To estimate the reference value for 100% attachment, cells in quadruplicate wells coated with polylysine (500 μg/ml) were fixed immediately by direct addition of 100 μl of 5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Unbound and loosely bound cells in experimental wells were removed by shaking, and the remaining cells were then fixed as described above for reference wells. The fixative was aspirated, the wells were washed 3 times with 200 μl of H2O, and attached cells were stained with Crystal Violet (Sigma) by a modification of the method of Kueng et al.(1989). 100 μl of 0.1% (w/v) Crystal Violet in 200 mM MES, pH 6.0, was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Excess dye was removed by three washes of 200 μl of H2O, and bound dye was solubilized with 100 μl of 10% (v/v) acetic acid. The absorbance of each well at 570 nm was then measured using a multiscan ELISA reader (Dynatech, Billingshurst, UK). Each sample was assayed in quadruplicate, and background attachment to BSA was subtracted from all measurements. Term placenta was obtained from Dr. J. Aplin, St. Mary's Hospital, Manchester, UK. Placenta (∼500 g) was cut into small chunks with scissors and homogenized in a blender (Philips) with 400 ml of buffer A (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.005% digitonin). The homogenate was stored at −70°C. Homogenate was thawed at room temperature and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The pelleted material was then mixed with 600 ml of buffer A on ice for 10 min and centrifuged as above. The pellet was extracted on ice for 1.5 h with 400 ml of buffer B (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml BSA). The extract was centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 10 min and then at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was preadsorbed by passing it through a column of Sepharose 4B (30 ml), and then by mixing it with 10 ml of rat IgG-Sepharose (2 mg IgG/ml of beads) for 2 h on ice. IgG-Sepharose was then removed by centrifugation (5 min at 180 × g) and column filtration, and the eluate was mixed with 8 ml of mAb 13-Sepharose (2 mg of IgG/ml of beads) for 2 h on ice. The suspension was then packed into a 1.6 cm diameter column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and washed overnight (16 h) at 15 ml/h with buffer C (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100). Bound material was eluted with buffer D (10 mM NaOAc, pH 3.5, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) at 45 ml/h. 1.5-ml fractions were collected into 0.5 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. Aliquots of the fractions (25 μl) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 6% nonreducing resolving gel and Coomassie Blue staining and found to contain β1 integrins of ≥90% purity. Pooled fractions were then mixed with 2 ml of mAb 16-Sepharose (5 mg IgG/ml Sepharose) for 2 h on ice. The suspension was then packed into a 0.8-cm diameter column and washed with 12 ml of buffer C. Bound material was eluted with buffer D, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected and neutralized with 0.1 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. Aliquots of the fractions (25 μl) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 6% nonreducing resolving gel. The only bands detected by Coomassie Blue staining were those corresponding to expected positions of the α5 and β1 subunits. α5 and β1 were the only integrin subunits detected in the eluted fractions by ELISA. Mononuclear cells were purified from ∼100 leukocyte concentrates (provided by the Blood Transfusion Service, Lancaster, UK) by centrifugation on Histopaque 1077 (Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK). Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min, and extracted with 100 ml of buffer B on ice for 30 min. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was precleared by rotary mixing with 4 ml of rat IgG-Sepharose beads for 1 h at room temperature. IgG-Sepharose was prepared by coupling at a ratio of 2 mg of IgG to 1 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The IgG-Sepharose was removed by column filtration, and the filtrate was rotary mixed with 5 ml of mAb 13-Sepharose (2 mg IgG/ml Sepharose) for 2 h at room temperature. The suspension was then packed into a 1.6-cm diameter column and washed overnight at 4°C with buffer C. Bound material was eluted with buffer D, and 1.5-ml fractions were collected and neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. Aliquots of the fractions (50 μl) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 7.5% nonreducing resolving gel and Coomassie Blue staining and were shown to contain β1 integrins of ≥90% purity. α5β1 was found to be a major component of this mixture by ELISA, although α2β1, α4β1, and α6β1 were also present. Only trace amounts of other β1 integrins (α3β1 and αVβ1) could be detected by ELISA. 80-kDa CCBD fragment of fibronectin (500 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was mixed with an equal mass of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimido biotin (Pierce, Chester, UK) and rotary mixed for 30-40 min at room temperature. The mixture was then dialyzed against several changes of 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to remove excess biotin. Solid-phase receptor-ligand binding was performed by a modification of the method of Charo et al.(1990). Purified α5β1 from placenta or β1 integrins from mononuclear cells (both at a concentration of ∼0.5 mg/ml) were diluted 1:500 or 1:200, respectively, with phosphate-buffered saline containing divalent cations, and 100-μl aliquots were added to the wells of a 96-well ELISA plate (Immulon 3, Dynatech). Plates were incubated overnight at room temperature, and wells were blocked for 1-3 h with 200 μl of 5% (w/v) BSA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Wells were then washed 3 times with 200 μl of 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 1 mg/ml BSA (buffer E). In experiments examining the role of cations in ligand binding, 100-μl aliquots of biotinylated CCBD fragment (typically 0.1 μg/ml) were diluted in buffer E with varying concentrations of MnCl2, MgCl2, or CaCl2 (alone or in combination). For experiments examining the effect of antibodies or RGD peptides on ligand binding, biotinylated ligand diluted in buffer E with 1 mM MnCl2 was added to the wells with or without antibodies or peptides. The plate was then incubated at 30°C for 3 h. Biotinylated ligand was aspirated, and the wells were washed 3 times with buffer A. Bound ligand was quantitated by the addition of 1:200 ExtrAvidin-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) in buffer E with 1 mM MnCl2 for 10 min. Wells were then washed 4 times with buffer E, and color was developed using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma). Measurements obtained were the mean ± S.D. of six replicate wells. The amount of nonspecific binding was measured by determining the level of ligand binding to wells coated with BSA alone; these values were subtracted from the corresponding values for receptor-coated wells. Results shown are representative of at least three separate experiments. Data shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 were obtained using placental α5β1, data shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 5 Fig. 6 were obtained using β1 integrins from mononuclear cells, although both integrin preparations gave essentially identical results. Curve fitting (nonlinear regression analysis) to estimate apparent dissociation constants was performed as described previously (Mould et al., 1994). For double-reciprocal plots, data were normalized to zero ligand binding in the absence of the supporting cation (Mn2+ or Mg2+). Linear regression analysis of double-reciprocal plots was performed using SigmaPlot version 6; for clarity, not all of the data points are shown in some of these analyses. Under the conditions used in these assays (α5β1 coating concentration ∼4 nM) the ELISA signal appeared to be directly proportional to the amount of bound ligand because plots of 1/absorbance versus 1/[free ligand] (not shown) did not deviate from linearity at high ligand concentrations.Figure 2Effect of Ca2+ on Mn2+-supported binding of CCBD fragment to α5β1. The ability of Ca2+ to interfere with ligand binding supported by 100 μM Mn2+ was measured for a range of Ca2+ concentrations. In the experiment shown above, the level of ligand binding in 8 mM Ca2+ alone was 0.032 ± 0.010.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3A, effect of 8 mM Ca2+ on the binding of CCBD fragment to α5β1 at varying Mn2+ concentrations. ●, Mn2+ alone; ■, Mn2+ with 8 mM Ca2+.

We chose to use an 80-kDa fragment from the CCBD of fibronectin as the ligand in these experiments because it contains only one integrin recognition domain. Native dimeric fibronectin, which contains an α5β1 recognition site in both subunits, could show cooperative binding to immobilized integrins. For the solid phase assays described in this report, we used either an affinity-purified preparation of α5β1 from human placenta or a partially pure preparation of α5β1 from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells; essentially identical results were obtained from these two preparations. In the initial characterization of this assay, binding of the CCBD fragment was found to be inhibited >90% by an antifunctional antibody to the α5 subunit and to be completely inhibited by either EDTA or GRGDS peptide (results not shown). K562 cells were chosen for the attachment assays because α5β1 is the only β1 integrin expressed by these cells (Hemler et al., 1987). In agreement with previous studies (Wayner et al., 1989; Faull et al., 1993), we found that the attachment of K562 cells to the CCBD fragment was mediated solely by α5β1 (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in the two assay systems (Fig. 1, A and B). These data suggest that cell-surface α5β1 and α5β1 in solid phase assays behave in a similar manner with respect to the divalent cation dependence of receptor-ligand interactions. Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ had markedly different effects on α5β1-fibronectin interactions. Both Mn2+ and Mg2+ promoted ligand binding, although Mn2+ supported higher levels of binding than Mg2+. In contrast, Ca2+ supported little or no binding. In the cell attachment assay, low levels of attachment were observed in the absence of cations, and this level was decreased with increasing concentrations of Ca2+. Comparison of the concentration of Mn2+ and Mg2+ to give half-maximal ligand binding in the solid phase assay (Table 1) suggested that the affinity of Mn2+ for its binding site(s) on α5β1 was ∼40-fold higher than that of Mg2+. Scatchard-type analysis of the binding curves (not shown) indicated that there was only a single site (or a single class of sites) for Mn2+ and Mg2+ on α5β1 for which cation occupancy supports ligand binding. Such sites have been termed “ligand-competent” sites (Smith et al., 1994).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Since the solid phase assay was found to be highly reproducible, and also avoided possible artifacts from cation effects on cellular components other than integrins, we chose to use this assay for a detailed study of the effects of combinations of cations on ligand binding. Since Ca2+ failed to support ligand binding, we first investigated whether Ca2+ could reduce the high levels of ligand binding supported by Mn2+. Fig. 2 shows the result of an experiment in which the concentration of Mn2+ was kept constant at 100 μM and the concentration of Ca2+ was varied. Ca2+ strongly inhibited Mn2+-supported ligand binding, although even at a very high Ca2+ concentration (8 mM) ligand binding was not abrogated. In contrast, Mg2+ did not significantly inhibit Mn2+-supported binding even at 8 mM (results not shown). To further analyze the effects of Ca2+ on Mn2+-supported ligand-binding, we examined the effects of varying the concentration of Mn2+ at constant Ca2+. Fig. 3A shows the inhibition of ligand binding by 8 mM Ca2+. Ca2+ greatly reduced the maximal level of ligand binding but did not significantly alter the concentration of Mn2+ required for half-maximal ligand binding. A double-reciprocal plot of these data (Fig. 3B) indicated that the inhibition observed at high Ca2+ concentrations is noncompetitive in nature. A detailed analysis of the effects of lower Ca2+ concentrations on Mn2+-supported ligand binding (not shown) suggested that Ca2+ binding at multiple sites on the integrin was responsible for its inhibitory effects; however, Ca2+ binding to any of these sites did not decrease the apparent affinity of Mn2+ for its ligand-competent site. An important inference from these studies is therefore that, Ca2+ does not compete with Mn2+ for binding to the Mn2+ ligand-competent site on α5β1, and therefore appears to bind to different sites. To investigate whether Ca2+ could act as an inhibitor of ligand binding promoted by Mg2+, we initially investigated the effect of Ca2+ on ligand binding supported by different Mg2+ concentrations. At high Mg2+ concentrations, only a partial inhibition of ligand binding was observed (result not shown), whereas for low Mg2+ concentrations ligand binding was significantly increased at low Ca2+ concentrations. Fig. 4 shows an experiment in which the concentration of Mg2+ was kept constant at 50 μM and the concentration of Ca2+ varied between 0 and 4 mM. Two phases were apparent. In the first phase there was a marked stimulation in ligand binding, with a concentration of Ca2+ for half-maximal increase of ∼30 μM and which reached a maximum at ∼0.2-0.5 mM Ca2+. In the second phase, ligand binding was inhibited at high concentrations of Ca2+; at very high Ca2+ concentrations ligand binding approached the low levels observed in Ca2+ alone (not shown). These results suggest that there are at least two Ca2+-binding sites on α5β1 and that these sites have opposing influences on ligand binding supported by low concentrations of Mg2+. Binding of Ca2+ to a high affinity site (the first phase) stimulates ligand binding, whereas binding of Ca2+ to a low affinity site (the second phase) inhibits ligand binding. To analyze the first of these two phases, we tested the effect of a low concentration of Ca2+ (0.25 mM) on ligand binding supported by different Mg2+ concentrations (Fig. 5A). The results showed that low Ca2+ concentrations have two effects on ligand binding; at low Mg2+ concentrations ligand binding is increased, whereas at high Mg2+ concentrations the maximal amount of bound ligand is reduced. The concentration of Mg2+ required for half-maximal ligand binding in these assays (∼40 μM) was decreased ∼30-fold compared with that for Mg2+ alone (see Table 1). This increase in affinity of Mg2+ for its ligand-competent site appears to be the mechanism by which Ca2+ stimulates ligand binding at low Mg2+ concentrations. A double-reciprocal plot of these data (Fig. 5B) showed that, at low concentrations, Ca2+ is a mixed-type inhibitor of ligand binding supported by Mg2+; it both increases the affinity of Mg2+ for its site and reduces the maximal level of ligand binding. To analyze the inhibition of Mg2+-supported ligand-binding by high Ca2+ concentrations (the second phase in Fig. 4) we compared the effect of 0.2 mM Ca2+ (a concentration that caused maximal stimulation of binding supported by low Mg2+ concentrations) with that of 8 mM (Fig. 6A). High concentrations of Ca2+ increased the concentration of Mg2+ required for half-maximal ligand binding but did not affect the maximal amount of ligand bound at high Mg2+ concentrations. The reciprocal plot (Fig. 6B) shows that the inhibition of ligand binding at high Ca2+ concentrations is competitive in nature. By nonlinear regression analysis, the KI value was calculated as ∼2 mM. Further analysis of the inhibition of Mg2+-supported ligand binding at different Ca2+ concentrations (not shown) indicated that this inhibition is directly competitive, i.e. Ca2+ is able to compete with Mg2+ for binding to the Mg2+ ligand-competent site. However, when this site is occupied by Ca2+, the integrin fails to bind ligand. Taken together, these data suggest: (a) that there is a Ca2+-binding site of high affinity, the occupancy of which converts the Mg2+ ligand-competent site into a high-affinity binding site for Mg2+ and (b) that Ca2+ is, however, also able to competitively inhibit the binding of Mg2+ to its ligand-competent site. However, since Ca2+ binds this latter site with only low affinity, high concentrations of Ca2+ are required to oppose the high affinity binding of Mg2+. Importantly, the observation that Ca2+ can act as a direct competitive inhibitor of Mg2+-supported binding but not of Mn2+-supported binding also suggests that the ligand-competent sites for these two ions may be distinct. In this report, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of the effects of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions on the ligand-binding capacity of the integrin α5β1. Our data show the following. (a) Only Mn2+ and Mg2+ support ligand binding. Although Ca2+ does not support ligand binding, it strongly modulates ligand binding supported by Mn2+ or Mg2+. (b) Ca2+ is a noncompetitive inhibitor of Mn2+-supported ligand binding, suggesting that it does not compete with Mn2+ for binding to the Mn2+ ligand-competent site. (c) Ca2+ can either enhance or inhibit Mg2+-supported binding, depending on the concentrations of each ion. The results suggest that Ca2+ can compete directly with Mg2+ for binding to the Mg2+ ligand-competent site, but Ca2+ binding to a separate high affinity site also greatly increases the affinity of Mg2+ for its ligand-competent site. Taken together, these findings indicate that α5β1 possesses several distinct cation-binding sites, each of which has a different specificity for Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. Our studies of the effects of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ on fibronectin binding to α5β1 showed that this interaction was strongly promoted by Mn2+, and to a lesser extent by Mg2+. This pattern has been observed for many other integrins including α1β1 (Luque et al., 1994), α2β1 (Staatz et al., 1989; Kern et al., 1993), α3β1 (Weitzman et al., 1993), α6β1 (Sonnenberg et al., 1988), αVβ1 (Kirchhofer et al., 1991), and αLβ2 (Dransfield et al., 1992b). Ca2+ does, however, support ligand binding by a small number of integrins, including those of the β3 family (Kirchhofer et al., 1991; Smith et al., 1994). In a previous study (Gailit and Ruoslahti, 1988), Mn2+ and Mg2+ were found to support ligand binding by purified α5β1 in liposomes, with similar values for the cation concentrations required for half-maximal ligand binding as reported here. However, Ca2+ was also found to support ligand binding in the above study. Based on our findings that Ca2+ can synergize with low concentrations of Mg2+, this result may have been due to contamination of the Ca2+ samples with low concentrations of Mg2+. Similarly, an explanation for the low levels of K562 cell attachment we observed in the absence of exogenous cations or in the presence of low Ca2+ concentrations is probably that small amounts of Mg2+ are released from the cells during the time course of the experiment, high concentrations of Ca2+ were observed to inhibit this effect. A recent study of myeloid cell adhesion to fibronectin confirms our finding that Ca2+ alone does not support α5β1-ligand interactions and that Ca2+ also inhibits Mn2+- and Mg2+-supported adhesion (Davis and Camarillo, 1993). We found that the affinity of α5β1 for Mn2+ was ∼40-fold greater than that for Mg2+. It is a common feature of integrin-ligand interactions that typically >10-fold lower concentrations of Mn2+ are required to support ligand binding than Mg2+ (Altieri, 1991; Dransfield et al., 1992b; Kern et al., 1993; Michishita et al., 1993; Luque et al., 1994; Smith et al., 1994), indicating that many other integrins also contain one or more high affinity Mn2+-binding sites. An important implication from our observation that Ca2+ could competitively inhibit Mg2+-supported ligand binding but not Mn2+-supported binding is that there may be separate ligand-competent sites on α5β1 for Mn2+ and Mg2+. This may shed light on why Mn2+-supported ligand binding is of much higher affinity than that supported by Mg2+. We have also found that Mn2+ causes a larger increase than Mg2+ in the expression of an activation epitope on α5β1 recognized by the mAb 12G10 (Mould et al. 1995), 2A. P. Mould, A. N. Garrat, J. A. Askari, S. K. Akiyama, and M. J. Humphries, manuscript in preparation. suggesting that Mn2+ is better than Mg2+ at stabilizing a conformational change in the integrin required for ligand recognition. The existence of a separate high affinity Ca2+-binding site, distinct from the Mg2+ ligand-competent site, was suggested by the observation that low concentrations of Ca2+ greatly increased the apparent affinity of Mg2+ for its ligand-competent site. In summary, our studies suggest that at least three distinct cation-binding sites on α5β1 are involved in the regulation of integrin activity; a tentative model of these sites is shown in Fig. 7. Site 1 binds Mn2+ with high affinity; Ca2+ does not appear to compete with Mn2+ for binding to this site. Site 2 binds Mg2+ with low affinity. Both sites 1 and 2 are ligand-competent sites (Smith et al., 1994). Since, at high concentrations, Ca2+ acts as a direct competitive inhibitor of Mg2+ binding, Ca2+ can also bind to site 2, although with low affinity. Site 3 is a Ca2+-binding site of high affinity with characteristics of the “effector” site proposed by Smith et al.,(1994). Ca2+ binding to this site dramatically increases the affinity of Mg2+ for site 2. Ca2+ binding at sites 2 and 3 (or possibly at additional sites) may be responsible for its ability to noncompetitively inhibit ligand binding supported by Mn2+. Our results clearly indicate that the cation-binding sites on α5β1 are not all equivalent, neither are they of broad specificity, but instead each site shows a distinct selectivity for one or more cations. Binding of one cation to its site(s) can also affect the affinity of a second cation for its site(s); a similar cooperativity in cation binding has been observed for proteins such as calmodulin that contain multiple EF-hands (Strynadka and James, 1989). How the proposed cation-binding sites in Fig. 7 correspond to the putative divalent cation-binding sites in the α5 and β1 subunits and the molecular basis of their specificity will be the subject of future investigations. Such studies have the prospect of maping key sites involved in modulating integrin function. The model shown in Fig. 7 is similar in several respects to that proposed to explain the effects of Ca2+ and Mn2+ on ligand binding to αVβ3 (Smith et al., 1994). In this study, Ca2+ was found to be a mixed-type inhibitor of Mn2+-supported fibrinogen binding to αVβ3: low concentrations of Ca2+ slightly increased the affinity of Mn2+ binding to αVβ3 but decreased the amount of ligand bound at saturating Mn2+ concentrations. Since high concentrations of Ca2+ completely inhibited ligand binding, it was suggested that Ca2+ could also competitively inhibit the binding of Mn2+ to its site. Based on these results, a two-site model for αVβ3 was proposed in which Ca2+ binds to an effector site and Mn2+ (or Ca2+) to a ligand-competent site (Smith et al., 1994). However, in a recent study of osteopontin binding to αVβ3 (Hu et al., 1995), it was found that Ca2+ only decreased the association-rate of Mn2+-supported ligand binding but had no effect on the dissociation-rate, suggesting that Mn2+ and Ca2+ must bind to different sites on the integrin, with one cation influencing the on-rate and the other the off-rate of ligand binding. Hence this latter report endorses the concept that there are cation-binding sites on integrins that selectively bind only one type of divalent ion. Our model of the cation-binding sites in α5β1 may be broadly applicable to the other integrins that show similar divalent-cation requirements for ligand binding. For example, it has been shown for the αLβ2-ICAM-1 interaction that high concentrations of Ca2+ can compete with Mg2+, but not with Mn2+, for binding to the integrin (Jackson et al., 1994). Low concentrations of Ca2+ can, however, synergize with low concentrations of Mg2+ to increase ligand binding (Marlin and Springer, 1987). Hence αLβ2 may have a similar arrangement of cation-binding sites to α5β1. One intriguing implication from our results is that there may be one cation-binding site on the integrin that selectively binds Mn2+. Whether or not Mn2+ (or other transition metals) have a role in the regulation of integrin activity in vivo has been a matter of some speculation. It has been estimated that the concentration of Mn2+ in tissues is in the range 1-14 μM (Smith et al., 1994). Significant binding of fibronectin to α5β1 was induced by these concentrations of Mn2+in vitro, hence Mn2+ could potentially act as a physiological effector of α5β1. Since the majority of Mn2+ in the body is sequestered in bone, Mn2+ might also be an important regulator of integrins during bone resorption. Alternatively, the effects of Mn2+ observed in vitro could be fortuitous and not relevant in vivo. If it is possible to identify the Mn2+-binding site in α5β1 (e.g. through site-directed mutagenesis), then several approaches could be adopted to resolve this question. This will be the subject of future work. In conclusion, we have shown that Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ appear to recognize different sites on α5β1 and that each ion has distinct effects on the capacity of α5β1 to bind ligand. Since these cations have the ability to differentially regulate α5β1 function, it will be important in the future to examine the in vivo consequences of fluctuations in divalent cation concentrations on α5β1-mediated cell adhesion and migration, for example, during wound healing (Banai et al., 1990; Sank et al., 1989).

Moreover, the AVP-binding site is situated in a position equivalent to that described for the cationic neurotransmitters. Since all mutated residues are highly conserved in AVP and OT receptors, we propose that the same agonist-binding site is shared by all members of this receptor family. In contrast, the affinity for the antagonists tested, including those with a structure closely related to AVP, is not affected by mutations.

https://openalex.org/W2053213325,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a neurite-promoting factor, has an amino acid primary structure that is related to members of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family. Controlled proteolysis of native PEDF (50 kDa) with either trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, or subtilisin yields in each case one major limited product of 46 kDa as analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N-terminal sequence analysis of the isolated 46-kDa products indicates a favored cleavage region located toward the C-terminal end of PEDF. A proteolyzed PEDF protein reaction mixture reveals two overlapping sequences: that of the N terminus of intact PEDF and that of an internal region, consistent with cleavage of PEDF about position 382. These data indicate that PEDF protein has a globular conformation with one protease-sensitive exposed loop that contains the homologous serpin-reactive site. Cleavage within the reactive-site loop of PEDF does not cause a conformational change in the molecules (the stressed (<i>S</i>) → relaxed (<i>R</i>) transition) and results in heat denaturation identical to its native counterpart. This lack of conformational change is also seen upon cleavage within the reactive-site loop of the noninhibitory serpin ovalbumin. Furthermore, the PEDF neurite-promoting function is not lost with cleavage of the exposed loop. Recombinant PEDF polypeptide fragments with larger truncations from the C-terminal end show neurotrophic activity. Our results clearly indicate that integrity of the PEDF homologous serpin reactive center is dispensable for neurotrophic activity. Thus, the PEDF induction of neurites must be mediated by a mechanism other than serine protease inhibition. Altogether our data indicate that PEDF belongs to the subgroup of noninhibitory serpins and that its N-terminal region confers a neurite-promoting activity to the protein. The neurotrophic active site of PEDF is separated from the serpin reactive-site loop, not only in the primary structure, but also in the folded protein structure."

In this study, we have further characterized and identified the major proteins associated with very rapidly cleared large unilamellar vesicles. These liposomes contained phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and anionic phospholipids (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, or cardiolipin) that dramatically enhance the clearance rate of liposomes from the circulation. These anionic phospholipids are normally found exclusively in the interior of cells but become expressed when cells undergo apoptosis or programmed cell death, and thus, they are believed to be markers of cell senescence. Analysis of the proteins associated with these liposomes by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that two of the major proteins associated with the liposome membranes are proteins with electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to Mr of 66,000 and 50,000-55,000. The 66-kDa protein was identified to be serum albumin by immunoblot analysis. Using various biochemical and immunological methods, we have identified the 50-55-kDa protein as the murine equivalent of human β2-glycoprotein I. β2-glycoprotein I has a strong affinity for phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, and cardiolipin inasmuch as the levels of β2-glycoprotein I associated with these anionic liposomes approach or even exceed those of serum albumin, which is present in serum at a concentration 200-fold greater than β2-glycoprotein I. Further, we demonstrate that the amount of β2-glycoprotein I associated with liposomes, as quantitated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, is correlated with their clearance rates; moreover, the circulation residency time of cardiolipin-containing liposomes is extended in mice pretreated with anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies.

The site of phosphorylation of cPLA2 by MAPK has been identified as serine 505 in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and lies in a consensus sequence for this kinase(9Lin L.-L. Wartmann M.

In human platelets, cPLA2 is phosphorylated after thrombin stimulation, and this is associated with an increase in its specific activity(2Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26796-26804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both p42mapk and p44mapk are present in platelets(18Samiei M. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Biochim.

Blenis J. Forsman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 463-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the regulation of cPLA2 in human platelets stimulated by collagen and thrombin. Collagen binds to glycoprotein receptors on the platelet surface, which results in an increase in phospholipase C (PLC) activity through phosphorylation of PLCγ-2 on tyrosine residues(21Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Smith J.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Blake R.A. Schieven G.L. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, thrombin activates PLCβ isoforms via a G protein-dependent pathway(23Brass L.F. Hoxie J.A. Manning D.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of PKC and MAPK in the regulation of cPLA2, we used kinase inhibitors that block the intracellular signaling pathways elicited by collagen and thrombin. Staurosporine is a strong inhibitor of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases, including PKC, but its lack of specificity limits its use for studying the role of PKC(24Watson S.P. McNally J. Shipman L.J. Godfrey P.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P.

We therefore included the staurosporine analogue Ro 31-8220 in our study, which is a potent and more selective inhibitor of PKC(26Davis P.D. Hill C.H. Keech E. Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Sedgwick A.D.

The results demonstrate that cPLA2 undergoes phosphorylation in collagen- and thrombin-stimulated platelets independent of PKC and MAPK and that Ca2+ has a major role in its regulation independent of phosphorylation. Polyclonal antiserum against human cPLA2 was generated as described previously(2Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26796-26804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); polyclonal anti-p44mapk antibody (recognizing both p42mapk and p44mapk) was purchased from Santa Cruz (Devizes, Wilts, UK). Monoclonal anti-p42mapk antibody and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (TCS Biologicals Ltd., Bucks, UK); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (NA934), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (NA931) and ECL reagents were from Amersham Corp. 32Pi (specific activity, 8500-9120 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) and [5,6,8,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (specific activity, 180-240 Ci/mmol) were obtained from DuPont NEN. Prostacyclin and BW4AC were kindly donated by Wellcome Laboratories (Beckenham, Kent, UK). Ro 31-8220 was a gift from Roche Products (Welwyn Garden City, Herts, UK). Bovine thrombin, staurosporine, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), bovine myelin basic protein (MBP), protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma. BAPTA-AM and fura2-AM were from Calbiochem Novabiochem (Nottingham, UK). Collagen was purchased from Nycomed Arzneimittel (Munich, Germany). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Blood was drawn on the day of the experiment from healthy volunteers by venepuncture using acidic citrate dextrose (ACD: 120 mM sodium citrate, 110 mM glucose, 80 mM citric acid) as anticoagulant. All solutions were prewarmed to 30°C. The blood was centrifuged at 200 × g for 20 min to obtain platelet-rich plasma. Platelets were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml prostacyclin. The pellet was gently resuspended in 1 ml of Tyrode's buffer (20 mM HEPES, 135 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 0.35 mM Na2HPO4, 12 mM NaHCO3, and 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.3) and 150 μl of ACD. For the measurement of [3H]arachidonic acid release, this suspension was incubated with 5 μCi of [3H]arachidonic acid for 2 h. Platelets were washed with a mixture of 25 ml of Tyrode's and 3 ml of ACD and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min in the presence of prostacyclin. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Tyrode's buffer. For cPLA2 and pleckstrin phosphorylation, platelets were labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml 32Pi for 2 h. The volume of the platelet suspension was adjusted to give 4 × 108 cells/ml for the [3H]arachidonic acid release studies and 2 × 109 cells/ml for immunoprecipitation. Indomethacin (10 μM) was added to the platelet suspension in all experiments in order to block cyclooxygenase. For the study of [3H]arachidonic acid release, BW4AC (3 μM) was added to block lipoxygenase, and for immunoprecipitation procedures, EGTA (1 mM) was present to prevent platelet aggregation. The platelets were rested for 30 min at 30°C prior to experimentation. Platelets were preincubated with BAPTA-AM for 15 min or with other substances for 5 min at 37°C. The incubation mixture was gently shaken for 2 min during stimulation with thrombin, A23187, and PDBu or stirred in an aggregometer at 1200 rpm for 5 min during stimulation with collagen. Stimulation of platelets (200 μl) was stopped with an equal volume of 6% glutaraldehyde. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The radioactivity of an aliquot of the supernatant (300 μl) was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry in a Beckman scintillation counter to a 5% level of significance. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated with fura2-AM (3 μM) at 30°C for 45 min, and platelets were prepared as descibed above. The volume of the platelet suspension was adjusted to give 3 × 108 cells/ml, and indomethacin (10 μM) was added. Aliquots (450 μl) were incubated with either Me2SO (1%), Ro 31-8220 (10 μM), or staurosporine (10 μM) for 5 min or with BAPTA-AM (10 μM) for 15 min. Platelets were stimulated with thrombin (1 unit/ml) or collagen (100 μg/ml) at room temperature in a stirred solution. Fluorescence was measured at excitation wavelengths 340 and 380 nm with emission at 510 nm, using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter. Data are presented as the excitation fluorescence ratio (340:380 nm). The stimulation of 32Pi radiolabeled platelets (500 μl incubation volume) was stopped with an equal volume of lysis buffer (final concentrations: 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.75% deoxycholate, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μM pepstatin A, 10 μM staurosporine, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 50 mM NaF, 200 μM Na3VO4) and placed on ice for 30 min. The cell lysates were separated from insoluble material by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge, precleared with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (1:2 in H2O (v/v)) and incubated with 2 μl of polyclonal rabbit cPLA2 antiserum at 4°C for 2 h and with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for another 30 min. The immunoprecipitates were collected and washed 3 times with 1 ml of wash buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) followed by two washes with the wash buffer containing 750 mM NaCl and finally 2 times with the initial wash buffer. The immunoprecipitates were dried with strips of filter paper, extracted with Laemmli sample buffer, heated for 15 min at 60°C, and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were blocked with 10% BSA. Membranes were exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm at −70°C using intensifying screens for 1-7 days. Phosphorylation was quantified by densitometry. Electrophoretic mobility analyses to distinguish phosphorylated from nonphosphorylated cPLA2 was performed on 10% SDS-PAGE as described previously(2Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26796-26804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A small sample of 32Pi-labeled platelet lysate was removed prior to cPLA2 immunoprecipitation, placed in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and autoradiographed. Regions of the gels corresponding to pleckstrin were cut and scintillation counted for radioactivity. The stimulation of platelets (500-μl incubation volume) was stopped with an equal volume of denaturing lysis buffer (final concentrations: 2% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.3). Samples were boiled for 10 min and diluted 40-fold with Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T 20 mM Tris, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) containing 2 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM EDTA. After preclearing the platelet extracts for 1 h, they were incubated overnight with either 1 μg of polyclonal anti-p42/p44mapk antibody or with 1 μg of monoclonal anti-p42mapk antibody and 0.76 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG and with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (1:2 suspension) followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with TBS-T containing 1 mM EDTA, dried, and boiled for 10 min in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (during the last wash, one-tenth of the immunoprecipitate was removed for Western blotting controls). The immunoprecipitates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, with MBP (0.5 mg/ml) copolymerized in the polyacrylamide gel. The in-gel renaturation was carried out as described by Papkoff et al.(19Papkoff J. Chen R.-H. Blenis J. Forsman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 463-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, gels were washed twice in a mixture of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 20% isopropanol and then twice in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were denatured with 6 M guanidine HCl and then renatured for 16 h at 4°C with several changes of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 0.04% Tween 20. For the kinase assay, gels were incubated at 37°C for 1 h with 10 ml of kinase assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μM ATP, and 200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and then extensively washed in a mixture of 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% Na4P2O7. Gels were dried, and autoradiographs were exposed for up to 2 days at −70°C with intensifying screens. The region of MAPK was cut from the gel and scintillation counted for radioactivity. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with rabbit cPLA2 antiserum (1:10,000 in TBS-T containing 2% BSA) for 2 h or with polyclonal anti-p44mapk antibody (2 μg/ml in TBS-T/2% BSA and 0.1% NaN3) for 1 h. Blots were washed 5 times in TBS-T and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (1:20,000 in TBS-T, 1% BSA). For anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots, membranes were incubated with 4G10 (1:1,000 in TBS-T, 2% BSA) for 1 h, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (1:10,000 in TBS-T, 1% BSA) for 1 h. After further washing, blots were developed using the Amersham ECL System. For [3H]arachidonic acid release, experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using Student's t test with p < 0.05. The release of [3H]arachidonic acid was measured as an index of cPLA2 activity in human platelets. We compared a procedure adapted from a 5-hydroxytryptamine release assay (24Watson S.P. McNally J. Shipman L.J. Godfrey P.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) with the separation of a lipophilic platelet extract on thin-layer chromotography prior to scintillation counting (11Halenda S.P. Zavoico G.B. Feinstein M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12484-12491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and found that both methods gave similar results. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 μM) and the lipoxygenase inhibitor BW4AC (3 μM) were included to prevent arachidonic acid metabolism (28Smith J.B. Selak M.A. Dangelmaier C. Daniel J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and secondary stimulation by thromboxane A2(29Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). During a 2-min stimulation, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 released 9.8 ± 0.74% (n = 14) of total tissue levels of [3H]arachidonic acid, and thrombin released 4.4 ± 0.49% (n = 14; Table 1). Collagen stimulated the release of 3.9 ± 0.54% (n = 5) of total tissue levels during 5 min.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The Ca2+ dependence of arachidonic acid formation in collagen-stimulated platelets has previously been demonstrated by Smith et al.(28Smith J.B. Selak M.A. Dangelmaier C. Daniel J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (100 μM), which permeates the plasma membrane and becomes trapped as a tetraanion inside the cell after cleavage by nonspecific cytosolic esterases. Since BAPTA-AM markedly suppressed PLC activation at concentrations higher than 15 μM(30Watson S.P. Poole A. Asselin J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 823-830PubMed Google Scholar), we used BAPTA-AM at a concentration of 10 μM. This blocked the thrombin- and collagen-stimulated Ca2+ rise in platelets (Fig. 1) and inhibited over 90% of the [3H]arachidonic acid release after stimulation by collagen, thrombin, or A23187 (Table 1). To check that BAPTA-AM did not inhibit PLC/PKC activation, we monitored phosphorylation of pleckstrin, the major PKC substrate in platelets(31Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5733) Google Scholar, 32Tyers M. Rachubinski R.A. Stewart M.I. Varriochio A.M. Shorr R.G.L. Haslam R.J. Harley C.B. Nature. 1988; 333: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). BAPTA-AM had no effect on [32P]phosphorylation of pleckstrin induced by collagen (106.8 ± 5.1%, n = 3, relative to collagen, 100%) or by thrombin (108.7 ± 6.4%, n = 4, relative to thrombin, 100%), indicating that the observed inhibition of [3H]arachidonic acid release is due to the Ca2+-chelating properties of BAPTA-AM. A rise in intracellular Ca2+ is therefore a necessary condition for the formation of arachidonic acid in platelets. Halenda et al.(11Halenda S.P. Zavoico G.B. Feinstein M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12484-12491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate enhanced the formation of arachidonic acid in ionophore-stimulated platelets without having any effect on its own. This synergy was reversed by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine, although the response to the ionophore in the absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was not altered by staurosporine(33Halenda S.P. Banga H.S. Zavoico G.B. Lau L.-F. Feinstein M.B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7356-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used a different phorbol ester, PDBu, and observed potentiation of [3H]arachidonic acid release over the length of the concentration-response curve to A23187 (Fig. 2). Preincubation with the specific PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220 (26Davis P.D. Hill C.H. Keech E. Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Sedgwick A.D. Wadsworth J. Westmacott D. Wilkinson S.E. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 34Walker T.R. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reversed the effect of PDBu but had no significant effect on A23187-stimulated [3H]arachidonic acid release (Fig. 2). Staurosporine did not significantly alter the [3H]arachidonic acid release from A23187-stimulated platelets (not shown). These data demonstrate that PKC activity does not contribute to Ca2+ ionophore-induced release of [3H]arachidonic acid in platelets but that additional stimulation of PKC can enhance this response. Further experiments were therefore designed to investigate whether PKC is involved in the formation of [3H]arachidonic acid after activation by physiological stimuli, such as collagen and thrombin. Both Ro 31-8220 and staurosporine inhibited phosphorylation of the PKC substrate pleckstrin in collagen- and thrombin-treated platelets (Fig. 3). Ro 31-8220 did not alter the collagen-induced [3H]arachidonic acid release significantly, whereas staurosporine blocked it (Fig. 4A). This is in agreement with results reported by Daniel et al.(21Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Smith J.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and parallels the effect of each inhibitor on PLC activation(35Blake R.A. Walker T.R. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of staurosporine is consistent with a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in early signaling events in collagen-stimulated platelets(21Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Smith J.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Blake R.A. Schieven G.L. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Poole A.W. Blake R. Asselin J. Watson S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 41PGoogle Scholar). Since Ro 31-8220 did not decrease the formation of [3H]arachidonic acid after collagen stimulation, PKC activity does not appear to be necessary for arachidonic acid liberation.Figure 4Effect of the protein kinase C inhibitors Ro 31-8220 and staurosporine on the release of [3H]arachidonic acid and on the intracellular Ca2+ rise in platelets stimulated with collagen and thrombin. A, [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled platelets (4 × 108/ml) were treated with indomethacin/BW4AC. They were incubated with Me2SO (DMSO, 1%), Ro 31-8220 (Ro 31, 10 μM), or staurosporine (stauro, 10 μM) for 5 min at 37°C and stimulated with collagen (100 μg/ml) for 5 min in a stirred solution (1200 rpm). Radioactivity released into the buffer was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” 100% stimulation correspond to 4135 dpm, 0% (basal) corresponds to 2290 dpm. B, concentration-response curve of the [3H]arachidonic acid release from indomethacin/BW4AC pretreated platelets stimulated with thrombin. [3H]Arachidonic acid-labeled platelets were incubated with Me2SO (■), staurosporine (▵, 10 μM), or Ro 31-8220 (○, 10 μM) for 5 min at 37°C and stimulated with thrombin for 2 min. In A and B, each point is the mean ± S.E. from quadruplicate determinations. The results shown are representative of at least three other similar experiments. C, intracellular Ca2+ was measured in fura2-AM-loaded platelets as described for Fig. 1. Platelets were incubated with Me2SO (1%), Ro 31-8220 (10 μM) or staurosporine (10 μM) for 5 min at room temperature and stimulated with collagen (100 μg/ml) or thrombin (1 unit/ml) as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) [3H]Arachidonic acid was generated in a concentration-dependent manner following stimulation of platelets with thrombin (Fig. 4B). At submaximal concentrations of thrombin (0.2-1 units/ml), both staurosporine and Ro 31-8220 enhanced [3H]arachidonic acid release without having any significant effect on their own (for example, compare release of [3H]arachidonic acid at 0.01 units/ml thrombin). Activation of PLC by thrombin is not altered in the presence of staurosporine but is potentiated significantly by Ro 31-8220(24Watson S.P. McNally J. Shipman L.J. Godfrey P.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 37Blake R.A. Asselin J. Walker T. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); the effect of Ro 31-8220 can be explained by inhibition of the negative feedback action of PKC on PLC(38Watson S.P. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2623-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This is in good agreement with the effect of Ro 31-8220 on [3H]arachidonic acid release, suggesting that thrombin-induced formation of [3H]arachidonic acid is an event downstream of PLC and Ca2+. To further investigate this hypothesis, intracellular Ca2+ elevation was measured in the presence of"
https://openalex.org/W2022628365,"We have purified a sperm membrane protein, designated zonadhesin, that binds in a species-specific manner to the extracellular matrix (zona pellucida) of the egg, and cloned its cDNA. The cDNA encodes a novel protein with a single transmembrane segment separating a 36 amino acid, highly basic intracellular C terminus from a 2418-amino acid extracellular region. The extracellular sequence specifies a mosaic protein comprising a unique N-terminal domain, a mucin-like domain, and five tandem domains proximal to the membrane that are homologous to prepro von Willebrand factor. The N-terminal and mucin-like domains were absent from zonadhesin that bound to the egg extracellular matrix, suggesting that processing occurs during sperm maturation and/or capacitation. By Northern blotting and in situ hybridization, zonadhesin mRNA was detected only within the testis, where it was expressed primarily in haploid spermatids. The unique domain structure of zonadhesin suggests multiple functions, one of which is to mediate sperm adhesion to the zona pellucida. We have purified a sperm membrane protein, designated zonadhesin, that binds in a species-specific manner to the extracellular matrix (zona pellucida) of the egg, and cloned its cDNA. The cDNA encodes a novel protein with a single transmembrane segment separating a 36 amino acid, highly basic intracellular C terminus from a 2418-amino acid extracellular region. The extracellular sequence specifies a mosaic protein comprising a unique N-terminal domain, a mucin-like domain, and five tandem domains proximal to the membrane that are homologous to prepro von Willebrand factor. The N-terminal and mucin-like domains were absent from zonadhesin that bound to the egg extracellular matrix, suggesting that processing occurs during sperm maturation and/or capacitation. By Northern blotting and in situ hybridization, zonadhesin mRNA was detected only within the testis, where it was expressed primarily in haploid spermatids. The unique domain structure of zonadhesin suggests multiple functions, one of which is to mediate sperm adhesion to the zona pellucida."

Both isoforms phosphorylated, activated, and formed complexes with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 in vitro. However, these isoforms were differentially activated by hypertrophic stimuli such as peptide growth factors, endothelin-1 (ET1), or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) that activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.

TPA and ET1 were the most potent activators of c-Raf and A-Raf. Both utilized protein kinase C-dependent pathways, but stimulation by ET1 was also partially sensitive to pertussis toxin pretreatment. c-Raf was inhibited by activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase although A-Raf was less affected. Fetal calf serum, phenylephrine, and carbachol were less potent activators of c-Raf and A-Raf.

https://openalex.org/W1963588589,"The cytoplasmic domains of integrin β subunits are involved in bidirectional transmembrane signaling. We report that the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β3 subunit undergoes limited proteolysis by calpain, an intracellular calcium-dependent protease. Calpain cleavage occurs during platelet aggregation induced by agonists such as thrombin. Five cleavage sites have been identified. Four of these sites (C-terminal to Thr741, Tyr747, Phe754, and Tyr759) are utilized in intact platelets and flank two NXXY motifs (Asn744-Pro-Leu-Tyr747 and Asn756-Ile-Thr-Tyr759).

INTRODUCTIONIntegrins, a family of adhesion receptors, play important roles in cellular functions such as adhesion, migration, cell proliferation, and differentiation(1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). The functions of integrins are modulated by bidirectional transmembrane signaling as exemplified by platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (glycoprotein IIb-IIIa)(2Ginsberg M.H. Du X. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Plow E.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). When platelets are stimulated by agonists such as thrombin, intracellular signal transduction leads to activation of the extracellular fibrinogen binding function of αIIbβ3 (inside-out signaling), resulting in platelet aggregation. Conversely, ligand binding to αIIbβ3 is involved in outside-in signals that result in its association with the cytoskeleton (3Phillips D.R. Jennings L.K. Edwards H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and biochemical changes including tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins(4Ferrell J.J. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Specific structural characteristics of the integrin cytoplasmic domains are critical for the two-way signaling mechanism. This includes a GFFKR sequence in the αIIb cytoplasmic domain (8O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J.

The NPLY sequence, in particular, is critical for controlling affinity states of the ligand-binding sites and for the interaction of the integrin with cytoskeletal elements(9O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J.

Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Calpain is among these proteins(12Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Calpain represents a family of intracellular calcium-dependent neutral proteases(13Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Of the two classic members of this family, μ-calpain and m-calpain, μ-calpain is probably the predominant form in platelets(14Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). These two isoforms of calpain have no major difference in substrate specificity, but differ in calcium sensitivity (14Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Calpain can be activated during platelet aggregation by a rise in the cytoplasmic calcium level and/or by its translocation to the membrane(13Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 14Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Furthermore, calpain activation promotes the shedding of procoagulant membrane vesicles from aggregated platelets (15Fox J.E. Austin C.D. Boyles J.K. Steffen P.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). While the mechanisms of calpain regulation are still not fully understood, calpain cleavages can regulate a variety of intracellular processes(16Fox J.E. Goll D.E. Reynolds C.C. Phillips D.R. J.

We now report that calpain may regulate the function of β3 integrins by limited cleavage of the cytoplasmic domain of β3 at specific sites flanking two sets of NXXY motifs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurified Proteins and PeptidesIntegrin αIIbβ3 was purified as described previously (20Du X. Plow E.F. Frelinger III, A.L. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) by sequential chromatography of platelet lysates on heparin, concanavalin A, and gel filtration columns. μ-Calpain was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and characterized as described previously(21Saido T.C. Shibata M. Takenawa T. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24585-24590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the enzyme was 680 units/mg. The synthetic peptide TIHDRKEFAKFEEERARAKWDTANNPLYKEATSTFTNITYRGT, corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of β3, was kindly provided by Dr. E. F. Plow (Department of Cardiovascular Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH). All other peptides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems Model 430A automated peptide synthesizer and were subsequently purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideAbantibody. The mass of all synthetic peptides was verified by ion-spray mass spectrometry.AntibodiesThe monoclonal antibodies PMI-1 (against the αIIb heavy chain) and 15 (anti-β3) were produced and characterized as described previously(22Frelinger III, A.L.

The rabbit antipeptide antibodies anti-IIbC(8276) (against the C-terminal 20 residues of the αIIb light chain cytoplasmic domain), anti-β3C(8275) (against the C-terminal 20 residues of the β3 cytoplasmic domain), and anti-V41 (against the N-terminal 13 residues of the αIIb light chain) have been described previously(24Loftus J.C.

Science. 1991; 254: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The specificity of anti-IIbC and anti-β3C was verified using recombinant integrin αIIbβ3 with truncations in the cytoplasmic domain of αIIb and β3, respectively(25O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1991; 254: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To produce antibodies recognizing specific calpain cleavage sites, pentapeptides corresponding to C-terminal sequences identified by calpain digestion of the synthetic β3 cytoplasmic domain peptide were synthesized with a cysteine incorporated at their N termini. The peptides were conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) by a cysteine-specific cross-linking reagent, m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pierce). The conjugates were then used to immunize rabbits as described previously(26Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamaura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, the antipeptide antibodies were affinity-purified using peptides immobilized on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).Calpain Digestion of αIIbβ3Purified integrin αIIbβ3 (0.2 mg/ml) in 0.01 M Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM reduced glutathione (Calbiochem), 50 mM octyl β-D-glucopyranoside (Calbiochem), pH 7.4, was incubated with calpain (1-10 μg/ml) at 30°C for 5 min. The reactions were then stopped by adding 0.1 mMN-[N-(L-3-trans-carboxyoxiran-2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl]agmatine (E-64; Boehringer Mannheim) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer. The samples were run on a 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After 1 h of incubation in 5% nonfat milk in 0.02 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, the membranes were incubated with various antibodies against integrin αIIbβ3 at 22°C for 60 min. Following three washes, the membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG for 30 min and then washed six times. Alkaline phosphatase substrate Vector-Red (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) was used to visualize the reaction.Mapping Calpain Cleavage Sites Using Synthetic PeptidesSynthetic peptides were solubilized in 0.05 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, at 1 mg/ml. 1 μg of purified μ-calpain was added to 100 μg of each peptide and incubated at 30°C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by adding a final concentration of 5 mM EDTA, and the fragments were immediately separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Gilson system with a Vydac C18 analytical column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using linear gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peaks were monitored by absorbance at 214 nm.Mass Spectrometry and N-terminal SequencingIon-spray spectrometry of synthetic peptides and their proteolytic fragments was performed on an API-III quadrupole ion-spray spectrometer (Sciex, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Sequences of the proteolytic fragments were predicted using MacProMass (Terri Lee, City of Hope, Duarte, CA) on the basis of the known sequence of the undigested peptide and the determined molecular masses of the fragments. N-terminal sequencing was performed using an automated sequencer(27Du X. Harris S.J. Tetaz T.J. Ginsberg M.H. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18287-18290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Analysis of Calpain Cleavage of Integrin β3in PlateletsPlatelets were separated from freshly drawn blood (20Du X. Plow E.F. Frelinger III, A.L. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and washed three times with 0.12 M sodium chloride, 0.0129 M trisodium citrate, and 0.03 M glucose, pH 6.5. The washed platelets were resuspended at a concentration of 109 platelets/ml in modified Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4(20Du X. Plow E.F. Frelinger III, A.L. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and then stirred at 37°C for various lengths of time in an aggregometer after adding thrombin or the calcium ionophore A23187. Platelets were solubilized by mixing 1:1 with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, and 0.2 mM E-64; subjected to SDS-PAGE; and Western-blotted with various anti-integrin antibodies. In immunoprecipitation experiments, the platelets (0.4 ml) were solubilized by addition of an equal volume of solubilization buffer (0.1 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM EGTA, 2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM leupeptin, 0.2 mM E-64, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.4). After centrifugation (100,000 × g) to remove insoluble material, the lysates (0.8 ml) were precipitated twice with 50 μl of a rabbit anti-β3 C-terminal domain antibody (anti-β3C), followed by protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads to deplete intact integrin β3. Calpain-cleaved β3, which remained in the lysates, was then detected by immunoblotting with an anti-β3 monoclonal antibody, 15. Immunoblotting was performed essentially as described above, except that the secondary antibodies were conjugated with peroxidase, and the reactions were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Corp.).Dissociation of αIIband β3SubunitsDissociation of αIIb and β3 was achieved by EDTA treatment as described previously(28Shattil S.J. Brass L.F. Bennett J.S. Pandhi P. Blood. 1985; 66: 92-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Washed platelets were resuspended in 0.01 M Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.6, and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Platelets were then solubilized by adding an equal volume of 2% Triton X-100, 0.1 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM PMSF, but no calpain inhibitors, and incubated at room temperature for an additional 30 min. To activate calpain, 40 mM CaCl2 was added, and the lysates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.RESULTSPreferential Cleavage of the β3Cytoplasmic Domain by μ-CalpainTo investigate whether integrin αIIbβ3 is a substrate for calpain, purified αIIbβ3 and calpain were incubated together in vitro. Cleavage of the integrin was then assessed by immunoblotting with site-specific antibodies. Calpain digestion abolished reactivity of an antipeptide antibody against the C-terminal 20 residues of the β3 subunit (Fig. 1). In contrast, the reactivities of antibodies against the entire subunit or against its extracellular domain were not affected by calpain treatment. Moreover, there was no major reduction in mass of the β3 subunit, indicating that the bulk of β3 is calpain-resistant. Thus, calpain cleavage sites in β3 are located primarily within the cytoplasmic domain.In contrast, the cytoplasmic domain of αIIb did not appear to be cleaved by calpain, as indicated by the preservation of reactivity with an antibody to the C terminus of the αIIb cytoplasmic domain (anti-IIbC). In addition, reactivity with an antibody to the C terminus of the αIIb heavy chain (PMI-1) was also unaffected by calpain. The N terminus of the αIIb light chain appeared to be cleaved since a second more mobile band, reactive with the antibody against the C terminus of the αIIb light chain, became evident after calpain treatment (Fig. 1). This more mobile band did not react with antibody anti-V41 (specific for the N terminus of the αIIb light chain), and anti-V41 staining of the intact αIIb light chain was decreased by calpain treatment. Thus, the αIIb cytoplasmic domain resists calpain cleavage, while the N terminus of the light chain is susceptible. Consequently, the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β3 appears to be a preferred intracellular substrate for calpain.To determine if cleavage of the β3 cytoplasmic domain by calpain occurs in intact cells, washed platelets were treated with a calcium ionophore, A23187 (1 μM), for 3 min at 37°C to activate intracellular calpain. After solubilization, intact β3 subunit was depleted by sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-β3C, and residual β3 was detected by Western blotting with an antibody to the extracellular domain of β3 (monoclonal antibody 15). Densitometry showed that >70% of β3 from A23187-treated platelets remained in the supernatant after quantitative immunoabsorption by anti-β3C. This result indicates that most of the β3 subunit in A23187-activated platelets lacks the C-terminal portion. In contrast, >99% of β3 in resting platelets was depleted by immunoprecipitation with anti-β3C, indicating that the cytoplasmic domain of β3 is intact (Fig. 2A). These results were confirmed when platelets were directly solubilized in SDS sample buffer containing calpain inhibitors and then Western-blotted with anti-β3C. The integrin β3 subunit from A23187-stimulated platelets showed much less reactivity with anti-β3C than did β3 from control platelets. This reduction in the anti-β3C reactivity was due to calpain cleavage because a membrane-permeable calpain inhibitor, E-64d, blocked it completely (Fig. 2B). Thus, calpain-dependent cleavage of the cytoplasmic domain of β3 occurs in intact platelets.Figure 2Calpain cleavage of β3 in platelets. A, washed platelets in modified Tyrode's buffer (0.4 ml) were incubated at 37°C with (A23187) or without (control) 1 μM calcium ionophore A23187 for 3 min with continuous stirring at 1000 rpm. The platelets were solubilized by addition of an equal volume of solubilization buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) and immunoprecipitated twice with 50 μl of preimmune serum (control (Ctrl)), anti-β3 antibody 8053 (β3), or the anti-β3 C-terminal peptide antibody, anti-β3C (β3C). After removing the antibody-bound proteins with protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads, the 50 μl of supernatant were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a monoclonal anti-β3 antibody, 15. B, platelets were stirred at 37°C for 3 min after adding buffer (0), 1 μM A23187 (A), or A23187 with 0.1 mM E-64d (a membrane-permeable calpain inhibitor) (A+E) and then solubilized by addition of an equal volume of SDS sample buffer containing 0.2 mM E-64, 1 mM PMSF, and 5 mM EDTA. 50 μl of lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with preimmune serum, antibody 8053, or anti-β3C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of the Calpain Cleavage Sites in the β3Cytoplasmic DomainTo map calpain cleavage sites in the cytoplasmic domain of the β3 subunit, a 43-residue synthetic peptide based on the sequence of the cytoplasmic domain was incubated with purified calpain, and the products were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 3). The molecular masses of peptide fragments from major HPLC peaks were determined by ion-spray mass spectrometry (Table 1). The identities of the fragments were assigned from their masses using the MacProMass program. The majority of calpain digestion-generated fragments were unambiguously assigned (Table 1). For fragment d (mass = 1376 Da), two assignments (Lys748-Tyr759 or Tyr747-Thr758) were possible. Lys748 was predicted to be the N terminus of fragment a, and Tyr759 was the C terminus of fragment g. Thus, Lys748-Tyr759 is likely to account for fragment d. The cleavage sites identified are depicted schematically in Fig. 3C.Figure 3Mapping calpain cleavage sites in the cytoplasmic domain of β3. A synthetic peptide (TIHDRKEFAKFEEERARAKWDTANNPLYKEATSTFTNITYRGT) corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β3 (100 μg) was incubated in the absence (A) or presence (B) of purified calpain (1 μg) at 30°C for 20 min. The samples were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 column. The fragments were eluted with a gradient of 15-60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. In C, peaks (fragments a-g) eluted from the HPLC column were immediately analyzed by ion-spray mass spectrometry, and their sequences were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Calpain cleavage sites (arrows) were assigned by the location of these fragments in the intact peptide. The solid circles above the arrows indicate cleavage sites confirmed by N-terminal sequencing in a separate experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Three of the cleavage site assignments were confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis of the products of calpain digestion of the β3 cytoplasmic domain peptide, Glu731-Thr762. Three HPLC peaks were found to contain peptides with N-terminal sequences differing from the intact peptide: A742NNPLYKEA …, K748EATSTF …, and T755NITYRGT, confirming three of the calpain cleavage sites identified by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3C). Thus, five calpain cleavage sites were identified C-terminal to Ala735, Thr741, Tyr747, Phe754, and Tyr759 of the β3 subunit.Calpain Cleavage Site Utilization in Intact PlateletsTo determine whether the calpain cleavage sites identified in vitro were used in platelets, we generated cleavage site-specific antibodies. To generate such antibodies, we immunized rabbits with pentapeptides EEERA (Ab 735), AKWDT (Ab 741), NNPLY (Ab 747), ATSTF (Ab 754), and TNITY (Ab 759). In each case, the antibody is identified by the number of the new C-terminal residue generated by the predicted cleavage. Western blot analysis indicated that these antibodies either did not react (Ab 735, Ab 741, Ab 747, and Ab 754) or reacted weakly (Ab 759) with β3 from resting platelets (Fig. 4). When the platelets were treated with the calcium ionophore A23187, there was a marked increase in staining with Ab 741, Ab 747, Ab 754, and Ab 759 (Fig. 4). This indicates the exposure of new C termini in β3 corresponding to calpain cleavage sites C-terminal to residues 741, 747, 754, and 759. Furthermore, the increased reactivity of these antipeptide antibodies with β3 was inhibited by addition of the calpain inhibitor E-64d, indicating that calpain is responsible for the generation of these new C termini in β3. These data indicate that calpain cleaves β3 at sites C-terminal to residues 741, 747, 754, and 759 in intact platelets.Figure 4Calpain cleavage site utilization in integrin β3 in intact platelets. Washed platelets resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (109/ml) were treated with 1 μM A23187 in the absence (A) or presence (A+E) of 1 mM E-64d. Alternatively, no A23187 was added (0). After 3 min at 37°C, platelets were solubilized by addition of an equal volume of SDS sample buffer containing 0.2 mM E-64, 0.5 mM leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, and 5 mM EDTA. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with the indicated calpain cleavage site-specific antibodies. Antibody binding was visualized by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies and ECL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast, the site C-terminal to residue 735 did not appear to be cleaved by calpain in the cellular environment. To verify that Ab 735 recognizes appropriately cleaved β3, platelets were treated with 10 mM EDTA at 37°C for 1 h to dissociate αIIb from β3. After solubilization, 40 mM CaCl2 was added to the lysate to activate endogenous calpain. After such treatment, reactivity of Ab 735 with β3 was detected (Fig. 5), indicating that cleavage after Ala735 had occurred. An upward shift in mobility of β3 on a nonreduced SDS-polyacrylamide gel, similar to that of reduced β3, was also observed. This suggests that cleavage may occur in the extracellular domain, leading to the unfolding of an extracellular loop within β3(29Niewiarowski S. Norton K.J. Eckardt A. Lukasiewicz H. Colt H.J. Kornecki E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 983: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, the calpain cleavage site C-terminal to Ala735 is utilized following treatments known to dissociate the αIIb and β3 subunits.Figure 5Calpain cleavage of β3 at Ala735 in EDTA-treated platelet lysate. Washed platelets were treated with 10 mM EDTA (+) or incubated in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2(-) at 37°C for 30 min and then solubilized by adding an equal volume of 2% Triton X-100, 0.1 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM PMSF, but no calpain inhibitors. After an additional incubation at 37°C for 60 min, a final concentration of 40 mM CaCl2 was added to EDTA-treated platelet lysates to activate calpain. The lysates were incubated at room temperature for a further 30 min and then fractionated by SDS-PAGE (nonreduced) and immunoblotted with Ab 735 or Ab 754. Note that the Ab 735 epitope appeared only when the platelets were pretreated with EDTA before calpain activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Calpain Cleavage of β3in Thrombin-activated PlateletsTo test whether calpain cleaves the β3 subunit during platelet activation induced by physiological agonists, washed platelets were treated with 0.1 unit/ml thrombin and allowed to aggregate for various lengths of time in an aggregometer. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted with antibodies specific for the calpain digestion sites of β3. As shown in Fig. 6, the cleavage site-specific antibody, Ab 754, did not bind to β3 from resting platelets (lane 0). In contrast, binding of the antibody was observed as early as 1 min after thrombin addition, before the platelets were fully aggregated. Reaction with Ab 754 increased with time (Fig. 6) and was inhibited by adding E-64d (data not shown), indicating that continuing calpain cleavage occurred. Similarly increased reactivities of the antibodies against the other calpain cleavage sites (Ab 741, Ab 747, and Ab 759) were also observed during thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (data not shown).Figure 6Calpain cleavage of β3 integrin in platelets activated by thrombin. Washed platelets (109/ml, 0.4 ml) were treated at 37°C in the absence (0) or presence of 0.1 unit/ml thrombin for 1, 3, 5, or 10 min with continuous stirring at 1000 rpm. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of SDS sample buffer containing 0.2 mM E-64, 0.5 mM leupeptin, 2 mM PMSF, and 5 mM EDTA. Proteins in the platelet lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with the calpain cleavage site-specific antibody (Ab 754).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe have found that the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β3 subunit is cleaved by calpain and have mapped five cleavage sites. Four of these sites (C-terminal to Thr741, Tyr747, Phe754, and Tyr759) are utilized in intact platelets. The fifth site is accessible only after treatment known to dissociate the αIIbβ3 heterodimer. These calpain cleavages remove residues critical for the attachment of the integrin to the cytoskeleton and bidirectional transmembrane signaling. Thus, calpain cleavage may regulate functions of β3 integrins.The conclusion that calpain cleaves the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β3 comes from three lines of evidence: 1) in vitro cleavage of the β3 cytoplasmic domain of purified integrin αIIbβ3 by purified μ-calpain, 2) cleavage of synthetic β3 cytoplasmic domain peptides by purified μ-calpain, and 3) limited cleavage of the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin in"

We reported previously that an anti-MAPKK neutralizing antibody inhibited progesterone- or Mos- induced initiation of oocyte maturation. Here, we show that injection of CL100 (also called MAPK phosphatase-1) into immature oocytes inhibited progesterone-induced oocyte maturation as well as MAPK activation and that injection of mRNA encoding a constitutively active MAPKK induced activation of histone H1 kinase and germinal vesicle breakdown in the absence of progesterone. Injection of recombinant STE11 protein (a yeast MAPKK kinase) also induced initiation of oocyte maturation. These data support the idea that the MAPKK/MAPK cascade plays an important role in oocyte maturation. Interestingly, injection of the active MAPKK mRNA or the STE11 protein resulted in induction and accumulation of Mos protein. Furthermore, in the presence of cycloheximide, the STE11-induced activation of MPF as well as the induction and accumulation of Mos was blocked, and the activation of MAPK was greatly reduced. The increase in Mos protein and the activation of MAPK by injecting cyclin A protein into immature oocytes were both blocked also by cycloheximide treatment.

INTRODUCTIONThe fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: FGFfibroblast growth factorFGFRFGF receptorBSAbovine serum albumin. are a family of polypeptide mitogens that currently consists of nine members(1Burgess W.H.

Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The FGFs mediate a variety of biological processes including angiogenesis, wound healing, migration, mitogenesis, neuronal survival, and mesoderm induction(2Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y.

Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). These biological effects are mediated via binding to four members of a family of high affinity membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase receptors(2Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 3Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). The FGFs have also been shown to bind to lower affinity cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans(1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The prototype FGF receptor (FGFR) is comprised of an extracellular domain made up of three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains designated IgI-IgIII, a hydrophobic membrane-spanning region, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain(2Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 3Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of individual members of the FGFR family are highly conserved among vertebrate species(2Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The IgIII domain of FGFR1-3 is encoded by three exons and is generated by alternative splicing of IgIIIa with one of two alternative exons designated IgIIIb and IgIIIc(4Johnson D.E. Lu J. Chen H.

Like the FGFs themselves, the FGFRs have unique but overlapping spatiotemporal patterns of expression during vertebrate development(9Orr-Urtreger A. Givol D. Yayon A. Yarden Y. Lonai P. Development. 1991; 113: 1419-1434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Friesel R. Brown S.A.N. Development. 1992; 116: 1051-1058PubMed Google Scholar, 11McDonald F.J. Heath J.K. Dev.

These mutations may either directly (Cys342® Tyr/Cys342® Arg/Cys342® Ser/Cys342® Phe; Cys278® Phe; Tyr328® Cys; Ser347® Cys; Ser354® Cys) or indirectly (Ser267® Pro; Gln289® Pro; Tyr340 His) result in the creation of a free cysteine residue that could result in covalent dimerization resulting in ligand-independent activation of the mutant receptor(2Wilkie A.O.M.

Here we report that mutation of Cys332® Tyr of Xenopus FGFR-2, analogous to the Cys342® Tyr mutation most commonly found in Crouzon syndrome, promotes activation of the mutant receptor in the absence of ligand.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsC4-Raf cDNA and N17-Ras cDNA were gifts of Dr. U. Rapp (National Cancer Institute) and Dr. T. Sargent (NIH), respectively. Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to FGFR were prepared as described previously(20Brown S.A.N. Friesel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A murine monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine, PY20, was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Recombinant FGF-1 was a gift from Dr. W. Burgess (Holland Laboratory).In Vitro MutagenesisA BamHI fragment encoding the entire open reading frame of Xenopus FGFR-2 (10Friesel R. Brown S.A.N. Development. 1992; 116: 1051-1058PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into pTZ19U (Bio-Rad). Mutagenesis of Cys332 to Tyr in Xenopus FGFR-2 was performed by the method of Kunkel et al.(21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar) using the mutagenic primer 5′-TCCAGCTATATAAGTATATTCCCC-3′ to yield FGFR-2CS. The presence of the Cys332® Tyr mutation and the absence of other mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis.Plasmid ConstructionAll constructs for in vitro transcription were cloned into the BglII site of the SP64T or SP64T3 vectors (gifts of Dr. D. Melton, Harvard University). Synthesis of capped mRNA for microinjection was performed with SP6 RNA polymerase using a Message Machine kit (Ambion).Embryo InjectionsEggs were collected from Xenopus laevis females and fertilized in vitro as described previously(22Moon R.T. Christian J.L. Technique (Phila.). 1989; 1: 76-89Google Scholar). Embryos were dejellied 30-60 min after fertilization with 2% cysteine, pH 8.0, and maintained at 17°C. At the two-cell stage, embryos were transferred to 1 × MMR (5 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, and 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 5% Ficoll. Each blastomere of two-cell embryos was injected in the animal pole with 5-10 nl of the indicated amount of RNA.Animal Cap Assays and RNA Gel Blot AnalysisAnimal pole ectoderm (animal caps) was dissected from stage 8-9 embryos (23Nieuwkoop P.D.

Animal caps were collected at stage 10.5 or 18 for Xbra mRNA analysis and stage 22-24 for muscle α-actin mRNA analysis unless otherwise noted. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by RNA gel blot as previously described(24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62982) Google Scholar, 25Church G.M.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2481-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Oocyte Injections and Immunoblot AnalysisOocytes were collected and staged according to established procedures(27Peng H.B. Xenopus laevis: Practical Uses in Cell and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, New York1991Google Scholar). Oocytes were defolliculated by mild collagenase treatment and maintained in 1 × MBS (27Peng H.B. Xenopus laevis: Practical Uses in Cell and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, New York1991Google Scholar) containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 18°C. Oocytes were injected with 10-20 nl of RNA at the indicated concentrations and cultured as described above for 1-2 days before immunoblot or cross-linking analysis. Oocytes were extracted in cold lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM EGTA, and 0.1 mM NaVO4) extracted with 1 volume of Freon to remove yolk proteins and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. For immunoblot analysis, equal amounts of protein were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer and proteins separated by electrophoresis through 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and immunoblotting procedures were carried out essentially as described(28Friesel R. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Mol. Cell.

Bound primary antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence procedures (DuPont NEN).In Vitro Kinase AssayOocyte lysates were prepared as described above, and equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with an FGFR antibody(20Brown S.A.N. Friesel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were immobilized onto Protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), washed extensively with lysis buffer and kinase reactions performed as described(20Brown S.A.N. Friesel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Samples were separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography (20Brown S.A.N. Friesel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).FGF Receptor Cross-linkingOocytes were injected with 5 ng of either FGFR-2 or FGFR-2CS RNA and cultured for 2 days prior to cross-linking analysis. Thirty oocytes expressing either FGFR-2 or FGFR-2CS were incubated in 0.5 ml of 1 × MBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 units/ml heparin (Upjohn) (binding buffer) in the presence of 20 ng/ml 125I-FGF-1 (8-10 × 104 cpm/ng) prepared as described previously (29Friesel R. Burgess W.H. Mehlman T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7581-7584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were incubated at 4°C for 1 h followed by extensive washing with binding buffer. Ligand-receptor complexes were cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate (0.3 mM; Pierce) for 15 min at 4°C as described (29Friesel R. Burgess W.H. Mehlman T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7581-7584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oocyte lysates were prepared as described above, and ligand-receptor complexes were partially purified by wheat germ agglutinin-agarose adsorption(30Amaya E. Stein P.A. Musci T.J. Kirschner M.W. Development. 1993; 118: 477-487PubMed Google Scholar), followed by analysis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Cross-linked complexes were visualized by autoradiography.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSeveral mutations have been identified in the IgIII domain of human FGFR-2 in individuals with Crouzon syndrome(17Reardon W. Winter R.M. Rutland P. Pulleyn L.J. Jones B.M. Malcolm S. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 18Rutland P. Pulleyn L.J. Reardon W. Baraister M. Hayward R. Jones B.

The most frequently identified mutation is Cys342® Tyr, resulting in the generation of a free cysteine residue that may then be available to form intermolecular disulfide bonds. To test this possibility we created a mutation in a Xenopus FGFR-2 cDNA (Cys332® Tyr) analogous to the human Cys342® Tyr mutation. Fifty picograms of RNA transcribed from wild-type FGFR-2 or FGFR-2CS plasmids were injected into both blastomeres of two-cell stage Xenopus embryos. At the blastula stage, animal pole ectoderm (animal caps) was dissected, cultured, and assayed for elongation(32Green J.B. Howes G. Symes K. Cooke J. Smith J.C. Development. 1990; 108: 173-183PubMed Google Scholar). By late neurula stages animal caps from embryos injected with FGFR-2CS RNA (Fig. 1d) elongated in a manner similar to control caps treated with FGF-1 (Fig. 1b). Animal caps injected with similar amounts of wild-type FGFR-2 RNA (Fig. 1c) remained spherical and resembled uninjected control animal caps (Fig. 1a). Injection of greater than 200 pg of FGFR-2CS RNA results in cleavage arrest in blastula stage embryos. 2K. M. Neilson and R. E. Friesel, unpublished observation. FGF-mediated mesoderm induction and animal cap elongation have been shown previously to be blocked by the expression of a dominant negative Raf (C4-Raf) or dominant negative Ras (N17-Ras)(33Whitman M. Melton D.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 34MacNicol A.M. Muslin A.J. Williams L.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 571-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, co-expression of either a dominant negative Raf (Fig. 1e) or dominant negative Ras (Fig. 1f) with FGFR-2CS inhibited FGF-independent animal cap elongation.We also assessed mesoderm induction by assaying for the expression of mesoderm-specific molecular markers. Xbra, the Xenopus homolog of brachyury, is expressed broadly in the presumptive mesoderm of gastrulating embryos and has been shown to be a useful molecular marker for mesoderm induction by growth factors such as FGF(35Smith J.C. Price B.M. Green J.B. Weigel D. Herrmann B.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Wild-type FGFR-2 or FGFR-2CS RNAs were injected into the animal pole of both blastomeres of two-cell stage embryos. Animal caps were dissected from blastula stage embryos (stages 8-9) and cultured until sibling controls reached the indicated stages (stage 10.5 or 18). RNA was isolated and analyzed by RNA gel blot hybridization. Fig. 2A shows that Xbra mRNA is expressed in animal caps in a dose-dependent manner following embryo injection with FGFR-2CS RNA. Injection of as little as 20 pg of FGFR-2CS RNA was sufficient to induce expression of Xbra mRNA, and the level detected was similar to that induced by FGF. No Xbra mRNA expression was detected in caps injected with a similar amount of wild-type FGFR-2 RNA or in uninjected control animal caps. Xbra transcripts were not detected in animal caps co-expressing FGFR-2CS and either a dominant negative Ras or a dominant negative Raf.Figure 2Induction of molecular markers of mesoderm formation by FGFR-2CS. Embryos at the two-cell stage were injected with either FGFR-2 or FGFR-2CS RNA in the indicated amounts. For experiments involving dominant negative Raf and Ras mutants, 50 pg of FGFR-2CS RNA was co-injected with 100 pg of C4-Raf RNA or N17-Ras RNA. A, animal caps were dissected at stage 8-9 and harvested at either stage 10.5 or 18 as indicated. RNA was isolated and Xbra mRNA expression analyzed by RNA gel blot hybridization. The blot was rehybridized with an 18 S rRNA oligonucleotide probe to serve as an RNA loading control. B, embryos were injected and animal caps dissected as described in A. Animal caps were harvested when sibling control embryos reached stage 22-24, and RNA was isolated and analyzed by RNA gel blot hybridization for muscle α-actin mRNA expression (arrow). Cytoskeletal actin transcripts (upper two bands) serve as an internal control for RNA loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Muscle-specific α-actin mRNA, a late marker for mesoderm formation(36Kimelman D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1987; 51: 869-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), is also induced in a dose-dependent manner by expression of FGFR-2CS as assessed by RNA gel blot analysis (Fig. 2B). Muscle α-actin mRNA is not expressed in uninjected control animal caps (data not shown) or in caps injected with a similar amount of wild-type FGFR-2 RNA. The expression of muscle α-actin mRNA is blocked in animal caps co-expressing FGFR-2CS and either a dominant negative Ras or a dominant negative Raf. Thus, by both morphological criteria and by the expression of early and late molecular markers of mesoderm, FGFR-2CS, but not wild-type FGFR-2, has the ability to induce mesoderm in the absence of exogenous FGF.A noteworthy feature of most Crouzon syndrome mutations identified thus far is the creation or loss of cysteine residues in the IgIII domain of FGFR-2(2Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Both Cys278 and Cys342 are predicted to form a disulfide bond essential to formation of the Ig domain. These two cysteine residues are conserved throughout the FGFR family. Mutation of either of these two residues could result in destabilization of the structure of the Ig domain and the creation of a free cysteine residue. The creation of a free cysteine residue either directly or indirectly predicts a possible mechanism for the FGF-independent mesoderm-inducing effects of FGFR-2CS: FGFR dimerization and ligand-independent activation by formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond. To examine this possibility, we microinjected wild-type FGFR-2 or FGFR-2CS RNA into Xenopus oocytes. Lysates from uninjected or injected oocytes were analyzed by reducing or nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with an FGFR antibody(20Brown S.A.N. Friesel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions, both FGFR-2 and FGFR-2CS migrated as monomeric forms of 110 and 125 kDa, whereas under nonreducing conditions FGFR-2CS displayed an additional species at ~260-280 kDa (Fig. 3A), consistent with the size of a disulfide-linked homodimer. These same protein samples were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine. The pattern of phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity was similar to that observed with the FGFR antibody. However, although similar amounts of receptor protein were present in each sample (Fig. 3A), FGFR-2CS displayed higher amounts of Tyr(P) (Fig. 3B). In addition, under non-reducing conditions, the ~260-280-kDa species seen only in FGFR-2CS lysates displayed significant Tyr(P) immunoreactivity. To confirm these results, immune complex kinase assays were performed. While both FGFR-2 and FGFR-2CS displayed in vitro tyrosine kinase activity, FGFR-2CS consistently displayed higher activity than FGFR-2 (Fig. 3C). When immune complex kinase assay samples were analyzed under non-reducing conditions, a high amount of the kinase activity exists as a ~260-280-kDa species confirming those results seen by immunoblotting with antibodies to FGFR and Tyr(P). These data indicate that a large amount of FGFR-2CS exists as a covalent dimer with elevated tyrosine kinase activity resulting in constitutive activation of the mutant receptor. Such a mechanism has been described for mutagenized epidermal growth factor receptor(37Sorokin A. Lemmon M.A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol.

The Cys332® Tyr mutation of FGFR-2CS, in addition to generating a free cysteine residue capable of forming intermolecular disulfide bonds, may also disrupt the tertiary structure of IgIII resulting in diminished ligand binding. To test this possibility, ligand binding and cross-linking experiments were performed on Xenopus oocytes microinjected with either wild-type FGFR-2 or FGFR-2CS RNA. Oocytes injected with wild-type FGFR-2 RNA exhibited a major 125I-labeled cross-linked band of 150 kDa (Fig. 4). Oocytes injected with FGFR-2CS RNA exhibited no increase in 125I-FGF-1 binding relative to control oocytes (Fig. 4). These data indicate that mutation of Cys332 results in a loss of ligand binding, and thus activation of the mutant receptor is indeed ligand-independent. These data are consistent with mutation of an equivalent residue in FGFR-1, which has also been shown to abrogate ligand binding(40Hou J.Z. Kan M. Wang F. Xu J.M. Nakahara M. McBride G. McKeehan K.

These results indicate a potential mechanism for the dominant phenotypic effects observed in Crouzon syndrome and other craniosynostoses involving mutations in FGFR genes(2Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It is likely that most of these FGFR mutations are activating ones, and the heterogeneity of clinical features observed in these syndromes may reflect the degree to which individual mutations activate the receptor. Alternatively, the variation in phenotype among individuals with identical point mutations may indicate that other genes may be involved that modify the effects of mutated FGFRs. A systematic analysis of each FGFR mutation, as described here, may shed light on subtle functional differences between different mutations, which may account for phenotypic variability.The Xenopus system has proven to be a very useful model for the functional analysis of mutant signal transduction molecules in vivo(41Dawid I.B.

https://openalex.org/W2140667109,"To genetically dissect the drug extrusion systems of Lactococcus lactis, a chromosomal DNA library was made in Escherichia coli and recombinant strains were selected for resistance to high concentrations of ethidium bromide. Recombinant strains were found to be resistant not only to ethidium bromide but also to daunomycin and tetraphenylphosphonium. The drug resistance is conferred by the lmrP gene, which encodes a hydrophobic polypeptide of 408 amino acid residues with 12 putative membrane-spanning segments. Some sequence elements in this novel membrane protein share similarity to regions in the transposon Tn10-encoded tetracycline resistance determinant TetA, the multidrug transporter Bmr from Bacillus subtilis, and the bicyclomycin resistance determinant Bcr from E. coli. Drug resistance associated with lmrP expression correlated with energy-dependent extrusion of the molecules. Drug extrusion was inhibited by ionophores that dissipate the proton motive force but not by the ATPase inhibitor ortho-vanadate. These observations are indicative for a drug-proton antiport system. A lmrP deletion mutant was constructed via homologous recombination using DNA fragments of the flanking region of the gene. The L. lactis (ΔlmrP) strain exhibited residual ethidium extrusion activity, which in contrast to the parent strain was inhibited by ortho-vanadate. The results indicate that in the absence of the functional drug-proton antiporter LmrP, L. lactis is able to overexpress another, ATP-dependent, drug extrusion system. These findings substantiate earlier studies on the isolation and characterization of drug-resistant mutants of L. lactis (Bolhuis, H., Molenaar, D., Poelarends, G., van Veen, H.

In rat liver extract, they detected four classes of protein phosphatase (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C) by DEAE chromatography and determined their activities toward the substrates in vitro. All of these protein phosphatases catalyzed the dephosphorylation of all the substrates, but they concluded, based on the differences in hydrolysis rates, that PP2A and PP2C appear to be the major phosphatases toward the glycolytic/gluconeogenic enzymes in liver but could not assess the significance of these results in vivo. Previous work from this laboratory has shown that perfusion of the liver with high concentrations of glucose results in an increased Fru 2,6-P2 level which is due to dephosphorylation of the bifunctional enzyme(6Nishimura M. Fedorov S. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26100-26106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the earlier view (7Hue L. Rider M.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 254: 313-324Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar) which attributed to the increased Fru 6-P concentration, which is the substrate for the kinase. This dephosphorylation of the bifunctional enzyme was a result of activation of a protein phosphatase, and the activation appears to be caused by two factors (6Nishimura M. Fedorov S. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26100-26106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One factor is Xu 5-P, and the other is yet unidentified but may involve a covalent modification of the protein phosphatase. These results suggested the existence of a specific protein phosphatase in liver which dephosphorylates the bifunctional enzyme and which is activated by Xu 5-P in response to the high glucose.

[32P]-Labeled phosphorylase a was prepared by essentially the same procedure as other phosphorylated substrates except that phosphorylase b was incubated in a reaction mixture containing 100 mM glycerol phosphate (pH 8.2), 0.1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.2 mM [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mg/ml phosphorylase kinase. The specific activities of the substrates were approximately 106 cpm/nmol. Thiophosphorylated RLN-RT2K was prepared with the same procedure as 32P-phosphorylated RLN-RT2K except that ATPγS was used instead of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture, in a final volume of 50 μl, contained 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 25 μg of bovine serum albumin, and the [32P]phosphate-labeled substrates (4-6 μM for standard assay) for 4-20 min at 30°C. Since large amounts of the mutant rat testis Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase enzyme (RLN-RT2K) are available in our laboratory, it was used as a substrate during the purification of the protein phosphatase. An aliquot (15 μl) was removed from the reaction mixture at a given time and precipitated by adding 30 μl of cold trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) and 30 μl of 6% bovine serum albumin as a carrier. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the 32Pi in the supernatant solution was determined by mixing 50 μl of reaction mixture with 5 ml of scintillation mixture (Optifluor, Packard Instrument Co.) and counting in a scintillation counter. One unit of protein phosphatase is defined as that amount which catalyzes the release of 1.0 μmol of 32P/min. Approximately 300 pmol of the purified Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a Millipore poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane according to the method of Matsudaira(10Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The appropriate region of the membrane was excised and digested in situ with trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated with reverse-phase HPLC (11Rowles J. Slaugahter C. Moomaw C. Hsu J. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9548-9552Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas phase sequencer coupled to an on-line model 120A high performance liquid chromatograph (12Kamibayashi C. Estes R. Slaughter C. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13251-13260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed in 8% acrylamide containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate according to the procedure of Laemmli(14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of catalytic subunit of PP2A was carried out as follows. After electrophoresis and blotting onto a nitrocellulose (S& NC BA85, Schleicher & Schuell), blots were blocked with TBS-T (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against catalytic subunit (Promega) in TBS-T for 1-2 h. Fab2 fragment of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio-Rad) (diluted 1:3000), and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) were used to detect bound antibody. All operations were performed at 2-5°C. Sprague-Dawley rats fasted over 24 h were given 5 ml of 5% (w/v) glucose via intraperitoneal administration. We established previously (6Nishimura M. Fedorov S. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26100-26106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that glucose administration was necessary for maximum activation of the protein phosphatase(7Hue L. Rider M.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 254: 313-324Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). After 1 h, livers were excised under pentobarbiturate anesthesia (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and homogenized in 3 volumes of extraction buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.1), 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM leupeptin, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 28,000 × g, and the pellets were discarded. The extract was mixed with 400 ml of DEAE-cellulose equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol), and the mixture was stirred for 1.5 h. The DEAE-cellulose was washed with 4 liters of buffer A containing 0.05 M NaCl over a funnel, and the enzyme was eluted with 2 liters of buffer A containing 0.5 M NaCl. Fractions of 400 ml each were collected, and the fractions containing the enzyme activity were pooled. Usually the first three fractions contained most of the enzyme. The enzyme in the pooled fractions was precipitated with 30% saturation of ammonium sulfate, and the pellet was discarded. Sufficient ammonium sulfate was added to the enzyme solution to bring it to 50% saturation, and the pellet was dissolved in buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.1), 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol). The enzyme solution was dialyzed overnight against buffer B (4 liters) and applied onto a DEAE-cellulose column (3 × 40 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with at least 3 volumes of buffer B containing 0.05 M NaCl and developed with a total volume of 1600 ml of a linear gradient from 0.05 M to 0.5 M NaCl in buffer B. The enzyme fractions were pooled, diluted 2-fold with buffer B, and applied to ω-aminohexyl-Sepharose 4B (1.5 × 10 cm) which had been equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 200 ml of buffer B containing 0.15 M NaCl and developed with a total volume of 200 ml of a linear gradient from 0.15 M to 0.45 M NaCl in buffer B. The enzyme fractions were pooled and concentrated to about 10 ml with an Amicon concentrator equipped with a YM-30 membrane. The solution was loaded onto a G-50 column (2 × 25 cm), and the eluate was directly applied to Toyopearl DEAE-650 M (2 × 14 cm). The column was washed with buffer B containing 0.1 M NaCl and developed with a total 500-ml linear gradient from 0.1 M to 0.4 M NaCl in buffer B. The enzyme fractions were pooled and concentrated with an Amicon concentrator to approximately 2 ml. The solution was diluted 2-fold with buffer B and applied to a DEAE-5PW HPLC column (0.7 × 7 cm, TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA). The active fractions were pooled and concentrated with a Centricon-30 concentrator (Amicon) to about 1 ml. The solution was desalted with a G-50 column (1.5 × 10 cm), and the protein peak was applied to thiophosphorylated RLN-RT2K (0.7 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with buffer B containing 0.03 M NaCl and developed with a total 50-ml linear gradient from 0.03 M to 0.2 M NaCl in buffer B. The enzyme fractions were pooled and concentrated with a Centriplus-30 concentrator (Amicon) to less than 1 ml. The solution was applied to two serially connected TSK G3000SWXL (1 × 30 cm, TosoHaas) which had been equilibrated with buffer B. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated with a Centricon-30 concentrator. A summary of the purification is provided in Table 1. Approximately 300 μg of protein phosphatase were obtained from 350 g of rat liver. The yield (3%) of the enzyme was based on the total protein phosphatase activity in the liver extract which included nonspecific and the Xu 5-P-activated enzyme. We estimated the latter protein phosphatase to represent approximately 25% of the total protein phosphatase in the extract.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Upon DEAE-cellulose chromatography of crude extract of liver, at least three major peaks of protein phosphatase were eluted (Fig. 1). Judging from the elution patterns, three major peaks corresponded closely to the three peaks of protein phosphatases reported by Pelech et al.(5Pelech S. Cohen P. Fisher M.J. Pogson C.I. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, none of these protein phosphatases was activated by Xu 5-P. Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase eluted at 0.35 M NaCl after the third major peak, and its activity was detected clearly in the presence of Xu 5-P. The elution from a size exclusion column TSK G3000SWXL (TosoHaas) indicated that the Mr of Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase was approximately 150,000. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (Fig. 2, lane 2) showed that the enzyme consisted of three subunits of 65, 52, and 36 kDa in nearly equimolar ratio since a densitometric scan of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel indicated the ratio of 1:0.7:0.7 (data not shown). No other protein bands were visible. Known serine/threonine protein phosphatases comprise at least two groups of protein phosphatases with distinct biochemical properties. These are protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) and type 2 (PP2) which can be further divided into three subspecies, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C(15Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). Because the pattern of the SDS-gel of the Xu 5-P-stimulated protein phosphatase was very similar to that of the heterotrimeric PP2A, immunoblotting was performed using an antibody against the catalytic subunit of PP2A. As shown in Fig. 2(lane 3), the antibody strongly reacted with the 36-kDa band, suggesting that the Xu 5-P-stimulated protein phosphatase is PP2A. Serine/threonine protein phosphatases are known to be characterized by their dependencies on cations and response to inhibitors(15Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). The Xu 5-P-stimulated protein phosphatase activity was not dependent on Mg2+, Ca2+, or Mn2+ ions (data not shown), thus excluding PP2B and PP2C. Okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of PP2A (IC50 = 1 nM) but requires much higher concentrations to inhibit PP1 (IC50 = 15-40 nM). It is, therefore, useful in distinguishing PP1 and PP2A(16Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21435-21438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase activity was inhibited 45 and 53% by 1 nM okadaic acid in the absence and presence of Xu 5-P, respectively (Fig. 3). These results indicated that the Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase was PP2A, consistent with the immunoblotting analysis. The concentration of Xu 5-P which produced a half-maximal activation was 10 μM (data not shown), which is similar to the values we reported previously with crude liver extract(6Nishimura M. Fedorov S. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26100-26106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When rat liver Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase was used as a substrate, the Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase showed a Km value of 0.8 μM and Vmax = 280 mU/mg in the absence of Xu 5-P (Table 2). Addition of 50 μM Xu 5-P increased the Vmax by more than 2-fold without affecting the Km.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab When phosphorylase a and pyruvate kinase were used as substrates, the Km value was five and three times, respectively, higher than that with rat liver bifunctional enzyme as a substrate, while the Vmax remained the same. Interestingly, addition of Xu 5-P (50 μM) had no effect on either Km or Vmax when phosphorylase a or pyruvate kinase was used as a substrate. Although the Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase catalyzed the dephosphorylation of those substrates, the activation by Xu 5-P occurred only with Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase as a substrate. To examine the specificity for Xu 5-P, effects of various sugar phosphates including the major intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway were examined at near physiological concentrations(17Casazza J.P. Veech R.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These compounds included glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (50 μM), erythrose 4-phosphate (5 μM), ribose 5-phosphate (50 μM), ribulose 5-phosphate (50 μM), 6-phosphogluconate (100 μM), glucose 6-phosphate (200 μM), Fru 6-P (50 μM), and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (100 μM). None of these sugar phosphates activated more than 1.2 times while under the same conditions Xu 5-P activation was 2.2 times. PP2A are heterotrimers composed of structural (A, 65 kDa), catalytic (C, 36 kDa), and regulatory (B, 55 or 75 kDa) subunits, and the B subunits, which determine the substrate specificity, are most variable(18Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). A band corresponding to the B subunit (52 kDa; Fig. 2) of the Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was digested by trypsin, and the amino acid sequences of five tryptic peptides were determined. Based on the limited sequence analysis of these peptides (Fig. 4), B subunit of Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase was similar to Bα subunit of rat PP2A(19Pallas D.C. Weller W. Jaspers S. Miller Jr., T.B. Lane W.S. Roberts T.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there were five amino acid residues of 73 which differed from the Bα sequence, and three of these five residues were nonconservative substitutions. In the present study we have purified Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase to apparent homogeneity from rat liver administered with high glucose. Based on the cation dependencies, the dose response to okadaic acid, and the reaction to antibody, this protein phosphatase is likely to be an isozyme of PP2A. Although PP2A is the most abundant isozyme among protein phosphatases, this PP2A is new because no other PP2A holoenzyme (or other protein phosphatase) reported thus far is activated by a sugar phosphate. The enzyme is a heterotrimer, consisting of subunits with Mr = 65,000, 52,000, and 36,000. The known PP2A holoenzymes are heterotrimeric complexes consisting of a catalytic subunit (C, Mr = 36,000-38,000), a structural subunit (A, Mr = 60,000-65,000), and a third subunit termed B or phosphatase regulatory (PR) subunit (Mr = 54,000-55,000 or 72,000-74,000) (15Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, 18Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 20Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular cloning thus far has identified two isoforms (α and β) of both A (21Walter G. Ferrer F. Espiritu O. Carbone-Wiley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8669-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Hemmings B.A. Adams-Pearson C. Maurer F. Muller P. Goris J. Merlevede W. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and C (23Green D.D. Yang S. Mumby M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4880-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7215-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) subunits, and the amino acid sequences of these subunits are highly conserved during evolution (25Orgad S. Brewis N.D. Alphey L. Axton J.M. Dudai Y. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because of the highly conserved nature of these subunits, we assigned the 65-kDa subunit of the PP2A as A subunit of Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase and the 36-kDa subunit as the C subunit based on its Mr and immunoreactivity toward the catalytic subunit. Multiple families and isoforms of the regulatory subunits (B), however, increase the diversity and complexity of the PP2A enzyme. Various holoenzymes containing different B subunits are thought to play important roles in diverse physiological functions by determining substrate specificity and by regulating catalytic activities of PP2A(26Imaoka T. Imazu M. Usui H. Kinohara N. Takeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1526-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mumby M.C. Russell K.L. Garrard L.J. Green D.D. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1992; 205: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). While the same A and C subunits are present in different cells, the B subunits comprise at least three distinct families of proteins. These B subunits include Mr = 55,000 (B/PR55), Mr = 54,000 (B′), and Mr = 72,000-74,000 (B″/PR72). Biochemical and immunological analyses have shown that these regulatory subunits are distinct polypeptides(15Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, 18Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 20Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar). Three cDNAs for B/PR55 (α, β, and γ) have been cloned from mammalian sources(19Pallas D.C. Weller W. Jaspers S. Miller Jr., T.B. Lane W.S. Roberts T.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mayer R.E. Hendrix P. Cron P. Matthies R. Stone S.R. Goris J. Merlevede W. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3589-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31Healy A.M. Zolnierowicz S. Stapelton A.E. Goebl M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5767-5780Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and these isoforms of B subunits have been shown to be also highly conserved during evolution(18Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of a limited number of tryptic peptides derived from the B subunit of Xu 5-P-activated PP2A revealed that, although it is closest to the rat neuronal Bα subunit(19Pallas D.C. Weller W. Jaspers S. Miller Jr., T.B. Lane W.S. Roberts T.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), several amino acids are different. Moreover, since this B subunit was smaller (52 kDa) than any of the known B subunits, it is possible that this is a new and unique subunit. A question may be raised whether Xu 5-P-activated PP2A could account for the dephosphorylation of the bifunctional enzyme in vivo. The concentration of the bifunctional enzyme in rat liver is 0.4 μM dimer(32Sakakibara R. Kitajima S. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 41-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), containing 0.8 μM phosphorylation sites, which is the same as the Km of the PP2A for this substrate. The PP2A activity (Vmax) in rat liver is 2.4 and 6 milliunits/g of liver in the absence and the presence of Xu 5-P, respectively. Thus, there is sufficient Xu 5-P-activated PP2A activity to dephosphorylate the bifunctional enzyme completely in less than 20 s in the presence of Xu 5-P, taking into account that the activity is 0.5 Vmax. Furthermore, we believe that 2-3 times activation by Xu 5-P is significant because the substrate itself, i.e. the bifunctional enzyme, is a catalyst which is being activated by the protein phosphatase and consequently should not require large changes in the protein phosphatase activity. This represents another example of a cascade system of signal amplification. The mechanism by which Xu 5-P activates this protein phosphatase is currently unknown. One possibility is that since Xu 5-P activates the dephosphorylation of only Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase as a substrate, the pentose-P may bind to the bifunctional enzyme, and the complex could be a better substrate than the free enzyme for the protein phosphatase. Another possibility is that Xu 5-P may bind to the B subunit and dissociate B from the heterotrimer, resulting in activation. Pelech et al.(5Pelech S. Cohen P. Fisher M.J. Pogson C.I. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) studied the substrate specificity of the catalytic subunit of PP2A and reported about the same activity toward Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase, phosphorylase a, and pyruvate kinase. Thus, it is possible that the B subunit inhibits the potential activity of the C subunit in the trimer, specifically with Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase as substrate and that Xu 5-P reacts with B to release this inhibition. These possibilities and others are currently under investigation. It is generally thought that PP2A is always in an active state in vivo and inhibitors regulate the PP2A activities in vivo. As far as we are aware, the activation of PP2A by Xu 5-P in rat liver described herein represents one of only two examples of metabolite (or small Mr compounds) activation of PP2A. The other is activation of a heterotrimeric form of PP2A of rat T9 glioma cells by ceramide(33Dobrowsky R.T. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5048-5051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dobrowsky R.T. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15523-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a more recent report (35Law B. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12808-12813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) indicates that even the catalytic subunit is activated by ceramide and lacks substrate specificity. This is in contrast to the Xu 5-P-activated PP2A, because activation by Xu 5-P shows the substrate specificity, thus reflecting the differences in the activation mechanism. Since PP2A is not only the most abundant form of protein phosphatase, especially in cytoplasm, but also shows broad substrate specificities, it is possible that other PP2As may be regulated by specific metabolites. It is becoming increasingly clear that Fru 2,6-P2 is one of the most important activators of phosphofructokinase and glycolysis in liver. The concentration of this sugar bisphosphate in liver is responsive to hormones and nutritional states (reviewed in (1Uyeda K. Kuby S.A. CRC Review. vol. 2. CRC Press, Boston1991: 445-456Google Scholar)). Consequently, the bifunctional enzyme, Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase, which catalyzes synthesis and degradation of Fru 2,6-P2, is one of the most important enzymes in regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Although this enzyme is regulated by several metabolites based on in vitro studies(1Uyeda K. Kuby S.A. CRC Review. vol. 2. CRC Press, Boston1991: 445-456Google Scholar, 7Hue L. Rider M.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 254: 313-324Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the enzyme is probably more important in vivo. The relative activities of the kinase and the phosphatase, which determine the Fru 2,6-P2 level, are directly related to the phosphorylation state of the bifunctional enzyme. The latter then is controlled by the relative activities of protein kinase and protein phosphatase (Fig. 5). The phosphorylation of Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase is catalyzed by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase which results in inhibition of Fru-6-P,2-kinase and activation of Fru-2,6-Pase, leading to decreased Fru 2,6-P2 and inhibition of glycolysis. Thus, the hormonal control of the bifunctional enzyme is by cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of the bifunctional enzyme. Dephosphorylation of Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase is catalyzed by Xu 5-P-activated PP2A described here, which is regulated in part by the Xu 5-P level in liver. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (a) Xu 5-P is an intermediate of both oxidative and nonoxidative parts of the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway and is shown to rise with high glucose administration in liver (17Casazza J.P. Veech R.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); (b) among the protein phosphatases in the liver extract, only this PP2A was activated specifically by Xu 5-P. The observation that Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase also catalyzes dephosphorylation of phosphorylase a and pyruvate kinase in the absence of Xu 5-P may be explained by the possible differences in the locations of these substrates and the PP2A in the cells; and (c) Xu 5-P-activated PP2A is activated by Xu 5-P only with the bifunctional enzyme as a substrate. It is, therefore, tempting to suggest that Xu 5-P serves as a second messenger, sensing the glucose level in circulation and attenuating the effects of cAMP. Thus, it is possible that cAMP and Xu 5-P are the key signals in regulating the relative activities of the protein kinase and the protein phosphatase in a reciprocal manner to maintain glucose homeostasis. Obviously, further investigation is necessary to determine the significance of the roles that Xu 5-P-activated PP2A plays in liver. In addition to Xu 5-P, another factor is required to completely activate the PP2A induced by high glucose administration in liver(6Nishimura M. Fedorov S. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26100-26106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of this factor is unknown at present but may involve a covalent modification of the PP2A. There is evidence that the free catalytic subunit or AC form of PP2A can be phosphorylated in vitro by tyrosine kinases such as pp60v-r, the epidermal growth factor, and the insulin receptor(36Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). It is possible that Xu 5-P-activated PP2A is also regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and this possibility requires further investigation.

We isolated cDNA for mouse 8-oxo-dGTPase, using as a probe human MTH1 (Escherichia coli mutT homolog) cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA revealed that the mouse MTH1 protein (molecular weight of 17,896) comprises 156 amino acid residues. When the cDNA for mouse 8-oxo-dGTPase was expressed in E. coli mutT- mutant cells devoid of their own 8-oxo-dGTPase activity, an 18-kDa protein, which is cross-reactive with an anti-human MTH1 antibody, was formed. In such cells, the level of spontaneous mutation frequency that was elevated reverted to normal. High levels of 8-oxo-dGTPase activity were found in liver, thymus, and large intestine, whereas all other organs examined contained smaller amounts of the enzyme. In embryonic stem cells, an exceedingly high level of the enzyme was present."

Activation requires translocation of cytosolic proteins p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2 to the plasma membrane and association with the membrane flavocytochrome b to assemble a functioning oxidase. We report the location of a region in p47phox that mediates its interaction with flavocytochrome b. From a random peptide phage display library, we used biopanning with purified flavocytochrome b to select phage peptides that mimicked potential p47phoxbinding residues. Using this approach, we identified a region of p47phox from residue 323 to 342 as a site of interaction with flavocytochrome b. Synthetic peptides 315SRKRLSQDAYRRNS328, 323AYRRNSVRFL332, and 334QRRRQARPGPQSPG347 inhibited superoxide (O∸2) production in the broken cell system with IC50 of 18, 57, and 15 μM, respectively. 323AYRRNSVRFL332 and its derivative peptides inhibited phosphorylation of p47phox. However, the functional importance of this peptide was independent of its effects on phosphorylation, since 323AYRRNAVRFL332 inhibited O∸2 production, but had no effect on phosphorylation. None of the peptides blocked O∸2 production when added after enzyme activation, suggesting that they inhibited the assembly, rather than the activity, of the oxidase. Furthermore these peptides inhibited membrane association of p47phox in the broken cell translocation assay and O∸2 production by electropermeabilized neutrophils, thereby supporting the interpretation that this region of p47phox interacts with flavocytochrome b.

Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs)1 play an important role in host defense against invading microorganisms. PMNs possess an NADPH-dependent oxidase which is capable of generating superoxide anion (O∸2) and other microbicidal oxygen-derived species (e.g. H2O2, HOCl) when activated by various particulate and soluble stimuli(1Badwey J.A. Karnovsky M.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 695Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 2Baggiolini M. Boulay F. Badwey J.A. Curnutte J.T. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent enzyme system which is unassembled in resting PMNs but assembles on the plasma membrane in activated PMNs(3Clark R.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 161: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 4Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The critical importance of the PMN NADPH oxidase in normal host defense is most dramatically illustrated by the frequent and severe infections seen in patients with chronic granulomatous disease(5Smith R.M. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1991; 77: 673-686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dinauer M.C. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1993; 30: 329-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The PMNs from such patients lack a functionally competent oxidase and, when stimulated, fail to generate O∸2. Essential components of the NADPH oxidase include plasma membrane and cytosolic proteins. The key plasma membrane component is a heterodimeric flavocytochrome b which is composed of a 91-kDa glycoprotein (gp91phox) and a 22-kDa protein (p22phox)(7Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G.

Flavocytochrome b serves to transfer electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen, resulting in the generation of O∸2. In PMN membranes, a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein, Rap1A, is associated with flavocytochrome b and plays an important role in NADPH oxidase regulation in vivo(11Quinn M.T. Parkos C.A.

Additionally, a cytosolic protein, p40phox, has recently been identified, but its role in oxidase function is not completely defined(22Wientjes F.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). According to the current model of NADPH oxidase assembly, p47phox and p67phox translocate en bloc to associate with flavocytochrome b during PMN activation(23Park J.W. Ma M. Ruedi J.M. Smith R.M.

Rac2 translocates simultaneously but independently of the other two cytosolic components to associate with the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase(25Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J.

In previous studies, peptides mimicking p47phox residues 323AYRRNSVRFL332 inhibited phosphorylation of p47phox, O∸2 production, and translocation of cytosolic components in the broken cell system (35Nauseef W.M.

In the present work, we used an approach combining the screening of a random peptide phage display library with the functional analysis of synthetic peptides to define residues in p47phox which interact with flavocytochrome b. Our data indicate that the region encompassing amino acids 323-342 comprises a functionally important domain in the association of p47phox with flavocytochrome b. NADPH, ferricytochrome c (horse heart, type VI), superoxide dismutase, and FAD were obtained from Sigma. GTPγS (5′-triphosphate) was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim and arachidonic acid (sodium salt) from NuChek Prep (Elysian, MN). NHS-LC-biotin was obtained from Pierce, and streptavidin was from Fisher. Dextran, Ficoll, and Percoll were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and Hypaque was obtained from Winthrop Laboratories (New York). Human PMNs were isolated from heparinized venous blood using sequential dextran sedimentation, differential density sedimentation in Hypaque-Ficoll gradients, and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes as described previously (35Nauseef W.M.

Purified PMNs were treated with 2 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate for 20 min at 4°C, washed, resuspended in relaxation buffer (KCl, 100 mM; NaCl, 3 mM; MgCl2, 3.5 mM; EGTA, 1.25 mM; Pipes, 10 mM, pH 7.3) and disrupted by N2 cavitation(35Nauseef W.M.

Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted (200 × g, 6 min, 5°C) and the supernatant loaded on top of an isotonic discontinuous gradient of Percoll as described previously(37Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Cytosol was collected from the top of the gradient and clarified before use. The plasma membrane fraction was collected, Percoll removed by centrifugation, and the membrane washed prior to use. Alternatively, purified PMNs (5 × 108/ml in 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0) were disrupted by N2 cavitation as described previously.

Fifty μg of human neutrophil flavocytochrome b was biotinylated to a final biotin/protein ratio of 20:1 (39Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Three rounds of biopanning were performed as described previously (39Smith G.P. Scott J.K.

The bacteriophage eluates of the first two pans were amplified in K91 Escherichia coli cells on solid Luria-Bertani (LB) agar dishes containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin to approximately 1013 plaque-forming units. The phage were then extracted(41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 4.21-4.38Google Scholar), and one-third of the eluate was used in the next round. The third round eluate was plated in K91 cells on LB plates, and plaques were then randomly picked and sequenced using a gene III-specific primer(40Burritt J.B. Quinn M.T. Jutila M.A. Bond C.W.

Dried sequencing gels were analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Peptides SRKRLSQDAYRRNS, QRRRQARPGPQSPG, RQARPGPQ, KLSYRPRDSNE, and AVEGGMKPVKLLVGC were synthesized by the Montana State University Peptide Synthesis Facility. Peptide sequences and purity (>95%) were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The p47phox peptides PPRRSSIRNA, HQRSRKRLSQD, AYRRNSVRFL, and gp91phox peptide RGVHFIF were synthesized at the Core Peptide Facility at the University of Iowa and displayed >95% purity via high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The p47phox (323-332)-related peptides (Table 1 and Table 2) were obtained from Macromolecular Resources (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO), and sequence and purity were confirmed by mass spectrometry.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab NADPH oxidase activity was measured using two different versions of the broken cell system, and results with the two systems were similar.

Leusen J.H.W. Kessels G.C.R. Hilarius P.M. De Bont D.B.A. Liskamp R.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18593-18598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Conditions used to assess the effect of various peptides on the phosphorylation of p47phox mirrored closely those for quantification of O∸2 generation and have been described in detail previously(35Nauseef W.M.

Relative quantitation of p47phox phosphorylation was obtained by densitometric analysis of resultant autoradiographs. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted as described previously(21Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Relative amounts of translocated proteins were quantitated by densitometric analysis of the immunoreactive p47phox detected by autoradiography or colorimetric assay. Histopaque-purified neutrophils were washed once with ice-cold permeabilization buffer (140 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes, 10 mMD-glucose, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.193 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.2) and then resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with 100 μM GTPγS, 1 mM ATP, and 2 mM NADPH, to a final concentration of 107 cells/ml and stored on ice. Aliquots of 800 μl were placed in 0.4-cm electroporation cuvettes and permeabilized with a Bio-Rad gene pulser using two consecutive pulses (with brief stirring between pulses) of 3.75 kV/cm with a 25-microfarad capacitor (τ = 0.3-0.5 ms) at 4°C. The cells were then incubated on ice for 5 and 30 min with or without 1 mM of the appropriate peptide. Subsequently, the cells were diluted into supplemented permeabilization buffer containing 100 μM cytochrome c ± 1 mM peptide (final concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml) and then stimulated with 1 μg/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (reference cuvette contained 25 μg/ml superoxide dismutase). The maximal rate of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c was determined on a Cary dual-beam spectrophotometer (Varian, Melbourne, Australia) at 550 nm and 25°C for 10 min. Electropermeabilized neutrophils retained 92.3 ± 1.9 and 49.8 ± 6.3% of their ability to produce O∸2 when incubated for 5 and 30 min after pulsing, respectively, compared with control, nonpermeabilized cells and were found to be 98% permeable to trypan blue 5 min after permeabilization. To identify the region or regions in p47phox that associate with flavocytochrome b, a random sequence nonapeptide bacteriophage display library was screened with purified flavocytochrome b. The predicted amino acid sequences from 94 of these affinity selected bacteriophage were analyzed and three dominant consensus motifs were identified (Fig. 1). When compared with the amino acid sequence of p47phox, these motifs mapped to residues 323-342 in p47phox, a region which contains multiple sites for serine/threonine kinase phosphorylation and includes a previously identified area of potential interaction with flavocytochrome b at residues 323-332(35Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Nauseef W.M. Eur. J. Haematol. 1993; 51: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The strongest homology among phage peptides was evident in those representative of the p47phox region 338QARPG342, and eight phage isolates contained three to four residues identical to this region. Additionally, seven phage isolates contained peptides that were homologous to p47phox residues 332LQQRRRQ338 (six of these contained three-residue matches), which immediately precede the 338QARPG342 region. In combination, 21 phage isolates were representative of the p47phox region 332LQQRRRQARPG342 (Fig. 1). Conservative substitutions and one residue shifts give many of these phage peptides even more similarity to the indicated region. This is especially evident for residues 335-337, where arginine appears to be substituted by a positively charged histidine or lysine. A third consensus sequence mapped to p47phox324YRRNS328 and was represented by 21 phage peptides, and conservative substitutions or one-residue shifts give many phage representative of this area an even greater similarity. Nauseef et al.(35Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously found that p47phox residues 323AYRRNSVRFL332 represented a functionally important domain involved in NADPH oxidase assembly. Certain residues within this region appear to be critically important for structural constraints, as the exclusion of these residues renders the peptide ineffective at inhibiting O∸2 production in the broken cell assay(35Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mapping of this site using a random sequence library provides direct evidence confirming the biological relevance of this site. To determine if the p47phox regions selected from the phage display library approach were relevant for the association of p47phox with flavocytochrome b and, thus, NADPH oxidase activity, peptides representative of these regions were synthesized and analyzed in a broken cell NADPH oxidase assay. In a previous study, p47phox peptides 299PPRRSSIRNA308 and 312HQRSRSRKRLSQD322 did not affect O∸2 production significantly in the broken cell assay at concentrations up to 500 μM(35Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These peptides encompass potential phosphorylation sites, are also positively charged, and precede the 323-342 region of p47phox mapped by the phage display library. In contrast, the peptides mimicking portions of p47phox residues 315-347, 315SRKRLSQDAYRRNS332, 323AYRRNSVRFL332, and 334QRRRQARPGPQSPG347, all inhibited O∸2 production in the broken cell assay in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 18, 57, and 15 μM, respectively (see Fig. 2 and Table 1). Surprisingly, a shorter peptide derived from 334QRRRQARPGPQSPG347, 337RQARPGPQ344, was much less inhibitory (IC50 $#x223C;750 μM) (see Fig. 2). Apparently, the loss of key flanking residues and/or the potential phosphorylation site at Ser345, or most likely, loss of conformational constraint rendered 337RQARPGPQ344 ineffective at inhibiting O∸2 production in the broken cell system. Charge alone does not seem to be the major determinant of inhibition in the broken cell assay. A control, unrelated peptide (KLSRPRDSNE) and two p47phox peptides (299PPRRSSIRNA308 and 312HQRSRSRKRLSQD322) all contain a similar percentage of positively charged residues (27.3, 30.0, and 46.2%, respectively) as do 334QRRRQARPGPQSPG347 and 315SRKRLSQDAYRRNS332 (28.6 and 35.7%, respectively), but had no inhibitory activity in the broken cell system at concentrations up to 500 μM. Previous studies indicated that p47phox peptide 323-332 is important in the assembly of a functioning NADPH oxidase(35Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to define more precisely the residues in this region which are critical for oxidase assembly, we compared the effects of various peptides derived from p47phox 323-332 on O∸2 generation in the broken cell system (Table 1). Peptide 325-330, a hexapeptide including the putative phosphorylation site at Ser328, did not inhibit O∸2 production in the broken cell system. Similarly the addition of Tyr324 or Phe331 to RRNSVR did not make the peptide inhibitory. However, the addition of both aromatic residues to RRNSVR resulted in inhibitory activity, albeit still less than that of the parent peptide (Table 1). Substitution of tryptophan either for Phe331 or for Tyr324 in p47phox peptide 323-332 did not alter the inhibitory effects of the parent peptide on O∸2 production. The substitution S328A, wherein the phosphorylation site is replaced by an alanine, did not compromise the inhibitory activity of the peptide. In previous studies, we found that p47phox 323-332 inhibited the first step (activation) of a two-stage broken cell O∸2-generating system, and addition of peptide to the second step (after the components of the oxidase had assembled) did not inhibit O∸2 generation(35Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine, in a similar fashion, whether peptides 315SRKRLSQDAYRRNS328 and 334QRRRQARPGPQSPG347 inhibited assembly of the oxidase, they were added to the broken cell system after activation. Added in this manner, the peptides, at 100 μM, exhibited only minimal inhibition of the oxidase (78.9%± 3.2 and 78.7%± 4.1 of control activity, respectively, versus 16.7 ± 1.2% and 15.5 ± 0.5% of control when added before activation; see Fig. 2) This observation is consistent with studies of Kleinberg et al.(27Kleinberg M.E. Malech H.L. Rotrosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15577-15583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our previous studies(32DeLeo F.R. Yu L. Burritt J.B. Loetterle L.R. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. Quinn M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7110-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These data indicate that prior to full activation of the NADPH oxidase, peptides representative of regions on oxidase components that participate in protein-protein interactions block assembly. Previously, we reported that the inhibitory effects of p47phox 323-332 on O∸2 generation are paralleled in assays of p47phox phosphorylation and translocation in the broken cell system(35Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar studies of this family of p47phox 323-332-related peptides were performed (Table 1). In general, the effect of a given peptide on O∸2 generation was paralleled by its effect on translocation, supporting the idea that p47phox 323-332 exerts its inhibitory effect on O∸2 production by blocking translocation of p47phox and assembly of a functioning oxidase. In contrast, the effects of these peptides on phosphorylation of p47phox did not parallel effects on O∸2 production. RRNSVR, YRRNSVR, and RRNSVRF reduced phosphorylation of p47phox but did not block O∸2 production. The S328A mutation did not inhibit phosphorylation but did block O∸2 production and translocation. Taken together, these data suggest that in the broken cell system the interactive site(s) in p47phox 323-332 which associate with flavocytochrome b do not depend on their being phosphorylated. As discussed above, p47phox peptides 315-332, 323-332, and 334-347 all inhibited O∸2 production in the broken cell system when added prior to activation but were ineffective when added after assembly, suggesting that these peptides blocked assembly by interfering with the association of p47phox with flavocytochrome b. To confirm that p47phox peptides 315SRKRLSQDAYRRNS332 and 334QRRRQARPGPQSPG347 were blocking assembly of the NADPH oxidase rather than activity, these peptides were tested in the broken cell translocation assay at 100 μM. Both peptides inhibited the translocation of p47phox to the membrane compared to a control sample (Fig. 3). Peptide 334QRRRQARPGPQSPG347 inhibited translocation to $#x223C;4% of control (Fig. 3), whereas peptides 315SRKRLSQDAYRRNS332 and 323AYRRNSVRFL332 inhibited p47phox translocation to the membrane to 35 and 16% (Fig. 3 and Table 1) of control, respectively. In contrast, peptides representative of p47phox residues preceding and partially encompassing 315-342 (299PPRRSSIRNA308 and 312HQRSRSRKRLSQD322) did not inhibit O∸2 production or translocation of p47phox to the membrane in broken cell assay systems(35Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The broken cell assay for O∸2 production does not mimic entirely, the NADPH oxidase assembly in the intact PMN(45Nauseef W.M. Eur. J. Haematol. 1993; 51: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For that reason, the ability of active p47phox peptides to inhibit in electropermeabilized neutrophils was evaluated. Peptides 315SRKRLSQDAYRRNS328, 323AYRRNSVRFL332, and 334QRRRQARPGPQSPG347 were incubated with the permeabilized neutrophils for 5 min and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated O∸2 production by these cells was determined. We chose a 5-min treatment time in these experiments for two reasons: 1) the cells were determined to be fully permeable by this time (>98% permeable), and 2) at longer incubation times the permeabilized cells failed to retain a level of O∸2 generating capacity that reasonably reflected that in the intact cell (>92% of control activity was maintained after 5 min of incubation, whereas <50% activity was present after 30 min). As shown in Table 2, the peptides that were inhibitory in the broken cell assay system also inhibited O∸2 production in permeabilized neutrophils ($#x223C;40-50% inhibition compared with controls). Similarly, peptides that were inactive in the broken cell assay (337RQARPGPQ344 and 325RRNSVR330) also had no effect on permeabilized cells and served as negative controls (Table 2). In addition, we also tested the gp91phox carboxyl-terminal peptide RGVHFIF as a positive control, since it was shown previously by Kleinberg et al.(27Kleinberg M.E. Malech H.L. Rotrosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15577-15583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to inhibit oxidase activity in electropermeabilized cells. Our data (Table 2) were consistent with their results. Two irrelevant peptides (AVEGGMKPVKLLVGC and KLSYRPRDSNE) were used to determine nonspecific peptide effects in permeabilized cells, and their molecular weights (1500.3 and 1364.5, respectively) were similar to that of 323AYRRNSVRFL332 (1281.6), 315SRKRLSQDAYRRNS328 (1719.1), and 334QRRRQARPGPQSPG347 (1590.8). Thus, in support of our findings in the broken cell assays, our data indicate that the active p47phox peptides identified represent sites which participate in the assembly of the active NADPH oxidase in vivo. The cytosolic NADPH oxidase protein p47phox has been shown to associate with flavocytochrome b, and several sites have been identified in carboxyl-terminal domains of both gp91phox and p22phox that are important for this interaction(27Kleinberg M.E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19072-19074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, our recent studies suggest that p47phox also binds to a region close to the amino terminus of gp91phox(32DeLeo F.R. Yu L. Burritt J.B. Loetterle L.R. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. Quinn M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7110-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recent studies have examined which regions in p47phox participate in the binding to flavocytochrome b. Two reports demonstrated that Src homology 3 domains in p47phox may interact with p22phox(29Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 33Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) screened p47phox peptides containing phosphorylation sites and found that one of these peptides (323-332) represents a functionally important domain in p47phox. This peptide, 323AYRRNSVRFL332, inhibits O∸2 production, phosphorylation, and translocation of p47phox in the broken cell system(35Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the data suggested that this p47phox domain might play a role in oxidase assembly, although no direct evidence supported this possibility. In the present studies using random peptide phage display library analysis, we provide direct evidence that p47phox residues 323-332, as well as the adjacent region extending to residue 342, are important in the binding of p47phox to flavocytochrome b. Thus, the entire binding domain encompasses residues 323-342 of p47phox, and synthetic peptides representing these adjacent sites and overlapping with the 323-332 region were potent inhibitors of NADPH oxidase activity. The phage display library analysis of potential flavocytochrome b-binding domains in p47phox indicated that among the 94 phage sequenced the strongest homologies to p47phox were 324YRRNS328, 332LQQRRRQ338, and 338QARPG342. Moreover, p47phox peptides encompassing these residues (315SRKRLSQDAYRRNS332, 323AYRRNSVRFL332, and 334QRRRQARPGPQSPG347) all inhibited superoxide production and translocation of p47phox in the cell-free system. The inhibition of O∸2 production was shown to be dose-dependent and targeted assembly of the oxidase rather than activity, as demonstrated by the inhibition of translocation by these peptides and their ineffectiveness when added after assembly of the oxidase. In addition to inhibiting O∸2 production and translocation in the broken cell system, the p47phox peptides 315SRKRLSQDAYRRNS332, 323AYRRNSVRFL332, and 334QRRRQARPGPQSPG347 all inhibited O∸2 production significantly in intact, permeabilized neutrophils, suggesting that they do indeed represent biologically relevant sites involved in NADPH oxidase assembly. Electropermeabilized neutrophils, which retained nearly all of their ability to generate O∸2 when compared with nonpermeabilized cells, may provide a more accurate representation of the in vivo situation. The inhibitory effect of the p47phox peptides on O∸2 production in permeabilized neutrophils supports the data from the phage library analysis and broken cell system and confirms that p47phox residues 323-342 are important for oxidase activation. Phosphorylation of p47phox is required for activation of the NADPH oxidase in neutrophils(46Hayakawa T. Suzuki K. Suzuki S. Andrews P.C. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9109-9115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19910-19915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Heyworth P.G. Badwey J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); however, this requirement for phosphorylation is not observed in the broken cell system(35Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Nauseef W.M. Eur. J. Haematol. 1993; 51: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been suggested that phosphorylation of p47phox may function, in part, to neutralize positively charged regions of the protein, thus allowing it to interact with the membrane or target protein. In the broken cell system, the addition of anionic detergent (SDS) or arachidonic acid appears to bypass the need for p47phox phosphorylation by imparting negative charge to the protein. Consistent with this hypothesis, the p47phox region identified here as an important domain for association with flavocytochrome b and NADPH oxidase assembly (323-342), is within a larger region (314-347) that contains 11 positively charged residues, one protein kinase C phosphorylation site (Ser328), and is surrounded by several other potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase(49El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, Joseph et al.(50Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Koshkin V. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29024-29031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that any polybasic peptide (≥5 basic residues) could nonspecifically inhibit NADPH oxidase activity; however, they also found that an 11 residue peptide containing six lysines had no effect on oxidase activity. We have analyzed a number of polybasic peptides, including some peptides with the same number of basic residues as in our active peptides, that had no inhibitory effect on NADPH oxidase activity in a broken cell assay system ((35Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Table 1) and in electropermeabilized neutrophils (Table 2). Thus, the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity by the active p47phox peptides is specific to their sequences and/or the charge distribution represented by their sequences, and the apparent “nonspecific” inhibition of oxidase activity by polybasic peptides unrelated to the NADPH oxidase, as reported by Joseph et al.(50Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Koshkin V. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29024-29031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is due to the blocking of specific binding interactions (in this case between p47phox and gp91phox) that involve basic amino acid-enriched domains on one or both of the interacting proteins. In conclusion, the data presented, based on the complementary approaches of random peptide phage display library analysis and peptide inhibition in both broken cell and permeabilized cell systems, demonstrate that p47phox residues 323-342 interact with flavocytochrome b and are required for the association of these two NADPH oxidase components. The association is sequence-specific and appears to require certain conformational constraints. The elucidation of the sites of interaction between human neutrophil NADPH oxidase component proteins will lead to a further understanding of the regulation of this system.

In this report, we show that purified Ste20 and Shk1 were each capable of inducing p42MAPK activation in cell-free extracts of Xenopus laevis oocytes, while a mammalian Ste20/Shk1-related protein kinase, p65pak (Pak1), did not induce activation of p42MAPK. In contrast to p42MAPK, activation of JNK/SAPK in Xenopus oocyte extracts was induced by both the yeast Ste20 and Shk1 kinases, as well as by mammalian Pak1.

The basic MAPK module consists of a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and a MAPK. MAPKKKs phosphorylate and activate MAPKKs, which phosphorylate and activate MAPKs(4Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Homologs of these kinases appear to be both structurally and functionally conserved in evolution (3Herskowitz I.

Data from yeast genetic studies, and more recently from studies of mammalian cells, suggest that different types of extracellular signals activate distinct MAPK modules. For example, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, distinct MAPK modules mediate cellular responses to mating pheromones, osmotic shock, extracellular salt concentration, and nutrients(3Herskowitz I.

Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Substantially less is known about the regulation of MAPK cascades controlled by other types of receptors, in particular those activated by G protein-coupled seven transmembrane domain receptors (serpentine receptors)(2Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 15Cook S. McCormick F. Nature. 1994; 369: 361-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, recent studies (16Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 17White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12741-12748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have provided evidence for the existence of both Ras- and Raf-independent MAPK cascades. In the evolutionarily distant yeasts S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the p21cdc42/rac1-activated protein kinases (PAKs) Ste20 and Shk1, respectively, have been implicated as functioning upstream of pheromone receptor-induced MAPK modules(19Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 20Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6180-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 2P. Yang and S. Marcus, manuscript in preparation. Wu et al.(21Wu C. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) recently showed that Ste20 immune complexes phosphorylate the S. cerevisiae MAPKKK, Ste11, implicating Ste20 as a potential MAPKKK kinase. PAKs structurally related to Ste20 and Shk1 have been identified in mammalian cells(22Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 23Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). However, it has not yet been determined whether mammalian PAKs regulate MAPK cascades. In this report, we show that purified Ste20 and Shk1 protein kinases are each capable of inducing activation of p42MAPK in cell-free extracts of Xenopus laevis oocytes. In contrast, p65pak (Pak1), a mammalian PAK structurally related to Ste20 and Shk1, did not induce p42MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts. We show that the S. cerevisiae MAPKKK, Ste11, is capable of inducing p42MAPK activation, and that the N-terminal regulatory domain of Ste11 partially blocked Ste20-induced activation of p42MAPK. Finally, we show that unlike p42MAPK, activation of a JNK/SAPK cascade in Xenopus oocyte extracts was induced by both the yeast Ste20 and Shk1 kinases and by mammalian Pak1. Our data demonstrate that MAPK cascades that are activated by PAKs are conserved in higher eukaryotes and suggest that distinct MAPK modules may be regulated by different types of PAKs. The plasmids pRD56 (for expression of GST fusion proteins in S. cerevisiae), pGSTSHK1ΔN (for expression of a GST-Shk1ΔN (residues 183-450) in S. cerevisiae), pRD56STE11 (for expression of a GST-Ste11 fusion protein in S. cerevisiae), pRP259 and pRP259STE11ΔC (for expression of a GST and GST-Ste11ΔC (residues 1-415) fusion proteins, respectively, in Escherichia coli), and pTrcHisHRAS[G12V] (for expression of a polyhistidine-tagged H-Ras[G12V] protein in E. coli) have been described previously(20Marcus S.

The plasmid pRDSTE20RI, which was used for expression of the Ste20ΔN (residues 496-939) GST fusion protein (GSte20ΔN) in S. cerevisiae, was constructed by cloning an EcoRI-KpnI fragment of the STE20 gene into the corresponding sites of the plasmid pRD56. The oligonucleotide primers 5′-ATGTCTCAGTGGCCATTAGGCAAATGAATCTC-3′ and 5′-TCGTGTAATGGTAACCGACAATCGATGAGAAT-3′ were used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify a fragment of the STE20 gene carrying the K649R mutation. The resulting product was digested with MscI and KpnI and used to replace the corresponding fragment of the wild type STE20 gene, producing the mutant gene STE20[K649R]. An EcoRI-KpnI fragment of STE20ΔN[K649R] was cloned into the corresponding sites of pRD56, producing the plasmid pGSTE20ΔN[K649R], which was used to express GST-Ste20ΔN[K649R] fusion protein in S. cerevisiae. pGEXKGPAK1-232, which was used for expressing GST-Pak1ΔN (residues 232-544) in E. coli, will be described elsewhere. 3J. Frost, M. Hutchison, S. Marcus, and M. H. Cobb, manuscript in preparation. AN43-5A (MATaade1 arg4 leu2-3, 112 trp1 ura3-52 mfa1::FUS1::lacZ his3::FUS1:: HIS3) was used for expression of GST fusion proteins in S. cerevisiae. Yeast cultures expressing GST fusion proteins were grown to about 3 × 106 cells/ml in drop out medium (27Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) at 30°C with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended at about 106 cells/ml in 1 liter of drop out medium without glucose and containing 2% galactose, 2% glycerol, and 1% ethanol, and grown to a density of about 107 cells/ml. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously(24Marcus S. Polverino A. Barr M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7762-7766Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The yeast cell lysate (5 ml) was mixed with 2 ml of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and the resulting slurry incubated at 4°C for 30 min. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 2 ml of PBS. GST fusion protein-bound beads were stored at 4°C in PBS. Polyhistidine-tagged H-Ras[G12V] protein was expressed and purified as described previously(26Shibuya E.K. Polverino A.J. Chang E. Wigler M. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Kinase assays were performed by mixing 5 μl of purified protein suspension with 25 μl of kinase buffer (30 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM Na3VO4), adding 1 μl of [g-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, 100 μCi/ml (DuPont NEN)), and incubating for 15 min at 30°C. Reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 4 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide gels and then exposed to film for autoradiography. MAPK assays were performed by incubating fusion proteins with extracts prepared from stage 5 to stage 6 Xenopus oocytes as described previously(26Shibuya E.K. Polverino A.J. Chang E. Wigler M. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Protein blots were probed using anti-ERK polyclonal antibody, 691(10Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and developed using the ECL chemiluminescent detection kit as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). Genetic experiments have suggested that the S. cerevisiae and S. pombe PAKs, Ste20 and Shk1, respectively, function upstream of mating pheromone-induced MAPK modules(19Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 20Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6180-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).2 To examine whether PAK-responsive MAPK cascades are conserved in evolution, we utilized a cell-free system for examining the activation of p42MAPK in extracts of X. laevis oocytes(26Shibuya E.K. Polverino A.J. Chang E. Wigler M. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This and similar systems have previously been used to demonstrate in vitro activation of p42MAPK induced by purified Ras, Mos, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C(26Shibuya E.K. Polverino A.J. Chang E. Wigler M. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Hattori S. Fukuda M. Yamashita T. Nakamura S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J.

Using this assay system, a direct correlation between the mobility shift induced by these various agents and activation of the kinase activity of p42MAPK has been demonstrated(26Shibuya E.K. Polverino A.J. Chang E. Wigler M. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A GST-Ste20ΔN fusion protein (GSte20ΔN), lacking amino acid residues 1-495 of the Ste20 regulatory domain, and a GST-Shk1ΔN fusion protein (GShk1ΔN), lacking residues 1-182 of the Shk1 regulatory domain, were expressed in yeast and purified from cell lysates using glutathione-agarose beads (see “Materials and Methods”). Both GSte20ΔN (Fig. 1A) and GShk1ΔN (not shown) were judged to be catalytically active, based on the ability of each to autophosphorylate in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1B, GSte20ΔN rapidly induced activation of p42MAPK in Xenopus oocyte extracts, as measured by a decrease in the mobility of p42MAPK. Using less than 1% of the amount of GSte20ΔN protein compared with Ras protein, we detected Ste20ΔN-induced p42MAPK activation in 30 min, while p21ras-induced p42MAPK activation required 2 h. GShk1ΔN also induced activation of p42MAPK when added to Xenopus extracts, although not as rapidly as GSte20ΔN (Fig. 1B). A bacterially expressed Ste20 protein that contained a functional regulatory domain was also capable of inducing p42MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts, albeit not as effectively as either GSte20ΔN or GShk1ΔN (data not shown). To determine whether p42MAPK activation was dependent on Ste20 catalytic function, we introduced a mutation into the GSte20ΔN coding sequence at Lys649, a residue that is conserved in protein kinases(31Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar). GSte20ΔN[K649R] was catalytically inactive, as determined by its inability to autophosphorylate, and did not induce p42MAPK activation when added to Xenopus oocyte extracts (Fig. 2). Thus, p42MAPK activation induced by Ste20 requires that the protein be catalytically active. Genetic data suggest that the Ste11 protein kinase functions downstream of Ste20 in the S. cerevisiae pheromone response pathway (19Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the N-terminal regulatory domain of Ste11 could inhibit activation of p42MAPK induced by GSte20ΔN in Xenopus oocyte extracts. The Ste11 regulatory domain (residues 1-415) was purified from a bacterial expression system as a GST-fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 3A, GSte11ΔC partially blocked p42MAPK activation induced by GSte20ΔN in Xenopus oocyte extracts. This result is consistent with two possible interpretations: (i) the Ste11 N terminus inhibits the activity of a protein activated by Ste20 in Xenopus oocyte extracts or (ii) Ste11 is a substrate of Ste20. Having determined that the Ste11 N-terminal regulatory domain could partially block Ste20-induced p42MAPK activation, we tested whether Ste11 was capable of inducing activation of p42MAPK in Xenopus oocyte extracts. A full-length GST-Ste11 fusion protein (GSte11) was expressed in yeast and purified from cell lysates (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 3B, GSte11 induced p42MAPK activation when added to Xenopus oocyte extracts. While a Ste11 homolog has not yet been identified in X. laevis, several MAPK and MAPKK homologs have been isolated from this organism(32Gotoh Y. Moriyama K. Matsuda S. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. Sakai H. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2661-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 33Kosako H. Nishida E. Gotoh Y.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5738-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our results suggest the existence of a MAPK cascade in Xenopus oocytes that strongly resembles the mating pheromone-responsive MAPK cascades found in yeasts. A mammalian Ste20/Shk1-related protein kinase, Pak1, was previously purified as a Cdc42/Rac1-binding protein(23Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of Pak1 to activate p42MAPK in Xenopus oocyte extracts. The addition of a constitutively activated Pak1ΔN protein (residues 232-544) to Xenopus oocyte extracts failed to induce activation of p42MAPK (Fig. 4). This result demonstrates that the p42MAPK cascade induced by Ste20 and Shk1 in Xenopus oocytes is selectively activated by a limited subset of PAKs. To further examine the relationship between PAKs and the activation of MAPK cascades, we determined whether PAKs induce activation of a JNK/SAPK cascade in Xenopus oocytes. JNK/SAPKs comprise a subfamily of stress-activated MAPKs distinct from the p42/p44 MAPK subfamily(35Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, Pak1ΔN, as well as the yeast Ste20 and Shk1 kinases, each induced activation of JNK/SAPK in Xenopus oocyte extracts. MEKK, a potent activator of JNK/SAPK in mammalian systems, also induced activation of JNK/SAPK in Xenopus oocyte extracts (Fig. 5). In contrast, JNK/SAPK activation was only weakly induced by H-Ras protein (Fig. 5).Figure 5Yeast and mammalian PAKs induce activation of JNK/SAPK in Xenopus oocyte extracts. Xenopus oocyte extracts containing 2 μg of purified GST-JNK/SAPK were incubated with 1 μg of GST, 1 μg of H-Ras[G12V], 20 ng of GSte20ΔN, 3 μg of GMEKK, 40 ng of GShk1ΔN, 40 ng of GShk1-FL, or 1 μg of GPak1ΔN-232 under conditions used for p42MAPK assays (see “Materials and Methods”). After 4 h, 10 μl of glutathione agarose beads was added to each sample and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were washed once with PBS and once with kinase buffer before being resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer. GST-c-JunΔC (residues 1-231) (2 μg) was added and the samples incubated for 30 min at 30°C. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 3 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis in 4-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels, then exposed to film for autoradiography. Duplicate samples were blotted to nitrocellulose and probed with an anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz) and developed using ECL. JNK/SAPK activation is expressed as the ratio of c-JunΔC phosphorylation relative to c-JunΔC protein present as determined by scanning densitometry. All values are expressed relative to GST, which was normalized to a value of 1.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have shown that yeast PAKs-Ste20 from S. cerevisiae and Shk1 from S. pombe trigger the activation of p42MAPK in cell-free extracts of X. laevis oocytes. In contrast, we found that the mammalian kinase Pak1, a Ste20/Shk1-related protein originally isolated as a Cdc42/Rac1-binding protein(23Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), did not induce p42MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts. While not capable of inducing activation of p42MAPK, mammalian Pak1 did induce activation of JNK/SAPK, as did the yeast Ste20 and Shk1 kinases. Our results demonstrate that PAK-responsive MAPK cascades are conserved in evolution and suggest that in higher organisms distinct MAPK modules might be regulated by different types of PAKs. In particular, our results suggest that protein kinases more closely related to Ste20 and Shk1 than Pak1 might regulate p42MAPK signaling pathways in higher eukaryotes. We have, in fact, cloned rat cDNA sequences corresponding to six distinct Ste20/Shk1-related protein kinases, including Pak1 and Pak2. 4J. Frost, M. Hutchison, P. Yang, S. Marcus, and M. H. Cobb, work in progress. One of these encodes a protein kinase that is more closely related to Ste20 and Shk1 than Pak1 or Pak2. It is possible that through evolution, distinct PAKs have evolved to regulate distinct MAPK pathways. Given their capacity to activate both p42MAPK and JNK/SAPK pathways, it can be speculated that the yeast Ste20 and Shk1 kinases represent ancestral forms of PAKs. While this manuscript was in preparation, other investigators provided evidence that in mammalian cells Cdc42 and Rac1 induce activation of JNK/SAPKs(36Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). In one of these studies(38Minden A. Lin A. Ciaret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar), it was shown that the N-terminal regulatory domain of Pak1 blocked Cdc42 and Rac1-induced JNK/SAPK activation. However, since Pak1 binds directly to Cdc42 and Rac1(23Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), it could not be concluded from this experiment whether Pak1 itself mediated Cdc42/Rac1-induced activation of JNK/SAPK. Our results demonstrate that Pak1 does indeed signal to the JNK/SAPK pathway. It is likely, therefore, that Pak1 represents a link between Cdc42/Rac1 and JNK/SAPK cascades. It remains to be determined exactly how PAKs fit into the regulatory networks that lead to the activation of MAPK modules. In fission yeast, Shk1 and Cdc42 are components of a Ras-dependent signaling complex that regulates both cytoskeletal-dependent cellular morphology and a MAPK module(20Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6180-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We have recently obtained genetic data suggesting that Shk1 acts upstream of the MAPKKK, Byr2.2 Genetic data also indicate that in S. cerevisiae Ste20 functions upstream of Ste11(19Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), which is both structurally and functionally related to Byr2 (5Neiman A.M. Stevenson B.J. Xu H.P. Sprague Jr., G.F. Herskowitz I. Wigler M. Marcus S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with biochemical data from others showing that Ste20 immune complexes are capable of phosphorylating Ste11 in vitro(21Wu C. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is possible that Ste20 and Shk1 are MAPKKK kinases, although direct demonstration of this will require the use of purified proteins. Recent studies have shown that in mammalian cells, as in fission yeast, Cdc42 proteins participate in the regulation of cytoskeletal-dependent cell morphology(39Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 40Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3679) Google Scholar). The structurally related small G proteins, Rac and Rho, also control cytoskeletal organization(41Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar, 42Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether Cdc42-activated protein kinases related to Ste20 and Shk1 participate in cytoskeletal regulation in mammalian cells. However, we have obtained results consistent with this possibility. We have found that expression of the N-terminal regulatory domain of Pak2 alters cytoskeletal organization in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and disrupts normal morphology in fission yeast.4 Thus, it appears likely that in both yeasts and higher eukaryotes, Ste20/Shk1-related protein kinases participate both in cytoskeletal regulation and in MAPK signaling pathways. It remains to be determined whether there is a link between MAPK signaling and control of the actin cytoskeleton. Further study and characterization of PAKs using metazoan cell systems in combination with yeast genetic and molecular biological approaches should provide a better understanding of the roles these types of protein kinases play in eukaryotic signal transduction pathways.

Close examination of the mammary tumors obtained from MMTV-myc, -ras, and -neu transgenic mice revealed significant correlation between the distinctive histologic appearance of each tumor and the identity of its transforming oncogene(6Cardiff R.D. Sinn E. Muller W. Leder P. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 495-501PubMed Google Scholar). This correlation can be thought of as having arisen through either of two mechanisms(6Cardiff R.D. Sinn E. Muller W. Leder P. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 495-501PubMed Google Scholar, 7Morrison B.W. Leder P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3417-3426PubMed Google Scholar). One stipulates that the mammary gland contains several cell types that differ in their susceptibility to transformation by individual oncogenes; that is, each transforming oncogene targets a particular cell type that is then expanded to give rise to a distinct tumor type. An alternative hypothesis suggests that one or few mammary cell types are susceptible to oncogenic transformation, but that each oncogene drives the transformed cell along a distinct developmental pathway, imparting to it a distinctive histologic phenotype. Both mechanisms could certainly operate in whole or in part simultaneously. The existence of oncogene-specific morphology also suggests that each type of mammary tumor expresses a somewhat different cohort of genes. The characterization of these marker genes might shed light on the details of transformation. Accordingly, we undertook to define genes expressed in particular types of mammary tumors. To date we have isolated several mRNA species whose expression pattern parallels the morphological differences found between tumor types (7Morrison B.W. Leder P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3417-3426PubMed Google Scholar), 2A. Elson, D. Kitsberg, and P. Leder, unpublished results. In general, we have found that tumors arising from ras- and neu-bearing transgenic mice fall into a common class at the molecular level and are distinguished from tumors that arise from transgenic mice bearing the c-myc transgene. The central role tyrosine phosphorylation plays in tumorigenesis has now prompted us to look specifically at genes whose products might control this process. Tyrosine phosphorylation is a reversible process that is controlled by the opposing actions of protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases (PTPases) (reviewed in (8Sun H. Tonks N.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 480-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and (9Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar)). PTPases comprise a large and complex family of related molecules that can broadly be divided into transmembranal, receptor-like molecules and non-transmembranal, intracellular ones (reviewed in (10Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 11Pot D.A. Dixon J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 463-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)). Transmembranal PTPases generally contain two PTPase catalytic domains and are thought to be capable of responding to extracellular signals. Intracellular PTPases contain one PTPase domain flanked by protein sequences that regulate the activity or localization of the entire molecule. Dual specificity phosphatases, i.e. molecules that can dephosphorylate both phosphoserine/threonine and -tyrosine exist as well. The best characterized of these, MKP1, can dephosphorylate mitogen-activated protein kinase in vivo, thereby linking this phosphatase to the latter stages of signal transduction to the nucleus(13Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Being the antithesis of tyrosine kinases, PTPases were originally thought to suppress transformation. Indeed, inhibition of PTPase activity was shown to result in transformation of cultured rat kidney cells(14Karlund J.K. Cell. 1985; 41: 707-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This interpretation was strengthened by the ability of the cytoplasmic PTPases, TCPTP (15Zander N.F. Cool D.E. Diltz C.D. Rohrschneider L.R. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1175-1182PubMed Google Scholar) and PTP1B(16Brown-Shimer S. Johnson K.A. Hill D.E. Bruskin A.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 478-482PubMed Google Scholar), to suppress oncogenic transformation in cultured cells. PTP1B has also been shown to be up-regulated in a mammary cell line transformed by neu(17Zhai Y.F. Beittenmiller H. Wang B. Gould M.N. Oakley C. Esselman W.J. Welsch C.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2272-2278PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-1 has been shown to counteract some of the actions of activated ras, suggesting that it can function as an anti-oncogene (18Sun H. Tonks N.K. Barsagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, overexpression of PTPases can in itself be transforming, as in the case of PTPα(19Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), suggesting that various PTPases may be linked to transformation in different ways. In an effort to focus on the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in mammary cell transformation, we sought PTPases that showed distinctive expression patterns in each tumor type. Here we report that the transmembranal PTPase ϵ (20Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) is highly expressed in mammary tumors initiated by ras or neu, but is absent or nearly absent from mammary tumors initiated by myc or int-2. Moreover, PTPϵ expression appears to be mammary tumor-specific and is not found in ras-based tumors that develop in several other organs. In addition, the PTPϵ protein displays a tissue-specific pattern of N-glycosylation. Cell lines were derived from mammary gland tumors of mice carrying the MMTV-c-myc transgene (1, cell lines M158, K485, 8MA1A, 11MB9A, 13MA1A, 16MB9A, MBP6, and M1011), the MMTV-c-neu transgene (3, cell lines SMF, NK417, NK639, NaF, and NFF), Zeta-Globin-v-Ha-ras transgene (AC-ras line; 5, cell lines AC204, AC236, AC711, AC816), or the MMTV-int-2 transgene (4, cell line 1128). Fibrosarcoma (AC101, AC216A, and AC280) and uterine tumor (AC139) cell lines were established from tumors that arose in AC-ras transgenic mice. Samples of primary mammary or salivary gland tumors were obtained from mice transgenic for MMTV-v-Ha-ras (2Sinn E. Muller W. Pattengale P. Tepler I. Wallace R. Leder P. Cell. 1987; 49: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) or MMTV-c-myc. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA purified from lines 16MB9A (MMTV-myc), SMF (MMTV-neu), or AC816 (AC-ras) were reverse-transcribed and one-tenth of the reverse transcriptase product was used in each PCR amplification experiment. The following pairs of degenerate mixtures of oligomers were used to amplify PTPase catalytic domains: pair AA/B, A(C/T)TT(C/T)TGG(A/C)(A/G/T)(G/T)ATG(A/G)T(A/C/T)TGG(G/C)A and CGCCC(A/G)A(T/C)(T/C/A/G)CC(T/C/A/G)GC(T/C/A/G)CT(A/G)CAGTG(21Matthews R.J.

Blood. 1991; 78: 2222-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amplifications were performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and 100 nM of each oligo mixture. Cycle parameters were: 1 min, 94°C; 1.5 min, 37°C; 2 min, 72°C for three cycles, followed by 30 additional cycles with annealing at 42°C and a final elongation step of 10 min, 72°C. Following a second round of amplification using the same conditions, the products of the PCR amplifications were subcloned and fragments of individual PTPases were identified by sequencing. The fragment of PTPϵ used here included nucleotides 993-1323 (Fig. 5). RNA was isolated from cultured cells and tissues using the guanidium-isothiocyanate/CsCl gradient technique (24Chirgwin J.M. Pryzbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified by oligo(dT) column chromatography (mRNA Purification Kit, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Electrophoresis of RNA, blotting onto GeneScreen membranes (DuPont), probe labeling, hybridization, and washing were all done using standard procedures(25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). Probes used in this work were the PTPase cDNA fragments isolated by PCR and a rat 28 S ribosomal RNA probe(26Rich B.E. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4065-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). An oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library was constructed from the AC-ras-based mammary tumor cell line AC816 in the l-ZAP vector (Stratagene). A l-ZAP random hexamer-primed adult mouse brain cDNA library was a generous gift from Dr. David Chan, Harvard Medical School. Both strands of a series of overlapping PTPϵ clones isolated from these libraries were sequenced. 5′-RACE was performed using the 5′-amplifinder RACE Kit (Clontech). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA from the AC-ras mammary tumor cell line AC204 was reverse-transcribed using oligomer E1225 (CTCTGCTGCTCTTGCTCTTCT, antisense to bases 613-593 in Fig. 5A) as primer. The 3′ end of the first-strand cDNA was ligated to the Amplifinder Anchor oligomer (Clontech) and two full rounds of PCR amplification were performed using this oligomer and oligomer PREX1 (AGGGAGGGTCGTGGGGACG, antisense to bases 181-163 in Fig. 5A). The amplification product was subcloned and sequenced. PTPϵ cDNA clone E25 was digested with SmaI (cleaves within the 5′-untranslated region at position 235, Fig. 5A) and XhoI (cleaves in the vector of clone 25, downstream of cDNA position 2484 in the 3′-untranslated region, Fig. 5A). The SmaI-XhoI fragment was ligated into the corresponding sites of pSVK3 ((27Mongkolsuk S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), Pharmacia), generating the expression construct pSVK3/ϵ-transmembranal. pSVK3/ϵ-transmembranal was then transiently transfected into COS7 cells by the DEAE-dextan method(25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). When needed, metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml) was perfomed according to (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994Google Scholar) for 12-14 h, starting 24 h after transfection. The peptide NKEENREKNRYPNI (amino acids 154-167 in Fig. 5A), to which a cysteine residue was added at the amino-terminal, was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Imject, Pierce) and was used to immunize a single rabbit (Pocono Rabbit Farm & Laboratory, Canadensis, PA). 48 h after transfection of COS7 cells with PSVK/ϵ-transmembranal, cells were lysed in 1 ml/plate of cold RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) and spun at 10,000 × g, 4°C for 10 min. Following preclearing with protein-A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia), fresh beads were added and the lysate divided into two aliquots: immune serum at a final dilution of 1:150 was added to one aliquot and preimmune serum from the same rabbit and at the same dilution was added to the other. The reactions were gently shaken at 4°C for 2 h after which the beads were pelleted and washed three times in cold RIPA buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS loading buffer and were analyzed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by fluorography or blotting onto Immobilon-P membranes (DuPont). Blocking, hybridization to the anti-PTPϵ antiserum, and detection were done using standard protocols(28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Mammary tumor cells (lines AC816, SMF, and 16MB9A) and organs were lysed in RIPA buffer and were electrophoresed, blotted, and analyzed in the same manner as described above. Deglycosylation was performed essentially as described in (29Daum G. Regenass S. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10524-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using deglycosylating enzymes and proteinase inhibitors from Boehringer Mannheim. Briefly, ~107 cells were lysed in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μg/ml Pefabloc, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) and spun at 10,000 × g, 4°C. Organs were homogenized in buffer A and spun as above. 50 μl of extract supernatant were incubated at 37°C for 3 h to overnight with 20 milliunits of neuraminidase, 300 milliunits of endoglycosidase-F, 1.3 milliunits of endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, or combinations thereof as indicated in the legend to Fig. 8. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiling. The products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with anti-PTPϵ antiserum. A preliminary screen for tumor-specific PTPases was conducted in three representative epithelial cell lines previously established from mammary tumors initiated in transgenic mice by myc, neu, or ras. Samples of first strand cDNA from these lines were amplified by PCR using pairs of degenerate oligomer mixtures targeted at conserved sequence motifs of the PTPase catalytic domain. PCR products were then subcloned and identified by sequencing. Fragments of catalytic domains from the following seven PTPases were identified: PTPα(30Matthews R.J. Cahir E.D. Thomas M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4444-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), PTPϵ(20Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), LAR(32Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Hall L.R. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), MPTP H3/70.15(33Boehm T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1385-1390PubMed Google Scholar), PTPH1(34Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5949-5953Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and musCPTP (35Mosinger B. Tillmann U. Westphal H. Tremblay M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cloned PTPase fragments were used to estimate the steady-state levels of PTPase mRNAs in mammary tumor cell lines. Each fragment was hybridized to blots containing RNA samples isolated from a panel of 18 epithelial cell lines previously established from mammary tumors initiated by neu, myc, ras, or int-2. As seen in Fig. 1, PTPase ϵ mRNA levels varied among the cell lines in a manner that correlated with the identity of the transforming oncogene. The six other PTPases listed above were uniformly expressed in all the tumor types examined and most were not studied further (results not shown). PTPϵ mRNA was relatively abundant and was expressed at similar levels in all the neu- and ras-based cell lines examined. On the other hand, PTPϵ mRNA was either absent or present at very low levels in the MMTV-myc and -int-2 cell lines (Band A, Fig. 1). This heterogeneity of expression is characteristic of the myc-based mammary tumors and has been noted previously(7Morrison B.W. Leder P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3417-3426PubMed Google Scholar). The three additional bands present in the blot depicted in Fig. 1(Bands B, C, and D) were subsequently found to be other forms of PTPϵ mRNA (results not shown). 3A. Elson and P. Leder, manuscript submitted for publication. Examination of primary tumor samples revealed that PTPϵ mRNA was expressed preferentially in MMTV-ras and MMTV-neu mammary tumors (Fig. 2, right panel, and not shown). This last result argues strongly that differential expression of PTPϵ mRNA is a characteristic of the original tumors and did not result from their adaptation to tissue culture conditions. If up-regulation of PTPϵ were part of a general mechanism of transformation by ras or neu then PTPϵ mRNA should be up-regulated in all tumors initiated by these oncogenes. To address this point, levels of PTPϵ mRNA were examined in a number of ras-based tumors and cell lines derived from various tissues of mice transgenic for ras(2Sinn E. Muller W. Pattengale P. Tepler I. Wallace R. Leder P. Cell. 1987; 49: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 5Leder A. Kuo A. Cardiff R.D. Sinn E. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9178-9182Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Significantly lower levels of PTPϵ RNA were found in cell lines derived from fibrosarcomas and from a uterine tumor when compared with a mammary tumor cell line (Fig. 2, left panel). Comparison of primary epithelial tumors from the salivary and mammary glands of mice transgenic for ras yielded similar results (Fig. 2, right panel). This suggests that increased levels of PTPϵ mRNA are not seen in all epithelial tumors. Due to lack of suitable material, similar analyses were not performed in the case of neu-initiated tumors. Examination of poly(A)+ RNA from several organs revealed that the PTPϵ mRNA species overexpressed in mammary tumors was present in brain, heart, testes, and lung (Fig. 3, Band A). Lower levels of a slightly smaller PTPϵ mRNA were present in lymph nodes, thymus, lung (Fig. 3, Band B), and spleen (not shown). Virtually no expression of either PTPϵ mRNA was detected in liver and kidney (not shown). There was little overlap in the expression patterns of the two mRNAs, suggesting each has a specific physiological role. As will be demonstrated below, the longer mRNA species encodes the transmembranal form of PTPϵ (ϵ-transmembranal). The smaller mRNA has been shown to encode a novel, non-transmembranal isoform of PTPϵ that is inducible by phorbol ester.3 Examination of the levels of PTPϵ expression in normal, untransformed mammary glands revealed relatively low expression of PTPϵ mRNA (Fig. 4). Expression was low in the virgin gland, but was somewhat increased during pregnancy. PTPϵ mRNA was nearly undetectable in glands from lactating mice, due either to its down-regulation or dilution resulting from massive expression of milk protein mRNAs at this stage. PTPϵ mRNA was again detected starting at the beginning of mammary gland regression. In accordance with there being distinct roles for the two PTPϵ isoforms, glands from pregnant mice preferentially expressed ϵ-transmembranal mRNA while the shorter form predominated in regressing glands. In all cases, expression levels in the mammary gland and other organs were clearly well below those found in ras- and neu-based mammary tumor cell lines (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). This indicates that the high levels of PTPϵ mRNA in ras and neu mammary tumors, rather than the low levels in myc tumors, were the abnormal finding. In order to provide additional tools for understanding the role of PTPϵ in tumorigenesis, we cloned the ϵ-transmembranal cDNA from libraries prepared from the AC-816 ras-based mammary tumor cell line and from adult mouse brain. Probing was initiated with the PTPϵ cDNA fragment originally isolated by PCR. Sequence analysis of a number of overlapping PTPϵ cDNA clones revealed that the ϵ-transmembranal cDNA is 5412 base pairs in length, in good agreement with the position of the ϵ-transmembranal mRNA signal on RNA blots (Fig. 5). The 5′-untranslated region of the ϵ-transmembranal cDNA is 323 base pairs long and, as in the case of the human PTPϵ cDNA, lacks an in-frame stop codon. The authenticity of the 5′ end was verified by performing 5′-RACE on mRNA obtained from another ras-based mammary tumor. Sequencing of several independent 5′-RACE products revealed that the 5′ ends of the ϵ-transmembranal cDNA were essentially as cloned from the cDNA libraries (not shown). No additional 5′ sequences were found despite extensive screening of both libraries used here. Both items, as well as cDNA expression and protein deglycosylation studies (see below), are consistent with the 5′ end of the ϵ-transmembranal cDNA described here being the true one. The coding portion of the ϵ-transmembranal cDNA begins at an ATG codon which is part of a near perfect Kozak consensus sequence (36Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) and is conserved in the human PTPϵ (Fig. 5A and (20Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar)). The putative product of this mRNA is a 699-amino acid-long protein that has leader, extracellular, and transmembranal domains characteristic of a transmembranal protein (Fig. 5A). Hydrophobicity and sequence analyses (37von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar) suggests that the extracellular domain of murine PTPϵ is 28 amino acids long. Overall, 87% of the nucleic acid sequence and 93% of amino acid residues of the murine PTPϵ are identical to the human form described in (20Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Examination of the relatively long 3′-untranslated sequence of ϵ-transmembranal mRNA revealed the presence of seven repeats of the sequence ATTTA which is found in short-lived mRNAs (reviewed in (38Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar)). Two polyadenylation signals were also found, the distal of which was used in the set of clones examined here. This signal directed polyadenylation at either of two distinct sites, located at nucleotides 5405 and 5412 (Fig. 5, A and B). In order to characterize PTPϵ expression at the protein level, polyclonal antibodies were raised against a peptide derived from the intracellular region of murine PTPϵ. Extracts of COS cells transiently transfected with the coding region of the ϵ-transmembranal cDNA served as positive controls in all the subsequent work. The anti-PTPϵ immune serum recognized a protein of ~105 kDa in extracts of transfected cells in immunoprecipitation and in protein blotting experiments (Fig. 6, lane 3, and results not shown). This protein was not observed in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 6, lane 1), nor when the experiments were repeated with preimmune serum or with immune serum in the presence of an excess of the immunizing peptide (Fig. 6, lane 2; Fig. 7, right panel, and not shown). Taken together, these results show that the antiserum was capable of recognizing the ϵ-transmembranal protein. The observed size of PTPϵ in these experiments was larger than its predicted molecular mass of ~80 kDa. This fact as well as its migration as a broad band indicated that the ϵ-transmembranal protein is glycosylated, as is demonstrated below.Figure 7Expression of the PTPϵ protein in several tissues and cell lines.

The ϵ-transmembranal protein was detected as a broad band of ~105 kDa in extracts from MMTV-ras and MMTV-neu cell lines. In agreement with RNA data presented in Fig. 1, the ϵ-transmembranal protein was absent from the representative MMTV-myc cell line used here (Fig. 7, left panel). This result indicates that the expression of the transmembranal form of PTPϵ is indeed limited to ras- and neu-based murine mammary tumors. Interestingly, a protein band corresponding to the shorter, non-transmembranal isoform of PTPϵ3> was present at relatively low levels in extracts from the MMTV-myc cell line (Fig. 7, left panel). The particular myc cell line used here does indeed express low levels of the mRNAs of both PTPϵ isoforms (Fig. 1, lane 10). Note that despite its presence, the ϵ-transmembranal mRNA present at low levels in this myc cell line does not give rise to mature ϵ-transmembranal protein. We next examined the forms of the PTPϵ protein present in normal mouse tissues. In agreement with RNA data (Fig. 3), the ϵ-transmembranal protein was detected as a broad band in protein extracts of brain and lung (Fig. 7, left panel). Interestingly, ϵ-transmembranal protein from lung and brain were of distinct sizes. An additional broad band corresponding to a protein of ~140-160 kDa was specifically recognized by the anti-PTPϵ serum in both of these tissues (Fig. 7, left panel, upper-most band). This band was not as prominent in the mammary tumor cell lines. Cellular fractionation experiments reveal that this protein is membrane-associated (not shown), and its migration as a broad band suggests it is glycosylated. This protein may represent yet another form of the ϵ-transmembranal protein or a cross-reactive form of another protein. Detection of the ϵ-transmembranal protein as a broad band of larger than expected size in protein blots suggested that it is glycosylated. In order to address this point protein extracts of a ras-based mammary tumor cell line were treated with a variety of glycosidases (Fig. 8). Treatment with neuraminidase or with endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase did not appear to significantly affect the mobility of the ϵ-transmembranal protein (Fig. 8, lanes 2 and 5). On the other hand, removal of N-linked carbohydrates by N-glycosidase-F resulted in a significant reduction in the apparent size of the molecule (Fig. 8, lanes 3 and 4). Most of the protein was now found in two sharp, closely spaced bands of ~80 kDa, in good agreement with the predicted mass of the ϵ-transmembranal protein. The same results were obtained when the extracts were treated with a mixture of all three deglycosylating enzymes (Fig. 8, lane 6). The heavier ~140-kDa band present in the extracts was virtually unaffected by neuraminidase and endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase; it exhibited only a slight decrease in size after treatment with N-glycosidase-F. We believe that it is glycosylated in a way that is resistant to the actions of the deglycosylating enzymes used here. Similar experiments were repeated with protein extracts from lung and brain (Fig. 8, right panel). As in the case of the ras mammary tumor, removal of N-linked carbohydrates by N-glycosidase-F had the most significant effect on the mobility of the ϵ-transmembranal protein. Note that the significant differences in the apparent molecular mass of the glycosylated ϵ-transmembranal proteins of lung and brain disappeared after deglycosylation (compare Fig. 7, left panel, with Fig. 8, lanes 10 and 12)). This indicates that the differences in the electrophoretic mobility of the ϵ-transmembranal proteins of lung and brain reflect tissue-specific glycosylation patterns. Note also that the apparent masses of the deglycosylated forms of the ϵ-transmembranal protein from lung and brain were slightly different from that of the mammary tumor (Fig. 8, lanes 10-12). This raises the possibility that other post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are still present on the deglycosylated ϵ-transmembranal protein. Our results indicate that there is a dramatic increase in expression of PTPϵ in ras- and neu-based mammary tumors, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Mammary tumors initiated by these two oncogenes in fact form a class that specifically expresses a cohort of marker genes which are underexpressed or silent in mammary tumors initiated by myc and int-2(7Morrison B.W. Leder P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3417-3426PubMed Google Scholar).2 This finding can be accounted for by assuming that the ras and neu oncogenes, acting in the context of the mammary epithelial cell, share a common transformation mechanism and/or transform a common susceptible target cell. Interestingly, neu and ras have been suggested to act through a common pathway (7Morrison B.W. Leder P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3417-3426PubMed Google Scholar, 39Reardon D.B. Hung M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18136-18142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ben-Levy R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Yarden Y.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3601-3608PubMed Google Scholar) which may serve as the basis for up-regulating PTPϵ and other marker genes. The possibility that PTPϵ is an invariant link in the ras transformation pathway appears less likely in view of the fact that relatively low levels of PTPϵ mRNA are found in several ras-based tumors that arise in non-mammary tissues, including some of epithelial origin. Thus it seems that overexpression of PTPϵ in ras-based tumors is at least partially specific to mammary tumors and is not part of a general mechanism by which ras and neu transform. Nonetheless, it remains possible that PTPϵ is part of a more restricted mammary-specific transformation pathway. Bearing this point in mind, it is important to note that the isoform of PTPϵ up-regulated in these mammary tumor cells is transmembranal and therefore can be conceptually integrated into the mechanisms by which neu and other tyrosine kinases act. A similar integration is possible in the case of ras, whose association with the cellular membrane is critical for its transforming ability(42Cox A.D. Der C.J. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1992; 3: 365-400PubMed Google Scholar, 43Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Moreover, ras influences the expression of genes whose products are thought to act upstream of itself in signal transduction pathways. For example, ras-mediated transformation has recently been shown to affect expression of the transcription factor AP2 (44Kannan P. Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainsky M.A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) which in turn regulates neu expression(45Bosher J.M. Williams T. Hurst H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Examination of the extracellular domain of transmembranal PTPϵ protein reveals two sites for N-linked glycosylation and a number of serine and threonine residues that could be substrates for O-linked glycosylation. Indeed, the transmembranal isoform of PTPϵ is present in various cell types as an N-linked glycoprotein of 100-110 kDa that is analogous to a 100-kDa form of the closely-related α phosphatase which is also predominantly N-glycosylated(29Daum G. Regenass S. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10524-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a way that creates an opportunity for differential function, each tissue or tumor examined displays a unique pattern of PTPϵ glycosylation. Tissue-specific glycosylation arises from differences in the glycosylating capabilities of tissues rather than from a particular property of the glycosylated protein(46Benallal M. Anner B.M. Experientia. 1994; 50: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the precise glycosylation pattern of PTPϵ could affect its function by, for example, influencing proteins that interact with its extracellular domain. The electrophoretic mobilities of PTPϵ from the mammary tumors and from normal mammary tissue are identical (not shown), indicating that their glycosylation patterns are similar. The precise pattern of glycosylation of PTPϵ in the mammary tumors may therefore be mammary gland- rather than tumor-specific. Finally, it is worth noting that the structurally related PTPase, PTPα, is the only PTPase known to have transforming ability when overexpressed(19Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). PTPϵ and PTPα are both type IV PTPases and are the only known members of this class(10Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 12Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 463-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Given that PTPα displays the highest degree of sequence and structural similarity to PTPϵ, it is possible that PTPϵ may share some of the transforming abilities of PTPα and that up-regulation of PTPϵ in mammary tumors is indeed linked to the transformation process. Subsequent efforts, involving the creation of transgenic mice, will be directed toward testing this possibility.

They assist the folding, oligomeric assembly, and quality control of newly synthesized proteins, the majority of which are glycoproteins. Some of these folding factors, such as BiP/GRP78 and GRP94, are members of classical chaperone families while others are unique to the ER. The latter include calnexin, a membrane-bound protein that interacts transiently with a variety of soluble and membrane-bound substrate molecules (see (3Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y.

Our studies have indicated that calnexin differs from previously characterized chaperones in being a lectin; it binds to glycoproteins with partially trimmed N-linked oligosaccharides(4Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 5Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The specificity for monoglucosylated chains (Glc1Man9-7GlcNAc2) was recently confirmed by Ware et al.(32Ware R.E.

These results are significant because they link the folding of glycoproteins and their quality control in the ER directly to the process of oligosaccharide trimming. Based on these observations, we have proposed that the de- and reglucosylation cycle, known to operate in the lumen of the ER(6Suh K. Gabel C.A. Bergman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21671-21677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is connected to calnexin binding and that the cycle plays a central role in the maturation of newly synthesized glycoproteins(4Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 7Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Recent studies have confirmed the requirement for glycans in substrate binding to calnexin. These rely on glycosylation inhibitors (tunicamycin), α-glucosidase inhibitors castanospermine (CST) and 1-deoxynojirimycin, and mutagenesis to remove consensus glycosylation sequences(8Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 9Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has also been reported, however, that polypeptide chains that have no N-linked oligosaccharides can associate with calnexin. The latter observations include the redistribution of the unglycosylated CD3e subunit of the T cell receptor in cells expressing a mutant version of calnexin, and the co-immunoprecipitation of unglycosylated thyroglobulin, class I and II major histo compatibility complex subunits and P-protein with calnexin(11Rajogapalan S.

It has therefore been suggested that calnexin binding may occur in more than one way and may not require the presence of sugars. To address the mode of substrate association with calnexin, we have analyzed mutant cells with glucosidase defects. Since they fail to remove glucoses from the core oligosaccharide, the glycoproteins do not reach the monoglucosylated form and are therefore unable to bind to calnexin via the lectin binding sites. Hence, these cells provide an opportunity to determine whether glycan-independent binding does take place under physiological conditions. Tests can be made without resorting to inhibitors and overexpression systems.

Lec 23 and CHO cells were infected with influenza virus and VSV as described(16Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J.

After 5 h of infection, cells were transferred for 1 h to cysteine- and methionine-free medium with or without 1 mM CST. They were then pulsed for 10 min with 0.1 Ci 35S-labeled ProMix (Amersham Corp.)/60-mm dish in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Cells were lysed with 2% CHAPS (Pierce) in HBS buffer (50 mM Hepes, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.6) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin) and precleared by rotating for 30 min at 4°C with Zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA). One-third of the lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with 10 μl of anti-calnexin antisera incubating overnight at 4°C as described(21Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). After incubation, precipitates were washed three times with 0.5% CHAPS in HBS buffer. Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and G protein were immunoprecipitated, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described(16Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). PhaR 2.7 and BW 5147 cells were infected with VSV tsO45. Cells were pulsed for 1 h with 0.15 Ci of [35S] ProMix. Otherwise the procedures were the same as for Lec 23 and CHO cells. CHO and Lec 23 cells were plated on alcian blue-treated glass coverslips as described previously(22Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). BW 5147 and PharR 2.7 were washed once with serum-free medium. 1 × 105 cells in 0.25 ml of serum-free medium were added to each well of a 24-well plate. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 h to allow them to attach and spread on the coverslips. They were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (J. T. Baker Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ) in serum-free α-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 20 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed twice with serum-free medium, and cells were permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature in 0.05% saponin (Sigma) in α-MEM containing 10 mM glycine (Sigma) and 10% horse serum (medium A) (Gemini Biocorporation Inc., Calabasas, CA). The coverslips were incubated in a humid chamber for 30 min with 15 μl of anti-calnexin antibody diluted 1:100 in medium A. After incubation, they were washed three times each for 5 min in medium A. The above incubation was repeated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Zymed Laboratories) diluted 1:100 with medium A. The coverslips were washed with water before mounting in Mowiol (Calbiochem Corp.) containing 2.5% 1,4-diazadicyclo-(2,2)-octane (Sigma). The two mutant cell lines used in this study were Lec 23 and PhaR 2.7. Lec 23 are mutant CHO cells defective in glucosidase I(23Ray M.K. Yang J. Sundaram S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22818-22825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PhaR 2.7 cells are mutants of the BW 5147 mouse lymphoma cell line defective in glucosidase II(24Reitman M.L. Trowbridge I.S. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10357-10363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has established that glycoproteins are synthesized in both mutant cell lines, but glucose trimming is defective. Both mutant cell lines grow well in culture and synthesize normal or slightly increased amounts of calnexin compared with the parental lines (see below). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-calnexin antibodies showed that the calnexin is distributed in a typical reticular ER pattern with nuclear rim staining (Fig. 1). The distribution of calnexin was identical to that seen in the parental cells. To analyze the interaction of newly synthesized cellular proteins with calnexin in Lec 23 cells and in the parental CHO cells, monolayers were pulse-labeled for 10 min with 35S-labeled ProMix. CST was included in some of the cultures to prevent the action of glucosidases I and II. A CHAPS-solubilized lysate was prepared and immunoprecipitated using anti-calnexin antibodies, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. As reported previously(8Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), several labeled protein bands were precipitated by the anti-calnexin antibodies from labeled wild type CHO cells (Fig. 2, lane 1). The band migrating at 90 kDa corresponded to calnexin itself, whereas the others were coprecipitating substrate proteins. When labeling was performed in the presence of CST (lane 2), only the calnexin band was seen, confirming the requirement for glucose trimming and the specificity of the antibodies. In Lec 23 cells, the coprecipitation of proteins was dramatically reduced (lane 3). Few if any substrate proteins associated with calnexin. The background was, however, further suppressed by the addition of CST (lane 4), suggesting that it was specific. The presence of small background staining was consistent with the report that Lec 23 cells are somewhat leaky, i.e. the glucosidase I activity is not completely inhibited(23Ray M.K. Yang J. Sundaram S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22818-22825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In infected wild type CHO cells, we have previously reported efficient binding of two viral glycoproteins, influenza HA and VSV G protein, to calnexin(4Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 8Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This is also seen in lanes 5 and 9 (Fig. 2). Binding of these viral membrane proteins was blocked if they were synthesized in the presence of CST (lanes 6 and 10). When Lec 23 cells were infected with the same viruses, calnexin binding of the two glycoproteins was virtually nonexistent (lanes 7 and 8 and 11 and 12). That the cells were, indeed, infected is shown in Fig. 3. The amounts of labeled HA and G protein after immunoprecipitation with anti-HA and G-protein antibodies show that the amounts were comparable with or without CST (compare lanes 1 and 3 and 5 and 6 and lanes 2 and 4 and 7 and 8). As expected, the apparent molecular weights of HA and G protein were slightly higher in Lec 23 cells due to the lack of glucose trimming. With the glucosidase II-deficient PhaR 2.7 cells, the results were similar to those seen for Lec 23. Whereas numerous newly synthesized proteins coprecipitated with anti-calnexin from the parental BW 5147 cells (Fig. 4, lane 3), virtually no labeled bands (except for calnexin itself) were seen in the PhaR 2.7 cells (lane 4). After infection of the wild type cells with VSV, the G protein was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin as expected (lane 1), whereas coprecipitation from the mutant cells was virtually undetectable (lane 2). That the cells were infected, and that they expressed VSV G protein, was shown by immunoprecipitation using anti-G protein antibodies (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 10). Both the membrane-bound, intact G protein (Gm) and the cleaved (Gs) forms were seen. Similar experiments were attempted with influenza virus, but being lymphoid, these cells could not be efficiently infected by this virus. Taken together, the results showed that the majority, if not all, of the substrate proteins that normally associate with calnexin in CHO and mouse lymphocytes must first be processed by glucosidases I and II. This confirms that substrate proteins were glycoproteins. Given that the results were obtained under normal tissue culture conditions without added inhibitors and without the use of overexpression, virus vectors, or mutant proteins, they probably reflect the normal binding specificity of calnexin. The results are consistent with data obtained with CST and other glucosidase inhibitors(4Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Q. Tector M. Salter R.D. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 2 such inhibitors effectively block the binding of virtually all newly synthesized substrate proteins to calnexin. PhaR 2.7 cells have recently been used by Kearse et al.(33Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to probe the specificity of T cell receptor α and β chain binding to calnexin. Consistent with our results they found that coimmunoprecipitation of these two glycoproteins was decreased compared to the parental cell. The reasons why association of calnexin with nonglycosylated proteins has been observed in several systems (11Rajogapalan S. Xu Y. Brenner M.B.

Some of the studies in question have been performed using tunicamycin as a glycosylation inhibitor or dithiothreitol as a folding inhibitors. Transient overexpression of glycoproteins has also been used. These experimental conditions are less physiological than those employed here. Tunicamycin causes global inhibition of N-linked glycosylation and massive aggregation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen as well as a blockade in their transport to the Golgi complex (25Gibson R. Schlesinger S. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3600-3607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hurtley S.M. Bole D.G. Hoover-Litty H. Helenius A. Copeland C.S. J.

Similar aggregation has been reported in the presence of dithiothreitol(28Sawyer J.T. Lukaczyk T. Yilla M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22440-22445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant proteins and protein subunits that fail to oligomerize also often end up in large aggregates. It has, moreover, been our experience that transient expression of wild type proteins using the T7 vaccinia virus expression system (29Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) frequently results in aggregated products(27Marquardt T. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). When the substrate proteins are aggregated, it is difficult to know whether the coimmunoprecipitation of a specific nonglycosylated substrate protein with calnexin occurs because of a direct contact between the two proteins or due to indirect association mediated by other proteins. Further studies using isolated proteins in vitro are needed to determine the various modes of calnexin binding to its substrate. That Lec 23 and PhaR 2.7 cells are viable is interesting in view of their glucosidase defects and the lack of calnexin-mediated folding. These cells have been selected for growth and may therefore contain higher amounts of other folding factors. It is known that many glycoproteins can fold correctly, albeit usually less rapidly and less efficiently, in cells treated with glucosidase inhibitors (see (30Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1720-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and (31Rabouille C. Spiro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11573-11578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Evidently, they can fold and reach the mature conformation using other chaperones and folding enzymes.

The SAP pentamer consists of five identical 25-kDa subunits each of 204 amino acids, the three-dimensional structure of which was determined recently(1Emsley J. White H.E. O'Hara B.P. Oliva G.

Each subunit was found to be constructed from multiple antiparallel β-strands arranged in two sheets, and the tertiary fold was remarkably similar to that of the legume lectins. It binds to DNA, to chromatin, and to glycosaminoglycans such as heparin, heparan, and dermatan sulfate, which are frequently associated with amyloid deposits (2Snow A.D. Wight T.N. Neurobiol.

In addition, SAP also inhibits the complement regulatory function of C4b-binding protein, a protein to which it is complexed in blood(12García de Frutos P. Dahlbäck B. J.

Despite the numerous properties ascribed to SAP, its physiological function is largely unknown. SAP is a universal constituent of amyloid deposits, including plaques from Alzheimer's disease (AD), amorphous β deposits, and neurofibrillar tangles(14Perlmutter L.S. Barrón E. Myers M. Saperia D. Chui H.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 352: 92-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). serum amyloid P component α1-antichymotrypsin apolipoprotein E Alzheimer's disease. The predominant component of amyloid deposits in the brain of individuals with AD is a 39-43-amino acid-long peptide (Aβ-peptide) which is a proteolytic product of the amyloid precursor protein(15Roher A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10836-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 16Iwatuso T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H. Nukina N. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-43 forms are specifically found in all kinds of AD plaques, indicating that those forms are critically important in AD pathology(17Gravina S.A. Ho L. Eckman C.B. Long K.E. Otvos L. Younkin L.H. Suzuki N. Younkin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7013-7016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). β-Amyloid-related peptides are secreted by cultured cells and are normally present in the cerebrospinal fluid(18Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Esch F. Lee M. Dovey H. Davis D. Sinha S. Schlossmacher M. Whaley J. Swindlehurst C. McCormack R. Wolfert R. Selkoe D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Nature. 1992; 359: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). The local fibril formation is probably a multistep process which is influenced by the rate of Aβ-peptide production and also involves conformational changes of the peptide. The presence of amyloid-associated proteins such as α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and apolipoprotein E (apoE) appears to enhance fibril formation(19Eriksson S. Janciauskiene S. Lannfeldt L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2313-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Ma J. Yee A. Brewer B.H. Das S. Potter H.

Invest. 1994; 94: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). ACT is present only in amyloid plaques from AD, while a specific allele of apoE (apoE4) has been associated with late onset AD. It has been suggested that ACT and apoE may act as pathological chaperones promoting fibril formation(22Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Rusell S.J. Mahley R.W. Huang D. Saunders A. Schmechel D. Wisniewski T. Frangione B. Roses A.D. Strittmatter W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although SAP is a universal constituent of all types of amyloid, its physiological role in fibril formation is not known. SAP binds to preformed amyloid fibrils and to Alzheimer Aβ1-40 peptide in vitro in a calcium-dependent reaction (23Pepys M.B. Dyck R.F. deBeer F.C. Skinner M. Cohen A.S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1979; 38: 284-293PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hamazaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10392-10394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that SAP protects amyloid from proteolytic degradation in vivo by binding to fibrils and masking fibrillar conformation(1Emsley J. White H.E. O'Hara B.P. Oliva G. Srinivasan N. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S. Nature. 1994; 367: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 25Tennent G.A. Lovat L.A. Pepys M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We now wish to report that SAP inhibits amyloid fibril formation from the Alzheimer Aβ1-42 peptide in an in vitro model. Alzheimer's peptide (>98% pure) and α1-antitrypsin C-terminal peptide (amino acids 358-394; >90% pure) were purchased from Saveen (Copenhagen, Denmark). DEAE-Sephacel and heparin-Sepharose were from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). SAP was prepared from human plasma by barium-citrate absorption followed by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and heparin-Sepharose, as described previously(26Schwalbe R. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12896-12901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein gave a single band of 25 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Three different batches of SAP were tested, and they gave similar results. The concentration of SAP was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 18.2(27Hamazaki H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 998: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Aβ1-42 (20 μl of a 40 μM solution) was mixed with different amounts of SAP in 15 mM Tris/HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS; final volume 500 μl) and incubated at 37°C. The final concentration of Aβ1-42 was kept constant at 1.6 μM, SAP concentrations being 1.6 nM (1000:1), 16 nM (100:1), 32 nM (50:1), and 320 nM (5:1); Aβ1-42:SAP ratios are given in parentheses. At different times, the light scattering at 400 nm was measured and compared with controls not containing the peptide. Presented results represent the mean of two experiments. Samples were applied to carbon-coated copper grids, negatively stained with 2% (v/w) uranyl acetate and examined in a JEOL 200CX electron microscope. The results shown are representative of samples taken from each test solution. The Aβ1-42 peptide was labeled with 125I using the lactoperoxidase method according to Thorell and Larson (28Thorell J.I. Larson S.M. Radioimmunoassay and Related Techniques. The C. V. Mosby Co., St. Louis, MO1978Google Scholar) and stored in TBS containing 0.02% NaN3. The radiolabeled peptide was mixed with unlabeled peptide to a final specific activity of approximately 3 mCi/mmol. Twenty μl of the peptide stock solution (40 μM) was incubated with increasing concentrations of purified SAP in 100 μl of TBS. The final concentration of the peptide was kept constant at 8 μM, SAP concentrations being 8 nM (1000:1), 40 nM (200:1), 80 nM (100:1), 160 nM (50:1), 800 nM (10:1), and 1.6 μM (5:1); Aβ1-42:SAP ratios are given in parentheses. The amount of peptide remaining in solution at the different time points was measured in a γ counter after centrifugation (10 min at 13,000 × g) and filtration through 0.2 μm filters (Millipore). In control experiments, peptide Aβ1-42 was incubated alone or in the presence of bovine serum albumin at Aβ1-42 to bovine serum albumin molar ratios of 5:1 and 1000:1 under standard experimental conditions. No influence on Aβ1-42 solubility by bovine serum albumin was found. In a control experiment, the radioactivity remaining in solution was determined after a 1-h centrifugation of the samples at 120,000 × g in an Aerofugue™ (Beckman). To examine the effect of SAP on Aβ1-42 fibril formation, an in vitro model was used in which the Alzheimer Aβ1-42 peptide spontaneously adopts aβ-pleated sheet conformation and forms elongated, approximately 7-8 nm thick, fibrils. The fibril formation of the Aβ1-42 peptide was monitored by light-scattering and electron microscopy (Fig. 1). In the absence of SAP, the light scatter increased to a maximum after 72 h (Fig. 1A), and elongated fibrils, having amyloid characteristics(29Pepys M.B. Frank M.M. Claman H.N. Unanue E.R. Samter's Immunologic Diseases. II. Little, Brown and Co., Boston1995: 637-657Google Scholar), were observed in the electron micrographs (Fig. 1B). The addition of SAP resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of fibril formation. At a peptide to SAP ratio of 5:1, there was almost no increase in light scattering (Fig. 1A), and the fibril formation was completely inhibited (Fig. 1B). A distinct inhibitory effect was observed also at the highest molar ratios of peptide over SAP. Even at a peptide to SAP ratio of 1000:1, the solubility of the peptide was increased as compared to the control, and short, flexible fibrils were formed as revealed by electron microscopy (Fig. 1D) and as reflected by a slight but significant increase in light scatter (Fig. 1A). These fibrils were 1-2 nm thicker than those formed by Aβ1-42 alone. Moreover, they did not exhibit green birefringence after Congo red staining, which is characteristic of amyloid fibrils. Although the precise mechanism of the molecular interaction between SAP and Aβ1-42 has not been elucidated, the changes in fibril morphology suggest that SAP affects the packing mechanism of Aβ1-42 and disturbs the typical uniformity of the fibrils. SAP is unique in its ability to inhibit fibril formation at all concentrations reported in this study. The amyloid-associated proteins apoE and ACT have been reported either to inhibit or to stimulate the β-peptide amyloid fibril formation. At a low ratio between the Aβ1-42 peptide and apoE (1000:1), a significant delay in the onset of amyloid fibril formation was observed, whereas under other conditions, apoE stimulated fibril formation(20Ma J. Yee A. Brewer B.H. Das S. Potter H. Nature. 1994; 372: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 22Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Rusell S.J. Mahley R.W. Huang D. Saunders A. Schmechel D. Wisniewski T. Frangione B. Roses A.D. Strittmatter W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 30Evans K.C. Berger E.P. Cho C.G. Weisgraber K.H. Lansbury P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Similar results have been reported for ACT(19Eriksson S. Janciauskiene S. Lannfeldt L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2313-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 21Gallo G. Wisniewski T. Choi-Miura N. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 526-530PubMed Google Scholar). To study the effect of SAP on the overall solubility of Aβ1-42 peptide, the amount of radiolabeled peptide remaining in solution after centrifugation and filtration was measured at various times of incubation (Fig. 2). After a 96-h incubation, the solubility of Aβ1-42 peptide reached its minimum with 20% of radioactivity remaining in solution. Addition of increasing amounts of SAP resulted in increased solubility demonstrating that SAP may be able to prevent Aβ1-42 aggregation. To ensure that the experimental conditions (10-min centrifugation at 13,000 × g and filtration through 0.2-μm filters) were sufficient to remove small aggregates of Aβ1-42 peptide, a second experiment was performed in which the peptide:SAP mixtures after a 72-h incubation were centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 1 h. The results confirmed the ability of SAP, at an Aβ1-42:SAP ratio of 5:1, to keep essentially all the peptide in solution (89%) for up to 72 h. At Aβ1-42:SAP ratios of 100:1 and 1000:1, the amounts of peptide remaining in solution were 81 and 60%, respectively. In this experiment, 54% of the peptide remained soluble in the absence of SAP. Direct binding between SAP and the Aβ1-42 peptide was demonstrated by nondenaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, but, in contrast to the complexes between ACT and the Aβ1-42 peptide(21Gallo G. Wisniewski T. Choi-Miura N. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 526-530PubMed Google Scholar), complexes between SAP and the β-peptide were not stable in SDS (results not shown). Recently, it has been shown that SAP is able to bind to Aβ1-40 immobilized in microtiter plates(24Hamazaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10392-10394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that SAP is able to bind Aβ1-42 under nondenaturing conditions. The inhibitory effect of SAP on Alzheimer Aβ1-42 peptide fibril formation appears to reflect a general ability of SAP to inhibit amyloid fibril formation. In support for this concept, SAP was found to inhibit the formation of fibrils from a β-pleated sheet containing peptide derived from α1-antitrypsin(31Janciauskiene S. Carlemalm E. Eriksson S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Complete inhibition of fibril formation was observed at a peptide to SAP ratio of 5:1. Even at a peptide to SAP ratio of 1000:1, a clear attenuation of fibril formation was observed (Fig. 3). It was noteworthy that at this latter experimental condition, the morphology of the aggregated peptide was different from that observed in the experiment using Aβ1-42 (compare Fig. 1D and 3C). Instead of short flexible fibers, dense aggregates of fibers were observed. Our present data suggest SAP both to impede the seeding process, which initiates fibril formation(32Jarret J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar), and to inhibit fibril growth by binding to the peptide and thus preventing peptide-peptide polymerization. Both processes presumably involve binding of SAP to β-pleated sheet structures formed by the polymerizing peptide. If the physiological function of SAP is to inhibit amyloid fibril formation, this process is probably imbalanced in AD, either due to changes in the metabolism of the β-peptide or to the presence of other SAP ligands in the plaques, such as glycosaminoglycans which would inhibit SAP function. Moreover, in such pathological situations, the attachment of SAP to amyloid fibrils may lead to increased resistance to proteolysis (1Emsley J. White H.E. O'Hara B.P. Oliva G. Srinivasan N. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S. Nature. 1994; 367: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 25Tennent G.A. Lovat L.A. Pepys M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). SAP has been extremely well conserved through evolution (33Rubio N. Sharp P.M. Rits M. Zahedi K. Whitehead A.S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and no deficiency of SAP has been described, suggesting SAP to have important functions. The ability of SAP to inhibit pathological deposition of amyloid-forming peptides may be such a function."
https://openalex.org/W255797560,"Despite the presence of the multiple subunits (α, β, γ, and δ) and their isoforms for γ-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptors in mammalian brains, the αxβ2γ2 subtypes appear to be the prototype GABAA receptors sharing many properties with native neuronal receptors. In order to gain insight into their subunit stoichiometry and orientation, we prepared a tandem construct of the α6 and β2 subunit cDNAs where the carboxyl-terminal of α6 is linked to the amino-terminal of β2 via a linker encoding 10 glutamine residues. Transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with the tandem construct alone failed to induce GABA-dependent Cl− currents, but its cotransfection with the cDNA for α6 or γ2, but not β2, led to the appearance of GABA currents which were picrotoxin-sensitive and, in the case of γ2 containing receptors, responded to a benzodiazepine agonist, U-92330. The high affinity GABA site, however, was detected with [3H]muscimol binding in all combinations of the receptor subunits, including the tandem construct alone or with the β2. No appreciable differences were found in their Kd (2.5 nM) and Bmax values (1.4 pmol/mg of protein). These data are consistent with the view that the polypeptides arising from the tandem construct were expressed with the high affinity GABA site, but unable to form GABA channels. The requirement of a specific monomeric subunit (α6 or γ2) for the tandem construct to express Cl− currents supports a pentameric structure of GABAA receptors consisting of two α6, two β2, and one γ2 for the α6β2γ2 and three α6 and two β2 for the α6β2 subtype.

The requirement of a specific monomeric subunit (α6 or γ2) for the tandem construct to express Cl− currents supports a pentameric structure of GABAA receptors consisting of two α6, two β2, and one γ2 for the α6β2γ2 and three α6 and two β2 for the α6β2 subtype."
https://openalex.org/W2014356768,"The receptor for interleukin-5 (IL-5R) is composed of a unique α chain (IL-5Rα) expressed on eosinophils and basophils, associated with a βc subunit, which is shared by the receptors for IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor. One of the molecular events activated via the IL-5R is the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Recent reports have shown that IL-5 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 followed by the subsequent cell type-specific activation of either STAT1α or STAT5. To identify additional STAT proteins activated by IL-5, we co-transfected the IL-5R with STAT cDNAs in COS cells. We found that IL-5 induces binding of STAT3 to the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 pIRE, and activates STAT3-dependent transcription. Moreover, endogenous STAT3 was tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in human IL-5-stimulated BaF3 cells ectopically expressing the human IL-5R (BaF3/IL5R). These data imply that multiple STAT proteins are involved in gene regulation by IL-5 in a cell type-specific manner. We further demonstrate using C-terminal truncations of the α and βc subunits of the IL-5R that the membrane-proximal regions of both subunits are required for STAT activation. Interestingly, a βc receptor mutant lacking intracellular tyrosine residues is able to mediate STAT3 activation, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of the βc receptor is not essential for STAT3 activation.

INTRODUCTIONHematopoiesis is tightly regulated by a complex network of stromal interactions and by soluble polypeptide factors named cytokines.

IL-5, and GM-CSF are cytokines that have diverse effects on the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of blood cells and their precursors (1Arai K.I. Lee F. Miyajima A. Miyatake S. Arai N.

Whereas IL-3 and GM-CSF also have effects on other hematopoietic lineages(3Ogawa M. Blood. 1993; 81: 2844-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Clutterbuck E.J. Hirst E.M. Sanderson C.J. Blood. 1989; 73: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of IL-5 in humans is restricted to eosinophils and basophils. IL-5 is essential for eosinophil differentiation (5Campbell H.D. Tucker W.Q.J. Hort Y. Martinson M.E. Mayo G. Clutterbuck E.J. Sanderson C.J. Young I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6629-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 6Sanderson C.J.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 2729-2735PubMed Google Scholar). The specific effects of IL-5 on eosinophils and basophils are due to restricted expression of the low affinity IL-5Rα receptor on these cell types(12Chihara J. Plumas J. Gruart V. Tavernier J. Prin L. Capron A. Capron M. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Ingley E. Young I.G. Blood. 1991; 78: 339-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity receptor for IL-5 (IL-5R) is composed of a unique α subunit associated with a βc subunit that is shared with the receptors for IL-3 and GM-CSF(14Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The βc subunit is essential for signal transduction(15Kitamura T. Miyajima A. Blood. 1992; 80: 84-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Miyajima A. Mui A.L. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but also, the α chain transduces intracellular growth signals(17Takaki S. Kanazawa H. Shiiba M. Takatsu K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7404-7413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the common use of the βc subunit by IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF explains the partial observed functional redundancy of these cytokines(16Miyajima A. Mui A.L. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Miyajima A. Hara T. Kitamura T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 378-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, postreceptor signal transduction pathways are not well defined and are likely to be composed of both mitogenic and differentiation signals. It is known that the βc subunit, like other cytokine receptors, does not contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity(19Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 20Mui A.L. Miyajima A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 206: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, one of the earliest events to occur after IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF stimulation is induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation(19Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 21Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This tyrosine phosphorylation is caused by the activation of several cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases such as Lyn (22Torigoe T. O'Connor R. Santoli D. Reed J.C. Blood. 1992; 80: 617-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pazdrak K. Schreiber D. Forsythe P. Justement L. Alam R. J. Exp.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the family of Janus kinases (JAKs), containing four members (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2), is associated with different cytokine receptors and is phosphorylated after ligand binding(25Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that only JAK2 is activated in response to IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF (26Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Cleveland J.L. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The JAK protein-tyrosine kinases activate members of a novel family of transcription factors named signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs)(25Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar).STAT proteins were first described as intermediates in the interferon-α/β (IFN-α/β) signaling pathway(30Fu X.Y.

At present, eight different STATs (STAT1α, STAT1β, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B, STAT6) have been described and are involved in specific cytokine regulation.(31Fu X.Y. Schindler C. Improta T.

Paul W.E. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This family of STAT proteins comprises a new class of transcription factors that contain Src homology 2 (SH2), SH3-like domains, and a carboxyl-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation site(25Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). STAT proteins normally exist as inactive monomers in the cytoplasm, but after phosphorylation on tyrosine, they form homo- or heterodimers, which translocate to the nucleus and bind to specific DNA motifs(40Fu X.Y. Zhang J.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 41Larner A.C. David M. Feldman G.M. Igarashi K. Hackett R.H. Webb D.S. Sweitzer S.M. Petricoin E.F.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 985-994PubMed Google Scholar). We recently found that STAT3 is also phosphorylated on serine residues(45Lutticken C. Coffer P. Yuan J. Schwartz C. Caldenhoven E. Schindler C. Kruijer W. Heinrich P.C. Friedemann H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This serine phosphorylation seems to be necessary for the regulation of the transactivation potential of STAT3.We have previously shown that IL-5 activates STAT1α together with an unidentified DNA-binding protein in human eosinophils(27van der Bruggen T. Caldenhoven E. Kanters D. Coffer P. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.W.J. Koenderman L. Blood. 1995; 85: 1442-1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested whether other known STAT proteins can be activated by IL-5. For this purpose, we reconstituted both subunits of the IL-5 receptor together with different STAT cDNAs in COS cells. We demonstrated that besides STAT1α, STAT3 was also activated by IL-5 in these transfected COS cells. In addition, endogenous STAT3 was tyrosine phosphorylated and activated by hIL-5 in BaF3 cells stably expressing the hIL-5R (BaF3/IL5R). Finally we demonstrate, using carboxyl-terminal truncations of both the α and β subunits, that the membrane-proximal region of both subunits are necessary for STAT3 activation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Reagents, and AntibodiesMonkey COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum. A mouse IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line, BaF3, and BaF3 cells expressing the wild type human IL-5 receptor α and β subunits (BaF3/IL5R) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% Hyclone serum and the appropriate cytokine. Parental BaF3 cells were grown in medium with 10-10M mouse IL-3 (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), BaF3/IL5R cells were grown in medium with 10-10M hIL-5 (a kind gift of Dr. D. Fattah, Glaxo Group Research, Greenford, United Kingdom) and 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) was obtained from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). The monoclonal antibody directed against STAT1α/β was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, Kentucky). The STAT3 rabbit polyclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, California).Synthetic Oligonucleotides and Plasmid ConstructionOligonucleotides with the following sequences were used in this study (only the top strands are shown): the human ICAM-1 pIRE, 5′-AGCTTAGGTTTCCGGGAAAGCAC-3′; a mutant pIRE, 5′-AGGCGCGAGGTTAGCGGTCAAGCAGCACCGC-3′; the c-fos SIEm67, 5′-GTGCATTTCCCGTAAATCTTGTCTACAATTC-3′; and the FcγRI GRR, 5′-AGCTTGAGATGTATTTCCCAGAAAAGA-3′. The 2xpIREtkluc reporter construct has been described by us previously(43Caldenhoven E. Coffer P. Yuan J. van de Stolpe A. Horn F. Kruijer W. van der Saag P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21146-21154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); also the pSV-lacZ expression vector has been described previously(46Shen S. van der Saag P.T. Kruijer W. Mech. Dev. 1993; 40: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmids 4xIREtkCAT and 4xGRRtkCAT were constructed by cloning four oligonucleotides containing either the pIRE or GRR in the HindIII site upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter in pBLCAT2. pSGhSTAT1α was constructed by inserting the cDNA for human STAT1α from pMNC91 (47Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) into the NotI/BamHI sites of pSG513(48Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). pSGhSTAT3 was constructed by inserting the human STAT3 cDNA isolated from a human eosinophil cDNA library into PSG513. pSGmSTAT4 was constructed by inserting the cDNA for mouse STAT4 from Rc/CMV-STAT4 (32Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar) into the HindIII/SmaI sites of pSG513. pSGshSTAT5 was constructed by inserting the cDNA for sheep STAT5 (MGF) from pXM-STAT5 (49Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) into the HindIII/NotI sites of pSG513. pSGhSTAT6 was constructed by inserting the cDNA for human STAT6 (IL-4STAT) from TPU231 (38Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pSG513. pSGhIL5Rα was constructed by inserting the cDNA for the human IL-5α receptor from pBKhIL5Rα (50Zanders E.D. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1994; 5: 35-42PubMed Google Scholar) into the NotI/KpnI sites of pSG513. pSGhIL5Rβ was constructed by inserting the cDNA for the human βc subunit from pSV532 (14Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI sites of pSG513. For construction of the c-terminal deletions of the IL-5 receptor α and β chains, stop codons where introduced at the indicated amino acids using PCR.Generation of Stable TransfectantsPlasmid DNAs of the human IL-5Rα and βc containing the neomycin resistance gene were transfected into the BaF3 cells by using electroporation as described previously(21Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and transfectants were selected using G418 (1 mg/ml). Expression of the α and βc subunits was verified by PCR analysis and by growth in the presence of hIL-5.Transient TransfectionFor transfection experiments, COS cells were split 1:3 in 6-well plates (Costar), and 2 h later the cells were transfected with 10 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique(51Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1973; 2: 607-616Google Scholar). Following 16-20 h of exposure to the calcium-phosphate precipitate, medium was refreshed, and cells were incubated for 16 h with IL-5. Transfected cells were subsequently harvested for luciferase assay (52Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar) and lacZ determination (53Kress C. Vogels R. de Graaf W. Bonnerot C. Meijlink F. Nicolas J.F. Deschamps J. Development. 1990; 109: 775-786PubMed Google Scholar).Gel Retardation AssayNuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated and stimulated COS and BaF3 cells following a previously described procedure(54Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were labeled by filling in the cohesive ends with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Gel retardation assays were carried out according to published procedures with slight modifications (30Fu X.Y. Kessler D.S. Veals S.A. Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8555-8559Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated in a final volume of 20 μl, containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mM KCL, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1.0 ng of 32P-labeled ICAM1-pIRE oligonucleotide for 20 min at room temperature. In competition experiments, extracts were incubated for 5 min with the indicated molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. Identification of the different DNA binding proteins was performed by preincubating nuclear extracts for 30 min on ice with antisera before addition of the probe.Immunoprecipitation and Western BlottingUnstimulated and IL-5 stimulated BaF3 cells were incubated with lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA, Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1 mM leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged to remove nuclei and cellular debris. The cell lysates were incubated with the anti-STAT3 polyclonal antibody for 1 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C, washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and boiled in 1.0 × Laemmli's sample buffer. The proteins were electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking in TBST (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.3% Tween 20) with 5% bovine serum albumin, the membrane was either incubated with the anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) monoclonal antibody or with the polyclonal anti-STAT3 antibody. Between the incubation with 4G10 and STAT3 antibodies, the membrane was stripped with 1% SDS, 30 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol for 2 × 15 min at 55°C. After washing 3 times with TBST, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or swine anti-rabbit antibodies, respectively. In both cases, the membrane was washed 5 times with TBST, and immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.).RESULTSReconstitution of the IL-5 Receptor in COS Cells Results in STAT3 Activation by IL-5We have previously shown that IL-5 treatment of human eosinophils activates the binding of multiple protein complexes to the pIRE from the ICAM-1 promoter(27van der Bruggen T. Caldenhoven E. Kanters D. Coffer P. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.W.J. Koenderman L. Blood. 1995; 85: 1442-1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that one of these complexes contained STAT1α (p91) by using STAT1α specific antibodies. However, the identity of the other DNA-binding proteins activated by IL-5 remained unknown. One approach to define whether IL-5 can also activate other known members of the STAT family is to reconstitute STAT activation by IL-5 in COS cells. We therefore transiently transfected these cells with expression vectors encoding the human IL-5Rα and IL-5Rβ subunits in combination with expression vectors encoding the different STAT members. These were co-transfected together with a reporter construct containing 2 pIRE sequences coupled to the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter and the luciferase (luc) gene (2xpIREtkluc). We previously identified this pIRE sequence from the ICAM-1 promoter to bind IL-6- and IFN-γ-induced DNA-binding proteins(43Caldenhoven E. Coffer P. Yuan J. van de Stolpe A. Horn F. Kruijer W. van der Saag P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21146-21154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed STAT activation by IL-5 through the measurement of luciferase activity. As can be seen in Fig. 1, COS cells transfected with the pSG5 expression vector without STAT cDNAs showed an IL-5-dependent 2-fold increase in luciferase activity, which is probably due to endogenous STATs in COS cells. Overexpression of hSTAT1α resulted in an IL-5-dependent 2-fold increase of luciferase activity compared with cells transfected with pSG5. Surprisingly, IL-5 also activated hSTAT3, which resulted in a 14-fold increase of luciferase activity. As a control for ligand specificity, we transfected COS cells with the cDNA for STAT3 and treated the cells with IFN-γ. We observed that STAT3 was not activated by IFN-γ, whereas IFN-γ was able to activate STAT1α. 2E. Caldenhoven and R. de Groot, unpublished observation. Furthermore, we observed no effect of IL-5 on luciferase activity after cotransfection of the cDNAs encoding for STAT4, STAT5, and STAT6 (Fig. 1). These results show that IL-5 can activate the transactivation potential of both STAT1α and STAT3 in COS cells.Since DNA-binding is a prerequisite for transactivation, we tested nuclear extracts from untreated and IL-5-stimulated COS cells transfected with STAT3. Indeed, when COS cells were stimulated with IL-5 for 30 min, a single DNA binding complex is induced using the ICAM-1 pIRE as a probe (Fig. 2). This is a specific binding complex because it could be competed with an excess of unlabeled pIRE, whereas a nonspecific competitor (SP1) was unable to compete for binding. To confirm that this DNA-binding protein was STAT3, we preincubated nuclear extracts with antibodies against STAT3. As shown in Fig. 2, this antibody against STAT3 binds to the DNA-protein complex and is therefore not able to migrate into the gel. In contrast, a control preincubation with STAT1α antibodies had no effect on this DNA-protein complex. These results indicate that IL-5 activates STAT3 binding to the ICAM-1 pIRE.Figure 2hIL-5 induces a DNA binding complex containing STAT3. The hIL-5 receptor and STAT3 were expressed in COS cells. These cells were either untreated or treated for 30 min with IL-5, after which nuclear extracts were prepared. Nuclear extract were assayed for binding to the 32P-labeled ICAM-1 pIRE in bandshift experiments. For competition experiments, extracts were preincubated for 5 min with a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide as indicated. For identification of the STAT proteins, the extracts were incubated with either anti-STAT1α, anti-STAT3 antibodies, or nonimmune serum for 30 min before the addition of the 32P-labeled ICAM-1 pIRE.

These experiments were performed with nuclear extracts from COS cells transfected with the IL-5R and STAT3 and treated with IL-5 for 30 min. The ICAM-1 pIRE was used as a radioactive probe, and as competitors we used the IFN-γ activating site elements from the c-fos (SIEm67) (40Fu X.Y. Zhang J.J.

Fig. 3A shows that competition with a 50-fold molar excess of either the pIRE or SIEm67 oligonucleotides completely inhibited binding of STAT3 to the ICAM-1 pIRE, whereas a mutant ICAM-1 pIRE was unable to compete for binding. Competition with the GRR sequence resulted in a decrease of STAT3 binding to the pIRE, suggesting that the pIRE is a better binding site for STAT3 than the GRR. We also tested the transcriptional activity of STAT3 mediated on the GRR sequence. We therefore inserted four copies of the GRR sequence in front of a tkCAT reporter plasmid. This 4xGRRtkCAT reporter construct was transfected in COS cells together with cDNAs encoding the IL-5Rα and βc subunits and STAT3. As shown in Fig. 3B, overexpression of the IL-5R and STAT3 in the presence of IL-5 resulted in a 40-fold induction of luciferase activity mediated via the GRR sequence. The increase in luciferase activity is comparable with the IL-5-induced transactivation of a 4xpIREtkCAT reporter construct. Taken together, these results show that IL-5 is capable of activating STAT3 in COS cells.Figure 3hIL-5 induced STAT3 activity is not restricted to the ICAM-1 pIRE.

https://openalex.org/W2159141097,"Ribophorin I is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein specific to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. We have previously shown that, when expressed in transfected HeLa cells, a carboxyl-terminally truncated form of ribophorin I that contains most of the luminal domain (RI332) is, like the native protein, retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment of these HeLa cells leads to O-glycosylation of RI332 by glycosyltransferases that are redistributed from the Golgi apparatus to the ER (Ivessa, N.

Using the state of glycosylation of RI332 as a measure for the BFA-induced backflow of enzymes of the Golgi apparatus to the ER, we now demonstrate that the retrograde transport is inhibited when cells are treated with various agents that affect intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, such as the dipeptide benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-Gly-Phe-amide, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the Ca2+-transporting ATPase of the ER. These treatments prevent the BFA-induced O-glycosylation of RI332. Immunofluorescence localization of the Golgi markers, MG-160 and galactosyltransferase, shows that when BFA is applied in the presence of Ca2+ modulating agents, the markers remain confined to the Golgi apparatus and are not redistributed to the ER, as is the case when BFA alone is used. Cbz-Gly-Phe-amide does not, however, interfere with the BFA-induced release of β-COP from the Golgi apparatus. We conclude that the maintenance of a Ca2+ gradient between the cytoplasm and the lumen of the ER and the Golgi apparatus is required for the BFA-induced retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the ER to occur.

https://openalex.org/W2064828746,"Pigeon liver malic enzyme was rapidly inactivated by micromolar concentration of Fe2+ in the presence of ascorbate at neutral pH. The inactivated enzyme was subsequently cleaved by the Fe2+-ascorbate system at the chemical bond between Asp258 and Ile259 (Wei, C. H., Chou, W. Y., Huang, S. M., Lin, C. C., and Chang, G. G.(1994) Biochemistry, 33, 7931-7936), which was confirmed by site-specific mutagenesis (Wei, C. H., Chou, W. Y., and Chang, G. G.(1995) Biochemistry 34, 7949-7954). In the present study, at neutral pH, Cu2+ was found to be more reactive in the oxidative modification of malic enzyme and the enzyme was cleaved in a similar manner as Fe2+ did. At acidic pH, however, Fe2+ was found to be ineffective in oxidative modification of the enzyme. Nevertheless, Cu2+ still caused enzyme inactivation and cleaved the enzyme at Asp141-Gly142, Asp194-Pro195, or Asp464-Asp465. Mn2+ and L-malate synergistically protect the enzyme from Cu2+ inactivation at acidic pH. Cu2+ is also a competitive inhibitor versus Mn2+ in the malic enzyme-catalyzed reaction with Ki value 70.3 ± 5.8 μM. The above results indicated that, in addition to the previously determined Asp258 at neutral pH, Asp141, Asp194, and Asp464 are also the coordination sites for the metal binding of malic enzyme. We suggest that the mechanism of affinity modification and cleavage of malic enzyme by the Cu2+-ascorbate system proceed in the following sequence. First, Cu2+ binds with the enzyme at the Mn2+ binding site and reduces to Cu+ by ascorbate. Next, the local oxygen molecules are reduced by Cu+, thereby generating superoxide or other reactive free radicals. These radicals interact with the susceptible essential amino acid residues at the metal-binding site, ultimately causing enzyme inactivation. Finally, the modified enzyme is cleaved into several peptide fragments, allowing the identification of metal site of the enzyme. The pH-dependent different specificities of metal-catalyzed oxidation system may be generally applicable for other enzymes or proteins.

The pH-dependent different specificities of metal-catalyzed oxidation system may be generally applicable for other enzymes or proteins. Cytosolic malic enzyme ((S)-malate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating), EC 1.1.1.40) catalyzes the divalent metal ion-dependent reversible oxidative decarboxylation of L-malate to give CO2 and pyruvate, with concomitant reduction of NADP+ to NADPH (Reaction 1). NADP++L-malate↠←M2+CO2+pyruvate+NADPH+H+Reaction 1 The role of metal ion in the enzymatic reaction entails providing a bridge between malate and the enzyme and functions as a second sphere complex with the substrate (Hsu et al., 1976). Therefore, identification of the ligands for metal binding is ultimately important in understanding the structure-function relationship of this enzyme. In most metalloproteins, the amino acid residues involved in metal binding are dispersed along the complete sequence (Regan, 1993). Without a three-dimensional crystal structure available, affinity cleavage at the putative metal-binding site by the metal-catalyzed oxidation system (MCO) 1The abbreviations used are: MCOmetal-catalyzed oxidation systemPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. may be the optimal approach of reaching the above goal. Using this technique with the Fe2+-ascorbate system, Asp258 is successfully identified in our previous study as one of the metal-binding sites (Wei et al., 1994), as confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (Wei et al., 1995). In that study, some divalent metal ions were found to be capable of providing protection of the enzyme against Fe2+-induced inactivation. Among the divalent metal ions, only Cu2+ was found to accelerate the Fe2+-ascorbate-induced enzyme inactivation rate. metal-catalyzed oxidation system polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In this work, the inactivation of malic enzyme by Cu2+-ascorbate system is investigated. We demonstrate, for the first time, that at different pH values Cu2+-ascorbate system shows different specificities in protein modification and peptide bond cleavage. Taking the advantage of this selectivity, three more metal binding ligands of pigeon liver malic enzyme are successfully identified. Novel sequence motifs for the metal-binding site of malic enzyme are also deduced. Malic enzyme from pigeon liver was purified to apparent homogeneity according to published procedure (Chang and Chang, 1982). The enzyme activity was assayed by monitoring the formation of NADPH at 30°C as described previously (Chang et al., 1992). The inactivation experiments were performed at 0°C by adding freshly prepared solutions of cupric nitrate (6 μM) and ascorbate (20 mM) into the enzyme solution (0.97 μM) in sodium acetate buffer (66.5 mM, pH 5.0). The progress of enzyme inactivation was monitored by assaying the enzyme activity in small aliquots withdrawn at the designated time intervals. For modification of the enzyme at different pH values, Bis-Tris (pH 4.0-7.0) or Bis-Tris-propane (pH 6.3-9.0) was used as buffer. Other experimental conditions are provided in the figure legends. For detecting the peptide bond cleavage, the samples withdrawn from the reaction mixture were added to EDTA solution (4 mM) to prevent further reaction from occurring. Next, the protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE for separating the peptide fragments. The resulting gel pattern was quantified by densitometric analysis and the isolated peptide fragments were then transblotted to an Immobilon-P membrane and subjected to automatic amino acid sequence analysis as described previously (Wei et al., 1994). Inhibition study was performed at several Cu2+ concentrations, and the concentration of Mn2+ was varied from 1 to 10 μM. Concentrations of other components were held constant. The results were fitted to for a competitive inhibition by using the EZ-FIT computer program (Perrella, 1988). v=Vm⋅[Mn2+]KmMn(1+[Cu2+]/KiCu)+[Mn2+](Eq. 1) where v is the observed enzyme activity, Vm is the maximum enzyme activity, KmMn denotes the Michaelis constants for Mn2+, and KiCu denotes the inhibition constant for Cu2+. Pigeon liver malic enzyme was highly sensitive to metal-catalyzed oxidation (Wei et al., 1994). The inactivation rate of the enzyme by the MCO system was highly pH-dependent. At pH 7.0 and 0°C, 20 μM Fe2+-20 mM ascorbate caused 98% enzyme activity loss in 1 h (Fig. 1), i.e. in correlation with our previous observation (Wei et al., 1994). On the other hand, under otherwise identical conditions, the enzyme lost only 10% activity in 1 h at pH 5.0. Experimental results indicated that Cu2+ caused a faster inactivation at a smaller concentration than Fe2+, especially at pH 5.0, in which Cu2+ caused substantial inactivation (Fig. 1). Inactivation of malic enzyme by Cu2+ required ascorbate in the system; Cu2+ or ascorbate alone did not cause any inactivation. Cu+ was much less effective; Cu+ (6 μM)-ascorbate (20 mM) caused only 10% inactivation in 1 h under conditions that caused >95% inactivation by the Cu2+-ascorbate system. The above results indicate that malic enzyme has a different sensitivity toward the metal-catalyzed oxidation system at two different pH values. Next, the inactivation of malic enzyme was investigated by the Cu2+-ascorbate system between pH 4.0-9.0 in which the enzyme was stable. There are two optima for the inactivation rate: one at pH 6.0-7.0, and the other at approximately pH 4.0 (Fig. 2). These results would suggest that different modification mechanisms involved in acidic or neutral pH. For obtaining manageable inactivation rates, the inactivation of malic enzyme by Cu2+ at pH 5.0 is explored in the following experiments. At pH 5.0, the inactivation of malic enzyme activity does not follow a pseudo-first-order kinetics as the natural logarithmic of residual activity versus time does not result in a straight line. The inactivation rate is clearly dependent on Cu2+ concentration (Fig. 3), i.e. much smaller in a concentration than Fe2+ requiring to cause the same extent inactivation. Similar to Fe2+-induced inactivation, Cu2+-induced inactivation could be stopped by EDTA (4 mM), which, however, did not reverse the already inactivated enzyme activity. For demonstrating that the inactivation of enzyme activity was due to modification of essential amino acid residues in or near the active site, the inactivation process was examined in the presence of various combinations of substrates. In contrast to Fe2+-ascorbate inactivation of malic enzyme, which was completely protected by some divalent cations, Mn2+ (4 mM) alone only protected 56% enzyme activity against the Cu2+-ascorbate induced inactivation at pH 5.0 (Fig. 4). L-Malate, which did not give any protective effect in the Fe2+ system, provided 15% protection in the inactivation induced by the Cu2+ system. L-Malate plus Mn2+ yielded synergistic protection (˜90%). Nucleotide NADP+, on the other hand, did not provide any protection by itself or in combination with Mn2+ and L-malate in both Fe2+ and Cu2+ systems. The above results indicate that at pH 5.0 the binding mode between divalent cation and the enzyme is different from that at pH 7.0. Direct kinetic evidence for the binding of Cu2+ at the Mn2+ binding site of malic enzyme was provided by inhibition studies shown in Fig. 5, where Cu2+ was demonstrated to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to Mn2+ with Ki value of 70.3 ± 5.8 μM. This result indicates that Cu2+ and Mn2+ compete for the same binding site. The fitted value of KmMn was 2.7 ± 0.23 μM, which is within the range (1.8-9 μM) as determined previously (Hsu et al., 1976). For comparison, Cu+ was also tested for inhibition of malic enzyme. Cu+ as high as 160 μM showed no inhibition on the enzyme. At 169 μM, the inhibition was only 7%. These results strongly suggest that only divalent Cu2+ has a high affinity with malic enzyme. We have demonstrated previously that, at pH 7.0, the Fe2+-ascorbate system cleaved malic enzyme at Asp258-Ile259 (Wei et al., 1994). In this study, the cleavage pattern of the enzyme inactivated by Cu2+-ascorbate system is also examined. The results shown in Fig. 6 clearly indicate that Cu2+ induced the same cleavage as Fe2+ at pH 7.0. However, different specificities were observed at pH 5.0. Fe2+ showed minimum cleavage at pH 5.0, which is in correlation with the minimum enzyme inactivation observed (Fig. 1). Cu2+ produced entirely different cleavage patterns at pH 5.0 (Fig. 6, lane6). The two fragments IV and V, which are those seen at pH 7.0, were relatively small in quantity at pH 5.0. Instead, six major fragments are detected (E‘I, E‘II, E‘III, E‘VI, E‘VII, and E‘VIII). On the basis of Mr estimation, these fragments seem to be due to three cleavages. Site A cleavage produces E‘II (48,000) and E‘VII (Mr 17,000), site B cleavage produces E‘III (Mr 38,000) and E‘VI (Mr 27,000), and cleavage at site C produces E‘I (Mr 55,000) and E‘VIII (Mr 10,000). Probably because of a low molecular mass, the diffusion problem renders E‘VII and E‘VIII less defined visually. However, we successfully obtained a discrete amino acid sequence that is the fourth coordination site of Mn2+ of malic enzyme as described in the following sections. To correlate the Cu2+-induced enzyme inactivation and peptide bond cleavage, the modification was performed in various stages, the reaction was stopped with EDTA, and the protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE to examine the peptide bond cleavage. Results shown in Table 1 clearly indicate that with the increasing of incubation time, a rapid loss in enzyme activity occurred and the peptide bond cleavage increased. However, the enzyme activity lost proceeded much faster than the peptide bond cleavage. When the enzyme activity was down to 27%, 91% of the enzyme molecules were still intact. We can conclude that peptide bond cleavage follows the enzyme inactivation, as for other MCO system-induced enzyme inactivation. Site C is a minor cleavage site as compared to sites A and B. Since E‘II+ E‘VII and E‘III+ E‘VI appear to have an equal amount (Table 1), site A and site B seem to have a similar probability of cleavage. However, these sites do not cleave simultaneously in the same enzyme molecule. Similar mutually exclusive cleavages were also observed for pig heart isocitrate dehydrogenase with Fe2+-ascorbate system (Soundar and Colman, 1993).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The switch of specificity was examined by monitoring the protein cleavage pattern at various pH values. As the pH decreased from neutral to acidic, fragments I, II, III, VI, VII, and VIII gradually increased, while fragments IV and V decreased (data not shown). From Fig. 6, we see that, at pH 5.0, Cu2+ cleaved malic enzyme at three sites that are different from the Asp258-Ile259 observed at pH 7.0. The SDS-PAGE-separated peptide fragments were electrophoretically transblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane and each peptide was analyzed via an automatic protein sequencer. The N terminus of fragment II was found to have the following sequence: Gly-Glu-Arg-Ile-Leu-Gly-Leu-Gly-Asp-Leu-X-X-X-Gly-Met-Gly-Ile-X-X-Gly, which is identified as the known sequence between Gly142-Gly161 of the cDNA sequence of pigeon liver malic enzyme (Chou et al., 1994). Peptide E‘III has the N-terminal sequence Pro-Leu-Tyr-Ile-Gly-Leu-Arg-His-Lys-Arg-Ile-Arg-Gly-Gln-Ala-Tyr-Asp-Asp, which is identified as Pro195-Asp212 of the cDNA sequence. Peptide E‘VIII has the N-terminal sequence Asp-Val-Phe-Leu-Thr-Thr-Ala-Glu-Val-Ile-Ala-Gln-Glu-Val-Ser-Glu-Glu-Asn-Leu-Gln, which is identified as Asp465-Asn484 of the cDNA sequence. Corresponding to peptide E‘II and E‘III are peptides E‘VII and E‘VI, which contain the N-terminal peptides Met1-Asp141 and Met1-Asp194, respectively, and should not detect any sequence since the N terminus of malic enzyme is blocked (Wei et al., 1994). When peptides E‘VI and E‘VII were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis, multiple small peaks were detected and identifying any reliable sequence was relatively difficult. When consulting the gel pattern shown in Fig. 6, we can conclude that while peptides E‘II-E‘VII represent the major cleavage products, minor cleavage at other sites also occurred. Peptide E‘VI contains sequence Met1-Asp194 and some other minor peptides. This is also true for peptide E‘VII. The failure in identifying some amino acid residues in E‘II may be due to the interference of other minor peptides. A sufficient quantity of fragment I for sequence analysis was not collected in this study to confirm that it is blocked at the N terminus. Although the peptide cleavage caused by Cu2+ system is complicated at pH 5.0, three more metal ligand sites are unequivocally identified, i.e. Asp141, Asp194, and Asp464. A comparison with the known amino acid sequences for malic enzyme from various sources (Bagchi et al., 1987; Börsch and Westhoff, 1990; Chou et al., 1994; Hsu et al., 1992; Loeber et al., 1991, 1994; Magnuson et al., 1986; Kobayashi et al., 1989; Kulkarni et al., 1993; Rothermel and Nelson, 1989) 2Chou, W.-Y., Huang, S.-M., and Chang, G.-G., unpublished results. reveals that these aspartate residues are highly conserved (Fig. 7 Fig. 8 Fig. 9).Figure 8Comparison of the putative Mn2+ binding site Asp194 of malic enzymes.

We have demonstrated previously that this enzyme was rapidly inactivated by the Fe2+-ascorbate system at neutral pH. The inactivation was rapid that incubation at 0°C was necessary to slow down the reaction rate. In this study, the Cu2+-ascorbate system was found to be more effective than the Fe2+ system. Experimental results indicated that the Cu2+ system produced an entirely different cleavage pattern at pH 5.0 as compared to the pattern at pH 7.0. The following criteria indicate that Cu2+-ascorbate caused affinity modification and cleavage of pigeon liver malic enzyme at the putative metal-binding site. (a) Cu2+ is essential for the process; Cu+ is much less effective, suggesting that Cu2+ must bind with the enzyme at the divalent metal ion binding site before inactivation takes place. (b) Cu2+ is a competitive inhibitor versus Mn2+ for the enzyme, indicating that Cu2+ and Mn2+ compete for the same binding site. (c) Inactivation of the enzyme is prevented by Mn2+ plus L-malate, indicating that modification is at the active site. Based on the above discussion, the reaction sequence of oxidative modification and peptide bond cleavage of pigeon liver malic enzyme by the Cu2+-ascorbate system can be summarized in Fig. SI. First, Cu2+ binds with the enzyme at the Mn2+ binding site (step 1). Second, ascorbate reduces Cu2+ to Cu+ (step 2), which, in the presence of dissolved O2, generates reactive free radicals (e.g. O2, OH.) that in turn modify the essential amino acid residue(s) nearby and forming the inactivated enzyme (E‘) (step 3). Finally, depending on pH of the solution, the enzyme molecule is cleaved at four possible sites giving peptide fragments E‘I+ E‘VIII, E‘II+ E‘VII, or E‘III+ E‘VI at pH 5.0, or E‘IV+ E‘V at pH 7.0 (step 4). In this manner, different specificities are achieved by manipulating the reaction conditions. We suggest that this strategy can be generally applied to other enzymes or proteins in elucidating the metal-binding sites. We propose that the catalytically essential carboxyl group of Asp258 has a pKa value of 6.7, as determined by chemical modification experiments (Chang et al., 1985). At pH 5.0, this carboxyl group is protonated and loss its metal-binding ability and is not reactive toward oxidative modification. Under this circumstance, Fe2+ is inactive but other metal ligands Asp141, Asp194, or Asp464, which might have pKa values near 4.7, are modified by the more reactive Cu2+. Interestingly, the metal ligands Asp141, Asp194, Asp258, and Asp464 of malic enzyme were all aspartate residue, which has been indicated to be the major metal-binding ligand for many metal-proteins (Higaki et al., 1992; Vallee and Auld, 1993; Traut, 1994). Furthermore, isocitrate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes a similar oxidative decarboxylation reaction as malic enzyme, was demonstrated to have Asp311, Asp307 from the same subunit, and Asp238‘ from the other subunit as the metal coordinates (Hurley et al., 1990); this enzyme from pig heart was also sensitive to MCO system (Soundar and Coleman, 1993). Examination of the sequences shown in Fig. 7 Fig. 8 Fig. 9 reveals that Asp141 and Asp194, the major cleavage sites by the Cu2+ system, are strictly conserved in all malic enzyme with known amino acid sequences. Asp464 is also highly conserved; however, this region has higher variations among malic enzyme of different origins. This site is a minor cleavage site. Maximum alignment of other malic enzyme sequences with Asp464 of pigeon enzyme reveals that Glu464 of duck, Asn512 of ascaris, and Glu557 of maize enzymes may be the metal coordinates. Although Asn and Glu are found as metal ligand in many metal-proteins (Villafranca and Nowak, 1992; Higaki et al., 1992; Vallee and Auld, 1993; Traut, 1994), an observation of the nearby amino acid residues reveals that Asp465 of duck, Asp511 or Asp513 of ascaris, and Asp558 of maize enzyme may be the authentic metal ligands. These results enforce the critical value of aspartate residue as the metal coordinate in proteins. Only bacillus malic enzyme was nonconservatively substituted this Asp with Val456. The actual metal ligand, however, may be Glu457, which is also a conservative substitution. Malic enzyme is a bifunctional enzyme. It catalyzes both the oxidoreduction and decarboxylation reactions. The reaction mechanism of the enzyme proceeds in two steps with hydride transfer preceding decarboxylation (Hermes et al., 1982). These two functions can be assessed separately by assaying the partial reactions with appropriate substrate (Hsu, 1982). One of the distinguishing features of the decarboxylase activity of malic enzyme is its pH optimum being at 4.5 (Salles and Ochoa, 1950). We propose that the proton released during dehydrogenase reaction provides a favorable local active site environment for the decarboxylation reaction, which involves metal ion-stabilized enolate anion transition state (Hsu et al., 1976; O'Leary, 1992). During the catalytic cycle, the enzyme might undergo an isomerization that favors the decarboxylation reaction. Results presented in this study support the hypothesis that the enzyme exists as different conformational isoforms at neutral or acidic environment. However, another possibility that the observed pH effects were due to changes in the catalytic cleavage rate of different sites rather than to global conformational changes was not ruled out (Kufel and Kirsebom, 1994). Metal-catalyzed oxidation of proteins has been suggested to be the marker for protein turnover in vivo (Stadtman and Oliver, 1991; Stadtman, 1992). According to this theory, the oxidized protein molecules are unstable and prone to degradation by multicatalytic proteases (proteasomes) in cells (Rivett, 1993). The normal copper concentration in serum is 16-31 μM (Murray et al., 1990); both iron and copper ions are normally presented in the cells, which also contain various reducing compounds. If malic enzyme is sensitive to only a few micromolar concentration of Cu2+ in the cytoplasm, an intriguing question is that how could malic enzyme survive in vivo for a reasonable period of time to perform its metabolic roles? Protection of the enzyme by Mg2+ or other divalent cations and substrate is one of the answers. Furthermore, cells contain other defense mechanisms against oxidative damage. The endogenous antioxidant enzymes (catalase, dismutase) are active in normal young tissues; a rapid physiological response of the translational or transcriptional control of the detoxification genes might play an important role when metal ion concentrations exceed a dangerous threshold (O'Halloran, 1993). These detoxification gene products may play important roles in cell protection, e.g. the high Fe2+ content and oxygen carrier function of red blood cells indicate the high oxidation stress experience by red blood cells, which contains an abundant natural killer enhancing factor that protects red blood cells from oxidation injuries (Shau and Kim, 1994). These protecting proteins are highly homologous with yeast thiol-specific antioxidant, which protects yeast cells from oxidation insults (Chae et al., 1993). It is these natural protecting mechanisms that prevent cell proteins and other cellular components from experiencing oxidative damage."

To further test their importance, these residues were mutated, and the resulting mutants were expressed, purified, and characterized. When the highly conserved, Schiff base-forming lysine residue was mutated (K170A) the resulting enzyme showed a ˜106-fold reduction in catalytic activity, but was still able to bind both substrate and product, as shown by a novel fluorescence-based ligand-binding assay. This is consistent with Lys-170 playing a central role in catalysis and shows that, although forming a covalent bond with the substrate, it is not essential for ground state binding of substrate or product. Conversely, substituting leucine for the conserved, iodoacetate-reactive methionine residue (M205L) had little effect on kcat or Km. Diethylpyrocarbonate experiments had previously implicated either His-143 or His-146 as the putative active site general base. Substituting alanine for each shows that H146A retains full catalytic activity while H143A shows a 106-fold loss of activity. As with the K170A mutant, H143A can bind ligand, and in addition to the predicted role of this residue as the proton-abstracting general base, our data suggest that it is also involved in the formation and breakdown of Schiff base intermediates. Isoelectric focusing, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and fluorescence spectroscopy show that the H143A mutant preferentially stabilizes the formation of the product Schiff base, and that this results in burst kinetics reminiscent of p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis by chymotrypsin. The most striking illustration of this stabilization is the fact that the H143A mutant is isolated from overexpressing cells with a significant proportion of the enzyme monomers covalently bound to the product, 3-dehydroshikimate, via a Schiff base linkage. Our data suggest that the H143A mutant is able to slowly transform substrate to product but that the hydrolytic release of the product is stalled.

INTRODUCTIONDehydroquinase (DHQase; 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase) 1The abbreviations used are: DHQase3-dehydroquinaseDHQ3-dehydroquinic acidDHS3-dehydroshikimic acidPCRpolymerase chain reactionIEFisoelectric focusingESI-MSelectrospray ionization mass spectrometryPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. catalyses the dehydration of 3-dehydroquinic acid to 3-dehydroshikimic acid and is the third step in the central shikimate pathway of microorganisms, fungi, and plants(1Haslam E. The Shikimate Pathway. Butterworths, London1974Google Scholar). The end products of the pathway are the precursors of the aromatic amino acids, and so the enzymes involved in these biosynthetic reactions have been studied as potential sites for antimicrobial agents and herbicides(2Kishore G.M. Shah D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 627-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The focus of the present work is the mechanism of the dehydroquinase enzyme from Escherichia coli (EC 4.2.1.10). In particular, the roles of several amino acid residues have been investigated which chemical modification experiments have implicated as either being involved in the mechanism or as being in close proximity to the active site.There are two distinct classes of DHQase enzymes, designated type I and type II, whose properties and mechanisms have been compared previously (3Kleanthous C. Deka R. Davis K. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Harding S.E. Price N.C. Hawkins A.R. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Type II DHQases are thermostable enzymes with a relatively small subunit molecular mass (˜16 kDa) but which oligomerize to form dodecamers. They were originally identified as part of a catabolic pathway for utilization of quinic acid in fungi(4Giles N.H. Partridge C.W.H. Ahmed S.I. Case M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1930-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but have since been found in the shikimate pathway of a number of prokaryotes(5White P.J. Young J. Hunter I.S. Nimmo H.G. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Garbe T. Servos S. Hawkins A.R. Dimitriadis G. Young D. Charles I.G. Mol. & Gen.

Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of dehydration for the type II enzyme of Anacystis nidulans has been identified as anti(8Shneier A.

Lett. 1993; 3: 1399-1402Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and it is thought that the elimination of water occurs through a concerted mechanism without the involvement of covalent intermediates (3Kleanthous C. Deka R. Davis K. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Harding S.E. Price N.C. Hawkins A.R. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Harris J. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. Hawkins A.R. Abell C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; 1993: 1080-1081Crossref Google Scholar). The type I class, typified by the E. coli and Salmonella typhi enzymes, are dimers of 25-kDa monomer molecular mass and are not heat-stable(10Chaudhuri S. Lambert J.M. McColl L.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Moore J.D. Hawkins A.R. Charles I.G. Deka R. Coggins J.R. Cooper A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The E. coli enzyme in particular has been studied extensively, and the current model for its mechanism is shown in Fig. S1. Chemical modification and peptide mapping studies have established that Lys-170 forms a Schiff base with the substrate and product; the latter intermediate can be trapped by reduction with sodium borohydride(12Butler R.J. Alworth W.L. Nugent M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 1617-1618Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Chaudhuri S. Duncan K. Graham L.D. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that reduction of this intermediate has profound effects on the stability of the resulting protein(14Kleanthous C.

Lys-170 is conserved in all the known type I DHQase sequences(11Moore J.D. Hawkins A.R. Charles I.G. Deka R. Coggins J.R. Cooper A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Chaudhuri S. Duncan K. Graham L.D. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Bonner C.A.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which is consistent with its central role in the mechanism. Stereochemical experiments have shown that, unlike the reaction catalyzed by the type II class, the reaction is a syn elimination(9Harris J. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. Hawkins A.R. Abell C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; 1993: 1080-1081Crossref Google Scholar, 18Hanson K.R. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Since anti elimination is chemically the preferred course for the uncatalyzed reaction(18Hanson K.R. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the formation of the Schiff base involves some distortion of the carbocyclic ring of dehydroquinate to render the pro-R proton more reactive(9Harris J. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. Hawkins A.R. Abell C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; 1993: 1080-1081Crossref Google Scholar).The pH dependence of Vmax for E. coli DHQase reveals the presence of a single ionizing species with a pKa of 6.2(10Chaudhuri S. Lambert J.M. McColl L.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), consistent with the action of a general base in the mechanism (Fig. S1). The identity of this base has been inferred from diethyl pyrocarbonate experiments in which the modification of a single histidine residue led to inactivation of the enzyme, and the pKa of this modification corresponded to the pKa determined from the pH-Vmax profiles of the enzyme(19Deka R. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22237-22242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide mapping of the modified enzyme and sequencing of an isolated peptide established that the reactive histidine residue was either His-143 or His-146, and on the basis of sequence comparisons it was concluded that His-143 was the putative general base B highlighted in Fig. S1.Iodoacetate acts as an affinity labeling reagent of E. coli DHQase, destroying activity by alkylating two unusually reactive methionine residues, Met-23 and Met-205(20Kleanthous C. Campbell D.G. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10929-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10935-10939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the two residues, only Met-205 is completely conserved in the type I family. Alkylation of both residues is required for complete inactivation of the enzyme, implying that these residues may not be crucial for enzyme activity but may lie close to the active site. Moreover, the carboxymethylation of Met-205 can be reversed by treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol but only when the enzyme is in the folded state(21Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10935-10939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was interpreted by Kleanthous and Coggins (21Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10935-10939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as demonstrating the close proximity of a neutralizing positive charge near the carboxylate moiety of the carboxymethylated Met-205.At present, there are no three-dimensional structures for either class of DHQase, but high resolution data should become available in the near future, since diffracting crystals of both a type I (22Boys C.W.G. Bury S.M. Sawyer L. Moore J.D. Charles I.G. Hawkins A.R. Deka R. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and a type II (23Gourley D.G. Coggins J.R. Isaacs N.W. Moore J.D. Charles I.G. Hawkins A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) enzyme have been produced. In the absence of such data the roles of all the amino acids thus far identified by chemical modification need clarification. Toward this end we have mutated residues His-143, His-146, and Lys-170 to alanine and Met-205 to leucine and characterized the resulting mutant proteins to elucidate further the roles of the wild type residues in the mechanism of type I DHQase. The mutations addressed several as yet unanswered questions concerning the roles of these residues. The histidine mutations were made for two reasons, first to determine unambiguously which of the two was the likely DEPC-reactive residue and second to assess the properties of the essential histidine to alanine mutation in terms of the known mechanism. Met-205 alone was mutated since it is the only one of the two reactive methionine residues which is conserved in the type I family and Met-23 has already been mutated and shown to have no effect on enzyme activity. 2E. Borthwell and J. R. Coggins, unpublished observations. Alanine was substituted for the Schiff base-forming lysine to assess the relative importance of this residue in catalysis and ground state binding of ligand.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicalsAmmonium 3-dehydroquinate was prepared by the method of Grewe and Haendler(24Grewe R. Haendler H. Biochem. Prep. 1968; 12: 21-26Google Scholar). Ammonium 3-dehydroshikimate was prepared by treatment of 3-dehydroquinate with DHQase (this produces a 15:1 dehydroshikimate:dehydroquinate mixture). Hydroxylamine hydrochloride was from Sigma. DE52 ion exchange resin was from Whatman. Other chemicals were of reagent grade or better and used without further purification.Genetic MaterialsPlasmid pKD203 (which contains the 1.8-kilobase pair genomic fragment from pKD201 (25Duncan K. Chaudhuri S. Campbell M.S. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) ligated into pKK223-3) was a kind gift of Dr. K. Duncan. The expression vector pKK223-3 was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. E. coli strain AB2848 (tsx-356, supE42, λ-, aroD352) (26Pittard J. Wallace B.J. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 91: 1494-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. B. Bachmann at the E. coli Genetic Stock Center. Mutagenic, PCR, and sequencing primer oligonucleotides were synthesized on a New Brunswick Cyclone synthesizer.Overexpression of 3-DehydroquinaseThe aroD gene encoding the type I DHQase from E. coli was isolated, free of extraneous chromosomal DNA, from plasmid pKD203 by PCR using primers complementary to the ends of the open reading frame. The primers were extended with a sequence designed to place an EcoRI restriction site at the 5′-end of the gene and a HindIII site at the 3′-end. The blunt-ended PCR fragments were ligated into a pUC18-derived cloning vector which has a SmaI site overlapping an EcoK site in the polylinker, and introduced into E. coli JM103 (which is EcoK+). Clones containing inserts were selected by the loss of β-galactosidase activity. The aroD fragment was then isolated by restriction digestion with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into the expression vector pKK223-3. The resulting construct was introduced into E. coli JM105 by transformation. Plasmid DNA from clones containing an insert was checked for appropriate size and restriction sites. Following DNA sequencing of the aroD gene using an A.L.F automated sequencer (Pharmacia), suitable clones were induced with isopropyl thiogalactoside and one (pAL2-2) producing a band of suitable size on SDS-PAGE was selected. This plasmid was then introduced into the aroD point mutant strain, E. coli AB2848. For protein preparation, this clone was grown on LB medium in the presence of 200 μg/ml ampicillin to an OD550 of 0.7-0.8, whereupon expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl thiogalactoside. The cells were grown for a further 6 h and harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min.In Vivo Complementation TestsStrain AB2848 was inoculated onto M9 minimal agar plates with and without aromatic amino acids (40 μg/ml phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan). Bacteria harboring the plasmids with enzymically active aroD genes (wild type, M205L, and H146A) grew on both plates. Those with no active aroD gene (pKK223-3 vector and K170A) grew only when supplemented with aromatic amino acids. The H143A mutant gave rise to an intermediate phenotype in that the bacteria grew well on supplemented medium but very slowly without aromatic amino acids.Purification of DehydroquinasePurifications of overexpressed type I wild type and mutant DHQase enzymes were carried out by a procedure modified from that first described by Chaudhuri et al.(10Chaudhuri S. Lambert J.M. McColl L.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells grown in LB medium were resuspended in buffer (50 mM Tris•HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0; 40 ml/liter of culture harvested) and treated with lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were then disrupted by three freeze-thaw cycles. The DNA and RNA in the viscous mixture were hydrolyzed by incubation with DNase I and RNase A (0.05 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. After centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, the supernatant was taken to 75% saturation with ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation (21,000 × g, 30 min), redissolved in low salt buffer (50 mM Tris•HCl, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer. The protein solution was then applied to a 50-ml column of DE52 anion exchange resin previously equilibrated in the same buffer. Dehydroquinase was eluted with a salt gradient (50-250 mM KCl; elution at ˜90 mM salt). Fractions were assessed by SDS-PAGE and enzyme activity and were usually more than 85% pure at this stage. Yields were up to 100 mg/liter of culture. For further purification, these fractions were dialyzed against potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, concentrated to ˜4 mg/ml in an Amicon concentrator and then applied to a semipreparative Superdex-S75 gel filtration column (360 ml; 26 mm × 600 mm) equilibrated in the same buffer. Enzyme prepared this way was typically >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. A further treatment of the H143A protein involved dialyzing the purified enzyme against 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mM hydroxylamine which removed Schiff base-linked product molecules (see “Isoelectric Focusing” under “Results”).Protein DeterminationsProtein concentration determinations were carried out by the method of Bradford(27Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213154) Google Scholar), using a kit from Bio-Rad, with bovine serum albumin as a standard and by spectrophotometry using the extinction coefficient ∈280 = 19,000 at 280 nm (19Deka R. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22237-22242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google ScholarMutagenesisA modified M13 method was used for the generation of site directed mutants(28Curtis M.D. James R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2727-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mutants were selected by single track sequencing and confirmed by complete sequencing of the aroD gene. The mutant genes were ligated into pKK223-3 and overexpressed as described above. The resulting proteins were all similar in size to wild type enzyme by SDS-PAGE. Mutations were confirmed by accurate mass measurement using ESI-MS (see below).Enzyme AssayDehydroquinase activity was assayed by monitoring the appearance of product by spectrophotometry at 234 nm as described previously(10Chaudhuri S. Lambert J.M. McColl L.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For determination of kinetic parameters, seven concentrations of dehydroquinate spanning the range 0.1 to 10 Km were used; determinations were done from separate enzyme preparations and at least in duplicate.SpectrofluorimetryExperiments were performed on a Shimadzu RF5000 spectrofluorimeter interfaced to a personal computer, in 1 cm × 1-cm cuvettes and in a total volume of 1.5 ml. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm and emission spectra were acquired from 300 to 450 nm. For Kd determinations, protein concentrations were ˜50 μg/ml (˜2 μM), and ligand concentrations were from 0 to 160 μM, in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25°C; emission was monitored at 330 nm. Since DHQase is a single substrate enzyme, the ligand for the majority of the binding experiments was an equilibrium mixture of substrate, dehydroquinate, and product, dehydroshikimate; the equilibrium constant for E. coli DHQase has previously been determined by Mitsuhashi and Davis (29Mitsuhashi S. Davis B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1954; 15: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to be 15. The mixture in these studies was generated by incubating (overnight at 4°C) the substrate with catalytic amounts of active enzyme until equilibrium had been reached (monitored at 234 nm) and used without further treatment. The final concentration of wild type enzyme during the spectrofluorometric assays was ˜3 orders of magnitude lower than the target protein and so did not contribute to any observed fluorescence changes. For the H143A mutant, samples for Kd determination were allowed to equilibrate overnight at 4°C, then for at least 2 h at 25°C before measurement. For this mutant it was also necessary to use much lower protein concentrations (1.25 μg/ml, 0.05 μM). Baseline spectra due to buffer and, where employed, to ligand were removed by subtraction in every case, and the resulting data were fitted to a single ligand binding curve. For time course experiments on the H143A mutant, protein concentrations of ˜50 μg/ml and ligand concentrations up to 500 μM were employed, and the resulting data were fitted to a single exponential decay. All experiments were done in duplicate.ESI-MSMass spectra were taken on a Fisons VG Platform using 1:1:0.001 CH3CN:H2O:HCOOH as sample solvent and horse heart myoglobin as a standard. Samples were dialyzed against water or 1-2 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, to remove salts, and mixed with the sample solvent immediately prior to analysis. Approximately 30 pmol of protein were used per run. For the time course experiments, the solvent flow rate was such that the protein was exposed to the solvent for less than 30 s before electrospray ionization. Data was acquired over the range m/z 700-1300, with five or more scans averaged and processed using the supplier's MassLynx software. Standard errors quoted under “Results” represent the errors from five separate mass determinations for each sample. The typical standard deviation for each mass determination was of the order of 1.0-2.0 Da.Isoelectric Focusing (IEF)Samples were analyzed on a Pharmacia PhastSystem using precast IEF gels covering pI 4.0-6.5 and a Pharmacia standards kit. Irreversible reduction of product (dehydroshikimate) at the active site of DHQase using sodium borohydride was carried out as described by Kleanthous et al.(14Kleanthous C. Reilly M. Cooper A. Kelly S. Price N.C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10893-10898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A hybrid mixture composed of DHQase containing none, one, and two molecules of product covalently bound per dimer was prepared as described previously(30Reilly A. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1993; 3: 1429-1434Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Samples of 0.5-1 μg of protein were loaded, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue according to the manufacturer's protocol.Data AnalysisCurve fitting for ligand binding experiments, time course experiments, and Km determinations was performed using Enzfitter (31Leatherbarrow R.J.

The level of expression from this construct is ˜10 mg/liter. However, we found that removing the flanking chromosomal DNA by PCR and cloning back into pK223-3 increased the level of expression to ˜100 mg/liter (see “Materials and Methods”). Using this expression construct both wild type and mutant DHQases were transformed into the aroD point mutant AB2848, a strain that was first described by Pittard and Wallace(26Pittard J. Wallace B.J. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 91: 1494-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AB2848 was chosen since a suitable E. coli aroD deletion mutant was unavailable. AB2848 is auxotrophic for aromatic amino acids and so was used as an initial assay for functional DHQase. Enzymatically active mutants (H146A and M205L) were able to complement the aroD- phenotype of E. coli AB2848 when grown on minimal medium in the absence of aromatic amino acids but the inactive K170A mutant did not; in the case of the H143A mutant, only partial complementation seemed to occur as growth on minimal medium was much slower. Wild type and mutant proteins were purified from AB2848 grown on LB medium as described under “Materials and Methods.” The mutations had relatively little effect on the physical properties of the proteins; all were overexpressed well without toxic effects or any observed degradation. They all behaved similarly on SDS-PAGE and on the ion exchange columns used for purification, and in preliminary experiments they were denatured at similar concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride to those reported previously for the wild type enzyme(3Kleanthous C.

It is therefore unlikely that the specific effects seen are due to destabilization of the protein structure caused by any of the mutations.Isoelectric FocusingThe purity of each of the mutant proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE and shown to be >95% pure (data not shown). As a matter of routine, the mutants were also analyzed by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis to determine whether any charge variants were apparent in the native protein preparations. Wild type DHQase showed a single band with a pI 4.9 (in agreement with previous work)(30Reilly A. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1993; 3: 1429-1434Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and similar isoelectric points were determined for the K170A and M205L mutants (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 3, and 4, respectively).Figure 1Isoelectric focusing gels of wild type and mutant dehydroquinases.

https://openalex.org/W2121990983,"Cholesterol was poorly available to free apolipoprotein (apo)A-I-mediated cellular lipid efflux from cholesterol-loaded rat vascular smooth muscle cells generating cholesterol-poorer pre-β-HDL particles than those generated from macrophages by the same reaction (Li, Q., Komaba, A., and Yokoyama, S. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 4597-4603). The factors known to induce transformation of the smooth muscle cells into a macrophage-like stage were used in order to modulate this reaction, such as human platelet-derived growth factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and phorbol 12-myristate-13acetate (PMA). When the cells were stimulated by PMA following the pretreatment with platelet-derived growth factor plus macrophage colony-stimulating factor, cholesterol efflux mediated by free apoA-I increased 3-fold without changing phospholipid efflux, resulting in generation of pre-β-HDL particles more rich in cholesterol. This treatment had only a little or no effect on apparent cellular cholesterol efflux to HDL or lipid microemulsion, respectively. Overall cellular free cholesterol pool size was unaffected by the treatment, and probing by extracellular cholesterol oxidase did not detect gross change in the cellular surface cholesterol. This specific enrichment of cholesterol in the apoA-I-mediated cellular lipid efflux was reversed by protein kinase C inhibitors. Measurement of intracellular cholesterol esterification suggested that PMA induced translocation of intracellular cholesterol to a specific pool for apoA-I-mediated efflux, and a protein kinase C inhibitor reversed this effect. Cholesterol was poorly available to free apolipoprotein (apo)A-I-mediated cellular lipid efflux from cholesterol-loaded rat vascular smooth muscle cells generating cholesterol-poorer pre-β-HDL particles than those generated from macrophages by the same reaction (Li, Q., Komaba, A., and Yokoyama, S.

Overall cellular free cholesterol pool size was unaffected by the treatment, and probing by extracellular cholesterol oxidase did not detect gross change in the cellular surface cholesterol. This specific enrichment of cholesterol in the apoA-I-mediated cellular lipid efflux was reversed by protein kinase C inhibitors. Measurement of intracellular cholesterol esterification suggested that PMA induced translocation of intracellular cholesterol to a specific pool for apoA-I-mediated efflux, and a protein kinase C inhibitor reversed this effect. When cholesterol is transported from the peripheral cells to the liver for its biological degradation, the first step of the pathway is efflux of cellular cholesterol to plasma lipoproteins. High density lipoprotein (HDL)1 is believed to play a primary role in this step by “accepting” the cellular cholesterol. Cellular free cholesterol is exchangeable with extracellular lipoprotein surface by a nonspecific physicochemical mechanism such as its diffusion through aqueous phase or direct collision between the membranes (Rothblat and Phillips, 1982; Johnson et al., 1986; Karlin et al., 1987; Johnson et al., 1988). The net efflux could therefore be induced by a gradient of cholesterol content between cell membrane and lipoprotein surface, so that cholesterol esterification on HDL may play an important role in such a mechanism (Murphy, 1962; Glomset, 1968; Ray et al., 1980; Fielding and Fielding, 1981; Czarnecka and Yokoyama, 1995). Specific function of HDL to accommodate cholesterol may also be attributed to physicochemical properties of its surface (Stein et al., 1986; Phillips et al., 1987). On the other hand, a HDL-binding protein(s) on the cell surface is proposed to play a specific role being linked to intracellular signal transduction that results in mobilization of intracellular cholesterol to cellular surface (Graham and Oram, 1987; Slotte et al., 1987; Mendez et al., 1991; McKnight et al., 1992). Recent development of the investigation in this field shed light for further understanding of the mechanism for cellular cholesterol efflux. Fielding and co-workers discovered that cellular cholesterol appeared in a specific HDL fraction, pre-β-HDL, in the very early stage of its efflux and then was transferred to other lipoproteins (Castro and Fielding, 1988; Miida et al., 1990, 1992) and proposed that this lipoprotein fraction is the most efficient “acceptor” of cellular cholesterol. Later, we demonstrated that lipid-free apolipoproteins having multisegments of amphiphilic helix mediate the net efflux of cholesterol and phospholipid from various types of cells, generating new HDL-like particles with these cellular lipids (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991, 1992; Hara et al., 1992; Komaba et al., 1992). The particles were consistent with pre-β-HDL with respect to the chemical and physical properties. Other groups have also reported similar data using lipid-free apolipoproteins (Bielicki et al., 1992; Forte et al., 1993). These results may explain why cellular cholesterol appears in pre-β-HDL fraction in the very early stage of the efflux (Castro and Fielding, 1988; Miida et al., 1990, 1992); pre-β-HDL particles are newly generated with cellular lipid by apolipoproteins dissociated from HDL, rather than the particles in the medium preferably “accepting” cholesterol from cellular surface. The reaction can be carried out by a number of amphiphilic helical apolipoproteins (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991; Hara et al., 1992; Bielicki et al., 1992) or their model peptides (Mendez et al., 1994), and it may induce specific translocation of intracellular cholesterol that would render cholesterol readily available for the efflux (Mendez et al., 1994). The involvement of a protein binding site(s) for such apolipoproteins has not clearly been identified on cellular surface. However, many circumstantial evidences may support a potential role of such a site(s) in this reaction. Apparent Km values for apolipoprotein-mediated lipid efflux were as low (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991; Komaba et al., 1992) as that of the LDL-receptor interaction (≈10-8M) (Brown and Goldstein, 1986), and lower than that of the lipid-apolipoprotein interaction (≈10-7M) (Tajima et al., 1983; Yokoyama et al., 1985), indicating some type of specific interaction. Proteolytic treatment of cellular surface resulted in complete inhibition of this pathway (Li et al., 1995). Furthermore, specific lack of interaction with lipid-free apoA-I in fibroblasts from the patients with Tangier disease strongly suggested that there is a genetically defined cellular interaction site for lipid-free apolipoproteins, and that this reaction is a major source of plasma HDL (Francis et al., 1995). Thus, free apolipoprotein-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux seems to be a distinct pathway from nonspecific physicochemical cholesterol exchange reaction between cellular surface and lipoproteins. This may lead us to the hypothesis that HDL-mediated lipid efflux includes two distinct mechanisms. One is physicochemical lipid exchange between the cell and HDL surface in which gradient of cholesterol between the two surfaces causes the net efflux and therefore cholesterol esterification on HDL may act as its driving force. The other is generation of new pre-β-HDL with cellular lipids, as apolipoproteins locally dissociate from HDL surface to interact with the cellular surface (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991, 1992). The maximum contribution of the free apolipoprotein-mediated portion could be as much as 40% of apparent HDL-mediated efflux (Komaba et al., 1992; Francis et al., 1995). Interestingly, vascular smooth muscle cells are very resistant to the free apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux (Komaba et al., 1992) due to generation of cholesterol-poor pre-β-HDL (Li et al., 1993). This was specific to lipid-free apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux, whereas little significant difference was found among cell lines in the nonspecific cholesterol efflux mediated by low density lipoprotein (LDL) or lipid microemulsions (Li et al., 1993). The low cholesterol/phospholipid ratio in the HDL-mediated lipid efflux from smooth muscle cells implied that free apoA-I-mediated mechanism is in fact involved in cellular lipid efflux to HDL (Li et al., 1993). These findings indicated that cell-specific intracellular factors are involved in regulation of cholesterol incorporation into the cellular lipid efflux mediated by apolipoprotein-cell interaction. Vascular smooth muscle cells are known to be stimulated by certain growth factors and transformed to different stages, and such transformation may be related to its roles in development of vascular atherosclerotic lesions. The smooth muscle cells isolated from arteriosclerotic lesion were found to express the c-fms gene encoding the receptor for macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) (Inaba et al., 1992a). In vitro, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB-chain homodimer stimulates the smooth muscle cells to induce c-fms gene as well as the scavenger receptor gene, as transforming the cells to a macrophage-like stage (Inaba et al., 1992b). On the other hand, in the undifferentiated macrophage cell line cell THP-1, phorbol esters are known to induce differentiation of the cells with respect to many macrophage activities, including expression of the scavenger receptor (Hara et al., 1987; Takata et al., 1989) and apolipoprotein E and lipoprotein lipase (Tajima et al., 1985; Menju et al., 1989). Hence, the in vitro transformation of the cells by these factors may modulate the cell specific factors involved in apolipoprotein-mediated lipid efflux and would provide an important model to study the intracellular mechanism for cholesterol efflux by this particular pathway. Thus, we undertook the study of lipid-free apoA-I-mediated lipid efflux from rat vascular smooth muscle cells in comparison to the apparent cholesterol efflux to lipoproteins and lipid microemulsions under the influence of stimulation of the cells by the growth factors and phorbol esters. HDL was isolated from fresh human plasma as the fraction with a density of 1.063-1.21 g/ml in NaBr. The purity of the lipoprotein preparation was verified by electrophoresis in 0.5% agarose and by apolipoprotein composition analysis in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, in order to assure no contamination of LDL or apoB. The particular preparation used was a mixture of HDL2 and HDL3, in approximately 1 to 1 protein ratio, determined by a non-denaturing gradient polyacrylamide electrophoresis. ApoA-I was further isolated from human HDL by delipidation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography in 6 M urea and dissolved in PBS buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate containing 150 mM NaCl in pH 7.4), in which the protein self-associates in equilibrium, as described previously (Yokoyama et al., 1982). All the materials were stored at 4°C as a solution in PBS buffer under argon. LDL was prepared and labeled with [1,2-3H]cholesteryl oleate (45.4 Ci/mmol, purchased from Amersham Corp.) according to a previously described method (Nishikawa et al., 1986). The labeled LDL was either acetylated or cationized by the method previously described for the purpose of loading radiolabeled cholesterol to macrophages or vascular smooth muscle cells, respectively (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991; Komaba, et al., 1992). Lipid microemulsions having a homogeneous diameter of 26 nm were prepared from egg phosphatidylcholine and triolein as described previously (Tajima et al., 1983) for a nonspecific cellular lipid efflux (Hara and Yokoyama, 1992). Both lipids were cosonicated in the weight ratio of 1:1, and the emulsions were isolated by ultracentrifugation and gel permeation chromatography. Smooth muscle cells were prepared from rat thoracic aorta (Komaba et al., 1992). The cells in passages 4-9 were loaded with radiolabeled cholesterol and labeled for choline phospholipid by incubating with cationized LDL containing the [3H]cholesteryl ester for 1 week and with [methyl-3H]choline chloride (15 Ci/mmol, Amersham) for the last 24 h of this period as we described previously (Komaba et al., 1992). The cholesterol-loaded cells were washed and incubated without lipoproteins for additional 24 h. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were obtained from male or female ICR mice by peritoneal lavage (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991). The cells were loaded with radiolabeled cholesterol and labeled for choline phospholipid by incubating with the acetylated LDL containing radiolabeled cholesteryl ester, together with [methyl-3H]choline chloride, for 24 h as described previously (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991; Li et al., 1993). The labeled cells were pretreated for stimulation with growth factors. Both macrophages and smooth muscle cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml recombinant PDGF (Sigma) and/or 100 ng/ml MCSF (a generous gift from Dr. Nobuhiro Yamada, University of Tokyo) for 24 h (Inaba et al., 1992b). In the presence of PDGF, the smooth muscle cells were transformed into the stretched shape with multipseudopods suggesting their transformation to synthetic state. The uptake of acetyl LDL was increased in this stage by 2-4-fold (Table 1), indicating expression of the scavenger receptor (Inaba et al., 1992b). This change was not obvious in the presence of MCSF alone. The cells were incubated with and without phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma), 160 nM, for the last 45 min of this 24-h incubation period. Sphingosine, staurosporine, and 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7) (all obtained from Sigma) were also added to this 45-min period as protein kinase C inhibitors, in the attempt to reverse the effect of PMA (Hannun et al., 1986; Tamaoki et al., 1986; Hidaka et al., 1984). Sphingosine was suspended with 2 mM bovine serum albumin solution in PBS to give its concentration of 25 mM, and added to the medium to make final concentration of 5-40 μM at the step of the PMA treatment (Hannun et al., 1986). Staurosporine was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide as 4 mM and added to the medium to make final concentration of 0.5-50 nM at the stage of the PMA treatment (Tamaoki et al., 1986). H-7 was dissolved in water as 5 mM and added to the medium to make final concentration of 12.5-100 μM (Hidaka et al., 1994).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab After the pretreatment, the cells were washed with the medium for three times and then incubated with HDL, apoA-I, and lipid microemulsion in the presence of 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Radioactivity of free and esterified cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin in the medium, and cells was then counted after the lipid was extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991, 1992). Radioactivity of each lipid in the medium in the presence of bovine serum albumin alone was less than 5% of the level induced by HDL as 50 μg of protein, and this was subtracted from each data point as a background (Komaba, et al., 1992; Li, et al., 1993). Specific radioactivity of cellular total cholesterol and each phospholipid was calculated based on their chemical amount, measured by an enzymatic fluorescence method and organic phosphorus assay, respectively, and used for calculation of the amount of the efflux into the medium (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991; Komaba et al., 1992; Li et al., 1993). The validity of this method was verified by quantification of cholesterol with gas-liquid chromatography (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991). In some experiments, the efflux was expressed as radioactivity of each lipid in the medium standardized for cellular pool of the respective cellular lipid in each culture dish specimen (Komaba et al., 1992) or radioactivity per cellular protein. Cellular protein of each dish was measured by the method of Lowry et al.(1951). The experimental data points were duplicated unless otherwise specified, mostly within a 10% error margin, and the values in the figures represent the averages unless otherwise specified. The medium was analyzed for the lipid efflux product by using density gradient ultracentrifugation in sucrose as described earlier (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991). Sucrose solution of density 1.30 (0.7 ml) was overlayered with the solution of density 1.10 (1.2 ml), and then the culture medium (1.2 ml) was overlayered on the top in a 3-ml quick-seal centrifuge tube for a Beckman TL100.3 rotor. After centrifugation at 99,000 rpm in a TL100 ultracentrifuge for 16 h at 4°C, 200-μl fractions were collected from the bottom. For each fraction, density was measured and radioactivity of free cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine was counted after lipid extraction and thin layer chromatography. The weight of each lipid was calculated by using the specific radioactivity of the respective lipid in a cellular pool (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991; Li et al., 1993). Cellular cholesterol was oxidized by extracellular cholesterol oxidase (Sigma) in order to assess accessibility from the cellular surface, and the oxidized product, cholestone, was analyzed by thin layer chromatography after extracting the cellular lipid, as described in detail previously (Lange and Ramos, 1983; Li et al., 1993). Intracellular cholesterol esterification activity was measured for the cholesterol-loaded cells after treatment with growth factors and PMA, according to the method previously described (Francis et al., 1993). The cells were treated in the same manner as the efflux experiment for cholesterol loading with cationized LDL, the growth factor treatment, and PMA stimulation in the presence and absence of H-7. After washing the medium containing [1-14]oleic acid (57 mCi/mmol, Amersham), 1.5 μCi (26 nmol) was added to each culture dish. After a 1-h incubation at 37°C, the cells were washed with ice-chilled medium and lipid was extracted for the analysis by thin layer chromatography. The radioactivity in cholesteryl ester fraction was counted. Lipid efflux profile was compared between rat aortic smooth muscle cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages. The efflux to lipid microemulsion represents nonspecific physicochemical pathway and apoA-I-mediated efflux represents the efflux pathway by generating new pre-β-HDL particles with cellular lipid. The condition was chosen for the Vmax of the efflux rate at the 24-h incubation (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991, 1992), and the results shown in Table 2 were consistent with our previous observation (Li et al., 1993). In nonspecific pathway (to lipid microemulsion), the rate of cholesterol efflux was much higher than that of phospholipid and the ratio of cholesterol to total phospholipid was very similar for the two types of cell, giving a weight ratio around 4. In contrast, phospholipid efflux was substantially high in the apoA-I-mediated efflux from both cells. Specific difference was observed in cholesterol efflux between smooth muscle cells and macrophages. Cholesterol was very poorly incorporated from smooth muscle cells into this pathway, making its weight ratio to phospholipid substantially lower than the efflux from macrophages, 0.24 versus 1.57. In lipid efflux to HDL, the value of this parameter was intermediate between the emulsion-mediated and apoA-I-mediated pathways.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Smooth muscle cells were exposed to the potential stimuli to induce macrophage-like functions. Such factors as PDGF, MCSF, and PMA were used in an attempt to modulate lipid efflux profile for the reasons mentioned earlier, and the results are shown in Table 3. When each of the three factors was individually used, there was no effect on the cholesterol efflux from the cells either by HDL or apoA-I. Since PDGF is known to induce MCSF receptor (Inaba et al., 1992b), the two growth factors were used together, but no additional effect was found by this combination. When the cells were stimulated by PMA following the treatment with growth factors, cholesterol efflux was somewhat enhanced from the PDGF-pretreated cells but not from the MCSF-treated cells. No increase was observed in the apparent cholesterol efflux to HDL in this condition. Finally, when both growth factors were used together in the pretreatment for the PMA-stimulation, the efflux of cholesterol mediated by lipid-free apoA-I was enhanced 3-fold. The increase was only 30% with the efflux to HDL by the same treatment. In contrast to the results for the cholesterol efflux, phospholipid efflux mediated by apoA-I was not significantly affected by the treatment with PDGF/MCSF and PMA. Total cellular protein has not reached significant difference by any of these treatments (Table 3). To examine potential contribution to the efflux of intracellular cholesteryl ester hydrolysis as the cellular reaction to the growth factors, free/total cholesterol ratio was determined in the cells during the pretreatment period (24 h). There was no significant change in this ratio (Table 3).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows the time course of the efflux of these lipids mediated by lipid-free apoA-I and HDL from control smooth muscle cells and those treated with PDGF/MCSF plus PMA. While free apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux was high from the stimulated smooth muscle cells, phospholipid efflux was essentially the same between the control and stimulated cells. The stimulation of the cell did not have a prominent effect on the lipid efflux to HDL. The enhancement of cholesterol efflux by the treatment was also demonstrated in an apoA-I dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Cellular cholesterol efflux was more than doubled by the PDGF/MCSF plus PMA treatment of smooth muscle cells in this particular experiment, while phospholipid efflux was almost identical between the control and the treated cells. Thus, the relative enhancement effect of the combined treatment was specific to cholesterol availability to the apoA-I-mediated cellular lipid efflux that had otherwise been poor in smooth muscle cells (Li et al., 1993).Figure 2Dose dependence of the apoA-I-mediated lipid efflux from smooth muscle cells. Circles, control; triangles, treatment with PDGF and MCSF, plus PMA. Panel A, cholesterol efflux; panel B, phosphatidylcholine efflux. The cells were labeled for cholesterol and choline phospholipid as described in the text, treated with growth factors and PMA, and the lipid efflux was observed in the presence of various amounts of apoA-I for 24 h. Cellular protein per dish was 346.8 ± 15.3 μg. Radioactivity of cellular free cholesterol per blank dish was 22526 ± 2697 cpm, and that of cellular phosphatidylcholine was 19539 ± 2021 cpm. Cellular free cholesterol was 42.3 ± 2.6% of total cellular cholesterol in radioactivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm generation of new pre-β-HDL by this reaction and incorporation of more cholesterol into this particle by the activation of smooth muscle cells, the culture medium was analyzed by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Fig. 3 demonstrates that the newly formed HDL in the medium was more cholesterol-rich when the cells were stimulated. Thus, more cholesterol molecules (relatively to phospholipid) were incorporated into the pre-β-HDL particles generated by lipid-free apolipoproteins when the smooth muscle cells were treated with PDGF/MCSF plus PMA. In order to observe whether this specific increase of cholesterol incorporation into apoA-I-mediated cellular lipid efflux pathway is related to gross change in cellular cholesterol distribution, surface cholesterol of smooth muscle cells was probed by extracellular cholesterol oxidase. Fig. 4 illustrates the percentage of oxidized cellular cholesterol in the control and activated conditions. There was no difference in cellular surface cholesterol observed by this procedure either in the initial rate of the oxidation or the end point of the reaction between the control cells and the cells after the combined treatment. Table 4 shows the comparison of the effect on the apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux pathway and a nonspecific physicochemical efflux pathway to lipid microemulsion of the treatment of the smooth muscle cells with the growth factors and PMA. While the enhancement was demonstrated for the apoA-I-mediated efflux, there was no influence of the treatment on the nonspecific efflux. Another experiment shown in this table is the effect of sphingosine, a potent protein kinase C inhibitor, on the activated apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux by the growth factors/PMA treatment. The enhancement effect of PMA was completely reversed in the presence of 40 μM of sphingosine in the medium, while it did not have any effect on the nonspecific cholesterol efflux.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5 further demonstrates the effect of protein kinase C inhibitors on the enhancement of apoA-I-mediated cellular lipid efflux from smooth muscle cells. Both sphingosine and staurosporine suppressed the cholesterol efflux in a dose-dependent manner (left panel). The maximum inhibition by sphingosine and staurosporine was 81% and 47% of the increment of cholesterol efflux by PMA, respectively. In contrast, staurosporine showed no significant effect on phosphatidylcholine efflux mediated by apoA-I (right panel). A specific inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase C, H-7, was used in a similar manner (Fig. 6). The increase of apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux by PMA from the growth factors-treated cells was almost completely reversed, while the effect on phospholipid efflux was negligible (left panel). The same compound demonstrated no effect on nonspecific lipid efflux from the similarly activated smooth muscle cells to lipid microemulsions (right panel).Figure 6Effect of H-7, a cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase C inhibitor, on the apoA-I-mediated efflux of cholesterol from the smooth muscle cells pretreated with the growth factors and stimulated by PMA. The cells were pretreated with PDGF and MCSF for 24 h. PMA was added to the medium in the presence of various amount of H-7 for the last 45 min of the growth factor treatment. The cells were washed and the lipid efflux by 10 μg of apoA-I (left panel) and by lipid microemulsion (as 156 μg of phospholipid) was observed for 24 h. Details of the method are described in the text. Circles represent cholesterol efflux, and squares represent phosphatidylcholine efflux. Each data point represents mean ± S.E. of triplicated assay. Broken horizontal line in the left panel represent the level of cholesterol efflux by apoA-I from the non-activated cells. Cellular protein was 168 ± 18 μg/dish, and cellular cholesterol was 2.1 ± 0.3 μg/dish.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Intracellular cholesterol esterification activity was determined in the same stages of activation of cholesterol-loaded smooth muscle cells by the growth factors and PMA as used for lipid efflux experiments (Fig. 7). Incorporation of radiolabeled oleate into cholesteryl ester was not significantly changed by the cellular treatment with both growth factors. Adding PMA for short periods (45 min) significantly decreased the reaction, suggesting the decrease of cholesterol pool available for this reaction. The presence of H-7 completely reversed the effect of PMA. Thus, the effect of PMA and H-7 on intracellular cholesterol esterification was reciprocal to the effect of these compounds on apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux from the growth factor-treated vascular smooth muscle cells. Finally, the experiment was performed for the treatment of mouse peritoneal macrophages with PDGF and MCSF, individually or in combination. Cholesterol efflux from the control cells was already high, and no significant effect of any of these treatments was observed on cholesterol and phospholipid efflux either mediated by HDL or free apoA-I (data not shown). Further incubation with phorbol ester (PMA) of the pretreated cells with the growth factors, which led to a specific effect on smooth muscle cells as described above, did not show any further differential effect on the lipid efflux, either among the different pretreatment groups with the growth factors or between the efflux mediated by apoA-I and HDL (Table 5).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab After short periods of incubation, PMA stimulated the cholesterol efflux by free apoA-I from the rat vascular smooth muscle cells pretreated with growth factors. The effect was achieved, but marginally by the pretreatment with PDGF alone and more prominently when the cells were pretreated with PDGF and MCSF. Without the stimulation, cholesterol was poorly incorporated into the apoA-I-mediated lipid efflux, generating cholesterol-poor pre-β-HDL in the medium. Stimulation of the cells by PDGF and MCSF plus PMA enhanced the apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux without changing phospholipid efflux rate, generating pre-β-HDL more rich in cholesterol. Interestingly, no effect was found on a nonspecific physicochemical lipid efflux pathway to lipid microemulsions by the same treatment of the cells. The effect of the treatment on cholesterol efflux to HDL was only partial. The observation was consistent with the view that the stimulation is specific to cholesterol incorporation to the apoA-I-mediated cellular lipid efflux, while the interaction of apoA-I with the cell itself is unaffected, since phosphatidylcholine efflux was not influenced by these treatment and the same amount of pre-β-HDL seemed to be produced regardless of the treatment. The partial effect on the HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux may reflect contribution of the apoA-I-mediated mechanism to the overall cellular lipid efflux to HDL. At least three protein kinase C inhibitors reversed the stimulating effect of PMA on the apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux from the vascular smooth muscle cells pretreated with PDGF and MCSF, again without changing the cellular phospholipid efflux by free apoA-I. The inhibitors had no effect on the nonspecific cellular lipid efflux to lipid microemulsions. In contrast, intracellular cholesterol esterification was suppressed by the same PMA treatment in the pretreated vascular smooth muscle cells with PDGF and MCSF, and this effect was also reversed by the protein kinase C inhibitor. However, overall cellular free cholesterol pool size was unaffected by these cellular treatment and probing of cellular surface cholesterol by extracellular cholesterol oxidase did not demonstrate any significant difference between the control cells and the stimulated cells. The data thus indicated that intracellular cholesterol is translocated to the specific pool readily available to apoA-I-mediated lipid efflux by the short term incubation of the pretreated cells with PMA, and this was inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitors. This effect was, however, not to an extent that influences cellular surface lipid composition reflecting in nonspecific physicochemical cellular lipid efflux and probing surface cholesterol by cholesterol oxidase. In the previous few years, a concept of a specific and biologically regulated cellular cholesterol efflux has been gradually developed by several research groups including ourselves. The efflux is mediated by lipid-free helical apolipoproteins and the reaction results in generation of pre-β-HDL with the apolipoprotein and cellular phospholipid and cholesterol (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991, 1992; Hara et al., 1992; Bielicki et al., 1992; Forte et al., 1993). This efflux reaction is distinguishable from nonspecific physicochemical lipid exchange between cell and lipoprotein in many aspects. The reaction has substantially lower Km (in the order of 10-8M) (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991; Komaba et al., 1992; Mendez et al., 1994) than Kd for apolipoprotein-lipid association (Tajima et al., 1983; Yokoyama et al., 1985) and Km for cellular lipid efflux to HDL (Komaba et al., 1992). A large amount of phospholipid accompanies cholesterol efflux, while phospholipid efflux to lipoproteins is much lower than that of cholesterol (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991; Forte et al., 1993; Li et al., 1993). Extracellular cholesterol esterification by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase takes place on the pre-β-HDL generated by apoA-I (Forte et al., 1995; Czarnecka and Yokoyama, 1995), but it does not have an impact on the rate of lipid efflux by this pathway (Czarnecka and Yokoyama, 1995), while it causes net efflux of cholesterol to HDL by reducing the influx of cholesterol and by shifting equilibrium distribution of cholesterol if the exchange rate is rapid (Czarnecka and Yokoyama, 1995). Proteolytic treatment of cellular surface causes selective inhibition of the apolipoprotein-mediated lipid efflux (Li et al., 1995). Specific defect of this pathway has been identified in the fibroblasts from the patients with Tangier disease (Francis et al., 1995) as well as in normal human erythrocytes (Li et al., 1995). The two distinct mechanisms were also differentiated by the lipid efflux profiles from vascular smooth muscle cells. Although there is no essential difference in nonspecific pathway between the smooth muscle cells and mouse macrophages, the former cells are resistant to net cholesterol efflux by free apolipoproteins, not because the cells are less reactive to free apolipoproteins but because cholesterol is poorly available to this reaction (Komaba et al., 1992; Li et al., 1993). In such a context, we undertook the attempt to modulate lipid-free apolipoprotein-mediated cellular lipid efflux by modification of cellular parameters. Vascular smooth muscle cells were chosen as a model because of their unique behavior in the apolipoprotein-mediated lipid efflux and because of their peculiar reaction to a numbers of factors leading to their various differential stages (Inaba et al., 1992a, 1992b; Shimada et al., 1992). They are known to be induced for macrophage-like functions, including expression of the genes encoding the scavenger receptor and the MCSF receptor in certain conditions such as stimulation by PDGF BB (Inaba et al., 1992a, 1992b). MCSF is known to enhance the activity of macrophage (Nakoinz and Ralph, 1988; Hume et al., 1988; Ishibashi et al., 1990; Shimano et al., 1990; Mori et al., 1991; Inaba et al., 1993; Ishii et al., 1994), and PMA is used for inducing differentiation of macrophage cell line cells such as THP-1 cells with respect to a number of macrophage-like functions, including expression of the scavenger receptor (Hara et al., 1987; Takata et al., 1989) and secretion of lipoprotein lipase and apolipoprotein E (Tajima et al., 1985; Menju et al., 1989). Stimulation of the smooth muscle cells by these factors brought us very interesting results as summarized above. None of the individual factor alone influenced lipid efflux profile either to HDL or by lipid-free apoA-I. When the two growth factors were used in combinations, additional PMA caused prominent specific stimulation of cholesterol availability for lipid-free apoA-I-mediated lipid efflux while phospholipid efflux in this pathway was unchanged. Accordingly, this resulted in generating pre-β-HDL particles with higher cholesterol/phospholipids ratio than the particles generated with the non-stimulated cells. More interestingly, the enhancement of cholesterol efflux by the apoA-I-mediated by PMA was reversed by protein kinase C inhibitors. These effects were not observed in a nonspecific lipid efflux pathway. Thus, the apolipoprotein-mediated cellular lipid efflux pathway is well distinguished from a physicochemical pathway. The stimulation of cholesterol efflux was independent of interaction of the apolipoproteins with the cellular surface because phospholipid efflux was intact. Thus, incorporation of cholesterol molecule into the free apolipoprotein-mediated cellular lipid efflux pathway is regulated independently of the cell-apolipoprotein interaction and of generation of pre-β-HDL. From the fact that the stimulation was observed by the short term incubation with PMA and reversed by the protein kinase C inhibitors, it is fair to conclude that cholesterol enrichment in this pathway is regulated by a mechanism that involves protein kinase C at least in vascular smooth muscle cells. Thus, the mechanism of this increase is more specific than overall activation of lipid metabolism reported in the cells of dividing stage (Fielding et al., 1982). In fact, the possibility of protein kinase C involvement in cellular cholesterol efflux has been suggested in a few other previous works although in a more general manner (Theret et al., 1990; Mendez et al., 1991; Bernard et al., 1992; Voyno-Yasenetskaya et al., 1993). Our data including intracellular cholesterol esterification suggested that translocation of cholesterol from the pool available for the esterification to the specific pool readily available for the apolipoprotein-mediated efflux is induced by PMA and prevented by the protein kinase C inhibitor. This view may be consistent with the hypothesis proposed by Mendez et al.(1991). A more specific approach is required for further characterization of the reaction including phosphorylation of specific proteins. As discussed above, such specific translocation of cholesterol may result in general increase of cholesterol in the cell surface. However, the attempt of probing surface cholesterol by extracellular cholesterol oxidase failed to demonstrate any difference between the control and treated cells. Thus, overall surface cholesterol may not be a regulating factor for the cholesterol availability to apolipoprotein-mediated cellular lipid efflux unless this method may be inappropriate to probe the change of surface cholesterol correctly (Brasaemle and Attie, 1990; Liscum and Dahl, 1992). This may also be consistent with the unaffected nonspecific cellular lipid efflux from the stimulated smooth muscle cells. It should be noted that free/total cholesterol ratio in the cell was not changed by the growth factor treatment, suggesting no increase in overall intracellular free cholesterol pool by such a treatment. Thus, a concept of specific cholesterol pool available to the apolipoprotein-mediated efflux may have to be introduced to interpret these results, and the regulation would be strictly limited for such a specific cholesterol pool. This specific pool should be distinguishable from the cellular cholesterol pool that undergoes nonspecific exchange with lipoprotein surface. Stimulation of mouse macrophages by human PDGF, MCSF, and PMA, or combinations of these factors, did not demonstrate specific effect on lipid efflux mediated either by lipid-free apoA-I or HDL. This may not be consistent with the report that MCSF stimulated HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from human monocyte-derived macrophage (Ishibashi et al., 1990; Inoue et al., 1992). Although the general effect of human MCSF was demonstrated on mouse macrophage (Hume et al., 1988; Ishibashi et al., 1990), the effect may not be entirely similar between the species. Mouse macrophages are generally considered very active in comparison to other species so that they may already be in an activated stage and further activation may not be necessary to achieve the maximum cholesterol efflux level. The results of this study implicate the importance of specific cellular factors in regulation of cholesterol efflux by the lipid-free apolipoprotein-mediated pathway. It seems to be particularly important to investigate its regulation by intracellular trafficking of cholesterol in relation to such a factor as manipulation of cellular protein phosphorylation in order to understand the entire process. Since apolipoprotein-cell interaction seems to be a major source of plasma HDL (Francis et al., 1995), it is increasingly important to study the cellular factors involved in this reaction system.

Sci. 1990; 15: 139-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the case of Ras, this modification involves the attachment of the farnesyl group to the protein through a thioether linkage to a cysteine located four residues from the carboxyl terminus, followed by removal of the three carboxyl-terminal amino acids and methylation of the newly exposed α-carboxyl group of the farnesyl cysteine residue(12Clarke S.

Furthermore, the relative contribution of each of the processing steps is unknown. Previously we developed a cell-free assay system, derived from Xenopus laevis eggs, to identify a direct target molecule for Ras. In this system, Ras promotes the activation of MAP kinase through MAP kinase kinase/ERK kinase (MEK). Using this system, we have identified a Ras-dependent MEK kinase termed REKS (Ras-dependent ERK Kinase Stimulator)(18Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we have highly purified this protein and have determined that it is distinct from c-Raf-1, Mos, and mSte11, all of which are known to both phosphorylate and activate MEK (19Kuroda S.

Furthermore, c-Raf-1 partially purified by Mono-S chromatography from X. laevis eggs did not cause activation of MAP kinase either in the presence or the absence of Ras under these assay conditions(20Shimizu K.

In the earlier reports, we could not exclude the possibility that the unmodified Ras was denatured, nor was it possible to examine the individual processing steps of Ras (see above) to determine which of these steps provides the critical modification. Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate are from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Geranyl pyrophosphate, (7S)-6,7-dihydrofarnesol, and 6,7-10,11-tetrahydrofarnesol were gifts from R. B. Croteau (Washington State University), D. Cane (Brown University), and Hoffman La Roche (Basel), respectively. 10,11-Dihydrofarnesol and (Z)-3-methyl-2-dodecenol were synthesized by reducing the corresponding methyl esters with LiAlH4(24Eidem A. Buchecker R. Kjosen H. Liaaen-Jensen S. Acta Chem. Scand. B. 1975; 29: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The alcohols were converted to the pyrophosphates(25Cornforth R.H. Popjack G. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 15: 359-390Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and the products were purified by TLC using 1-propanol:concentrated NH4OH:water (6:3:1). The pyrophosphate esters were eluted from the TLC plates using 10 mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide containing approximately 0.5% concentrated ammonium hydroxide. The tetrabutylammonium hydroxide was removed by loading the sample on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters) washing with water and eluting with MeOH containing approximately 1% concentrated ammonium hydroxide. The methanolic solutions were concentrated to dryness and taken up in 5 mM NH4HCO3 containing approximately 0.8% added concentrated ammonium hydroxide. Bacterial H-Ras was prepared by a modification of the published procedure(26Gross M. Sweet R.W. Sathe G. Yokoyama S. Fasano O. Goldfarb M. Wigler M. Rosenberg M. Mol. Cell.

Frozen cells (27 g) were thawed on ice and lysed by sonication in 35 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol). All steps were carried out at 4°C. The 100,000 × g supernatant was diluted to 70 ml with buffer A and applied to a column of DEAE CL-6B (2.5 × 18 cm, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After washing with 100 ml of buffer A, the protein was eluted with a linear gradient (500 ml, 0-0.4 M NaCl in buffer A). H-Ras was located by protein-farnesyl transferase (PFT)-catalyzed incorporation of [1-3H]FPP(27Pompliano D.L. Rands E. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Anthony N.J. Gibbs J.B.

The protein was diluted with an equal volume of glycerol and stored at −20°C. GTP binding for location of H-Ras was done using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay with [guanosine-8-3H]GTP. Sample (5 μl) was incubated in buffer (100 μl) (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA) containing 10 μM [3H]GTP (406 mCi/mmol) for 20 min at 30°C. The assays were quenched with ice-cold MgCl2 buffer (200 μl) (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mM MgCl2) on ice and filtered over nitrocellulose (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) and washed extensively with MgCl2 buffer. The nitrocellulose was dissolved in ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, and the radioactivity bound was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. H-Ras protein (1 nmol) was incubated with recombinant PFT (0.25 nmol), obtained as described(29Chen W.J. Moomaw J.F. Overton L. Kost T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

Buffer exchange and removal of excess pyrophosphate ester were performed using a spin column of P-6 gel (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in column buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol). The eluant was diluted with an equal volume of column buffer containing 1.2% CHAPS. Geranylgeranylated H-Ras was produced by incubation of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and recombinant protein-geranylgeranyl transferase-I (obtained from P. Casey, Duke University) with bacterial H-Ras containing a modified carboxyl terminus (CVLL, obtained from P. Casey, Duke University). Eggs were obtained from fully mature X. laevis females and activated by electric shock (30Gerhart J. Wu M. Kirschner M. J.

Mono-Q purified REKS was incubated for 10 min at 30°C in a final volume of 50 μl containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 μM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 6 mM EGTA, 80 nM GST-MEK, and the indicated amounts of GTPgS•Ras or GDPβS•Ras (loading with nucleotide was as described(20Shimizu K.

The paper was washed with 75 mM phosphoric acid, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Recombinant GST-MEK and GST-MAP kinase were obtained as described(33Smith D.B.

Analysis for fatty acids was carried out on the various components of the system by negative ion, chemical ionization mass spectrometry after conversion to pentafluorobenzyl esters (35Kawahara F.K.

Heptadecanoic acid was added as an internal standard, and octadeutereo-arachadonic acid or 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine was added to some samples as an internal control. It has been proposed that the role of the farnesyl group is primarily to bind proteins to membranes(13Newman C.M.H. Magee A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 79-96PubMed Google Scholar). In the Ras- and Raf-dependent system, the primary function of Ras appears to be the recruitment of Raf to the plasma membrane, where this kinase is somehow activated through phosphorylation by an unknown kinase. Raf, in turn, activates the protein kinase MEK, which subsequently activates MAP kinase(7Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 8Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Although Raf has been identified as one of the downstream targets of Ras, recent evidence indicates that other targets exist(9Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 10Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L.

Biol. 1994; 4: 798-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In fact, Zheng et al.(40Zheng C.-F. Ohmichi M. Saltiel A.R. Guan K.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5595-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have presented evidence that the Raf pathway plays only a relatively minor role in the growth factor-induced activation of MEK and, subsequently, of MAP kinase. Hence, an important aspect of the present system is that it is membrane free. To confirm this, the various components of the cell-free system were analyzed for their membrane content. This was done by searching for the common fatty acid linolenic acid by negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Only a trace amount of this fatty acid was found, representing 1 nM or less in the final assay mixture, which is well below the concentration of H-Ras added to the assays, indicating that the assay mixture was virtually membrane free. For the present studies, we used REKS that was partially purified from X. laevis eggs by ion exchange chromatography to a completely soluble form to study the role of the farnesyl group of Ras in promoting the activation of MAP kinase. We have been able to quantitatively farnesylate recombinant H-Ras produced in Escherichia coli by incubation with FPP and recombinant PFT (Fig. 1). The unmodified H-Ras was prepared in such a way as to produce an intact carboxyl-terminal CVIS sequence, necessary for farnesylation. Lower than maximal incorporation of the farnesyl group into H-Ras is observed when using other procedures for isolating this protein, probably due to proteolytic damage at the carboxyl terminus. Using Mono-Q purified REKS, the GTPgS-bound form of non-prenylated H-Ras, even at high concentrations, does not detectably activate MAP kinase (Fig. 2, B and C). In marked contrast, farnesylated but otherwise unprocessed GTPgS•H-Ras, produced by the in vitro farnesylation of recombinant H-Ras, is as active as fully processed H-Ras or K-Ras in activating MAP kinase. Fully processed K-Ras was used as a standard to compare the activity of the modified H-Ras proteins due to the difficulty in purifying and handling fully processed H-Ras. However, fully processed H-Ras supports activation of MAP kinase, through REKS, to roughly the same extent as fully processed K-Ras (Fig. 2A). This result clearly shows that inactive unmodified H-Ras can be converted to a fully active form solely by farnesylation, and thus further processing (carboxyl-terminal proteolysis and methylation and palmitoylation) are not required. To determine if the precise structure of the farnesyl group is necessary for REKS-dependent activation of MAP kinase, a variety of farnesyl analogs (Fig. 1B) were also incorporated enzymatically into recombinant H-Ras (Fig. 1A). Using this method, the activity of these differently modified proteins toward the activation of MAP kinase in the cell-free system described above was examined (Fig. 2, B and C). H-Ras proteins containing the farnesyl analogs were able to support the activation of MAP kinase to variable extents. A significant dependence on the size of the prenyl group was observed (Fig. 2B); H-Ras bearing the longer 20-carbon geranylgeranyl group was the best activator, while H-Ras containing the shorter 10-carbon geranyl group was the least potent activator. With regard to the structurally modified farnesyl analogs, saturation of either of the more distal double bonds of the farnesyl group caused a small decrease in activity (Fig. 2C). H-Ras containing the (Z)-3-methyl-2-dodecenyl side chain was one of the least potent activators; this group, while the same length as the farnesyl group, structurally bears the least resemblance to the native lipid. The trend observed indicates that there is a component of specificity based on the prenyl structure of the side chain as well as a component based on hydrophobicity. Therefore, it appears that H-Ras, in this system, is interacting at least in part through its prenyl group with some soluble component or components of the MAP kinase activation system. As shown in Fig. 3, the GDPβS-bound form of farnesylated H-Ras is weakly stimulatory but does inhibit the stimulation of MAP kinase by farnesylated GTPgS•H-Ras, giving 50% inhibition at approximately 30 nM. Non-farnesylated GTPgS•H-Ras neither activates MAP kinase nor inhibits the activation of MAP kinase by farnesylated GTPgS•H-Ras. This result also suggests that the farnesyl group is needed for the binding of H-Ras to some protein component of the MAP kinase activation system. Based on the current studies it is concluded that inactive bacterially produced H-Ras can be converted to an active form solely by farnesylation using FPP and recombinant PFT. Our results indicate that farnesylation of Ras is the critical modification needed for the Ras- and REKS-dependent activation of MAP kinase and that further processing (proteolysis, methylation, and palmitoylation) is not necessary for this aspect of Ras function. This is demonstrated by the results showing that the farnesylated but otherwise unprocessed H-Ras is comparable to fully processed K-Ras or H-Ras in its ability to stimulate MAP kinase in this system. This is further illustrated by the inability of non-farnesylated H-Ras to either stimulate the activity or to inhibit the activity caused by the farnesylated H-Ras. It appears that the dependence of REKS-mediated stimulation of MAP kinase by Ras on the farnesyl group arises from a fairly nonspecific hydrophobic interaction of the prenyl group with some soluble component of the system. The various analogs of the farnesyl group, when incorporated into H-Ras, cause only relatively small changes in the extent of activation. We have recently purified a REKS activity from bovine brain cytosol. The bovine REKS was found to be a complex of three proteins, one of which was B-Raf(41Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Fukui K. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11723-11726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). While the Xenopus REKS did not cross-react with anti-B-Raf antibody(18Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we cannot rule out that Xenopus REKS is an isoform of Raf. Clearly, the interaction of this protein with Ras is different than that previously described for Raf(7Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 8Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Unlike the membrane binding function of Ras described previously, the effects of farnesylation in this system are not the result of membrane binding, as no membranes are present in the assay. Moreover, if the role of the farnesyl group in the H-Ras- and REKS-dependent activation of MAP kinase is only to bind H-Ras to membranes or other possible interfaces in this in vitro system, the level of maximal activation caused by all of the lipidated H-Ras proteins should be the same; the results in Fig. 2 clearly show that this is not the case. Taken together, the data strongly suggest that there is a direct interaction of the farnesyl group of H-Ras either with REKS, or with an as yet undetermined soluble component of the system, and that the activation of MAP kinase, in this system, is not dependent on the binding of Ras to membranes. Alternatively, prenylation may cause a structural change in Ras, which allows it to interact with its target protein. In any case, these experiments demonstrate a role for the prenyl group of Ras, which is distinct from that of a simple membrane anchor and is more similar to the prenyl protein-protein interaction model described for heterotrimeric G proteins in which the prenyl group appears to play a crucial role in subunit interaction(16Higgins J.B.

https://openalex.org/W2039180413,"Insulin causes the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) through complexation of tyrosine-phosphorylated YMXM motifs on insulin receptor substrate 1 with the Src homology 2 domains of PI 3-kinase. Previous studies with inhibitors have indicated that activation of PI 3-kinase is necessary for the stimulation of glucose transport in adipocytes. Here, we investigate whether this activation is sufficient for this effect. Short peptides containing two tyrosine-phosphorylated or thiophosphorylated YMXM motifs potently activated PI 3-kinase in the cytosol from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Introduction of the phosphatase-resistant thiophosphorylated peptide into 3T3-L1 adipocytes through permeabilization with Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin stimulated PI 3-kinase as strongly as insulin. However, under the same conditions the peptide increased glucose transport into the permeabilized cells only 20% as well as insulin. Determination of the distribution of the glucose transporter isotype GLUT4 by confocal immunofluorescence showed that GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane can account for the effect of the peptide. These results suggest that one or more other insulin-triggered signaling pathways, besides the PI 3-kinase one, participate in the stimulation of glucose transport."

INTRODUCTIONThe fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1The abbreviations used are: FGFfibroblast growth factorHSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycansHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl. family consists of at least nine structurally related proteins(1Burgess W.H.

Two of these proteins, FGF-1 and FGF-2, have been characterized under many different names, most often as acidic FGF and basic FGF, respectively. Although there is a large amount of overlap in the spectrum of biological activities and receptor-binding properties of the FGFs, the only known function shared by all members of the family is a relatively high affinity for heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). It has been established that heparin can potentiate the mitogenic activity of FGF-1 (4Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J.

In addition, heparin increases the apparent affinity of FGF-1 for high affinity FGF receptors(10Schreiber A.B. Kenney J. Kowalski W.J. Friesel R. Mehlman T. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, an obligatory role for heparin or HSPGs in mediating the binding of FGF-1 or FGF-2 to the high affinity, tyrosine kinase receptors has been suggested(12Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D.

It has also been reported that cell surface HSPGs are capable of binding and internalizing FGF-2(18Moscatelli D. Flaumenhaft R. Saksela O. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 638: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A direct role of HSPG-bound FGF in mediating the various functions of this growth factor family has not been established.We reported previously that a change of lysine 132 in FGF-1 to a glutamic acid (K132E) by site-directed mutagenesis reduced the apparent affinity of the recombinant protein for heparin(4Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The K132E mutant is fully capable of binding to and activating the high-affinity tyrosine kinase FGF receptors and can induce transcription of a variety of immediate-early genes(19Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This mutant is, however, an extremely poor mitogen for all cells tested(4Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Together these results indicate that modulation of the heparin or HSPG binding properties of the FGFs could result in the development of specific agonists or antagonists of their functions. For example, FGF-1 is highly dependent on the presence of exogenous heparin for its mitogenic activity(19Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, exogenous heparin is not required for FGF-1-induced mesoderm formation in Xenopus animal cap assays(20Slack J.M.W. Isaacs H.V. Darlington B.G. Development. 1988; 103: 581-590PubMed Google Scholar).To date there are no reports on the identification of a heparin-binding domain of any member of the FGF family using direct assays. We reported previously that a peptide corresponding to residues 49-71 of human FGF-1 could compete with full-length FGF-1 for binding of 125I-fluorescein-heparin(21Mehlman T. Burgess W.H. Anal.

These studies suffered from the use of modified heparin in an indirect assay; furthermore, we were not able to demonstrate direct binding of this peptide to immobilized heparin. Baird et al.(22Baird A. Schubert D. Ling N. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2324-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) were able to demonstrate binding of [3H]heparin to certain peptides derived from the sequence of FGF-2 after the peptides were baked onto nitrocellulose filters. Two regions of heparin binding activity were identified corresponding to residues 32-76 and 101-128 of the human FGF-2 sequence.Several consensus sequences of heparin-binding regions in a variety of proteins have been proposed(23Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Google Scholar, 24Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). These include the motifs XBBXBX and XBBBXXBX, where B is a basic amino acid and X is a hydropathic residue. Analysis of the primary sequence of FGF-1 revealed three regions that are in good agreement with the proposed consensus sequences(23Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Google Scholar). These include residues 22-27, 113-120, and 124-131. Lysine 132 falls just outside of the latter sequence, yet its modification reduces significantly the apparent affinity of FGF-1 for immobilized heparin(19Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Harper J.W. Lobb R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A basic residue in this position following the XBBBXXBX consensus is not common among known heparin-binding proteins(23Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Google Scholar, 24Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Whereas the existence of multiple heparin-binding domains centered around clusters of basic amino acids seems consistent with the fact that heparin is able to protect the majority of the FGF-1 protein from digestion with trypsin(7Rosengart T.K. Johnson W.V. Friesel R. Clark R. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 432-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), it does not appear to be consistent with the dramatic reduction in heparin affinity exhibited by the lysine 132 mutant(19Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Margalit et al.(26Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported a more stringent approach to the analysis of heparin-binding domains concentrating on sequences of heparin-binding proteins with established three-dimensional structures. They concluded that basic residues in human FGF-1 corresponding to positions 126 and 133 of the full-length sequence satisfied the spatial requirements of basic amino acids at opposite ends of a β-strand fold in their model. This result implicates residues 126 and 133 as crucial to heparin binding. It should be noted, however, that residue 133 in bovine and chicken FGF-1 is occupied by leucine(27Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Winkles J.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).We examined the role of additional basic amino acids in these three putative heparin binding domains by site-directed mutagenesis. The apparent affinities of the FGF-1 mutants were compared with that of wild-type protein by affinity-based chromatography. Synthetic peptides corresponding to regions of the wild-type and mutant sequences were synthesized, and their apparent affinities for heparin were determined. The results of these studies indicate that 1) a specific peptide with relatively high apparent affinity for heparin can be identified within the sequence of FGF-1 and 2) the role of clusters of basic amino acid residues in heparin binding is more subtle than predicted by the consensus sequence models. The results are consistent with predictions based on the crystal structure of FGF-1 (28Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham S. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1991; 251: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and suggest a mechanism by which heparin protects the protein from degradation by trypsin. In addition, the identification of a heparin-binding domain in FGF-1 can serve as a basis for the development of peptide based antagonists of its function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHeparin-Sepharose, the pKK233 expression vector, and low molecular weight protein markers were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.

Other chemicals were reagent grade.Construction of Wild-type and Mutant FGF-1 Prokaryotic Expression PlasmidsThe plasmids expressing wild-type or mutant human FGF-1 were constructed exactly as described previously(19Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The plasmid expressing wild-type bovine FGF-1 was constructed as follows. First, a bovine FGF-1 cDNA fragment was isolated using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique. RNA was isolated from bovine heart tissue (Pel Freeze, Roger, AR) using RNAzol (Tel Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μg of RNA was converted into cDNA as described previously(29Winkles J.A. Gay C.G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 531-540PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot was used for the polymerase chain reaction. These reactions were performed using human FGF-1 sense and antisense primers as described previously(29Winkles J.A. Gay C.G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 531-540PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to 35 cycles of amplification using a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermocycler. Each cycle included denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 58°C for 30 s, and primer extension at 72°C for 30 s.An aliquot of the amplification mixture was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and the 489-base pair bovine FGF-1 DNA fragment was excised and purified by Geneclean (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA). BamHI and NdeI restriction sites were introduced at the 5′ end, and a BamHI site at the 3′ end of the cDNA fragment using polymerase chain reaction with the following primers: 5′-ACCTGGGATCCCATATGAATTACAAGAAG-3′ (sense), 5′-CAACAGGGATCCTTAATCAGAGGAGAC-3′ (antisense).The resulting fragment was digested with BamHI, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised from the gel, purified by Geneclean, and subcloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript sk+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After ligation and transformation, 10 colonies were isolated. Plasmid DNA from each colony was purified, and the sequence of the cDNA inserts was obtained by the Sanger dideoxy sequencing method using a Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Co.). The bovine FGF-1 cDNA was then subcloned into the expression vector pET3c(30Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). This construct was used to transform BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli cells(30Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). Production and purification of the recombinant proteins was performed as described previously(31Jaye M. Burgess W.H. Shaw A.B. Drohan W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16612-16617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Heparin-binding Properties of Wild-type and Mutant FGF-1sCultures of the E. coli strain JM103 bearing recombinant plasmids were grown at 37°C in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. A fresh overnight culture was diluted and grown until the absorbance reached 0.2 at 550 nm. Isopropylthiol β galactoside was then added to 1 mM, and the cultures were incubated at 37°C for an additional 2 h. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and frozen at −80°C. Frozen pellets from 2 liters of culture were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM glucose, pH 7.4. Egg lysozyme was added to 10 μg/ml. The cells were incubated at 4°C for 45 min and then sonicated at maximum intensity for 30 s using the large probe of a Heat System 380 sonicator. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatants were diluted to 100 ml with 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 (buffer A) and applied to a Bio-Rad heparin cartridge using a Waters Associates HPLC system. Samples were eluted with a linear gradient of buffer A and buffer A containing 1.2 M NaCl. Flow was 1 ml/min, and 1-min fractions were collected.Western Blot AnalysisAliquots of the fractions eluted from the heparin cartridge were subjected to electrophoresis using the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system of Laemmli(32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). A 15% acrylamide, 0.4% N,N‘-methylenebisacrylamide solution was polymerized in a Hoefer Mini-gel apparatus, and electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V. Proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose, and FGF-1 containing fractions were identified using rabbit polyclonal FGF-1-specific antibodies and 125I-protein A as described previously(19Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Peptide Synthesis and CharacterizationPeptides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 431A peptide synthesizer and small scale Fmoc cycles supplied by the manufacturer. Peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and the ratio of their absorbance at 280 and 215 nm was monitored to evaluate removal of side chain protection groups. Purified peptides were analyzed further by amino acid analysis using a Waters Associates Pico Tag system and amino acid sequencing using an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer with on-line phenylthiohydantoin derivative analyzer as described previously(33Hampton B.S. Marshak D.R. Burgess W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Aliquots of each peptide were dried in a Savant Speed Vac resuspended in water, mixed with buffer A, and applied to a heparin column. The relative affinities of the synthetic peptides for immobilized heparin were determined as described above for recombinant FGFs using UV absorption to monitor the eluants. The peptides corresponding to residues 122-137 with substitutions at residue 131 were made using a cartridge containing a mixture of 10 different Fmoc amino acids at the appropriate position in each of two syntheses.Mitogenic AssaysBalb MK cells were grown to ˜80% confluence at 37°C in 48-well plates containing Eagle's minimal essential medium, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. The cells were serum starved in a 1:1 mix of Ham's F-12 and Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 5 μg/ml transferin and 3 × 10-8M selenium for 72 h. Growth factors were added directly to the starvation media. After 20 h, the cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml). The cells were harvested 4 h later, and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was measured as described previously(19Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were grown to ˜80% confluence at 37°C in 48-well plates containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and L-glutamine (2 mM). The cells were starved for 24 h in the same media containing 0.5% calf serum. Stimulation of DNA synthesis was assayed as described above.Receptor Binding AssayNIH 3T3 cells overexpressing FGF receptor-1 (flg) were prepared as described previously(11Kaplow J.M. Bellot F. Crumley G. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to ˜80% confluence at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), and 500 μg/ml G418. Cells were starved in the same media except the serum was reduced to 0.5% and G418 was omitted. FGF-1 was iodinated using chloramine T. Labeled protein was isolated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Cells were incubated with 125I-FGF-1 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled wild-type or mutant proteins for 90 min at 4°C in binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 5 units/ml heparin). Cells were washed 3 times with binding buffer and solubilized in 0.5 N NaOH, and bound FGF was quantitated by γ counting.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe apparent affinities of wild-type and various mutants of FGF-1 for immobilized heparin were examined by chromatography using defined NaCl gradient elution and Western blot analysis of the eluted fractions. Lysine residues corresponding to positions in putative consensus sequences for heparin binding (23Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Google Scholar, 24Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) were changed to glycine residues by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1). The range of mutants covered every dibasic cluster in FGF-1 as well as other residues predicted to play a role in heparin binding(23Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Google Scholar, 24Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). We reported previously that a change of lysine 132 to a glutamic acid residue significantly reduced the apparent affinity of FGF-1 for immobilized heparin(19Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A similar reduction in affinity is observed when lysine 132 is changed to a glycine residue (Fig. 2). Of the eight lysines replaced in the present study, only a change of lysine 127 resulted in a similar reduction in heparin affinity (Fig. 2). A change in the adjacent lysine 126 to a glycine residue does not produce a large reduction in heparin affinity, and changes in lysines 114 or 115 results in a small reduction in heparin affinity. Changes of lysines 23, 24, or 26 to glycine residues has no effect on the heparin-binding activity of FGF-1 (Fig. 2). Together these results indicate that of the three putative heparin-binding domains of FGF-1 predicted by consensus sequence analysis(23Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Google Scholar, 24Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), changes of the lysine residues in one region (residues 22-27) have no effect on heparin binding, whereas changes in another (residues 113-120) result in a minor reduction in heparin-binding, and whereas changes in a third (residues 124-132) can have significant and varying effects on heparin-binding. We cannot rule out the possibility that the drastic loss of heparin affinity exhibited by the residue 127 and residue 132 mutations is not due to an alteration in the folding or stability of the mutant protein. Both mutants are, however, able to compete equally with wild-type FGF-1 for binding to cells overexpressing FGF receptor-1 (Fig. 3). The binding was done in the presence of exogenous heparin to inhibit binding to cell surface HSPGs.Figure 2Heparin-binding properties of wild-type and sitedirected point mutants of human FGF-1. Recombinant wild-type and mutant proteins were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lysates of E. coli producing the various FGF-1 forms were subjected to heparin affinity-based chromatography using a linear gradient of 0-1.2 M NaCl. Eluted fractions were examined for FGF-1 immunoreactivity by Western blot analysis. Autoradiograms of selected fractions for the indicated proteins (wild-type or mutant) are shown along with the range of NaCl concentrations sufficient for FGF-1 elution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Ability of wild-type and mutant FGF-1 to compete with 125I-labeled wild-type protein for binding to NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing human FGF receptor-1 (flg).

The site-directed mutagenesis studies described above indicated that a change of lysines 126, 127, or 132 resulted in the largest reduction in apparent affinity of FGF-1 for heparin. A peptide corresponding to residues 122-137 of the human sequence (peptide 1 in Fig. 1) was synthesized, and its apparent affinity for immobilized heparin was examined. As shown in Fig. 4, this peptide exhibited a reasonably high apparent affinity for heparin (elution at ˜0.3 M NaCl). In contrast, peptide 2 (residues 15-29), which exhibits a similar distribution of basic residues as peptide 1, did not bind to the heparin column at all (data not shown). This result was consistent with the site-directed mutagenesis that showed substitution of lysines 23, 24, or 26 was without affect on the heparin affinity of FGF-1. Furthermore, mutation of lysines 114 or 115 was shown to have a slight affect on the affinity of FGF-1 heparin, and extension of peptide 1 to include these residues (peptide 3, Fig. 1) resulted in a small increase in the apparent affinity of the synthetic peptide for heparin (Fig. 4). The peak of absorbance eluting at ˜0.7 M NaCl is likely to represent a disulfide-linked dimer of peptide 3 as judged by the fact that we were not able to derivatize its cysteine residue without prior reduction. In contrast, extension of peptide 1 by the same amount in the C-terminal direction did not increase the apparent affinity of the peptide for heparin (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that a relatively short linear sequence within the primary structure of human FGF-1 that has a relatively high affinity for heparin can be identified. Furthermore, the studies with synthetic peptides overall correlate well with site-directed mutagenesis experiments.Figure 4UV absorbance profiles of heparin affinity-based chromatography of various synthetic peptides corresponding to regions of FGF-1 sequences. The chromatography conditions were identical to those described in Fig. 2. Panel A shows the elution profile of a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 122-137 of human FGF-1. Panel B shows the elution profile of a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 114-137 of human FGF-1.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W2018155489,"The extracellular portion of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor has a mosaic structure of six domains (each approximately 100 amino acid residues) consisting of an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain, a cytokine receptor homologous region subdivided into amino-terminal (BN) and carboxyl-terminal (BC) domains, and three fibronectin type III repeats. In the present study, we expressed the Ig-BN and the BN-BC regions and purified them to homogeneity as monomers using G-CSF affinity column chromatography. Using gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography, we investigated the molecular composition of receptor-ligand complexes formed between G-CSF and purified BN-BC or Ig-BN domains. In contrast to the well characterized example of the human growth hormone (GH) receptor, in which the BN-BC•GH complex shows a 2:1 receptor-ligand complex stoichiometry, the BN-BC domain of the G-CSF receptor formed a 1:1 complex. The isolated Ig-BN domain also formed a 1:1 complex with G-CSF. However, in the presence of both Ig-BN and BN-BC domains, we detected a 1:1:1 Ig-BN•G-CSF•BN-BC complex corresponding to the 2:1 receptor:ligand stoichiometry. These results suggest that 1) the Ig domain and both the BN and the BC domains are required for oligomerization of the G-CSF receptor, 2) G-CSF contains two binding sites for its receptor, and 3) there are two ligand binding sites on the G-CSF receptor, one site on the BN-BC domain and one on the Ig-BN domain.

INTRODUCTIONLigand-induced receptor oligomerization has been proposed as the key mechanism of signal transduction for some families of single transmembrane receptors, such as cytokine receptors and tyrosine kinase-type receptors (Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990; Wells et al., 1993; Heldin, 1995). In these models, the oligomerization of the extracellular regions, induced by ligand binding, is followed by the activation of their cytoplasmic regions. The extracellular regions of these receptors generally have a composite structure containing multiple domains (Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990; Bazan, 1990; Miyajima et al., 1992; Heldin, 1995), which are presumed to play important roles in ligand-induced oligomerization. Investigation of the molecular properties of purified extracellular domains is a prerequisite for understanding mechanisms of receptor oligomerization that culminate in the transductions of external signals.The extracellular region (˜600 amino acid residues) of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 1The abbreviations used are: G-CSFgranulocyte colony-stimulating factorBN domainamino-terminal domain of the cytokine receptor homologous regionBC domaincarboxyl-terminal domain of the cytokine receptor homologous regionCRHcytokine receptor homologousGHgrowth hormoneHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyIgimmunoglobulin-likePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisChaps3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. receptor is composed of an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain, a cytokine receptor homologous (CRH) region, and three fibronectin type III-like domains (Fukunaga et al., 1990b, 1990c). The Ig domain (˜100 amino acid residues) was originally defined by its homology to the immunoglobulin superfamily (Williams and Barclay, 1988). Though a number of receptors, including those for several cytokines, such as G-CSF, interleukin 6, and ciliary neurotrophic factor, contain Ig domains (Fukunaga et al., 1990b, 1990c; Larsen et al., 1990; Yamasaki et al., 1988: Davis et al., 1991), little is known about their function. A deletion derivate of the G-CSF receptor lacking the Ig domain retained ligand binding activity, although the dissociation constant (Kd) value of the mutant was 10-20-fold higher than that of the intact receptor (Fukunaga et al., 1991). The CRH region (˜200 amino acid residues) was originally defined by its striking homology to the predicted ligand binding domains of the receptors for various cytokines, such as interleukins 2-7, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, erythropoietin, growth hormone (GH), and prolactin (Bazan, 1990) receptors. The CRH region consists of an amino-terminal (BN; ˜100 amino acid residues) domain containing four conserved cysteine residues and a carboxyl-terminal (BC; ˜100 amino acid residues) domain containing a “WSXWS” motif (Bazan, 1990). Earlier work has identified high affinity oligomers of the G-CSF receptor on the surface of mouse myeloid leukemia cells (Fukunaga et al., 1990a), and mutational analyses showed that deletion of the BN domain completely abolishes ligand binding activity (Fukunaga et al., 1991). As a first step toward studying its molecular properties, we expressed the gene encoding the BN domain as a minimal binding unit, using an Escherichia coli maltose binding protein fusion system (Hiraoka et al., 1994a). This purified, small domain still retained ligand binding activity but did not form oligomers, such as dimers or tetramers (Hiraoka et al., 1994a), suggesting that a larger binding unit is required for G-CSF receptor oligomerization. As a second approach, we expressed a three-domain binding unit consisting of Ig-BN-BC regions (˜300 amino acid residues; indicated as Ig-CRH in Hiraoka et al. (1994b)) using an insect Trichoplusia ni cell-baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus system. The purified Ig-BN-BC protein retained high ligand binding activity and formed dimers and tetramers in the presence of G-CSF (Hiraoka et al., 1994b). These studies indicated the involvement of the Ig or BC regions in receptor oligomerization and suggested that expression of tandem Ig-BN or BN-BC domains might permit functional dissection of the oligomerization process.In the present study, we describe expression of the Ig-BN and the BN-BC domains of the G-CSF receptor in insect cells using a baculovirus system. Isolated Ig-BN and BN-BC domains did not form homo-oligomers in the presence of ligand, although these products did form 1:1 binary complexes with G-CSF. However, the combined Ig-BN and the BN-BC domains formed a 1:1:1 Ig-BN•G-CSF•BN-BC complex, which is consistent with binding of a single molecule of G-CSF ligand by a dimeric receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProduction of Recombinant Baculoviruses Carrying the Genes Encoding the Ig-BN and the BN-BC Domains of the G-CSF ReceptorThe Ig, BN, and BC domains contain 4, 6, and 4 cysteine residues, respectively (Fukunaga et al., 1990b; Seto et al., 1992). Since an insect baculovirus A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus secretion system has recently been developed for the efficient secretion of such cysteine-rich proteins, (Luckow and Summers, 1988; Ota et al., 1991; Hiraoka et al., 1994b), the Ig-BN and the BN-BC proteins (each ˜200 amino acids) were secreted using the recombinant baculoviruses AcIg-BN and AcBN-BC. DNA encoding the murine Ig-BN domain of the G-CSF receptor (Fig. 1A) and its signal sequence was generated by the polymerase chain reaction amplification of plasmid pBLJ17, which bears the cDNA for the murine G-CSF receptor (Fukunaga et al., 1990b). The 5′-sense primer had the sequence (primer 1) 5′-CGGGATCCATGGTAGGGCTGGGAGCCTG-3′, which contains a BamHI site (underlined) at the amino terminus, followed by the coding sequence for the murine G-CSF receptor starting from Met-25. The 3′-antisense primer has the sequence 5′-GCTCTAGATTATTTCACAACATCCATGGGGTCGAG-3′, which corresponds to the sequence for the carboxyl-terminal part of the Ig-BN domain, terminated at Lys202 and followed by a stop codon and an XbaI site (underlined). Thus, the resultant fragment contains the signal sequence (Met-25-Ser-1)and the Ig-BN domain (Cys1-Lys202) of the murine G-CSF receptor. The fragment was digested with BamHI and XbaI and was used for the construction of the transfer vector, pAcIg-BN.A DNA fragment corresponding to the BN-BC portion of the murine G-CSF receptor (Fig. 1A) and its signal sequence was generated from plasmid pBOSdIg, encoding a deletion mutant GΔ(5-84), which lacks Glu5-Ser84 of the Ig domain (Fukunaga et al., 1991). To mutate Cys1 to Ser1 in the residual portion of the Ig domain of the GΔ(5-84) mutant, two polymerase chain reaction fragments (fragment N and fragment C) were initially generated, using pBOSdIg as the template. Fragment N corresponds to the G-CSF receptor from the amino terminus to Val85, including the signal sequence and the deleted part of the Ig domain. Primer 1 above was used for the 5′-primer. The 3′-antisense primer has the sequence 5′-GGACGCCGATGTGTCCAGAGCTCTCCAGACTTCTGGGGAG-3′, which corresponds to the sequence from Leu-7 to Ile4, and the anti-codon Val85, in which the anticodon ACA for Cys1 was replaced with AGA (underlined) for Ser. Fragment C corresponds to the sequence from Leu-3 to Ala309 of the deletion mutant cDNA GΔ(5-84), followed by a stop codon. The 5′-primer has the sequence 5′-CTGGAGAGCTCTGGACACATCGGCGTCCAACTCCTG-3′, which contains the coding sequence from Leu-3 to Ile4 and from Val85 to Ala309, in which the codon TGT for Cys1 was replaced with TCT (underlined) for Ser. The 3′-antisense primer (primer 2) has the sequence 5′-GCTCTAGATTAGGCCTTCATGGTAGGCCTCA-3′, which corresponds to the sequence for the carboxyl-terminal part of the BN-BC domain, terminated at Ala309 and followed by a stop codon and an XbaI site (underlined). To amplify the full-length BN-BC DNA, small amounts of fragments N and C were used as the template for a second round of the polymerase chain reaction, using primer 1 as the 5′-primer and primer 2 as the 3′-primer, respectively. Thus, the resulting fragment contains the signal sequence (Met-25-Ser-1), part of the Ig domain (Ser-Gly2-His3-Ile4 and Val85-Gly96), and the BN-BC domain (Tyr97-Ala309) of the murine G-CSF receptor. After digestion with BamHI and XbaI, the resultant fragment was used for the transfer vector, pAcBN-BC.The transfer vectors pAcIg-BN and pAcBN-BC were obtained by the insertion of these amplified DNA fragments within the BamHI/XbaI sites of plasmid pVL1393 (Invitrogen), which carries part of the genome of the A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus. The BamHI/XbaI sites in pVL1393 are downstream of the polyhedrin promoter. The recombinant viruses AcIg-BN and AcBN-BC, carrying the Ig-BN and the BN-BC genes, were produced by in vivo homologous DNA recombination using the transfer vectors pAcIg-BN and pAcBN-BC, as described (Summers and Smith, 1988; Ota et al., 1991).Expression and Purification of the Ig-BN and the BN-BC Domains of the G-CSF ReceptorThe Ig-BN and the BN-BC domains were expressed using the recombinant viruses AcIg-BN and AcBN-BC. T. ni cells (Invitrogen; HIGH FIVE™ cells) were infected with recombinant viruses and were cultured for 9 days at 18°C. The culture fluids were applied to a G-CSF affinity column (1 cm, inner diameter, × 5 cm), and the Ig-BN and the BN-BC proteins were eluted by a glycine-HCl, pH 2.0, buffer. The affinity-purified proteins were then chromatographed by gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (7.6 mm, inner diameter, x 60 cm; TSKgel G3000SW; TOSO Co., Ltd) as described (Hiraoka et al. 1994b). For further purification, the Ig-BN fraction was applied to a DEAE HPLC column (4.6 mm, inner diameter, × 25 cm; TSKgel DEAE-2SW; TOSO Co., Ltd) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. Ig-BN was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.4 M.G-CSF Binding to the Ig-BN and the BN-BC Domains of the G-CSF ReceptorThe assay used to quantitate G-CSF binding to the BN-BC domain of the G-CSF receptor was essentially that described by Fukunaga et al. (1990a). The BN-BC domain was mixed with various concentrations (10 pM to 1 nM) of 125I-labeled G-CSF (Amersham International plc) in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.1% Chaps in the presence or absence of 500 nM unlabeled G-CSF. The binding reaction proceeded for 90 min at room temperature. After the incubation, the BN-BC portion of the G-CSF receptor•G-CSF complex was precipitated with carrier protein (γ-globulin) and anti-M1 serum specific for the CRH region of the G-CSF receptor (Fukunaga et al., 1991) by 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000. The radioactivity in the precipitate was measured using a γ-counter (Packard, AUTO-GAMMA model A5002 COBRA). The 125I-G-CSF binding assays used to establish the complexes of the Ig-BN or the BN-BC domains of the G-CSF receptor with G-CSF were performed by means of gel filtration HPLC, as described (Hiraoka et al., 1994b).Production and Purification of the BN-BC Domain of the GH ReceptorThe BN-BC domain of the human GH receptor corresponds to its entire extracellular region (Bazan, 1990). Production and purification of the BN-BC domain of the GH receptor, using the insect baculovirus system, were performed according to the procedure described for the extracellular region of the human GH receptor (Ota et al., 1991). In the present study, the DNA sequence encoding Met-18-Leu233 of the human GH receptor (Leung et al., 1987) followed by a stop codon, TAA, comprised the BN-BC domain sequence of the GH receptor.RESULTSExpression and Purification of the Ig-BN ProteinThe purified Ig-BN protein migrated as a homogeneous 33-kDa band during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 1B). Western blotting using anti-M1 serum specific for the CRH region of the G-CSF receptor (Fukunaga et al., 1991) identified the same 33-kDa band (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified 33-kDa protein ((Cys)-Gly-His-Ile-Glu-Ile-), identified by direct sequencing on an automated gas phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer equipped with a model 120A PTH analyzer), corresponded precisely to that of the amino terminus of the G-CSF receptor, as deduced from the murine G-CSF receptor sequence (Fukunaga et al., 1990b; Hiraoka et al., 1994b). These results confirmed that the purified product was the Ig-BN protein. The position of the eluted peak at 35 kDa by gel-filtration HPLC indicated that the purified Ig-BN protein existed as a monomer. Approximately 50 μg of the purified Ig-BN protein was obtained per liter of culture.The molecular mass of the Ig-BN protein, identified by SDS-PAGE and gel-filtration HPLC, is larger than the molecular mass of 23 kDa deduced from the Ig-BN protein sequence (Cys1-Lys202) (Fukunaga et al., 1990b; Seto et al., 1992). The discrepancy between the observed and predicted molecular masses is most likely due to glycosylation. The Ig-BN protein has three potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites, which are conserved between the murine and human G-CSF receptors (Fukunaga et al., 1990b, 1990c). The 33-kDa band identified by Western blotting of the culture fluid was not detected when tunicamycin, a glycosylation inhibitor, was added to the culture medium after infection, supporting the proposed glycosylation of the Ig-BN protein. When Western blotting of the culture fluid was performed under nonreducing conditions, we noted that the 33-kDa band was less abundant and that most anti-M1 reactive material migrated at more than 100 kDa. Presumably, most native Ig-BN molecules are secreted into the culture fluid as large molecular weight aggregates due to the effects of random disulfide bond formation, and only the 33-kDa monomeric form, which bound to the G-CSF affinity column, was purified. The far UV CD spectrum of the Ig-BN protein (Fig. 2A) exhibited positive ellipticity at 230 nm and negative ellipticity around 210 nm. The extracellular region of the human GH receptor (Fig. 2D) (Bass et al., 1991) showed a very similar CD spectrum, suggesting that the purified Ig-BN protein has a GH receptor-like structure. These results are consistent with the spectra of the Ig-BN-BC region (Fig. 2C; Hiraoka et al., 1994b) and the BN domain (Hiraoka et al., 1994a).Figure 2Far-UV CD spectra of the Ig-BN, the BN-BC, and the Ig-BN-BC regions of the G-CSF receptor and the BN-BC portion of the GH receptor. The CD spectrum was measured on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd.) at 20°C with solutions in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.093 mg/ml Ig-BN protein (A), 0.11 mg/ml BN-BC protein (B), and 0.12 mg/ml of Ig-BN-BC protein (C) (Hiraoka et al., 1994b) of the G-CSF receptor and 0.10 mg/ml of the BN-BC protein of the GH receptor (D; indicated as hGH-R; Ota et al., 1991). The optical path length was 1 mm for the far ultraviolet CD spectra. The mean residue ellipticity, [⊘]φ, has units of deg cm2 dmol-1. The purified protein concentrations were calculated from the absorption at 280 nm (A2800.1% values of 1.3, Ig-BN; 2.2, BN-BC; and 1.9, Ig-BN-BC domains of the G-CSF receptor, and 2.3, BN-BC portion of the GH receptor). This value was calculated using 1,576 M-1•cm-1 for tyrosine and 5,225 M-1•cm-1 for tryptophan at 280 nm (Goodwin and Morton, 1946).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression and Purification of the BN-BC ProteinTo purify the BN-BC protein, we used the recombinant baculovirus AcBN-BC, which was constructed from the plasmid pBOSdIg, harboring the mutated murine cDNA GΔ(5-84). GΔ(5-84) encodes the BN-BC portion but lacks most of the Ig domain. The GΔ(5-84) mutant receptor was shown to retain significant ligand binding activity when expressed on the surface of mammalian cells, despite the absence of an intact Ig region (Fukunaga et al., 1991). The GΔ(5-84) mutation removes all but 16 amino acid residues (Cys1-Ile4, Val85-Gly96) of the Ig domain. The Cys1-Ile4, Val85-Gly96 interval was postulated to contain the amino terminus of the adjacent BN-BC domain (Tyr97-Ala309), based on the exon-intron organization of the G-CSF receptor gene (Seto et al., 1992; Hiraoka et al., 1994b). In the construction of the recombinant baculovirus AcBN-BC, we replaced Cys1, which lies within the Cys1-Ile4, Val85-Gly96 interval, with Ser1 in the mutant GΔ(5-84) in order to prevent formation of disulfide bonds in the BN-BC protein. The purified BN-BC protein eluted at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of 27 kDa. The eluted material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and revealed a nearly homogenous 32-kDa band (Fig. 1C). Western blotting identified the same 32-kDa band (Fig. 1C). These data strongly suggested that the purified product corresponds to a BN-BC protein monomer. The molecular masses of 32 kDa (SDS-PAGE) and 27 kDa (gel filtration) of the purified BN-BC protein appear larger than the molecular mass of 24 kDa deduced from the predicted BN-BC protein sequence (Ala95-Ala309) (Fukunaga et al., 1990b; Seto et al., 1992). However, the BN-BC protein has one potential Asn-linked glycosylation site (Fukunaga et al., 1990b, 1990c) conserved between the murine and the human cDNAs, suggesting, like the Ig-BN unit, that the BN-BC protein is glycosylated in insect cells. Consistent with this notion, tunicamycin treatment resulted in disappearance of the 32-kDa band on Western blots (data not shown). About 2.5 mg of purified BN-BC protein was obtained per liter of culture.A Scatchard analysis of the 125I-G-CSF binding data revealed that the BN-BC protein has a Kd of about 2.5 × 10-9M. The far UV CD spectrum of the BN-BC protein (Fig. 2B) was similar to those of the Ig-BN domain and the human GH receptor (Fig. 2D) (Bass et al., 1991), suggesting that the BN-BC protein also has a GH receptor-like structure. The amino-terminal sequence of the purified BN-BC protein was determined. The predominant amino-terminal residue was Ala, followed by the sequence Gly-Tyr-Pro-Pro. This amino-terminal residue corresponds to Ala95 of the Ser1-Ile4, Val85-Gly96 interval (see underlines: Ser1-Gly2-His3-Ile4 and Val85-Gln-Leu-Leu-Asp89-Gln-Ala-Glu-Leu-His-Ala95-Gly96) derived from the Ig region. A minor (less than 10%, as estimated by gel filtration HPLC), contaminating amino-terminal residue was Asp, followed by the sequence Gln-Ala-Glu-Leu. This amino-terminal residue corresponds to Asp89 of the 16 residual amino acids from the Ig domain. Thus, the expressed BN-BC protein contains the amino terminus expected of the BN-BC domain; however, most of the short Ig-derived sequence was removed during or after the processing of the signal peptide. As a control, we expressed the BN-BC domain from Tyr97 to Ala309 using an E. coli maltose binding protein fusion system, as described (Hiraoka et al. 1994a). The E. coli purified BN-BC domain exhibited almost the same Kd for G-CSF and the same CD spectrum as those of the purified BN-BC domain expressed using the baculovirus system. 2O. Hiraoka, H. Anaguchi, and Y. Ota, manuscript in preparation. These results suggested that the residual 16 amino acids of the Ig domain affect neither the Kd nor the conformation of the BN-BC domain.Formation of the BN-BC•G-CSF and the Ig-BN•G-CSF Binary Complexes and the Ig-BN•G-CSF•BN-BC Ternary ComplexTo analyze the effect of the ligand G-CSF upon oligomerization of purified BN-BC protein, the size of the purified BN-BC•G-CSF (27 and 19 kDa, respectively) complex was established by separating mixtures of the proteins (in ratios of BN-BC:G-CSF; 1:5, 1:1, 1:0.5, 1:0.1, and 1:0) by gel filtration HPLC (Fig. 3). At a 1:1 ratio of BN-BC to G-CSF, virtually all of the protein chromatographed at the position corresponding to a molecular mass of 35 kDa (Fig. 3, line 2, and Table 1). When the ratio of the BN-BC protein to G-CSF was 1:5, an excess of free G-CSF (19 kDa) appeared as a peak (Fig. 3, line 1). The 35-kDa peak did not dissociate, and no peak with a higher molecular mass was detected (Fig. 3, line 1). When the ratio was below 1:1 (ratios of 1:0.5, 1:0.1, and 1:0), a BN-BC (27 kDa) peak was present, whereas free G-CSF was absent (Fig. 3, lines 3-5). Gel filtration of the BN-BC•G-CSF complex using 125I-G-CSF confirmed that most of the 125I-G-CSF chromatographed at the position corresponding to 35 kDa at an extremely low concentration of the ligand (1:0.0004 ratio of BN-BC to G-CSF), whereas most of this 125I-G-CSF migrated at the position corresponding to 19 kDa in the presence of a high concentration of the unlabeled ligand (1:4 ratio of BN-BC to G-CSF) (data not shown). Thus, these data indicated that the BN-BC domain of the G-CSF receptor formed a stable 1:1 complex with G-CSF. The mass of the observed complex, 35 kDa, was somewhat smaller than the 46-kDa mass calculated from the sum of the components (Table 1). However, gel filtration HPLC analysis of the BN-BC domain expressed using an E. coli system also gave a smaller apparent mass for the BN-BC•G-CSF complex.2Figure 3Analysis of BN-BC•G-CSF complexes by gel filtration HPLC. The gel filtration profiles of various ratios of the BN-BC protein to G-CSF, corresponding to 1:5 (line 1), 1:1 (line 2), 1:0.5 (line 3), 1:0.1 (line 4), 1:0 (line 5) (top to bottom tracing) are shown. The protein concentrations of BN-BC (fixed at 1.6 μM) and G-CSF were calculated from the absorption at 280 nm (A2800.1% values of 2.2 and 0.81, respectively) as described in Fig. 2. Protein mixtures were equilibrated for 90 min at 20°C in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.2 M NaCl. Samples (200 μl) were applied to a TSKgel G3000SW gel filtration HPLC (7.6 mm, inner diameter, × 60 cm; TOSO Co., Ltd) and were eluted with the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min. Peaks were monitored for absorbance at 280 nm. The elution positions of the BN-BC portion of human GH receptor, the human GH, and their complexes estimated from Table 1 are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Fuh et al.(1990) expressed the BN-BC portion of the GH receptor as a soluble protein using an E. coli secretion system. The molecular composition of the BN-BC portion of the GH receptor•GH complex established by gel filtration HPLC showed a stoichiometry of 2:1 (Cunningham et al., 1991). As a control to test the accuracy of our gel filtration assessment of molecular mass, we also expressed the BN-BC portion of the GH receptor using the insect-baculovirus system and attempted to induce the formation of the 2:1 receptor•ligand complex. At a 1:0.5 ratio of the BN-BC portion of the GH receptor to GH, all of the protein chromatographed as a single peak, which corresponded to an 82-kDa complex composed of two molecules of the BN-BC portion of the GH receptor (30 kDa)/molecule of GH (22 kDa) (Fig. 4, line 3). When the ratio of the GH receptor to GH was decreased, a peak appeared corresponding to a 1:1 complex of 52 kDa, and the 82-kDa peak decreased in size (Fig. 4, lines 1 and 2). These results confirmed that a 2:1 GH receptor to GH complex was formed, and this complex dissociated to the 1:1 complex with an excess of GH, as described (Cunningham et al., 1991; de Vos et al., 1992; Fuh et al., 1992). These results also indicated that the stoichiometry of the receptor BN-BC•ligand complex differs between the G-CSF and the GH receptors, despite the structural similarity between their BN-BC domains.Figure 4Analysis of the BN-BC portion of the GH receptor-GH complexes by gel filtration HPLC. The gel filtration profiles of various ratios of the BN-BC portion of the GH receptor (indicated as hGH-R) to GH, corresponding to 1:5 (line 1), 1:1 (line 2), 1:0.5 (line 3), 1:0.1 (line 4), 1:0 (line 5) (top to bottom tracing) are shown. The protein concentrations of the BN-BC portion of the human GH receptor (fixed at 1.3 μM) and GH (recombinant human GH; Ota et al. 1991) were calculated from the absorption at 280 nm (A2800.1% values of 2.3 and 0.80, respectively) as described in Fig. 2. Protein mixtures were equilibrated for 90 min at 20°C in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.2 M NaCl. Samples (200 μl) were applied to the TSKgel G3000SW gel filtration HPLC and were eluted with the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min. Peaks were monitored for absorbance at 280 nm. The elution positions of bovine serum albumin (BSA; 67 kDa) and ovalbumin (ova; 43 kDa) are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Ig-BN (35-kDa) complex with G-CSF (19 kDa) was also established using gel filtration HPLC (Fig. 5). At a 1:1 ratio of Ig-BN to G-CSF, all of the protein chromatographed at 48 kDa (Fig. 5, line 2), corresponding to the size of a 1:1 complex (Table 1). When the ratio of Ig-BN to G-CSF was 1:10, peaks corresponding to the 1:1 complex, as well as to free G-CSF, were present, and no peaks with higher or lower molecular masses were detected (Fig. 5, line 3). These results show that the Ig-BN protein formed a stable 1:1 complex with G-CSF. When the Ig-BN protein was mixed with the BN-BC protein in addition to G-CSF, a peak of 74 kDa appeared, with a corresponding decrease in the 48-kDa peak (in ratios of Ig-BN:G-CSF:BN-BC; 1:1:0, 1:1:0.5, 1:1:3; Fig. 5, lines 2, 4, and 5). This result is consistent with the formation of a 1:1:1 Ig-BN•G-CSF•BN-BC complex, as the observed molecular mass of 74 kDa is quite close to the expected mass of 81 kDa for a 1:1:1 ternary complex (Table 1). Components of the ternary complex were confirmed by analysis of amino-terminal residues released from the 74-kDa peak (data not shown). No Ig-BN•BN-BC complex was formed in the absence of G-CSF (Fig. 5, line 6). The 35-kDa peak that would correspond to release of the Ig-BN domain was not detected by gel filtration HPLC, either upon addition of a small (1:1:0.5 ratio; Fig. 5, line 4) or an excess amount (1:1:3 ratio; Fig. 5, line 4) of the BN-BC domain. G-CSF was detected only in the 74-kDa peak seen upon addition of an excess amount of the BN-BC domain (1:1:3 ratio; Fig. 5, line 5; Western blotting; data not shown). These results suggested that the BN-BC protein did not compete with the Ig-BN protein for binding to G-CSF. The formation of the 74-kDa peak and the retention of the Ig-BN domain in the complex were confirmed by the addition of an excess amount of the BN-BC domain to the purified Ig-BN•G-CSF complex, using gel filtration HPLC (data not shown).Figure 5Analysis of Ig-BN•G-CSF and Ig-BN•G-CSF•BN-BC complexes by gel filtration HPLC.

The protein concentrations of the Ig-BN domain (fixed at 0.5 μM), the BN-BC domain, and G-CSF were calculated from the absorption at 280 nm (A2800.1% values of 1.3, 2.2, and 0.81, respectively) as described in Fig. 2. Protein mixtures were equilibrated for 90 min at 20°C in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.2 M NaCl.

We confirmed the existence of this 2:1 complex using GH receptor produced by a baculovirus system. Similar 2:1 receptor-ligand complexes have also been obtained using the receptors for interferon-γ and prolactin (Greenlund et al., 1993; Hooper et al., 1993). Among the members of the cytokine receptor family, these receptors, as well as the G-CSF receptor, seem to function as homo-oligomers (Nagata and Fukunaga, 1991; Hiraoka et al. 1994b), supporting the view that the BN-BC domain of the G-CSF receptor may form a 2:1 receptor-ligand complex. Surprisingly, however, we found that the BN-BC domain of the G-CSF receptor forms a 1:1 binary complex with its ligand G-CSF, suggesting that the BN-BC domain of the G-CSF receptor alone is not sufficient for G-CSF-induced oligomerization. Notably, extracellular portions of the receptors for GH, interferon-γ, and prolactin compose only the BN-BC region (Bazan, 1990), while the G-CSF receptor contains Ig and fibronectin type III domains in addition to the BN-BC functional unit. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the purified Ig-BN-BC protein existed as dimeric or tetrameric forms in the presence of G-CSF (Hiraoka et al. 1994b). These results suggested the possibility that the Ig domain might play an important role in oligomerization of the G-CSF receptor.Cunningham et al. indicated that the GH receptor contains two overlapping binding sites that interact with two distinct sites on the GH protein, thereby producing the 2:1 receptor-ligand complex (Cunningham et al., 1991). In contrast, our results suggest that the BN-BC region of the G-CSF receptor contains a single binding site for G-CSF, while the Ig domain may provide a second ligand binding site. The purified Ig-BN protein formed a stable 1:1 binary complex, indicating that the Ig-BN region is also able to contribute to stable binding of G-CSF. Furthermore, we detected the formation of a 1:1:1 Ig-BN•G-CSF•BN-BC ternary complex upon addition of BN-BC protein to the 1:1 Ig-BN•G-CSF complex. These results suggested that two binding sites for G-CSF are found within the Ig-BN-BC region and that, unlike the GH receptor paradigm, two different functional units of the receptor molecule (both BN-BC and Ig-BN) are involved in interactions with two distinct binding sites on the G-CSF ligand.The apparent Kd of the BN-BC domain for G-CSF in the present study is about 2.5 × 10-9M. This value is similar to the Kd of about 3.7 × 10-9M exhibited by the deletion mutant of the G-CSF receptor expressed on the surface of a murine myeloid cells that contains both the BN and the BC domains but lacks the Ig domain (Fukunaga et al., 1991). We could not measure the Kd of the Ig-BN domain for G-CSF, because of the low purification yield and weak affinity of the anti-G-CSF receptor CRH antibody (anti-M1 serum; Fukunaga et al., 1991) for the Ig-BN protein. Fukunaga et al. reported a Kd value of about 1.1 × 10-8M for a mutant G-CSF receptor expressing the Ig and BN domains in addition to the fibronectin type III domains but lacking the BC domain at the cell surface (Fukunaga et al., 1991). Thus, it is likely that the affinity of the BN-BC domain for G-CSF is higher than that of the Ig-BN domain. Interestingly, in our study the Ig-BN domain was not released when the BN-BC domain was incubated with the Ig-BN•G-CSF complex. This finding is consistent with the idea that the binding site on the Ig-BN domain is distinct from that of the BN-BC domain. We have reported previously that the expressed Ig-BN-BC protein was purified primarily as a dimer, using G-CSF affinity column chromatography, and that only the dimeric Ig-BN-BC protein retained affinity for the ligand, termed “high” affinity (Kd = about 10-10M), while the monomeric Ig-BN-BC protein showed reduced affinity, which was termed “low” (Kd = about 2.5 × 10-9M) (Hiraoka et al., 1994b). These data supported the proposal that the Ig-BN-BC protein has two binding sites and suggested that the two sites provided by each dimeric Ig-BN-BC chain are required for high affinity binding of G-CSF. The apparent Kd of the purified BN-BC domain (about 2.5 × 10-9M) is nearly the same as that exhibited by the monomeric Ig-BN-BC protein and corresponds to low affinity ligand binding (Hiraoka et al., 1994b).In our previous work, we indicated that the Ig-BN-BC•G-CSF complex was composed of a dimeric Ig-BN-BC protein which forms at an extremely low concentration of G-CSF, and that this dimer converted to a tetramer with an increase in the concentration of ligand (Hiraoka et al., 1994b). The stoichiometry of the tetrameric complex was determined to be 4:4 Ig-BN-BC•G-CSF (Hiraoka et al., 1994b). We could not estimate the stoichiometry of the dimeric complex in that study because of the extremely low yield. In the present study, we did not obtain any receptor-ligand complexes containing four molecules of receptor (such as a 2:2:2 or 2:4:2 Ig-BN•G-CSF•BN-BC complexes, which would correspond to a 4:2 or 4:4 receptor-ligand stoichiometry), even at a high concentration of G-CSF (data not shown). These data suggest that a minimal Ig-BN-BC functional unit is required for the tetramerization. Fuh et al. expressed chimeric GH and G-CSF receptor cDNAs in a leukemia cell line and showed that the 2:1 GH receptor-GH complex, induced at a low concentration of GH, was the active form for signal transduction, whereas the 1:1 complex, induced at a high concentration of GH, was an inactive form (Fuh et al., 1992). Thus, it is likely that the receptor-ligand complex identified in the present study was “frozen” during purification as 2:1 G-CSF receptor-G-CSF stoichiometry, which appeared as a 1:1:1 Ig-BN-BC•G-CSF•BN-BC ternary complex (Fig. 6). The possibility remains that the G-CSF receptor exists on the cell surface as a dimer and that higher molecular weight aggregates, e.g. tetramers, constitute the activated form of the receptor induced by G-CSF stimulation (Fukunaga et al., 1990a; Hiraoka et al., 1994b). However, identification of a 1:1:1 Ig-BN•G-CSF•BN-BC ternary complex, formed by two discrete ligand binding sites in separate functional domains, suggests that the formation of a 2:1 G-CSF receptor-ligand complex may play an important role in the function of the G-CSF receptor, even if the dimerization of the G-CSF receptor is insufficient to activate the receptor. Interestingly, a mutant G-CSF receptor (GΔ(5-84)) containing the BN-BC and fibronectin type III domains but lacking the Ig domain still retains weak signal transduction activity (Fukunaga et al., 1991). Thus, if the activated form of the G-CSF receptor is indeed a dimer, it is likely that high concentrations of G-CSF can drive the GΔ(5-84) mutant receptor into a dimeric form, at least to some extent, even in the absence of the Ig domain. The mechanism and the meaning of the conversion from dimeric to tetrameric forms of the G-CSF receptor are still open questions. Further studies, including both mutational and structural analyses, are required to understand the precise mechanism of oligomerization and to correlate the observed oligomerization in solution to the mitogenicity of G-CSF.Figure 6Schematic representation of complexes of the Ig-BN-BC, the BN-BC, and the Ig-BN domains of the G-CSF receptor with G-CSF. A, each Ig-BN and BN-BC domain formed 1:1 binary complexes with G-CSF. These Ig-BN and BN-BC regions form a 1:1:1 ternary complex with G-CSF in the presence of both the Ig-BN and the BN-BC domains. B, thus, it is conceivable that the 2:1 Ig-BN-BC•G-CSF complex may be formed at a low concentration of G-CSF, and this 2:1 complex is converted to a 4:4 tetrameric complex with an increasing concentration of G-CSF (see “Discussion”; Hiraoka et al., 1994b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) INTRODUCTIONLigand-induced receptor oligomerization has been proposed as the key mechanism of signal transduction for some families of single transmembrane receptors, such as cytokine receptors and tyrosine kinase-type receptors (Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990; Wells et al., 1993; Heldin, 1995). In these models, the oligomerization of the extracellular regions, induced by ligand binding, is followed by the activation of their cytoplasmic regions. The extracellular regions of these receptors generally have a composite structure containing multiple domains (Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990; Bazan, 1990; Miyajima et al., 1992; Heldin, 1995), which are presumed to play important roles in ligand-induced oligomerization. Investigation of the molecular properties of purified extracellular domains is a prerequisite for understanding mechanisms of receptor oligomerization that culminate in the transductions of external signals.The extracellular region (˜600 amino acid residues) of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 1The abbreviations used are: G-CSFgranulocyte colony-stimulating factorBN domainamino-terminal domain of the cytokine receptor homologous regionBC domaincarboxyl-terminal domain of the cytokine receptor homologous regionCRHcytokine receptor homologousGHgrowth hormoneHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyIgimmunoglobulin-likePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisChaps3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. receptor is composed of an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain, a cytokine receptor homologous (CRH) region, and three fibronectin type III-like domains (Fukunaga et al., 1990b, 1990c). The Ig domain (˜100 amino acid residues) was originally defined by its homology to the immunoglobulin superfamily (Williams and Barclay, 1988). Though a number of receptors, including those for several cytokines, such as G-CSF, interleukin 6, and ciliary neurotrophic factor, contain Ig domains (Fukunaga et al., 1990b, 1990c; Larsen et al., 1990; Yamasaki et al., 1988: Davis et al., 1991), little is known about their function. A deletion derivate of the G-CSF receptor lacking the Ig domain retained ligand binding activity, although the dissociation constant (Kd) value of the mutant was 10-20-fold higher than that of the intact receptor (Fukunaga et al., 1991). The CRH region (˜200 amino acid residues) was originally defined by its striking homology to the predicted ligand binding domains of the receptors for various cytokines, such as interleukins 2-7, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, erythropoietin, growth hormone (GH), and prolactin (Bazan, 1990) receptors. The CRH region consists of an amino-terminal (BN; ˜100 amino acid residues) domain containing four conserved cysteine residues and a carboxyl-terminal (BC; ˜100 amino acid residues) domain containing a “WSXWS” motif (Bazan, 1990). Earlier work has identified high affinity oligomers of the G-CSF receptor on the surface of mouse myeloid leukemia cells (Fukunaga et al., 1990a), and mutational analyses showed that deletion of the BN domain completely abolishes ligand binding activity (Fukunaga et al., 1991). As a first step toward studying its molecular properties, we expressed the gene encoding the BN domain as a minimal binding unit, using an Escherichia coli maltose binding protein fusion system (Hiraoka et al., 1994a). This purified, small domain still retained ligand binding activity but did not form oligomers, such as dimers or tetramers (Hiraoka et al., 1994a), suggesting that a larger binding unit is required for G-CSF receptor oligomerization. As a second approach, we expressed a three-domain binding unit consisting of Ig-BN-BC regions (˜300 amino acid residues; indicated as Ig-CRH in Hiraoka et al. (1994b)) using an insect Trichoplusia ni cell-baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus system. The purified Ig-BN-BC protein retained high ligand binding activity and formed dimers and tetramers in the presence of G-CSF (Hiraoka et al., 1994b). These studies indicated the involvement of the Ig or BC regions in receptor oligomerization and suggested that expression of tandem Ig-BN or BN-BC domains might permit functional dissection of the oligomerization process.In the present study, we describe expression of the Ig-BN and the BN-BC domains of the G-CSF receptor in insect cells using a baculovirus system. Isolated Ig-BN and BN-BC domains did not form homo-oligomers in the presence of ligand, although these products did form 1:1 binary complexes with G-CSF. However, the combined Ig-BN and the BN-BC domains formed a 1:1:1 Ig-BN•G-CSF•BN-BC complex, which is consistent with binding of a single molecule of G-CSF ligand by a dimeric receptor."

Through inhibition of these latter two proteases, it has been suggested that the KPI-containing isoforms of AβPP may play a role in regulating hemostasis by acting as an anticoagulant(30Van Nostrand W.E.

Factor XIa (FXIa) participates in the middle phase of the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation by converting the zymogen Factor IX to the active serine protease Factor IXa. Factor IXa then converts Factor X to Factor Xa, the next serine protease to participate in the coagulation cascade ultimately leading to fibrin clot formation(31Di Scipio R.G. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).In the present study, we investigated the proteolytic processing of AβPP by FXIa. We report here that FXIa can cleave the RHDS sequence in the Aβ domain, altering the cell adhesive properties of both Aβ and secreted AβPP. These data suggest a new potential biological function for FXIa in the modulation of cell adhesion. These findings also indicate that the KPI domain of AβPP can regulate the activity of a protease that can process the Aβ domain, thus altering its potential physiological and pathological properties.DISCUSSIONThe present studies show that FXIa, a target protease for inhibition by the KPI domain of AβPP, proteolytically cleaves secreted AβPP695 from U138/695 cells. Initial cleavage at low FXIa concentrations (~2.5 nM) occurred at the site previously reported for thrombin cleavage at Arg510-Ile511 of AβPP695. It is noteworthy that the amino acid sequence at the thrombin cleavage site in AβPP is Glu508-Pro509-Arg510, the same sequence as the synthetic chromogenic substrate used to assay FXIa activity in vitro(39van der Graaf F.

Additional cleavage sites were utilized at higher concentrations of FXIa (Fig. 1A). Several potential functions have been ascribed to secreted AβPP695, including cell adhesion, growth supportive activity, and neuroprotection(16Schubert D. Jin L.-W. Saitoh T. Cole G.

Proteolytic processing of AβPP695 by FXIa may disrupt one or more of these properties.Reduced cell adhesion to the substratum was observed in FXIa-treated U138/695 cells. This may have resulted from disruption of the cell adhesion domain by FXIa. A cell adhesion site in AβPP has been localized within the amino-terminal region of the Aβ domain, which is present in secreted forms of the protein(18Ghiso J. Rostagno A. Gardella J.E. Liem L. Gorevic P.D. Frangione B. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, synthetic Aβ1-40 was digested with increasing concentrations of FXIa. The loss of Aβ immunoreactivity observed in Fig. 3 was consistent with disruption of the mAb 6E10 epitope, which has been mapped within the amino-terminal region of Aβ(40Kim K.S. Miller D.L.

Accompanying the loss of Aβ immunoreactivity, we observed the appearance of a truncated Aβ peptide when treated with FXIa (Fig. 4). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the first five amino acids of this truncated peptide yielded the Aβ sequence HDSGY (Table 1), consistent with cleavage through the cell adhesion domain RHDS. It is noteworthy that the RHDS cleavage site in the Aβ domain shows homology to the factor IX activation site for FXIa(32Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henscher A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because cleavage through the RHDS sequence may disrupt the cell adhesive properties of the Aβ domain, we compared the abilities of Aβ1-40 and FXIa-cleaved Aβ1-40 to serve as cell adhesion substrates. Aβ1-40 promoted adhesion of U138/695 cells to the substratum by nearly 20-fold over buffer-treated substratum (Fig. 5). However, FXIa-cleaved Aβ1-40 lost its ability to serve as cell adhesive substrate. Similarly, FXIa diminished the ability of secreted AβPP695 to promote cell adhesion. These results suggest that FXIa could disrupt adhesion of cells that may use this region of the Aβ domain as an extracellular matrix protein.Together, these findings have identified a new potential function for FXIa in the modulation of cell adhesion. This suggests that in addition to a function in coagulation, FXIa may participate in other roles of wound repair and tissue remodeling at sites of vascular injury. It is noteworthy that platelets activated by physiological agonists release large amounts of PN-2/AβPP(27Smith R.P. Higuchi D.A. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1126-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 41Van Nostrand W.E. Schmaier A.H. Farrow J.S. Cunningham D.D. Science. 1990; 248: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Therefore, PN-2/AβPP released by platelets at sites of vascular damage may participate in both the regulation of coagulation and cell adhesion. Through its intimate interactions with PN-2/AβPP, FXIa may also be involved in both of these processes. The present data also show that the KPI domain of PN-2/AβPP can regulate the activity of a target protease that possesses the ability to modulate another potential biological function on a distal region of the protein. Moreover, these findings demonstrate that the KPI domain of PN-2/AβPP can regulate the activity of a protease that can cleave the Aβ peptide. Proteolytic processing of this nature could alter possible physiologic and perhaps pathologic properties of Aβ.

The latter two isoforms contain a 56-amino acid domain that is homologous to Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors (KPI)(9Ponte P. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P. Schilling J. Miller J. Hsu D. Greenberg B.

Secretory cleavage of AβPP occurs within the Aβ domain, and therefore, processing through this pathway precludes Aβ formation(14Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R.

For example, several laboratories have provided evidence that AβPP can mediate both cell-cell and cell-surface adhesion in neural and non-neural cells(16Schubert D. Jin L.-W. Saitoh T. Cole G.

Recently, AβPP has been shown to be involved in regulating intracellular calcium levels in neurons, thus providing protection to these cells(21Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Culwell A.R. Esch F.S.

Both the cell adhesion and neuroprotective activities have been localized to the carboxyl-terminal region of the secreted AβPP(17Chen M. Yankner B.A. Neurosci.

In addition, growth-promoting activities of AβPP in non-neural and neural cells have been reported(23Saitoh T. Sundsmo M. Roch J.-M. Kimura N. Cole G. Schubert D. Oltersdorf T. Schenk D.B.

Through inhibition of these latter two proteases, it has been suggested that the KPI-containing isoforms of AβPP may play a role in regulating hemostasis by acting as an anticoagulant(30Van Nostrand W.E. Schmaier A.H. Wagner S.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 674: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Factor XIa (FXIa) participates in the middle phase of the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation by converting the zymogen Factor IX to the active serine protease Factor IXa. Factor IXa then converts Factor X to Factor Xa, the next serine protease to participate in the coagulation cascade ultimately leading to fibrin clot formation(31Di Scipio R.G. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).In the present study, we investigated the proteolytic processing of AβPP by FXIa. We report here that FXIa can cleave the RHDS sequence in the Aβ domain, altering the cell adhesive properties of both Aβ and secreted AβPP. These data suggest a new potential biological function for FXIa in the modulation of cell adhesion. These findings also indicate that the KPI domain of AβPP can regulate the activity of a protease that can process the Aβ domain, thus altering its potential physiological and pathological properties."

Immunofluorescence measurements showed that Gi2α is distributed throughout much of the interior of the hepatocyte as well as at the periphery of the cell. By contrast, Gq/11α was found principally at the cell periphery.

Thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow is inhibited by an anti-Gi1-2α antibody and by a Gi2α peptide, indicating that the trimeric G-protein Gi2α controls store-operated Ca2+ inflow in hepatocytes. Immunofluorescence experiments indicate that the Gi2α polypeptide is located in the interior of the hepatocyte and is not restricted in intracellular location to the plasma membrane. A rabbit polyclonal anti-Gi1-2α antibody, which recognizes Gtα, Gi1α, and Gi2α, was raised against the peptide KENLKDCGLF, a region of the carboxyl amino acid sequence for Gtα, and a rabbit polyclonal anti-Gq-11α antibody, which recognizes Gqα and G11α, was raised against the peptide QLNLKEYNLV, a common region of the carboxyl amino acid sequence for Gqα and G11α. The antibodies were prepared using peptides linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, affinity-purified as described previously(24Crouch M.F. Hendry I.A. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and routinely stored at −70°C in Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.3. The abilities of the antibodies to recognize Gi2α (anti-Gi1-2α) and Gq/11α, respectively, in extracts of hepatocytes were confirmed by Western blot analysis. The anti-Gi1-2α antibody detected a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa and the anti-Gq-11 antibody a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa. The peptides against which antibodies were raised, and the peptides IKNNLKDCGLF (Gi2α Ile345-Phe355 (peptide Gi2α)) and IKNNLKECGLY (Gi3α Ile344-Phe354 (peptide Gi3α)), corresponding to the carboxyl termini of Gi2α and Gi3α, respectively, were synthesized (as free COOH) by the Merrifield solid-phase synthesis procedure using an Applied Biosystems 430A synthesizer and were analyzed by quantitative amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry, as described previously(25Pearson R.B. Mitchelhill K.I. Kemp B.E. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 265-291Google Scholar). Solutions of peptides Gi2α and Gi3α were prepared fresh each day by dissolving the peptide in a solution of 10 mM fura-2 in 125 mM KCl to give a concentration of 12 mM peptide in the microinjection pipette tip (estimated intracellular concentration 160 μM). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit IgG was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia; and indocarbocyanine (Cy3) from Jackson, West Grove, PA. All other reagents were obtained from sources described previously(11Berven L.A. Hughes B.P. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The isolation of hepatocytes, attachment of hepatocytes to coverslips coated with collagen, the microinjection of fura-2, antibodies, and peptides, and measurement of the fluorescence of single hepatocytes loaded with fura-2 were conducted as described previously(11Berven L.A. Hughes B.P. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The dilution factor for the microinjection of reagents to hepatocytes, determined previously(12Berven L.A. Barritt G.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was approximately 75-fold. Antibodies were concentrated in a buffer composed of 27 mM K2HPO4, 8 mM Na2HPO4, and 26 mM KH2PO4 (adjusted to pH 7.3 by addition of KOH) (phosphate buffer) (26Glennon M.C. Bird G.St.J. Kwan C.-Y. Putney J.W. Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8230-8233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) at 4,000 × g for 30 min, stored at 4°C, and used within 1-8 days. The final concentration of antibody in the microinjection pipette tip ranged from 2.5 to 3.0 mg/ml (estimated intracellular concentration 30-40 μg/ml). Antibodies were co-injected with fura-2 (10 mM in the pipette tip, estimated intracellular concentration 130 μM) at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. In control experiments, the Gi1-2α antibody (2.2-3.0 mg/ml in the pipette tip) was mixed with blocking peptide KENLKDCGLF (1.7 mM in pipette tip) and co-injected with fura-2. Peptides Gi2α (Ile345-Phe355) and Gi3α (Ile344-Phe354) were dissolved in phosphate buffer, mixed with fura-2 to give 12 mM peptide and 10 mM fura-2 in the micropipette tip, and introduced to the cytoplasmic space of hepatocytes by microinjection. The fluorescence of FITC-conjugated rabbit IgG injected into hepatocytes was measured using excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 540 nm, respectively. Freshly isolated hepatocytes (10q-11α cells/50-mm plastic Petri dish) were cultured for 24 h in William's Medium E, fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized using Triton X-100 as described by Lièvremont et al.(27Lièvremont J.-P. Hill A.-M. Hilly M. Mauger J.-P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After washing twice with 0.05% (w/v) Tween in PBS (Tween-PBS), the cells were incubated overnight with a given affinity-purified rabbit anti-Gα antibody (50 μg/ml) or with a given anti-Gα antibody which had been mixed with a molar excess of appropriate blocking peptide. The cells were washed five to six times with Tween-PBS to remove primary antibody and then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to indocarbocyanine (Cy3) (1 in 200). Immunofluorescence was detected using a Nikon inverted microscope, a × 60 or × 100 oil immersion objective lens and a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 scanning confocal imaging system incorporating a krypton-argon laser. Hepatocytes loaded with anti-Gi1-2α antibody exhibited a substantial inhibition of vasopressin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow compared with control hepatocytes (Fig. 1a, solid line, cf.Fig. 1b).

Details of the total number of cells tested and the numbers of cells yielding a given type of response are set out in Table 1. In the majority of cells tested the ability of vasopressin to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores was not affected by microinjection of the antibody (Table 1). Pretreatment of the anti-Gi1-2α antibody with the peptide against which the antibody was raised (the blocking peptide) prevented the inhibition of vasopressin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow (Fig. 1a, broken line; Table 1). The anti-Gi1-2α antibody also inhibited thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow and caused some inhibition of thapsigargin-stimulated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Fig. 1c, Table 1). No inhibition of vasopressin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow was observed in cells loaded with an anti-Gi2α antibody raised against a peptide which corresponds to a region near the amino terminus of Gi2α (results not shown).Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The effects of the anti-Gi1-2α antibody were compared with those of an antibody against Gq/11α. This inhibited vasopressin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow in most cells tested and caused partial inhibition of the vasopressin-stimulated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Fig. 1d, Table 1), as shown previously for hepatocytes by Yang et al.(19Yang L. Camoratto A.M. Baffy G. Raj S. Manning D.R. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3739-3746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that the microinjected anti-Gq-11α antibody was incompletely distributed in the cytoplasmic space was tested by microinjecting FITC-conjugated rabbit IgG to hepatocytes. The fluorescence signal diffused evenly in recipient cells within 5 min following the microinjection of the antibody, indicating that antibody microinjected to an hepatocyte is distributed throughout the cell within 5 min following its microinjection (results not shown). The microinjection of peptide Gi2α (Ile345-Phe355) inhibited vasopressin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow in almost all cells tested but had no effect on the ability of vasopressin to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Fig. 2a, Table 1). By contrast, microinjection of peptide Gi3α (Ile344-Phe354), at the same concentration as that employed for peptide Gi2α, caused no inhibition of either Ca2+ inflow or Ca2+ release from intracellular stores induced by vasopressin (Fig. 2a, Table 1). Neither peptide caused an activation of Ca2+ inflow in the absence of vasopressin or thapsigargin (results not shown). Thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow was also inhibited by peptide Gi2α. Complete inhibition was observed in 55% of the cells tested (Fig. 2b, cf.Fig. 2c, Table 1). Peptide Gi3α caused little or no inhibition of thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow (Fig. 2b, cf.Fig. 2c, Table 1). However, both peptides caused some inhibition of thapsigargin-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Fig. 2b, cf.Fig. 2c, Table 1). In 7 out of 11 cells (peptide Gi2α) and in 3 out of the 4 cells (peptide Gi3α) the inhibition of the thapsigargin-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by the peptide was associated with an inhibition of thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ inflow. This suggests there may be some correlation between the effects of the peptides on the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and their effects on Ca2+ inflow. Since the results of the experiments conducted with anti-Gi2α antibodies and site-specific Giα peptides suggest that Gi2α is required for the activation of Ca2+ inflow, the intracellular location of Gi2α was investigated by immunofluorescence, using anti-Gi1-2α antibody as the primary antibody and anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled to the fluorescent dye Cy3. In most cells, immunofluorescence, which was dependent on anti-Gi1-2α antibody, was found to be distributed throughout the cytoplasmic space as well as in most parts of the cell periphery (Fig. 3a). This distribution is seen more clearly at higher magnification (Fig. 3b). The fluorescence signal given by anti-Gi1-2α antibody was not observed when the anti-Gi1-2α antibody was omitted or when this antibody was pretreated with the blocking peptide (results not shown). A pattern of immunofluorescence similar to that given by anti-Gi1-2α antibody was observed when an anti-Gi3α antibody was employed as the primary antibody (results not shown). In contrast to the results obtained with the anti-Gi1-2α antibody, when anti-Gq-11α antibody was employed, the fluorescence signal was largely confined to the periphery of the cell, adjacent to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, c and d). The fluorescence given by anti-Gq-11α antibody was abolished when anti-Gq-11α antibody was omitted or when this antibody was pretreated with blocking peptide (results not shown). The cells labeled with the anti-Gq-11α antibody exhibited a much more defined location of immunofluorescence at the cell periphery than that exhibited by cells labeled with the anti-Gi1-2α antibody (Fig. 3c, cf.Fig. 3a). These results indicate that while Gi2α is distributed in the plasma membrane and in various regions of the cytoplasmic space, Gq-11α is located predominantly at the plasma membrane. Previous studies with hepatocytes which utilized pertussis toxin, GTPγS, and GDPβS have shown that vasopressin-dependent Ca2+ inflow requires a pertussis toxin-sensitive trimeric G-protein in addition to the pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein Gq/11, which is required for the activation of phospholipase Cβ and the subsequent generation of InsP3(11Berven L.A. Hughes B.P. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Berven L.A. Barritt G.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Fernando K.C. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The conclusion that vasopressin- and thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow requires the action of Gi1α and/or Gi2α is consistent with the observation reported here that the anti-Gi1-2α antibody, but not the anti-Gi1-2α antibody treated with blocking peptide, inhibited vasopressin- and thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow. Moreover, the observation that, when present at the same concentration as peptide Giα2, peptide Gi1α3 did not inhibit vasopressin- and thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow indicates that the observed inhibitory effects of peptide Giα2 are most likely due to inhibition of the action of Gi2α. Taken in conjunction with the observations that the only detectable pertussis toxin-sensitive trimeric G-proteins in hepatocytes are Gi2 and Gi3(16Rossier M.F. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Bushfield M. Griffiths S.L. Murphy G.J. Pyne N.J. Knowler J.T. Milligan G. Parker P.J. Mollner S. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the results reported here indicate that the pertussis toxin-sensitive trimeric G-protein required for activation of the hepatocyte plasma membrane receptor-activated Ca2+ channel is Gi2. The conclusion that Gi2 is required for store-activated Ca2+ inflow in hepatocytes is consistent with the observation that Gi2α is distributed in regions of the cytoplasmic space as well as at the plasma membrane, in contrast to Gq/11α which was found at the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte. ADP-ribosylation of Gi2α catalyzed by pertussis toxin is very slow (11Berven L.A. Hughes B.P. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Yang L. Camoratto A.M. Baffy G. Raj S. Manning D.R. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3739-3746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with a location of some Gi2α in the cytoplasmic space. The partial inhibition of the thapsigargin-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by the anti-Gi2 antibody (which would not be expected to bind to other intracellular proteins) and the Gi2α and Gi3α peptides was unexpected especially in view of the absence of an inhibition of vasopressin-stimulated Ca2+ release. This preferential inhibition of thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release may reflect some form of steric interaction between Gi2α and the thapsigargin-sensitive (Ca2++ Mg2+)-ATPase proteins. The observations that (a) the anti-Gq-11α antibody completely inhibited vasopressin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow (present results) and (b) the only known action of Gq/11 is to activate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cβ (28Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar) provide further evidence which indicates that an increase in InsP3 is a necessary prerequisite for vasopressin activation of Ca2+ inflow in hepatocytes (cf. the conclusion reached previously on the basis of studies with GDPβS and heparin(11Berven L.A. Hughes B.P. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). The observation that the anti-Gi2α antibody completely inhibits thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow as well as vasopressin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow also provides further evidence that the process of store-operated Ca2+ inflow is a necessary part of the mechanism of activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel by vasopressin in hepatocytes (cf. the conclusion reached previously on the basis of results with pertussis toxin which was also shown to block both vasopressin- and thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow(12Berven L.A. Barritt G.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Fernando K.C. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). The failure of the anti-Gq-11α antibody to completely inhibit vasopressin-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores may be due to a failure of the injected antibody to bind to all Gq/11α molecules, possibly because the affinity of the anti-Gq-11α antibody for Gq/11α is low or Gq/11α is in an environment that restricts the accesses of the antibody. Others have also reported that, relative to the effects of anti-Giα antibodies, longer incubation times are required in order to detect the inhibition by anti-Gq-11α antibodies of phospholipase Cβ in intact cells(19Yang L. Camoratto A.M. Baffy G. Raj S. Manning D.R. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3739-3746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Baffy G. Yang L. Raj S. Manning D.R. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8483-8487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another possible explanation for incomplete inhibition by the anti-Gq-11α antibody of vasopressin-induced release of Ca2+ is that, in hepatocytes, there is a species of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C which can be activated by seven transmembrane-spanning receptors through a mechanism which does not involve Gq/11(28Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). However, no evidence for such a pathway in hepatocytes has so far been reported. Furthermore, Gi2 is unlikely to be involved in the activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cβ in hepatocytes, since first, this function of Gi2 in hepatocytes has not been reported, and second, the anti-Gi1-2α antibody and the Gi2α peptide caused no inhibition of vasopressin-stimulated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. It is noteworthy that in several cells the anti-Gq-11α antibody inhibited vasopressin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow with little effect on the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. One possible explanation for this observation is that only a small region of the intracellular Ca2+ stores (most likely the endoplasmic reticulum near the plasma membrane) is involved in activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. Based on the results obtained, the sequence of events emerging for the activation by vasopressin of RACCs in hepatocytes is likely to include the following steps: formation of the vasopressin-receptor complex, activation of Gq/11, activation of phospholipase Cβ, an increase in InsP3 at the periphery of the cell, release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum in this region, activation of Gi2, and activation of one or more RACCs. Since the anti-Gi1-2α antibody and the Gi2 peptide inhibit thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow (in the absence of added vasopressin and hence in the absence of the formation of the vasopressin-receptor complex) activation of Gi2 would not involve its interaction with a seven-transmembrane-spanning receptor protein. One possible role of Gi2 may be to regulate the movement of Ca2+ between components of the endoplasmic reticulum (8Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21486-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gill D.L. Ueda T. Cheuh S.-H. Noel M.W.

FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or interaction of the endoplasmic reticulum with the plasma membrane. The proposed role of Gi2 in store-activated Ca2+ inflow in hepatocytes does not exclude a role for a low molecular weight G-protein, as proposed for mast and mouse lacrimal acinar cells, in part, on the basis of the observation that GTPγS inhibits store-activated Ca2+ inflow in these cell types(8Bird G.St.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, other studies conducted in this laboratory have also shown that a relatively high concentration of GTPγS inhibits thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ inflow in hepatocytes. 2L. A. Berven and G. J.

INTRODUCTIONFerrochelatase (protoheme ferrolyase, EC 4.99.1.1) is the terminal enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway(1Ferreira G.C. Franco R. Lloyd S.G. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Huynh B.H. J.

Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 123-161Google Scholar) in vitro. Certain other divalent metals, i.e. Mn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+, are inhibitors(7Dailey H.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 514: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ferric ion is not used as a substrate(8Porra R. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1963; 87: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Deficiencies in ferrochelatase activity cause an accumulation of precursor porphyrins within cells, particularly in those tissues (i.e. liver and bone marrow) where there is a high rate of heme synthesis, and this accumulation results in the disease protoporphyria(9Nordmann Y. Deybach J.-C. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 491-542Google Scholar). Because of this and because of heme's importance as a cofactor in a variety of enzymes and proteins (e.g. hemoglobin, cytochromes, NO synthase, peroxidases, catalases), understanding the mechanism and regulation of ferrochelatase activity is of prime importance.Ferrochelatase is a membrane-associated protein (with the cytoplasmic membrane in prokaryotes and with the inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes)(2Dailey H.A. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 123-161Google Scholar), except for the Bacillus subtilis enzyme, which is water-soluble(10Hansson M. Hederstedt L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As with most mitochondrial proteins, eukaryotic ferrochelatase is synthesized in the cytosol as a larger precursor form and subsequently processed to the mature protein during translocation into the mitochondria(2Dailey H.A. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 123-161Google Scholar, 11Camadro J.-M. Labbe P. J. Biol.

Commun. 1990; 173: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Human ferrochelatase is encoded by a single gene and has been mapped to chromosome 18q21.3(21Whitcombe D.M. Carter N.P. Albertson D.G. Smith S.J. Rhodes D.A. Cox T.M. Genomics. 1991; 11: 1152-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Brenner D.A. Didier J.M. Frasier F. Christensen S.R. Evans G.A. Dailey H.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 1203-1210PubMed Google Scholar).Because ferrochelatase is a membrane-associated protein, and hence relatively insoluble, it has been difficult in the past to purify substantial amounts of enzyme from conventional sources (e.g. mammalian liver). This has hindered detailed mechanistic and spectroscopic studies. Recently, however, this problem has been overcome by molecular recombinant DNA techniques. Both mouse (23Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human (24Dailey H.A. Sellers V.M. Dailey T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 390-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) ferrochelatase have been overexpressed in E. coli. For the mouse enzyme, the overexpressed protein remains associated with the soluble bacterial fraction, facilitating and increasing the yields of the purification procedure(23Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adequate amounts of the enzyme are now available, and spectroscopic studies are possible. Since these developments of heterologous overexpression systems, a [2Fe-2S] cluster was unexpectedly found in ferrochelatase isolated from mouse livers(25Ferreira B.C. Franco R. Lloyd S.G. Pereira A.S. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Huynh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7062-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recombinant (overexpressed) mouse (25Ferreira B.C. Franco R. Lloyd S.G. Pereira A.S. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Huynh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7062-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant human sources(26Dailey H.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The function of the cluster remains to be established, but it has been proposed to be necessary for activity(26Dailey H.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The cluster may or may not be near the ferrochelatase active site (which binds the substrate ferrous ion). The discovery of the cluster has opened new avenues of ferrochelatase research and is changing the way in which ferrochelatase in particular, and iron-sulfur clusters in general, are viewed.Little is known about the ferrous binding site itself. Chemical modification of protein sulfhydryl groups led to the proposal that at least two cysteine residues were responsible for binding the ferrous ion(27Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2711-2715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, comparison of the genes of the sequenced ferrochelatases reveals that not a single cysteine is conserved among all the species(12Miyamoto K. Nakahigashi K. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Frustaci J. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4223-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hansson M. Hederstedt L. J.

Commun. 1990; 173: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), although there are four cysteines conserved in the mammalian enzymes that have been implicated as ligands of the [2Fe-2S] cluster. In a recent report utilizing site-directed human ferrochelatase mutants, it was observed that the kinetic parameter KmFeincreased markedly when His-263, which is conserved in all of the sequenced ferrochelatases, was mutated to alanine while the same mutation in three other well conserved histidine residues had little effect(28Kohno H. Okuda M. Furukawa T. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that His-263 is a ligand of the substrate iron.Identification of the residue(s) responsible for binding the substrate iron is a critical first step in elucidating the enzymatic mechanism of ferrochelatase. In this paper we report kinetic and Mössbauer data on recombinant mouse ferrochelatase, which are consistent with the proposal that histidine residues are ligands of the ferrous ion and inconsistent with the involvement of sulfur ligands. A modified purification procedure is used and an improved assay for ferrochelatase activity, which eliminates the use of the competitive iron chelator dithiothreitol (DTT),1 is described. Ferrochelatase activity was monitored by UV-visible and by Mössbauer spectroscopy, and the two techniques yielded consistent results. Mössbauer spectroscopy reveals that the ferrous heme reaction product forms the S = 0 bis(pyridine) complex upon addition of base and pyridine followed by sodium dithionite reduction and that the formation of the adduct is complete. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the nature of the ferrous substrate binding site.MATERIALS AND METHODSDeuteroporphyrin IX dihydrochloride and N-methylprotoporphyrin IX were purchased from Porphyrin Products (Logan, UT). Bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagents were obtained from Pierce. 57Fe metal foil (> 95% pure) was from Advanced Materials and Technology (New York, NY). Natural-abundance FeSO4 (containing 92%56Fe) was from Mallinckrodt, and natural-abundance ferrous ammonium sulfate and the sodium citrate were from Fisher. L-Ascorbic acid, ferrozine, and the ferric standard solution were from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available.Enzyme PreparationRecombinant murine liver ferrochelatase was isolated from hyperproducing E. coli cells containing the plasmid pGF42(23Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in a medium containing natural-abundance iron (2.2%57Fe). The protein was purified and concentrated as described previously (23Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ferreira B.C. Franco R. Lloyd S.G. Pereira A.S. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Huynh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7062-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the modification that the buffers used throughout the process did not contain DTT. No special anaerobic techniques were used at this stage; the protein was purified and concentrated in air. The purified, concentrated protein (typically 1-2 mM) was frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard(29Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18442) Google Scholar).Ferrochelatase Activity AssayThe assays are essentially similar to those reported previously(23Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with differences noted below. Ferrochelatase was diluted into a buffer appropriate for the specific experiment (buffer and pH described for each experiment). In all cases, solutions containing ferrous ion were freshly prepared in previously deaerated distilled water (deaerated by bubbling high purity argon gas directly through).Reagents containing thiol groups, such as DTT, are well known chelators of both ferric and ferrous ion. Furthermore, thiol reagents are known to destabilize hemes in aerobic environments(30Porra R.J. Vitols K.S. Labbe R.F. Newton N.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine if DTT, which is commonly used in the ferrochelatase activity assay, could be confounding the activity measurements. In order to assess the effects of aerobic environment and presence of reductant in the activity assays, four experiments were carried out. Four test tubes (soaked overnight in concentrated HCl to remove all traces of iron) were each filled with 0.5 ml of a 100 mM HEPES buffer solution, pH 7.5, containing 20% glycerol, 1.5 M NaCl, and 1% sodium cholate; with 0.1 ml of 2.2 μM protein solution; and with 0.1 ml of 1.88 mM deuteroporphyrin IX solution. Tubes 2 and 3 also contained 0.1 ml of 50 mM DTT solution, while tubes 1 and 4 instead contained an additional 0.1 ml of the buffer solution. All tubes were covered with a rubber stopper and placed at room temperature (22°C). Tubes 3 and 4 were deaerated for 1 h using cycles of vacuum/ultrapure argon flow. The reactions were then initiated by adding 0.05 ml of 4 mM ferrous sulfate solution. The rubber stoppers were removed from tubes 1 and 2 during the reaction, while tubes 3 and 4 remained under a flow of ultrapure, humidified argon gas. After a 30-min incubation, all tubes were opened and 0.75 ml of 1 M NaOH was added, completely stopping the reaction. The heme content was then measured using the pyridine hemochromogen method (8Porra R. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1963; 87: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) using a value of Δɛ = 15.3 mM-1 cm-1 for the reduced - oxidized difference spectra(31Porra R.J. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1963; 87: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).As we have established that DTT is not necessary for enzyme activity (see “Results”), it was not used in any subsequent activity assays. DTT is, however, a reductant that serves the role of keeping the iron in the ferrous form in aerobic assays. Therefore, without DTT, care must be taken to ensure that the assay is carried out under strictly anaerobic conditions from start to finish in order to avoid oxidation of the ferrous substrate. Therefore, the activity assay procedure was slightly modified. In a typical assay, 0.6 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 (or of varying pH for the pH dependence study), 0.1 ml of enzyme solution, and 0.1 ml of a 2 mM deuteroporphyrin IX solution were mixed in a stoppered test tube and deaerated for 30 min under an ultrapure argon flow. Then, 0.05 ml of a 4 mM ferrous ammonium citrate solution was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 23°C and it was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 1 M NaOH. Heme content was assayed with the pyridine hemochromogen method.To determine the optimum pH for ferrochelatase activity, activity assays were carried out using a 0.1 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH values over the range of 6.8 to 9.7. The pH was measured at 20°C in the final reaction mixture. For the assays of ferrochelatase activity versus time of reaction, each assay contained a protein concentration of 0.105 μM.To examine the inhibition of ferrochelatase under these experimental conditions by the well studied inhibitor N-methylprotoporphyrin, stock solutions of N-methylprotoporphyrin were freshly prepared in Me2SO and then diluted into 0.1 N HCl. Each assay contained 235 μM ferrous ammonium sulfate, 235 μM deuteroporphyrin IX, and 0.4 μM ferrochelatase.Iron Determination57Fe was dissolved from metallic foil into diluted H2SO4 as described previously(32Ravi N. Bollinger J.M. Huynh B.H. Edmondson D.E. Stubbe J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 8007-8014Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). After dissolution, the iron content was determined using a ferrozine colorimetric method(33Stookey L.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 779-781Crossref Scopus (3531) Google Scholar). A standard curve was made using an atomic absorption ferric standard solution. Total iron content (Fe2++ Fe3+) was determined by adding ascorbic acid to the assay mixture, while the ferrous content was determined in an assay that did not include ascorbic acid. In all cases the ferric content was small (<5%).Mössbauer SpectroscopyMössbauer spectroscopy was employed both to describe and quantitate the reaction product in an activity assay and to define the nature of the iron-binding site. To investigate the iron-binding site, a ferrous control was prepared as follows: 0.35 ml of a buffer solution (100 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, 1.5 M NaCl, and 1% sodium cholate) was placed in a Mössbauer sample cuvette at 23°C under argon flow and deaerated for 2 h. The lower pH is required here in order to prevent precipitation of Fe(OH)2. The sample was taken inside an anaerobic glove box (Vacuum Atmosphere Co.), and a stock solution of 57FeSO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. The sample was then allowed to incubate for 20 min before freezing in liquid nitrogen. A protein sample was prepared in parallel. Ferrochelatase was purified and concentrated to 1.75 mM in a buffer solution identical to that of the ferrous control described above. The protein sample was placed in a Mössbauer cuvette and deaerated in a stoppered tube under ultrapure argon flow for 2 h while on ice. The sample was taken inside the glove box, and 57FeSO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM (the reason for using such a small amount of iron is discussed under “Results”). The solution was stirred and left to incubate for 20 min at 23°C. The sample was then frozen in liquid nitrogen without exposure to air.To study the interactions of ferrous ion, ferrochelatase, and DTT, a Mössbauer sample was prepared containing 1 mM57FeSO4 and 400 mM DTT in a pH 7.5 buffer as described above (sample volume is 0.35 ml). A sample was also prepared containing 310 nmol of ferrochelatase and 280 nmol of 57FeSO4; initially, this sample also contained 390 nmol of DTT. After recording the Mössbauer spectrum, a concentrated DTT stock solution was added to increase the DTT:protein ratio to 23:1 and finally to 90:1. The Mössbauer spectrum was recorded at each ratio.To quantitate and characterize the heme product, a ferrochelatase activity assay was carried out with enough material for quantitation by both the Mössbauer method and by the pyridine hemochromogen UV-visible method. The reaction mixture was prepared as follows. All reagents were deaerated as described above. In a stoppered, acid-cleaned test tube, 0.894 ml of 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5 buffer containing 20% glycerol, 1.5 M NaCl, and 1% sodium cholate was mixed with 6 μl of 74 μM ferrochelatase and 74 μl of 13.6 mM deuteroporphyrin solution. After sufficient deaeration, 26 μl of 39 mM57FeSO4 was added with a gastight syringe. The reaction was allowed to proceed under argon pressure at 24°C for 2 h, at which time 0.4 ml was transferred to a Mössbauer sample cuvette and 0.1 ml of pyridine and 0.025 ml of 4 M NaOH added. This sample was stirred and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The remainder was added to 0.75 ml of 1 M NaOH and taken for the pyridine hemochromogen assay.Mössbauer spectra were recorded on a constant-acceleration spectrometer. The instrument is equipped with a Janis 8DT variable-temperature cryostat and all measurements reported here were collected at 4.2 K. The zero velocity of the Mössbauer spectra is referenced to the centroid of the room temperature spectrum of a metallic iron foil.RESULTSDuring ferrochelatase activity determinations, we noticed that a solution of iron citrate (which is largely ferric in aerobic situations) and DTT turn a brilliant red color when mixed; this red complex slowly turns to a green color, presumably as the excess DTT reduces the ferric ion. The presence of these colored species made us suspect that DTT may be capable of binding substrate iron ions and hence interfering with the enzymatic activity. We therefore investigated this possibility with kinetic measurements and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Table 1 summarizes the effects of aerobicity and presence of DTT on ferrochelatase activity. Without DTT and in the presence of air, the enzyme activity is minimal. This is understood in terms of the oxidation state of the iron. DTT is a reductant capable of keeping iron in the ferrous state. Without it, in the presence of oxygen, the ferrous ion is expected to oxidize to the ferric form, which is not a substrate for ferrochelatase. When DTT is added to an aerobic assay, activity is observed. However, activity is increased in the anaerobic assays. Importantly, maximum activity is seen in the absence of both oxygen and DTT. The anaerobic assay that includes DTT shows only about half the activity of the assay without DTT. This difference is likely due to the ability of DTT thiol groups to competitively chelate ferrous ion and keep it from the protein. The kinetic experiments summarized here cannot directly confirm this hypothesis, but they do clearly show that DTT is not needed and that it in fact interferes with ferrochelatase activity. The lower activity seen in the aerobic assay with DTT versus the anaerobic assay with DTT possibly reflects the documented susceptibility of the heme product to attack by thiols in the presence of oxygen(30Porra R.J. Vitols K.S. Labbe R.F. Newton N.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For these reasons we performed all subsequent measurements anaerobically and without DTT.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Mössbauer spectroscopy was employed to investigate the chemical environment of the substrate ferrous ion and to study the binding of ferrous ion to the enzyme. Spectra are shown in Fig. 1 and were collected at 4.2 K in the absence of an external magnetic field. Fig. 1A is the spectrum of the ferrous control in a pH 7.5 buffer. The line shapes are non-Lorentzian and cannot be fit with a single quadrupole doublet. The ferrous ion here is expected to be found in a variety of configurations and its nuclear energy levels would probably be best described with a distribution of energies. Because of this a curve fit to these data is not meaningful and therefore we report only the average values for the isomer shift d and quadrupolar splitting ΔEQ (1.39 and 3.25 mm/s, respectively). These values are consistent with high spin ferrous ions in a nitrogenous/oxygenous ligand environment (34Huynh B.H. Kent T.A. Eichhorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. Advances in Inorganic Biochemistry. 6. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 163-223Google Scholar) and the lack of ferric species confirms the anaerobicity of our sample preparation.Figure 1Mössbauer spectra of ferrous ion binding to ferrochelatase.

Sample preparation was similar to that of the ferrous control described above, except that the buffer solution also contained 1.75 mM ferrochelatase. The decision to use such a small amount of iron was based on the following considerations. If we assume a simple equilibrium model with three components (ferrochelatase, ferrous iron, and the enzyme-substrate complex) and define the dissociation constant for Fe(II) as KDFe=[E][Fe(II)][E-Fe(II)](Eq. 1) where [E] and [Fe(II)] are concentrations of the free ferrochelatase and unbound ferrous ion, respectively, and [E-Fe(II)] is the concentration of the complex, the ratio R of bound iron to total iron can be written as R=12{1+KDFe[Fe(II)]o+[E]o[Fe(II)]o-(1+KDFe[Fe(II)]o+[E]o[Fe(II)]o)-4[E]o[Fe(II)]o}(Eq. 2) Here [Fe(II)]o is the total concentration of iron and [E]o represents the total concentration of enzyme capable of binding iron. It may be clearly seen from that, for a given [E]o and Kd, R will be greatest for a small [Fe(II)]o. Approximating Kd with the previously determined KmFe (112 μM)(23Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may be taken as a measure of the affinity of the active site for ferrous ion, R approaches 1.0 for [E]o≈ 2 mM and [Fe(II)]o≈ 10-1 mM. Consequently, under such conditions, the Mössbauer spectrum will represent the protein-bound Fe(II) species.Two distinct species, both quadrupole doublets, are seen in the spectrum of Fig. 1B.

In the present studies, monocyte procoagulants and different GAGs including chondroitin sulfate (CS) A, CSB, CSC, CSD, CSE, and heparan sulfate, were tested either in clotting assays with whole plasma or in chromogenic assays with purified coagulation proteases. Procoagulant activity in plasma was inhibited by three of the seven GAGs, including heparan sulfate, CSE, and CSB. In contrast, activity of purified coagulation protease was inhibited only by CSE, and the inhibition was observed with intrinsic (factor VIIIa/IXa) but not extrinsic (tissue factor/factor VII) components. Reciprocal titration experiments with enzyme and substrate and Scatchard type analyses were consistent with concentration-dependent inhibitory interactions between CSE and sites on both factor VIIIa and IXa. On purified phospholipids, CSE concentration resulting in half-maximal inhibition (Ki) was 5 ng/ml for interaction with factor IXa and >500 ng/ml for interaction with factor VIIIa. The Ki values were lower for reactions on purified lipid than for reactions on monocyte surfaces and for reactions on resting than on endotoxin-stimulated monocytes. Experiments with CSE oligosaccharides of defined size indicated that the smallest CSE fragment capable of inhibitory activity was composed of 12-18 monosaccharide units. Collectively, these results indicate that factor X-activating reactions are inhibited by GAGs expressed on monocyte membranes. Inhibition is specific with respect to the structure of both the GAG and the activating protease. Lack of inhibition by added CSA, CSB, and CSC in contrast to CSE strongly suggests a direct role of 4,6-di-O-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine GAG structures in the inhibition of intrinsic pathway protease. These findings also suggest potential pharmacologic use of CSE as specific anticoagulant in the management of prothrombotic states mediated by intrinsic pathway coagulation reactions.

Experiments with CSE oligosaccharides of defined size indicated that the smallest CSE fragment capable of inhibitory activity was composed of 12-18 monosaccharide units. Collectively, these results indicate that factor X-activating reactions are inhibited by GAGs expressed on monocyte membranes. Inhibition is specific with respect to the structure of both the GAG and the activating protease. Lack of inhibition by added CSA, CSB, and CSC in contrast to CSE strongly suggests a direct role of 4,6-di-O-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine GAG structures in the inhibition of intrinsic pathway protease. These findings also suggest potential pharmacologic use of CSE as specific anticoagulant in the management of prothrombotic states mediated by intrinsic pathway coagulation reactions."

Hypermethylation within the SRE of the low density lipoprotein receptor promoter was observed when cells were treated with cholesterol synthesis inhibitors, insulin, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, suggesting that the SRE regulates this promoter through sterol-independent as well as sterol-dependent mechanisms. No significant changes were observed in binding to the Sp1-like sites, suggesting that differential binding to these sites does not play a role in altered transcription levels.

Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4516) Google Scholar)). The expression of these genes is highly regulated in order to provide the cell with sufficient cholesterol for normal growth and function. Because of the importance of these genes for a variety of cellular processes, both are subject to regulation by multiple signals. LDLR expression is primarily controlled transcriptionally(2Sudhof T.C. Van Der Westhuyzen D.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10773-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while HMGR expression is controlled transcriptionally, translationally, and post-translationally(3Clarke P.R. Hardie D.G.

Effectors of LDLR and HMGR transcription include a variety of mitogenic and nonmitogenic signals including phorbol esters(5Auwerx J.H. Chait A. Wolfbauer G. Deeb S.S. Mol. Cell.

Work on localization of the DNA elements responsible for regulation of the LDLR and HMGR genes has focused primarily on the role of sterols. There is a conserved octanucleotide sequence in these promoters as well as in other cholesterol regulated genes that has been termed the sterol regulatory element (SRE)(11Metherall J.E.

Chem. 1988; 263: 18480-18487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, single nucleotide mutagenesis has revealed functional differences between the LDLR and HMGR sequences, suggesting that only part of the conserved octanucleotide is functional in the HMGR promoter and that additional sequences upstream are important(13Osborne T.F.

Two related proteins, SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, bind specifically to the LDLR SRE and have been shown to be critically involved in sterol regulation(15Osborne T.F. Bennett M. Rhee K. J. Biol.

In addition to the SRE, other DNA elements corresponding to protein binding sites have been identified in both promoters. The binding of multiple factors to these promoters has been shown via in vitro DNase protection experiments and transfections using mutated promoters(2Sudhof T.C. Van Der Westhuyzen D.R.

Cell. 1987; 48: 1061-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the HMGR promoter, a number of nuclear factor 1-like sites have been characterized by DNaseI protection while Sp1-like sites have been found flanking the SRE in the LDLR promoter (20Dawson P.A.

Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19009-19019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the Sp1 consensus site is highlighted by the deleterious effects of a single base mutation that causes familial hypercholesterolemia(25Koivisto U.-M. Palvimo J.J. Janne I.A. Kontula K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10526-10530Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The sequence and previously characterized regulatory elements in the two promoter regions (26Luskey K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1881-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Sudhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Russell D.W. Science. 1985; 228: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) are indicated (Fig. 1). The in vitro DNaseI protection data have yielded valuable insight into regulation of these genes, but these experiments suffer from nonphysiological protein and DNA concentrations, making in vivo relevance uncertain. To directly address these concerns, we have examined protein-DNA interactions in known regulatory regions of the LDLR and HMGR promoters in Jurkat T cells and HepG2 cells. These experiments, coupled with those reported earlier in human fibroblasts and hepatocytes(28Ellsworth J.L. Lloyd D.B. Carlstrom A.J. Thompson J.F. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), provide insight into the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in a variety of cell systems. By examining alterations in the DMS-induced DNA cleavage pattern(29Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), we are able to confirm and extend a number of in vitro observations as well as provide data regarding the effect of various physiological conditions on protein binding in the LDLR and HMGR promoters. HepG2 and Jurkat T cells (both obtained from the ATCC) were grown at 37°C in 5% CO2. HepG2 cells were grown in DMEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) and Jurkat cells in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). DMS treatment and polymerase chain reaction conditions for the LDLR promoter have been described previously(28Ellsworth J.L. Lloyd D.B. Carlstrom A.J. Thompson J.F. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 0.5% DMS for 1 min, spun down, and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. DNA was prepared as described previously (29Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) and then denatured at 90°C for 10 min in 200 μl of 20 mM KPO4, 1 mM EDTA, chilled on ice, and cleaved by adding 2 μl of 10 M NaOH and heating for 5 min at 90°C. The cleaved DNA was extended with Sequenase and a primer homologous to −255 to −240 in the LDLR promoter or +2 to −12 in the HMGR promoter. A double-stranded oligo was ligated to the extended DNA as described previously (29Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) and amplified with one of the ligation oligos and a primer complementary to −187 to −167 in LDLR or −14 to −33 in HMGR. Amplification was done for 25 cycles (1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 66°C, 3 min at 76°C) with native Taq polymerase, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.35), 50 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mM dNTPs, and the mixture was overlaid with mineral oil. Labeling of the mix was accomplished by adding 5′ end-labeled oligo (homologous to −185 to −155 for LDLR and to −17 to −46 for HMGR), fresh polymerase, dNTPs, and buffers, and treating for 2 min at 94°C, 2 min at 70°C, 10 min at 76°C. After ethanol precipitation, the samples were electrophoresed on a 6% acrylamide, 7 M urea gel. mRNA levels were determined using internally controlled reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction reactions. Primers specific for a given gene were used to amplify both cDNA and genomic DNA and were chosen so that a small intron would allow differentiation of the cDNA and genomic DNA on a polyacrylamide gel. Since the same primers are used to amplify both the cDNA and control genomic DNA, artifacts are minimized. LDLR primers were chosen in exons 13 and 14 to flank a 134-bp intron, generating fragments of 205 and 339 bp. For HMGR, primers were designed to flank short introns based on the hamster genomic structure. Primers homologous to 2614-2637 and 2881-2858 were found to generate appropriately sized fragments, 267 bp for the cDNA and about 390 bp for the genomic DNA. For each gene, one of the primers was labeled and used to amplify each gene for 25 cycles according to conditions provided by Perkin Elmer. Samples were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and quantitated using a Fuji PhosphorImager. The ratio of cDNA to genomic DNA was measured for each gene. This method of quantitation has been found to give results similar to Northerns but with less variability (data not shown). Close contacts between protein and DNA can be identified by using DMS to alkylate the N-7 of guanine or, at a slower rate, the N-3 of adenine. Proteins bound to DNA at or near these atoms in the major and minor grooves affect the DMS reactivity at these sites. Because DMS can penetrate the cell nucleus, information about protein binding in living cells can be obtained. Previously described conditions (29Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) were used as a starting point for the promoter sequences of interest. Conditions were chosen so that the correct sequence was readable from DNA treated with DMS in the absence of protein, and a low background for DNA not treated with DMS was obtained. The cleavage pattern obtained with DNA isolated from DMS-treated cells was compared with the cleavage pattern from DMS-treated, naked DNA. Differences in band intensity (either protection or hyperreactivity) are caused by protein-DNA interactions. The identity of the proteins binding in vivo can then be inferred from in vitro protection experiments with purified proteins or extracts. Because of the pivotal role of the liver in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, we chose the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, as a model for our protein binding studies. To distinguish tissue-specific effects, we have also examined an unrelated cell line, Jurkat T cells, for its basal response. Prior to determining the effect of transcriptional modulators on protein binding, it was first necessary to characterize the basal pattern. In the LDLR promoter, there are multiple differences between the naked DNA (Fig. 2, lane 1) and in vivo DNA (Fig. 2, lane 2) from Jurkat cells. The SRE region and both Sp1-like binding sites previously characterized in vitro are also occupied in vivo as strong protections are found throughout all three sites. Detailed information about the TATA box region cannot be obtained because its AT richness provides few cleavage sites. Some protein binding can be detected, however, with protection at −27 frequently observed. In the transcriptional start region, there is hyperreactivity at −5 and protection at +2 and +3. Distal to the SRE, positions −107, −109, −110, −113, and −116 are also protected even though no binding was observed at these positions in vitro, suggestive of proteins present in vivo that are not present in the nuclear extracts or cannot bind properly in that artificial environment. Weak protection of nucleotides −131, −138, −139, −140, and −146 was also observed (data not shown), consistent with the in vitro data. When the HMGR promoter is examined under the same conditions (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4), many regions of protection and hypermethylation are observed. In the SRE, positions −168 and −173 are protected, while −172 shows hyperreactivity. In the hamster HMGR promoter, three nuclear factor 1 binding sites (24Gil G. Osborne T.F. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19009-19019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been identified in the region we have characterized by in vivo footprinting. In the hamster promoter, one of these sites is a perfect match to the consensus TGGN7CCA(30Gronostajski R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5545-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), while the other footprints were proposed to be half-sites involved in heterodimeric binding(24Gil G. Osborne T.F. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19009-19019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the human promoter, there are four TGG half-sites, but none of the sequences match the complete consensus perfectly. All four of these half sites (−217 to −215, −195 to −193, −184 to −182, and −174 to −172) share the same modification pattern with the upstream G protected and the downstream G hyperreactive. These four sequences are each separated by a helical turn, suggesting that the bound proteins are on the same face of the helix. The two downstream half-sites match the regions shown to be important in sterol regulation in the hamster gene. Additional sites of protection are located throughout the promoter with especially strong sites at positions −113, −129, −133/−137/−139 (GC box), −144, −146, −178, and −185. HepG2 cells were cultured in two different media commonly used when studying lipoprotein regulation. Cells grown in DMEM plus 10% calf serum were exposed to DMS. Protein binding to the LDLR promoter (Fig. 3, lane 3) and to the HMGR promoter (Fig. 3, lane 7) was characterized. With the LDLR promoter, the DMS protection pattern is qualitatively the same as that seen with Jurkat cells, although somewhat less protection of the SRE and transcription start sites is seen. In contrast, the HMGR promoter contains many sites that are more strongly protected in the HepG2 cells than in the Jurkat cells. When the cells are switched to a defined, serum-free media, changes are seen in both promoters. While most of the LDLR footprint is unaffected by the inducing conditions (Fig. 3, lane 4), an increased hyperreactivity in the SRE at −59 and −61 was observed. Increased protection was observed over many areas of the HMGR promoter in the inducing conditions (Fig. 3, lane 8). Especially prominent is the hypermethylation at position −182, which changes to protection in serum-free medium. In order to better characterize the effect of transcription on protein binding, conditions known to induce changes in mRNA levels were examined. One of the most dramatic changes described previously is induced by phorbol esters, which increase LDLR transcription severalfold over 2-4 h(5Auwerx J.H. Chait A. Wolfbauer G. Deeb S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2298-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In order to see what effect this increased transcription would have on protein binding, cells were exposed to 0.2 μM PMA for 1-24 h, and separate aliquots used for DMS protection and mRNA analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, mRNA levels increase by 4.6-fold at 2 h with the increase falling to 1.8-fold at 24 h, similar to previous results(5Auwerx J.H. Chait A. Wolfbauer G. Deeb S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2298-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The only change in DMS protection that could be detected throughout the region examined was at position −59 in the SRE (Fig. 5). The extent of hypermethylation was observed to vary between experiments but could be observed as early as 1 h after the addition of PMA. Since this hypermethylation occurs concomitant with the increase in mRNA levels, it would appear that the change in protein binding indicated by hypermethylation is needed for the transcriptional increase. This is similar to the observation that fibroblasts exposed to cholesterol synthesis inhibitors or oxysterols change protein binding to the LDLR promoter prior to a change in transcription(28Ellsworth J.L. Lloyd D.B. Carlstrom A.J. Thompson J.F. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A slight increase in the HMGR mRNA levels was observed in PMA-treated HepG2 cells at 1 and 2 h with a decrease at 24 h (Fig. 4). A 2.3-fold increase in HMGR was observed previously in THP-1 cells, but no data were provided for HepG2 cells(31Auwerx J.H. Chait A. Deeb S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). No effects on the HMGR promoter footprint pattern were observed in response to PMA (data not shown). When HepG2 cells are incubated in a defined, serum-free medium (SSF)(32Murakami H. Masui H. Sato G.H. Sueoka N. Chow T.P. Kano-Sueoka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), addition of insulin stimulates an increase in LDLR mRNA (6Wade D.P. Knight B.L. Soutar A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Mazzone T. Basheeruddin K. Piang L. Frazer S. Getz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1787-1792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found an increase in LDLR mRNA levels of similar magnitude. HepG2 cells incubated for 2-6 h with insulin-containing serum-free media contained 1.4-fold more LDLR mRNA (data not shown). In these conditions, there is hypermethylation at position −59 in the SRE of the LDLR promoter relative to cells incubated in the absence of insulin (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the stimulatory effect of insulin on LDLR gene expression is mediated at least in part through alterations in protein binding to the SRE region. This is consistent with previous results that indicated the addition of lipoproteins could not effectively eliminate the insulin induction of LDLR(6Wade D.P. Knight B.L. Soutar A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that there is a 9 of 11 bp match between a region of the SRE sequence and a region in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene promoter shown to be involved in its insulin responsiveness (34, Fig. 1). Insulin induces no reproducible footprint changes in the HMGR promoter under the same conditions, even though a 1.5-fold increase in HMGR mRNA levels was observed (data not shown). Ketoconazole induces an up-regulation of the LDLR and HMGR promoters (35Takagi K. Alvarez J.G. Favata M.F. Trzaskos J.M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12352-12357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by reducing the availability of endogenous cholesterol. Ketoconazole treatment of HepG2 cells was found to increase LDLR mRNA levels 2.7-fold (results with fibroblasts yielded a 2.9-fold increase(28Ellsworth J.L. Lloyd D.B. Carlstrom A.J. Thompson J.F. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Ketoconazole also yields a distinct and reproducible change in the LDLR DNA binding pattern in HepG2 cells (Fig. 7). There is strong hypermethylation at position −59 (SRE) of the LDLR promoter when cells are incubated in either DMEM or serum-free medium containing ketoconazole. When cells are incubated in DMEM, ketoconazole additionally increases the protection within both Sp1-like binding sites of the LDLR promoter. When the HMGR promoter is examined after addition of ketoconazole, there are no dramatic changes, although a 2.6-fold increase in HMGR mRNA is observed (data not shown). The genes encoding LDL receptor and HMG CoA reductase are involved not only in regulating cholesterol homeostasis but also in other processes, many of which are specific for either LDLR or HMGR. Thus, there must be some sharing of regulatory signals while still allowing for independent inputs. Major changes in protein binding to these promoters do not occur upon transcriptional induction or between cell types. The changes we do see are focused primarily on the SRE regions of both genes (data summarized in Fig. 8). Our data are consistent with previous in vitro data on the regulation of these genes. We are also able to extend previous observations and rule out certain proposed models. In all of the conditions tested, there is virtually no change in binding to the Sp1-like sites flanking the SRE in the LDLR promoter, arguing against a major regulatory role for these sites in transcription. However, these sites are important for transcription based on both in vivo and in vitro data(2Sudhof T.C. Van Der Westhuyzen D.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10773-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Koivisto U.-M. Palvimo J.J. Janne I.A. Kontula K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10526-10530Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The constancy of binding that we observe suggests a structural role in assembling the appropriate protein-DNA complex needed for transcription. It seems likely that proteins bound to these sites may serve as a scaffold for the binding of other regulatory proteins rather than carry out that function themselves. The clear in vitro demonstration that Sp1 is able to bind to the sites flanking the SRE and the similarity of these sequences to the Sp1 consensus sequence have led to the obvious conclusion that Sp1 is binding in vivo. However, the modification patterns we observe are not completely consistent with this interpretation and suggest that there may be Sp1-like proteins that are involved. When the modification patterns of the LDLR Sp1 sites are compared with 15 previously characterized Sp1 sites (including nine characterized in vivo, (36Gidoni D. Dynan W.S. Tjian R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1119-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)), differences are observed (Fig. 9). In all 15 sites, position seven is a guanine, and it is hypermethylated in all 13 non-LDLR sites. In contrast, this position is protected in the two LDLR sites. While this does not prove the presence of a novel protein, the cloning of a family of Sp1-related proteins (41Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 42Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) makes it a distinct possibility, especially since the LDLR sites are not perfect matches with the consensus sequence. Because of the central role that the liver plays in cholesterol homeostasis, the regulation of hepatic LDLR expression could potentially be very different than in other tissues. The basal protein binding pattern in the LDLR promoter is virtually identical in the Jurkat and HepG2 cells examined here and the primary fibroblasts and hepatocytes examined previously(28Ellsworth J.L. Lloyd D.B. Carlstrom A.J. Thompson J.F. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the basal protein binding pattern of the LDLR promoter does not change among these cell types, the DMS protection pattern of the SRE is altered upon transcriptional induction by ketoconazole, PMA, and insulin. In each case, the major alteration is at position −59. This could be caused either by new proteins binding to this region or by existing proteins being covalently modified or interacting with new partners. The recent cloning of proteins SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 (18Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) will provide reagents to aid in deciphering these possibilities. While the cultured cells are all striking in their sameness of protein binding to the LDLR promoter, primary hepatocytes differ from other cell types in that −59 is not hypermethylated upon induction(28Ellsworth J.L. Lloyd D.B. Carlstrom A.J. Thompson J.F. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result is not readily interpreted based on the hamster SREBP expression results. While the expression of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 is unchanged with transcription in cultured cells, the relative expression of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 is affected by transcription in the intact liver (18Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). If the primary hepatocytes mirror the intact liver, SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 would have to yield the same protection pattern when bound to the SRE. The hypermethylation of −59 in cultured cells would then be explained not by a new protein binding to the SRE but by DNA distortion caused by more long range interactions. Additional information about the expression and processing of the SREBPs will be required to help resolve these questions. Previous work has suggested that distinct proteins bind the SREs of the LDLR and HMGR genes(13Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13947-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Smith J.R. Osborne T.F. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2306-2310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homologous positions in the SRE consensus sequences are differentially methylated in Jurkat cells, supporting this conclusion. In HepG2 cells, however, the same conclusion cannot be drawn because the HMGR SRE protection pattern is similar to that seen in the LDLR SRE. The DMS profiles of purified proteins may now be undertaken to clarify the in vivo binding patterns. These data suggest that the SRE and the protein(s) that bind to it are involved in regulating many, but not all, aspects of LDLR transcription. While the in vivo interactions identified here do not answer many of the questions about how these important genes are regulated, this information can be used to help focus future in vitro binding studies to provide a clearer picture of how these genes are regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2108464148,"To investigate the mechanisms governing the expression of DNA topoisomerase II alpha, the Chinese hamster topoisomerase II alpha gene has been cloned and the promoter region analyzed. There are several transcriptional start sites clustered in a region of 30 base pairs, with the major one being 102 nucleotides upstream from the ATG translation initiation site. Sequencing data reveal one GC box and a total of five inverted CCAAT elements (ICEs) within a region of 530 base pairs upstream from the major transcription start site. Sequence comparison between the human and Chinese hamster topoisomerase II alpha gene promoter regions shows a high degree of homology centered at the ICEs and GC box. In vitro DNase I footprinting results indicate protection by binding proteins at and around each ICE on both DNA strands. However, no obvious protection was observed for the GC box. Competition gel mobility shift assays with oligonucleotides containing either the wild-type or mutated ICE sequences suggest that identical or similar proteins specifically bind at each ICE, although with different affinities for individual ICE sequences. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays employing nested 5'-deletions of the 5'-flanking sequence of the gene demonstrate that the sequence between -186 and +102, which contains three proximal ICEs, is sufficient for near wild-type level of promoter activity. When these three ICEs were gradually replaced with sequences which do not interact with the binding proteins, reducing promoter activity of the resulted constructs was observed. In conjunction with results from footprinting and gel mobility shift studies, the transient gene expression finding suggests that the ICEs are functionally important for the transcriptional regulation of the topoisomerase II alpha gene."
https://openalex.org/W1994179665,"Phosphorylation of the polyomavirus major capsid protein VP1 plays a role in virus assembly and may function in virus-cell recognition. Previous mapping of the in vivo phosphorylation sites on VP1 identified phosphorylation of threonine residues Thr-63 and Thr-156 (Li, M., and Garcea, R. L.(1994) J. Virol. 68, 320-327). Phosphoserine was detected in a tryptic phosphopeptide encompassing residues 58-78. Because of consensus casein kinase II (CK II) sites in this peptide, we examined the in vitro phosphorylation of the purified recombinant VP1 protein by CK II. CK II phosphorylated VP1 on serine, and the resulting tryptic phosphopeptide eluted in a 30-31 min high performance liquid chromatography fraction corresponding to residues 58-78. The VP1 tryptic phosphopeptide also co-migrated in two-dimensional peptide analysis with one of the tryptic peptides obtained from VP1 isolated after in vivo32P labeling of virus-infected cells. A site-directed mutant VP1 protein, Ser-66 to Ala, was phosphorylated poorly by CK II in vitro. As determined by electron microscopy, all of the mutant proteins were isolated in pentameric form similar to the wild-type protein, although the Ala-66 pentamers had a tendency to self-assemble in vitro into tubular as well as capsid-like structures. These findings identify Ser-66 as a site of VP1 phosphorylation in vitro, and suggest that VP1 may serve as a substrate for CK II in vivo. Phosphorylation of the polyomavirus major capsid protein VP1 plays a role in virus assembly and may function in virus-cell recognition.

INTRODUCTIONThe polyomavirus capsid is composed of 72 pentamers of the major coat protein VP1(1Rayment I. Baker T.S. Caspar D.L.D. Murakami W.T. Nature. 1982; 295: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The minor capsid proteins VP2 and VP3 are present in approximately one-tenth the abundance of VP1 in the virion and play an unknown structural role(2Tooze J. DNA Tumor Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar). VP1 is synthesized late in the viral lytic cycle and transported to the nucleus of the infected cells where encapsidation of the viral minichromosome occurs. Studies have suggested that post-translational modifications of VP1 play an important role in virus assembly and cell infection(3Garcea R.L. Benjamin T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3613-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Bolen J.B. Anders D.G. Trempy J. Consigli R. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 80-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bolen J.B. Consigli R.A. J.

VP1 is phosphorylated in serine and threonine residues(7Anders D.G. Consigli R.A. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 206-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Garcea R.L. Ballmer-Hofer K. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 311-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we mapped the phosphorylation sites of VP1 isolated from virus-infected mouse cells(9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Threonine phosphorylation of VP1 was identified on residues Thr-63 and Thr-156 in the BC and DE loops, respectively, which are exposed on the exterior viral surface(10Stehle T. Yan Y. Benjamin T.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). A defect in virus assembly was associated with a mutation at threonine 156(9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serine sites, although present in the same tryptic phosphopeptides as the threonine sites, could not be assigned because viruses reconstructed with mutations at these serine residues were nonviable.Polyoma host-range nontransforming mutant viruses have genetic alterations in both middle and small tumor (T)-antigens, and are defective in cell transformation in vitro and tumor induction in vivo(11Benjamin T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 695: 69-95PubMed Google Scholar). The host-range nontransforming mutant viruses are blocked in virus assembly when grown on nonpermissive cells(3Garcea R.L. Benjamin T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3613-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The assembly defect of host-range nontransforming mutant viruses is associated with underphosphorylation of VP1 on threonine(8Garcea R.L. Ballmer-Hofer K. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 311-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo phosphate labeling of VP1 during host-range nontransforming mutant virus infections showed that phosphorylation of VP1 on both residues Thr-63 and Thr-156 was defective(9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This regulation could be controlled by activation of a cellular kinase, e.g. pp60c-src, or inactivation of a specific phosphatase, e.g. phosphatase 2A, both activities known to be associated with middle T-antigen(12Courtneidge S.A. Smith A.E. Nature. 1983; 303: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 13Pallas D.C. Shahrik L.K. Martin B.L. Jaspers S. Miller T.B. Brautigan D.L. Roberts T.M.

A. 1990; 87: 2521-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). VP1 serine phosphorylation appears constitutive, however, at least in the presence of an intact large T-antigen(8Garcea R.L. Ballmer-Hofer K. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 311-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Casein kinase II (CK II) 1The abbreviations used are: CK IIcasein kinase IIHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a ubiquitous cyclic nucleotide independent serine-threonine kinase present in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm(15Edelman A.M. Blumenthal D.K. Krebs E.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 567-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 16Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar). CK II is activated rapidly when cells are treated with certain growth factors such as serum, epidermal growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor (17Ackerman P. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11958-11965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15872-15875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Carroll D. Marshak D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7345-7348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that CK II plays an important role in cellular activities related to cell growth and proliferation(20Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 21Takio K. Kuenzel E.A. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4851-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This enzyme has a number of substrates including MYC and p53(22Lüscher B. Kuenzel E.A. Krebs E.G. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 23Meek D.W. Simon S. Kikkawa U. Eckhart W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition, CK II activity is stimulated by many of the agents that activate c-fos transcription(18Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15872-15875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sommercorn J. Mulligan J.A. Lozeman F.J. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These substrates suggest that CK II may link signal transduction pathways and nuclear proteins that control cell proliferation(26Lorenz P. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2733-2739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pepperkok R. Lorenz P. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6986-6991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CK II has also been found to phosphorylate structural and nonstructural viral proteins such as SV40 large T-antigen and varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein(28Grose C. Jackson W. Traugh J.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3912-3918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Grèsser F.A. Scheidtmann K.H. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Walter G. Virology. 1988; 165: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The data presented in this report show that the polyomavirus major capsid protein VP1 is also phosphorylated by CK II.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Virus InfectionA31 (Balb/c3T3) mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cell culture was performed as previously described(30Garcea R.L. Talmage D.A. Harmatz A. Freund R. Benjamin T.L. Virology. 1989; 168: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The wild-type polyomavirus strain used was NG59RA. Virus infections were performed at multiplicities of 5-10 plaque forming units/cell in A31 mouse fibroblasts at approximately 50% confluence. Following adsorption of polyomavirus, fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% calf serum was added.In Vivo [32P]Orthophosphate LabelingCells were grown in 100-mm plates and infected with polyomavirus. At 25-28 h postinfection, cells were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and labeled with 2 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (specific activity 900 mCi/mmol) in 1 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% dialyzed calf serum for 4-6 h(9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).VP1 ImmunoprecipitationPolyomavirus-infected monolayers were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA: 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The soluble lysate was incubated with a rabbit anti-VP1 polyclonal antiserum (I58) at 4°C for 1 h(31Moreland R.B. Montross L. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Montross L. Watkins S. Moreland R.B. Mamon H. Caspar D.L.D. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4991-4998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immune complexes were adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia) by a further incubation for 1 h at 4°C. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and twice with water.HPLC Phosphopeptide MappingImmunoprecipitated VP1 was removed from the protein A-Sepharose beads with SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.625 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol) by heating for 5 min at 100°C. VP1 was resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose with a dry blot apparatus (Hoeffer) as described(9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with 0.1% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid for 5 min and destained in 1% acetic acid and washed with water. The VP1 band was excised and incubated at 37°C for 30 min in 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 dissolved in 100 mM acetic acid(33Aebersold R. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, New York1989: 73-88Google Scholar). Excess polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 was removed by washing with water 5 times, and the nitrocellulose paper was then cut into small pieces. VP1 on nitrocellulose was digested with trypsin in enzyme buffer (100 mM NaHCO2, pH 8.2), acetonitrile, 95:5 (v/v), at 37°C overnight. The ratio of trypsin to VP1 was approximately 1:20 (w/w). The nitrocellulose was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and lyophilized under vacuum. The tryptic peptide pellets were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was then analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 column. Peptides were separated with a linear gradient from 0 to 70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid applied with a flow rate of 200 μl/min over 60 min. The fractions were collected every 1 min. Phosphorylated peptides were detected by scintillation counting.Phosphoamino Acid AnalysisThe 32P-labeled VP1 isolated by immunoprecipitation from in vivo32P-labeled polyomavirus-infected cells or recombinant protein phosphorylated in vitro was used for phosphoamino acid analysis. After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting to Immobilon-P membrane, the VP1 band was hydrolyzed with HCl(34LeGendre N. Matsudaira P. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, New York1989: 51-69Google Scholar). The hydrolysate was then dissolved in 5 ml of two-dimensional buffer (7.5% acetic acid, 2.5% formic acid, 0.1% Orange G) plus 1 mg/ml phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, and spotted onto Cel 300 TLC plates (Alltech). Electrophoresis was performed in 7.5% acetic acid, 2.5% formic acid (pH 1.9) for 60 min at 1200 V. Phosphoamino acids were stained by spraying with 0.1% ninhydrin in acetone, and developed at 80°C. The plate was exposed to Kodak film at −70°C.Phosphopeptide Mapping by Two-dimensional ElectrophoresisPhosphopeptides of VP1 obtained either from direct tryptic digestion or after HPLC purification were used in two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. The peptide fragments were spotted to a Cell 300 TLC plate with 5 μl of two-dimensional buffer. The first dimension electrophoresis was performed in the buffer described for the phosphoamino acid analysis. The second dimension was thin-layer chromatography in 38% 1-butanol, 25% pyridine, 7.5% acetic acid orthogonal to the first dimension(9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were detected by autoradiography.Site-directed Mutagenesis and Construction of Mutant VirusesMutations were introduced into the VP1 coding region of polyomavirus using a Muta-Gene M13 in vitro Mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). The VP1 sequence of polyomavirus cloned into M13 mp19 was used as the template for mutagenesis(9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A serine to alanine mutation was introduced at residue 66 of VP1 using the 25-mer CCCACCCCTGAAGCCCTAACAGAGG, and a serine to alanine change at residue 77 using CTATGGTTGGGCCAGAGGGATTAAT. The mutated VP1 sequence was verified by dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing using the Sequenase System (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Mutant viruses Gly-63 and Ala-153 have been described(9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant polyomavirus genomes were reconstructed by ligation of the mutant fragment into a wild-type virus(9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reconstructed mutant virus DNA was transfected into A31 cells by using the DEAE-dextran method(35McCutchan J.H. Pagano J.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1968; 41: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar). Virus lysates were obtained by subculturing the transfected cells every 3-4 days until an extensive cytopathic effect developed. Viral DNA was isolated by the method of Hirt (36Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar) and purified using Geneclean II Kit (BIO 101).Recombinant VP1 Expression and PurificationThe vector ptacVP1 was used for expression of VP1 in Escherichia coli(37Leavitt A.D. Roberts T.M. Garcea R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12803-12809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vectors to express site-directed mutant and carboxyl-terminal deleted forms of VP1 in E. coli were prepared using ptacVP1. The site-directed mutant VP1 was constructed by inserting the HindIII-XbaI fragment of the reconstructed mutant polyomavirus into HindIII-XbaI-digested ptacVP1. Carboxyl-terminal deletions of VP1 were constructed as described (38Garcea R.L. Salunke D.M. Caspar D.L.D. Nature. 1987; 329: 86-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with slight modification. The plasmid ptacVP1 containing the introduced mutation was digested with NcoI, and the large DNA fragment was isolated using Geneclean II Kit (BIO 101). This fragment was then digested with S1 nuclease. The blunt-ended DNA was ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The truncated VP1 protein was purified as described (37Leavitt A.D. Roberts T.M. Garcea R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12803-12809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In Vitro Phosphorylation of VP1 and VP1 Peptides by Casein Kinase IIVP1 obtained after the phosphocellulose purification step was dialyzed into kinase buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The phosphorylation of VP1 was carried out in kinase buffer containing 30 μg of VP1, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol), and 20 ng of CK II (Upstate Biotechnology) or 200 microunits of CK II (Boehringer-Mannheim) for 1 h at 30°C. Enzymes from both vendors gave equivalent results. CK II phosphorylation of VP1 immunoprecipitates from virus-infected cells was performed by washing the immunoprecipitates twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with kinase buffer. 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was then added with or without CK II.The peptides GQPPTPESLTEGGQYYGWSRGINC and DVHGFNKPTDTVNTKGISTPVEGC, corresponding to residues 59-81 and 138-160 of VP1, were reacted with CK II in kinase buffer. The 32P-labeled peptide was spotted on Immobilon-P membrane and free [γ-32P]ATP eluted with water. The peptide was then subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis.Electron MicroscopyVP1 proteins obtained after the phosphocellulose purification step were incubated in 2 M NaCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), for 4 days at 4°C. Samples were applied to glow-discharged carbon-coated 400 mesh grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were taken on a Philips CM 10 electron microscope at a magnification of approximately 40,000.RESULTSIn Vitro Phosphorylation of VP1 by Casein Kinase IISequences in VP1 containing a CK II phosphorylation site motif ((S/T)XX(D/E)) were identified by inspection. The presence of these putative sites prompted us to investigate whether CK II could phosphorylate VP1 in vitro. Recombinant VP1 proteins, purified after expression in E. coli, were used as substrates in in vitro kinase reactions with CK II. These proteins are purified as pentamers which resemble the capsomeric subunits of the virion(39Salunke D.M. Caspar D.L.D. Garcea R.L.

Because the full-length protein has the potential for self-assembly into capsid-like structures in vitro(39Salunke D.M. Caspar D.L.D. Garcea R.L. Cell. 1986; 46: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), a carboxyl-terminal 63 amino acid deleted form of VP1 (ΔNCOVP1;(38Garcea R.L. Salunke D.M. Caspar D.L.D. Nature. 1987; 329: 86-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)) which is unable to assemble into capsids but is otherwise structurally intact, was also tested as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 1, recombinant VP1 was phosphorylated by CK II. The minor Coomassie Blue-stained band in lanes 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A) migrating slightly above the position of the ΔNCOVP1 band in lanes 3 and 4, represents a proteolytic cleavage product of VP1, which has deleted the first 27 amino acids of the protein(31Moreland R.B. Montross L. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the partially proteolyzed species and ΔNCOVP1 were also substrates for CK II (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 4). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the kinased proteins revealed that CK II phosphorylated both VP1 and ΔNCOVP1 on serine only (Fig. 1C).Immunoprecipitates of VP1 from virus-infected cells were also tested for associated kinase activity by direct incubation with [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). No significant VP1 “autophosphorylation” was detected and the addition of CK II to the immunoprecipitates did not lead to increased VP1 phosphorylation. Mitogen-associated protein (p44), cdc2 (p34), and cdk2 kinases were also tested for their ability to phosphorylate VP1 in vitro. 2M. Li, personal observations. Mitogen-associated protein kinase did not phosphorylate VP1. cdc2 and cdk2 kinases did phosphorylate VP1 in vitro, but the tryptic phosphopeptides resulting from these reactions did not correspond with those seen in vivo (see below) and these enzymes were therefore not further characterized.Analysis of Phosphopeptides by HPLC and Two-dimensional Peptide MappingTo characterize the site(s) phosphorylated by CK II, we analyzed VP1 tryptic phosphopeptides by HPLC. Fig. 2 shows that two phosphopeptide peaks (30-31 min and 36-37 min fractions) were detected in VP1 isolated after in vivo32P labeling of polyomavirus-infected cells. In contrast, only one major phosphopeptide peak (30-31 min fraction) was detected for the recombinant VP1 protein phosphorylated by CK II in vitro, with a variable shoulder peak (28-29 min fraction). Tryptic phosphopeptides eluting in the 30-31 min and 36-37 min fractions have been previously identified as corresponding to residues 58-78 and 153-183, respectively(9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2HPLC analysis of VP1 tryptic phosphopeptides. VP1 was either labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate or in vitro by CK II.

Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the phosphopeptide in the 30-31 min fraction is phosphorylated on both threonine and serine residues (Fig. 2B, lane 1). The phosphopeptide in the 30-31 min fraction of in vitro CK II-kinased recombinant VP1 contained only phosphoserine (Fig. 2B, lane 2). These results suggest that phosphorylation of VP1 by CK II was primarily on serine sites between residues 58 and 78. In order to verify that the in vivo and in vitro phosphopeptides were identical, they were further analyzed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 3). The two-dimensional mapping showed that VP1 isolated from polyomavirus-infected mouse cells has three phosphopeptide spots (Fig. 3A)(9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide spots 1 and 2 contained phosphothreonine, and spot 3 phosphoserine (9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Recombinant VP1 protein phosphorylated by CK II showed a major phosphopeptide spot containing phosphoserine (Fig. 3B; data not shown). When 32P-labeled VP1 from polyomavirus-infected cells was mixed with the recombinant VP1 phosphorylated by CK II, spot 3 from the in vivo labeled VP1 co-migrated with the phosphopeptide generated by CK II (Fig. 3C). HPLC analysis showed that both spots 2 and 3 eluted in the 30-31 min fraction (9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). This result may be due to two different peptides eluting coincidently from the 30-31 min fraction, or the same peptide which has been differentially modified. The two-dimensional chromatography analysis supports the latter, suggesting that the peptide from residues 58 to 78 is phosphorylated on either threonine or serine residues, but not both, and each of these modifications yields a distinctive species in the two-dimensional chromatogram (spot 2 or 3).Figure 3Two-dimensional mapping of VP1 tryptic phosphopeptides.

This peptide was incubated with CK II in vitro, and phosphoamino acid analysis of the reaction product demonstrated phosphoserine (Fig. 4, lane 1). In addition, a peptide corresponding to residues 138-160 (the DE loop of VP1) was also phosphorylated by CK II (Fig. 4, lane 2). This peptide contains a potential consensus CK II site (residue Thr-156), a site phosphorylated in vivo. In vitro the intact protein is not phosphorylated in this region, but the synthetic peptide is phosphorylated on both serine and threonine. These results suggest that in the intact VP1 pentamer, potential CK II sites are conformationally distinct for kinase recognition.Figure 4BC and DE loop peptides of VP1 are phosphorylated by CK II in vitro. BC (lane 1) and DE (lane 2) loop peptides of VP1 were phosphorylated by CK II, and the phosphorylated peptides were analyzed for phosphoamino acids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)VP1 Is Phosphorylated by CK II on Serine 66Two serine residues, Ser-66 and Ser-77, are found between residues 58 and 78. Serine 66 is a CK II phosphorylation site based on the motif of (S/T)XX(D/E), whereas Ser-77 is not a consensus CK II site. Site-directed mutations were introduced into the polyomavirus genome, substituting alanine for serine at these residues. Neither reconstructed mutant virus (Ala-66 and Ala-77) could be isolated (9Li M. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 320-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown), and therefore determination of the in vivo phosphorylation site could not be confirmed in this manner. Both the Ala-66 and Ala-77 mutations were also introduced into the VP1 expression vector, ptacVP1. The mutant recombinant VP1 proteins were purified, and analyzed for phosphorylation by CK II. The wild-type VP1 and two additional proteins Gly-63 (Thr-63 to Gly) and Ala-156 (Thr-156 to Ala) as well as Ala-77 were phosphorylated by CK II, both as full-length and carboxyl-terminal deleted proteins (Fig. 5B). The mutant protein Ala-66 was not significantly phosphorylated by CK II (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 7). This result demonstrates that VP1 is phosphorylated in vitro on Ser-66, and not Ser-77, by CK II.Figure 5In vitro phosphorylation of mutant VP1 proteins by CK II.

This disease, which affects 1 out of 600 people of African descent born in the United States(2Rucknagel D.L. Sickle Cell Anemia and Other Hemoglobinopathies. Academic Press, New York1975: 1Google Scholar), is characterized by microvascular occlusion that results in painful episodes or “crises” and acute organ damage.

The kinetics of polymer formation and melting have important consequences in the pathogenesis of the disease. If HbS polymerization is slow enough so that during circulation in areas of hypoxia insufficient polymer is formed to alter the red blood cell shape and rigidity, and if the HbS that has begun to polymerize during circulation is melted immediately upon oxygenation at the lungs, then microvascular occlusion would be avoided. If, on the other hand, complete melting does not occur before the cell reaches an area of hypoxia, further polymerization would be facilitated. In fact, the kinetics of gelation (for review, see (3Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar)) and the double nucleation theory that describes these kinetics (4Ferrone F.A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Mol.

Thus the kinetics of polymerization and that of melting are important factors in determining whether or not vascular sequestration of sickle cells will occur. Whereas the kinetics of polymerization have been extensively studied, relatively few reports involving the kinetics of melting have been made (6Hofrichter J. Ross P.D. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Polymerization of HbS depends on several factors including pH, temperature, the presence of polyphosphates, hemoglobin concentration, and ligand pressure. Under physiological conditions, the most important of these factors is the ligation state. Thus religation kinetics could be a significant factor in polymer melting. When studied under conditions where HbS does not polymerize (below a critical concentration necessary for polymerization) it follows the same equilibrium binding curve as HbA(13Allen D.W. Wyman J. Rev. Hematol. 1954; 9: 155-157PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the kinetics associated with ligand rebinding following laser photolysis are the same for HbA and unpolymerized HbS(14Penneley R.R. Noble R.W. Biochemical and Chemical Aspects of Hemoglobin Abnormalities. Academic Press, New York1978: 401Google Scholar, 15Deyoung A. Noble R.W.

Due to partial alignment of the HbS polymers, a static linear dichroism (LD) is observed in heme absorption bands upon HbS gelation. This LD is a result of the heme groups being nearly parallel to each other and nearly perpendicular to the HbS polymer(23Hofrichter J. Hendricker D.G. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3604-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The hemes are near perfect planar absorbers of linearly polarized light(24Eaton W.A. Hochstrasser R.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1967; 46: 2533-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 25Eaton W.A. Hochstrasser R.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1968; 49: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus linearly polarized light is more strongly absorbed when the polarization axis is perpendicular to the long axis of the polymers. A spectral decomposition of measured static LD into oxygen bound and deoxy-hemoglobin components has been used to measure the equilibrium binding curve of HbS polymers(22Sunshine H.R. Hofrichter J. Ferrone F.A. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 158: 251-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It was found that the oxygen affinity of HbS polymers is about one-third that of T-state HbA. A similar study using carbon monoxide (CO) had been performed previously (26Hofrichter J. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 128: 335-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although this study found no evidence of CO bound to the HbS polymer in equilibrium, it was later suggested that if temperature affects are accounted for, the relative affinity of the polymer for CO would be the same as for oxygen(22Sunshine H.R. Hofrichter J. Ferrone F.A. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 158: 251-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Laser photolysis and time-resolved absorption studies have made important contributions to understanding kinetics associated with ligand rebinding to HbA (for reviews, see (27Chen E. Chance M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 119-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and (28Hofrichter J. Ansari A. Jones C.M. Deutsch R.M. Sommer J.H. Henry E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 387-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). Since most of the ligand bound in a partially saturated HbS solution will be bound to the monomer (a single HbS tetramer) phase, it would be difficult or impossible to detect religation to polymer in a time-resolved absorption experiment. We have thus implemented time-resolved LD (TRLD) measurements to study religation to HbS polymers. After ligand photolysis, a transient LD is observed between directions parallel and perpendicular to the polarization of the actinic light. The polarized actinic light beam photoselects hemes that are parallel to its polarization. Thus, soon after photolysis, there will be more deoxy-hemes parallel to the actinic polarization and more ligand bound hemes in the direction perpendicular to this polarization. The photoinduced LD due to HbS in the monomer phase disappears upon orientational randomization resulting from rotational diffusion. On the other hand, the LD due to photoselected deligation of HbS polymer hemes decays with kinetics dominated by polymer religation because the polymers rotate slowly or not at all. The difference of the linear dichroism (defined as absorption parallel to the laser polarization minus that perpendicular), measured on a HbS gel taken at a time following photolysis when the monomers have rotated into an isotropic distribution, minus the static linear dichroism gives a deoxy-carboxy difference spectrum. This transient-difference linear dichroism signal may also arise due to the presence of partial order in the polymer gel, with the transient polymer state being primarily deoxy. Thus the transient-difference linear dichroism will be in the form of a deoxy-carboxy difference spectrum, whether due to photoselection or initial polymer alignment. The photoinduced LD of the polymer is very small because the polymer is mostly ligand free, so in this work, we apply an ultrasensitive time-resolved LD technique (29Che D. Shapiro D.B. Esquerra R.M. Kliger D.S. Chem. Phys.Lett. 1994; 224: 145-154Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to measure the CO re-equilibration rate to HbS polymers. The feasibility of this measurement was demonstrated previously(30Ferrone F.A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Front. Biol. Energet. 1978; 2: 1085-1092Crossref Google Scholar). Hemoglobin S was prepared as described previously(31Geraci G. Parkhurst L.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4664-4667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), from excess blood originally donated by patients homozygous in HbS, following federal regulations and guidelines outlined by the National Institutes of Health. The blood cells were washed in 1% NaCl and lysed by incubation in distilled water. The blood was dialyzed against 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage. The combined level of HbF + HbA2 was less than 7% as determined by the alkali denaturation method and microcolumn chromatography. These levels are insufficient to cause a considerable sparring effect (32Poillon W.N. Kim B.C. Rodgers G.P. Noguchi C.T. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5039-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 33Chung L.L. Magdoff-Fairchild B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) so that any increase in HbS solubility was ignored in our calculations. Prior to measurements, thawed samples were concentrated using an Amicon stirred cell and Centricon concentrators (Amicon Inc., catalog numbers 4205 and 8050). The final concentration of the sample ranged from 15 to 20 mM in heme. Two portions of the sample, one degassed with argon and the other with CO were mixed under anaerobic conditions. Sodium dithionite was added to the sample to a final concentration of 0.05 M prior to injecting it into a 0.03-mm path-length cell (Hellma Cells Inc., Jamaica, NY, catalog number 121.000 QS). Gelation was achieved by a temperature jump from 0 to 30°C and equilibrated to room temperature (20°C). The amount of polymer in the sample was calculated based on a determination of the partial ligation and total concentration of the sample prior to gelation. This was achieved by fitting the sample absorption spectrum to the absorption profiles for pure carboxy and deoxy-hemoglobins. A light scattering factor was also included. The total saturation of the sample before gelation, yt, was related to the solution phase saturation after gelation, ys, by the relation ys = yt/1 − xp where xp is the mole fraction of polymer in the sample. Implicit in this relation is the assumption that all of the CO-bound hemes are found in the solution phase. If this assumption were perfectly correct, this work would not be possible, but since the polymer is only ligated to a small degree(22Sunshine H.R. Hofrichter J. Ferrone F.A. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 158: 251-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Hofrichter J. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 128: 335-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it is a reasonable approximation. The solution phase saturation was then related to the solubility, cs, by a previously derived equation (Equation III.13 from (3Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar)). The final equation used to calculate the solubility is: -cs/cp)=(0.098(1-cs/cp)3yt3)/(cs/ct-cs/cp)3+(0.235(-cs/cp)15yt15)/(cs/ct-cs/cp)15=0(Eq. 1) where T is the equilibrium temperature in degrees Celsius, cp is the concentration of hemoglobin within the polymer, and ct is the total concentration of hemoglobin. The concentration within the polymer phase, cp, was taken as 0.69 g/ml(34Sunshine H.R. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 133: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The above equation was solved using Mathematica (Wolfram Research); the single positive real root of the equation was taken as the solubility. The mole fraction of polymer was calculated from the equation (see (3Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar)). xp=(1-cs/ct)(1-cs/cp)(Eq. 2) Time-resolved absorption (TROD) measurements were performed as described previously(35Kliger D.S.

A xenon flashlamp produced probe pulses at 1 Hz which are focused on the sample to a diameter of about 8 mm. Actinic pulses of 15 mJ/pulse were produced by a Quanta Ray DCR-2A Nd:YAG laser, frequency doubled to 532 nm. The excitation pulses made an angle of about 30° with respect to the probe beam. The diameter of the laser beam was about 10 mm. A clean up Glan-Taylor polarizer was used to insure the polarization purity (vertical) of the actinic beam. The probe beam was passed through a polarizer with its polarization axis oriented along the magic angle (the angle where photoselection effects are minimal, 54.7°) to reduce artifacts from reorientation kinetics of the photolyzed hemoglobin molecules. The probe beam was focused through a 100-μm slit into a Jarrel Ash spectrograph (150 grooves/mm, 800 nm blaze) and detected with an EG& OMA II detector. A Stanford Instruments DG535 delay/pulse generator was used to control the timing of the detector gate (10 ns) and the firing of the flashlamp with respect to the laser. The ultrasensitive TRLD method used in this study has been described in detail previously(29Che D. Shapiro D.B. Esquerra R.M. Kliger D.S. Chem. Phys.Lett. 1994; 224: 145-154Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To implement the TRLD measurement the TROD measurement described above was modified in several ways. The 100-μm slit of the spectrograph was replaced with a 250-μm slit and the detector gate was opened to 500 ns for measurements made above 1 millisecond following photolysis. Two polarizers, oriented along directions ±45° with respect to the vertically polarized actinic beam, are placed before the sample and one after the sample, respectively. To conduct a linear dichroism measurement, the sample is probed at a given time following photolysis for two separate rotations by a small angle, β, of the initial polarizer. The LD signal is calculated as the detected intensity when the initial polarizer is rotated +β (I+) minus the detected intensity when the polarizer is rotated by -β (I−), divided by the sum of these intensities. As shown previously (29Che D. Shapiro D.B. Esquerra R.M. Kliger D.S. Chem. Phys.Lett. 1994; 224: 145-154Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) this gives, LD singnal=I+-I-I++I-=(β+LD/2)2-(β-LD/2)2(β+LD/2)2+(β-LD/2)2≍LDβ(Eq. 3) where we have assumed that LD is much smaller than β, which is a reasonable assumption for our measurements. A value of 0.011 radians was chosen for β in this work so that a signal to noise advantage of about 100 was obtained with respect to standard LD measurements probing vertical and horizontal direction separately. The sign (parallel - perpendicular as opposed to perpendicular - parallel) of the LD was determined by measuring the linear dichroism at early times, before significant rotational diffusion of the solution phase hemoglobins. Before each measurement, sufficient time was allowed between laser pulses to allow the return of the system to its pre-photolysis state. The recombination of CO with the photolyzed hemoglobin sample can be described by the equation, d[CO]dt=-kR[HbR][CO)-kT[HbT][CO]-kp[Hbp][CO](Eq. 4) where k refers to the rate constants and [Hb] to concentration of free hemes with the subscripts R, T, and p indicating solution phase R-state, solution phase T-state, and polymer phase, respectively. The TRLD measurements are only sensitive to changes in [Hbp] and can thus be used to study CO religation kinetics to the polymer. Data was analyzed using singular value decomposition (SVD)(37Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 38Golub G.H. Reinsch C. Numer. Math. 1970; 14: 403-420Crossref Scopus (1975) Google Scholar, 39Brodersen S. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1990; 142: 122-128Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). SVD rewrites the data matrix of signals at each wavelength and time as the product of three matrices. A=USV′(Eq. 5) U is a m × n matrix containing the optical density for n orthonormal basis spectra at m wavelengths. Vr denotes the transpose of V, a n × n matrix giving the amplitude of each basis spectrum at n time delays. S is an n × n matrix containing the singular values of A, a determinant of the contribution of each basis spectrum to the measured spectrum at a given time. In practice, only the largest singular values and time amplitudes are retained. The smaller values and amplitudes are discarded as noise. Thus SVD provides a concise, noise-filtered representation of the data. This truncated representation was used to fit the TRLD data to an exponential lifetime using a (non-linear) least square global analysis fitting technique (36Goldbeck R.A. Kliger D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 147-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This lifetime, τ, yields the observed re-equilibration rate for CO binding to the HbS polymer, kp‘, by k′p=1/τ(Eq. 6) If re-equilibration of the polymer with CO is achieved through the binding of CO by hemes in the polymer as described in then the rate constant for CO binding to the polymer is given by, kp=k'p/[Hbp]=1/(τ[Hbp])(Eq. 7) Alternative mechanisms of polymer religation, to be discussed below, are not consistent with the association of kp‘/[Hbp] with kp, thus we refer henceforth to a re-equilibration rate operationally defined as kp‘/[Hbp]. An absorption spectrum of a typical sample of HbS before gelation is shown in Fig. 1a. Also shown is the fit of this spectrum to pure components of carboxy and deoxy spectra (and light scattering). The basis curves to which the absorption spectra were fit are shown in Fig. 1b. These fits were used to determine the initial saturation of the sample, yt, and calculate the molar fraction of polymer. The results of these analysis for three samples studied are shown in Table 1(concentrations are given in terms of heme concentration, [Hbp] = xp ct).Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Results of a typical TROD measurement performed on a gelled sample are shown in Fig. 2. Each curve represents the difference in absorption of the sample at given delay time following ligand photolysis minus the absorption of the sample before photolysis. Data is shown for 50 delay times (10 per decade) from about 50 ns to 1 ms. The data show that over 90% of CO recombination is complete by 1 ms. The kinetics of CO recombination to the monomer phase are complicated. Before photolysis most of the ligation will be to R-state (solution phase) hemes. The R-state recombination rate is about 60 times faster than that to T-state (40Bertini I. Gray H. Lippard S.J. Valentine J.S. Biorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994: 186-187Google Scholar) and if the T-state rebinding were to be ignored the CO recombination kinetics could be explained by hyperbolic recombination to R-state hemes. However, since this recombination is hyperbolic rather than exponential in nature, and since (especially as R-state recombination proceeds) T-state hemes will be in excess of free CO, the presence of the T-state hemes should be accounted for. One relatively simple model (and not necessarily the only one) that is consistent with the data is one which assumes that the concentration of free CO is equal to the concentration of ligand-free R-state hemes and that the concentration of ligand-free T-state hemes is in excess of free CO, [CO]=[HbR]and[HbT]>>[CO](Eq. 8) These assumptions can be worked into the rate equation (Equation 4) giving d[CO]dt=-kR[CO]2-k'T[CO]wherek'T=kT[HbT](Eq. 9) (where the polymer rebinding is ignored). can be integrated to give an approximate equation for CO recombination: [CO]=-Ak'T(AkR-ek′Tt)whereA=[CO]0(k′T+kR[CO]0)(Eq. 10) and [CO]O is the initial concentration of free CO at the beginning of the recombination process. Most of the measured CO religation kinetics is given by the time dependence of the first basis vector (the primary spectral component) obtained by applying SVD to the TROD data. This time dependence is shown for a typical TROD measurement in Fig. 3. Also shown in this figure is a theoretical fit to these data using. The theoretical fit is not a “best fit” but rather that obtained using values of kR and kT taken from the literature(40Bertini I. Gray H. Lippard S.J. Valentine J.S. Biorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994: 186-187Google Scholar), which results in reasonable agreement with the data. The static (ground state) linear dichroism for a gelled sample is shown in Fig. 4. This linear dichroism signal is due to the partial alignment of the HbS polymers. As expected, it resembles a mostly deoxy-hemoglobin absorption spectrum. Time-resolved linear dichroism difference spectra (transient - ground state) are shown for a typical experiment in Fig. 5a for 0.65, 0.95, 1.25, 1.55, 1.75, and 1.85 s following laser photolysis. The spectral signature of these measurements resembles a deoxy-carboxy difference spectrum. Fig. 5b shows the transient-ground state linear dichroism difference spectra for 0.65 and 1.55 s following laser photolysis, as well as a fit to these spectra using the static absorption curves of deoxy- and carboxy-hemoglobin shown in Fig. 1b. Each TRLD curve is decomposed into approximately a 50% deoxy-hemoglobin - 50% carboxy-hemoglobin absorption curve. This decomposition fits the TRLD data reasonably well, however, there is about a 3-nm blue shift of the experimental data relative to the theoretical fit. A similar shift is observed when a fit is made to our transient absorption difference spectra (Fig. 2). An examination of the basis vectors for the TRLD data obtained by SVD, shown in Fig. 6a, also demonstrates the similarity of the TRLD data to a deoxy-carboxy difference spectrum. The time course of the first basis spectrum is shown in Fig. 6b. That the time dependence of this basis spectrum fits a straight line when plotted as log (intensity) versus time demonstrates that the religation to the polymer follows pseudo-first order kinetics. The TRLD data were fit to exponential processes the lifetimes of which are shown in Table 1. These lifetimes were used to calculate the CO re-equilibration rate, as described above (Equation 7), giving an average value of 0.14 ± 0.07 (s−1 mM−1).Figure 5a, time-resolved linear dichroism difference spectra of the HbS gel. Each curve represents the linear dichroism of the sample measured at a given delay time after laser photolysis minus the ground state linear dichroism. The signal is shown magnified 92 times; a linear dichroism signal shown in the figure of 0.01 corresponds to a linear dichroism of 1.1 × 10−4 optical density units. Each curve represents the average of 128 measurements. Delay times were 0.65, 0.95, 1.25, 1.55, 1.75, and 1.85 s. The spectra were offset to zero at 650 nm. b fit to time-resolved linear dichroism difference spectra. A fit (dotted curves) using the static deoxy- and carboxy-hemoglobin absorption curves (Fig. 1b) is shown for TRLD difference spectra (solid curves) at 0.65 and 1.55 s following photolysis. The fit to the 0.65-s time point is composed of 49% deoxy-hemoglobin - 51% carboxy-hemoglobin absorption curves and the 1.55-s time point is composed of 55% deoxy - 45% carboxy curves. These values are at least as good a fit to a deoxy-carboxy difference spectrum as the values obtained in a similar fitting to TROD data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Singular value decomposition of HbS TRLD.

https://openalex.org/W2056638571,"Abstract The relative contribution of the finger/growth factor domains of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and of the other t-PA domains to the clearance of t-PA by hepatocytes was investigated. A recombinant finger/growth factor construct inhibited t-PA and t-PA/plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 degradation with an IC of 1800 nM, whereas a t-PA mutant lacking the finger and growth factor domains inhibited degradation with an estimated IC of 1200 nM. In comparison the IC of t-PA was found to be approximately 10 nM. Clearance of t-PA by human or rat hepatoma cells was not inhibited by high concentrations of fucose (50 mM), which suggests that the fucose on Thr-61 is not involved in clearance by these cells. These results suggest that the binding of t-PA involves several low affinity binding sites located on distinct domains of the t-PA molecule."

A 29-kDa protein was obtained after renaturation from inclusion bodies. The KJ16 scFv had a relative affinity for the native TCR that was slightly higher than KJ16 Fab fragments. The scFv and Fab fragments of the KJ16 antibody, together with monovalent forms of two other anti-TCR antibodies, were evaluated as antagonists of the T cell-mediated recognition of a peptide-class I complex or of a superantigen, Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) bound to a class II product. Each of the anti-TCR antibodies was efficient at inhibiting the recognition of the SEB-class II complex. In contrast, only the clonotypic antibody, which binds to epitopes on both the Vβ and Vα regions, inhibited the recognition of peptide-class I complex. We conclude that the TCR binding site for the SEB-class II ligand encompasses a larger surface area than the TCR binding site for the peptide-class I ligand.
