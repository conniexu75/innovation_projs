https://openalex.org/W2149437313,"When coffee plants are watered at relatively short intervals, so as to maintain the water content of the soil at close to field capacity, the flower buds remain dormant and no fruits are formed. Irrigation or rain induces flowering only when preceded by a period of water shortage. Water stress is apparently essential to break the dormancy of coffee flower buds."

This shows that this effect is not due to respiration and is not associated with the carbon dioxide-reducing phase of photosynthesis. Peaks at 650 and 670 mμ in the action spectra of this effect, in the case of quinone reductions as well as in that of photosynthesis in Chlorella, show that light absorbed by chlorophyll b as well as that absorbed by chlorophyll a 670 can effectively supplement far-red light (> 680 mμ) in both reactions; light absorbed by chlorophyll a 680 cannot do so."
https://openalex.org/W4239710619,It is contended that there is little justification and no necessity for believing in the competitive exclusion principle as usually formulated. There is danger that a trite maxim like this may lead to the neglect of important evidence.
https://openalex.org/W2002023695,A strip of mammary gland is removed from a lactating rabbit and suspended in a bath. The contractions of the strip are recorded isometrically. The strip shows no spontaneous activity and responds with reasonable linearity and stability to oxytocin at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 milliunits per milliliter.

Extracts from a luminescent fish are now found to cross react with a crustacean system; some properties of the new system and implications of the phenomenon are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2084004076,Photosynthesis produced by far-red light (about 700 mmicro) is reversibly inhibited in some algae by extreme-red light ( approximately 750 mmicro).
https://openalex.org/W2088579709,"Three species of rotifers have now been grown synxenically and, to a limited extent, axenically. Brachionus variabilis thrives in suitable media containing Chlorella pyrenoidosa and a bacterial species. Lecane inermis and Philodina acuticornis var. odiosa are bacteriophagous, the former doing best with two bacterial species (dixenically), the latter doing well with Escherichia coli alone (monoxenically)."
https://openalex.org/W2077896744,"Altitudinal and carbon-14 age determinations of in-place Pinus strobus stumps of drowned forests at Odiorne Point, N.H., and Grand Pré and Fort Lawrence, Nova Scotia, yield apparent average rates of submergence of 3.1, 14.5, and 20.3 feet per 1000 C(14) years, respectively. Rate differences are assessed in terms of eustatic rise of sea level, crustal movements, and tidal effects."

https://openalex.org/W1965533779,"A magnetic field is said to possess an energy density which is analogous to the thermal energy density of a gas. When a region of magnetic field is compressed or distorted, its energy content is raised. A magnetic field of 1 megagauss has an energy density of 40 x 10/sup 3/ ergs, or 1000 cal per cc, which is comparable to the chemical energy density of high explosives. The achievement of very high magnetic fields has obvious uses in pure and applied research. In high energy physics, the most common use is that of guiding energetic particles along paths that are more or less strongly curved, depending on the field strength and panticle momentum. An analogy of the magnetic field is given as a two-dimensional in which the flux lines take the place of gas molecules. This analogy becomes exact for systems that are infinite and uniform along the direction of the field. The technological avenues being followed to produce high magnetic fields are reduction of input current requirement by means of a tubular coil wound of insulated wire, use of motional effects in solid tube design with a straight or helical slit, use of motional effects in solidmore » but nonrigid tubes, use of conductive fluids, and reduction of magnetic forces by means of forcefree geometric designs.

https://openalex.org/W2051176406,"X-ray fluorescence analysis of several lepidolites whose rubidium and strontium concentrations had already been determined by neutron activation and stable isotope dilution, or both, indicates that this technique can be used for rapid nondestructive reconnaissance rubidiumstrontium studies, and that an x-ray analysis method comparable in accuracy to isotope dilution can probably be developed for dating Precambrian lepidolites, as the simple technique presently used has many obvious possibilities for improvement."

https://openalex.org/W2040107799,"An extensive discussion of elementary particles is presented and a total of 30 particles and antiparticles is given, 7 of which are genuinely stable. The following properties are tabulated for all 30 particles: spin, mass, charge, baryon number, lepton number, strangeness number, mean life, and decay modes. Particles differing only slightly in mass may be attributed to different charge states of the same particle. Each of the properties is studied in detail, and the reasons for the construction of the strangeness number are given. The three types of forces are discussed: strong (nuclear), electromagnetic, and weak. Finally, conservation of parity, charge conjunction, and time reversal are considered. (D. L.C.)"

It is part of a rebuttal of a criticism of a paper on the relevance of current standards for mercury contamination of food. Incidences of mercury poisoning in humans by ingestion of contaminated food are briefly discussed. 2 references.
