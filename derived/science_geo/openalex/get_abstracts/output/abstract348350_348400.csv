https://openalex.org/W1996161852,"Sclerostin, the protein product of the Sost gene, is a potent inhibitor of bone formation. Among bone cells, sclerostin is found nearly exclusively in the osteocytes, the cell type that historically has been implicated in sensing and initiating mechanical signaling. The recent discovery of the antagonistic effects of sclerostin on Lrp5 receptor signaling, a crucial mediator of skeletal mechanotransduction, provides a potential mechanism for the osteocytes to control mechanotransduction, by adjusting their sclerostin (Wnt inhibitory) signal output to modulate Wnt signaling in the effector cell population. We investigated the mechanoregulation of Sost and sclerostin under enhanced (ulnar loading) and reduced (hindlimb unloading) loading conditions. Sost transcripts and sclerostin protein levels were dramatically reduced by ulnar loading. Portions of the ulnar cortex receiving a greater strain stimulus were associated with a greater reduction in Sost staining intensity and sclerostin-positive osteocytes (revealed via in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively) than were lower strain portions of the tissue. Hindlimb unloading yielded a significant increase in Sost expression in the tibia. Modulation of sclerostin levels appears to be a finely tuned mechanism by which osteocytes coordinate regional and local osteogenesis in response to increased mechanical stimulation, perhaps via releasing the local inhibition of Wnt/Lrp5 signaling.

Low bone mass and poor bone structure are two major risk factors for osteoporotic fracture (1Ahlborg H.G. Johnell O. Turner C.H. Rannevik G. Karlsson M.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 2Lane N. Bull NYU. Hosp. Jt. Dis. 2006; 64: 67-71PubMed Google Scholar). A simple yet effective means to enhance bone mass and architecture is through mechanical stimulation of the resident bone cell population (3Turner C.H. Robling A.G. Exerc. Sport. Sci. Rev. 2003; 31: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 4Turner C.H. Robling A.G. J. Bone Miner Metab. 2005; 23: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mechanical loading (e.g. exercise) improves bone mass and strength by stimulating the addition of new bone onto surfaces experiencing high strains, whereas surfaces that experience small strains largely remain quiescent. This phenomenon occurs both across the skeleton (limb bones adapt to locomotive loading, whereas nonbearing bones (e.g. skull) do not) and within a loaded bone (tension/compression surfaces undergo bone formation, whereas surfaces straddling the neutral bending axis do not). The cellular mechanisms involved in directing new bone formation to the high strain regions of a loaded bone are unclear, but elucidation of these mechanisms would provide an attractive target for pharmaceutical intervention aimed at mimicking the adaptive response to loading (5Robling A.G. Castillo A.B. Turner C.H. Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2006; 8: 455-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Despite these gaps in our understanding, significant progress has been made in delineating some of the basic mechanisms of mechanotransduction in bone, in large part because of the creation of genetically engineered mice. A key finding in this arena is the requirement for Wnt signaling through Lrp5 (the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5) in mechanically induced bone formation. We reported recently that mice engineered with a loss-of-function mutation in Lrp5 recapitulate the low bone mass phenotype observed in humans with inactivating mutations of LRP5 but, perhaps more importantly, were nearly completely unable to respond anabolically to mechanical stimulation (6Sawakami K. Robling A.G. Ai M. Pitner N.D. Liu D. Warden S.J. Li J. Maye P. Rowe D.W. Duncan R.L. Warman M.L. Turner C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23698-23711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Wnt/Lrp5 signaling is an integral part of the mechanotransduction cascade in normal bone tissue (7Robinson J.A. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Yaworsky P.J. Cullen D.M. Zhao W. Li C. Kharode Y. Sauter L. Babij P. Brown E.L. Hill A.A. Akhter M.P. Johnson M.L. Recker R.R. Komm B.S. Bex F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31720-31728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), and from these observations an obvious question emerges: how does mechanical stimulation enhance Lrp5 signaling? Potential explanations include enhanced agonism of Lrp5 signaling (e.g. enhanced Wnt secretion), reduced antagonism of Lrp5 signaling (e.g. reduced dickkopf homolog 1 (Dkk1) levels, reduced secreted frizzled-related protein (sFrp) levels), or both. Sclerostin, the protein product of the SOST gene, is an osteocyte-specific cysteine knot-secreted glycoprotein that is a potent inhibitor of bone formation. Mutations in the SOST gene, or in its distant regulatory elements, cause sclerosing bone disorders such as sclerosteosis and Van Buchem disease (8Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P.

Patients with SOST mutations exhibit very high bone mass in the appendicular and axial skeleton (11Gardner J.C. van Bezooijen R.L. Mervis B. Hamdy N.A. Lowik C.W. Hamersma H. Beighton P.

Med. 1976; 84: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Sclerostin was originally characterized as a Bmp (bone morphogenic protein) antagonist because of its sequence homology to other members of the DAN family of cysteine knot proteins, but more recently it has been shown to bind Lrp5/6 with high affinity (13Li X. Zhang Y. Kang H. Liu W. Liu P. Zhang J. Harris S.E. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19883-19887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 14Semenov M. Tamai K. He X. J.

Consequently, sclerostin presents an attractive candidate for regulating mechanically induced signaling through the Lrp5 receptor. Furthermore, sclerostin expression in adult bone is limited to osteocytes (16Poole K.E. van Bezooijen R.L. Loveridge N. Hamersma H. Papapoulos S.E. Lowik C.W. Reeve J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1842-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 17van Bezooijen R.L. ten Dijke P. Papapoulos S.E. Lowik C.W. Cytokine. Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), which have long been postulated as the “mechanosensor” in bone (18Lanyon L.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1993; 53: S102-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 19Cowin S.C. Moss-Salentijn L. Moss M.L. J. Biomech. Eng. 1991; 113: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The osteocyte population density, distribution, and extensive communication networks within bone make these cells ideal mechanosensors in the adaptive process of bone. Despite these attributes, very little data have been generated that implicate the osteocyte network as the primary mechanosensory cell type, to the exclusion of the other cell types (e.g. osteoblasts, bone lining cells). The discovery of a mechanically modulated osteocyte-specific factor, particularly a secreted factor that had the propensity to reach effector cell populations (osteoblasts), with known effects on a crucial mechanotransduction signaling pathway (Wnt/Lrp5), would provide a long sought-after molecular basis for osteocytic reception, initiation, and spatial control of mechanotransduction. We investigated the regulation of Sost/sclerostin by the mechanical environment using two different rodent models of mechanotransduction: one for enhanced loading (axial ulnar loading) and one for reduced loading (hindlimb unloading). Ulnar loading in rodents induces a consistent pattern of bone deformation (i.e. strain) both along the bone axis and cross-sectionally at the midshaft. We hypothesized that enhanced loading would reduce Sost transcripts and sclerostin protein levels, particularly in the high strain regions of the tissue where enhanced bone formation is maximal. We further hypothesized that hindlimb unloading would increase Sost/sclerostin levels in the unloaded limbs. Our results indicate that sclerostin protein levels were reduced dramatically by ulnar loading. Portions of the ulnar cortex receiving a greater strain stimulus were associated with a greater reduction in the proportion of sclerostin-positive osteocytes. The load-induced reduction in sclerostin levels could be partially explained by a reduction in Sost transcript levels. Conversely, hindlimb unloading, a model of disuse mechanotransduction, yielded an increase in Sost transcript levels in the tibia. Modulation of sclerostin levels appears to be a finely tuned mechanism by which osteocytes coordinate regional and local osteogenesis in response to increased mechanical stimulation, perhaps via releasing the local inhibition of Wnt/Lrp5 signaling. Animals—18-week-old C57Bl/6J male mice and 6-month-old virgin female Lewis rats were used for the ulnar loading studies. The unloading studies were performed in 6-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice. The mice were purchased from Jackson Labs, and the rats were purchased from Harlan, Inc. The animals were housed at the Indiana University Animal Care Facility until the proper age for each experiment was reached. Standard rodent chow and water were provided ad libitum. All of the procedures performed in the experiments were in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. In Vivo Ulnar Loading—Under isoflurane-induced anesthesia, the right forearms of mice and rats were loaded for 360 cycles/day (2 Hz). The mice used for immunolocalization of sclerostin were loaded for 2 consecutive days and then sacrificed on day 3. The rats and mice used for RNA analysis (in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR) were loaded for a single session (1 day) and sacrificed 24 h later. Loading was conducted on a customized electromagnetic actuator at peak force of 2.7 newtons for mice and 17 newtons for rats, which generates ∼2200 μϵ at the midshaft ulna (Fig. 1A). Strain magnitudes were determined previously using miniature strain gauges bonded to the midshaft ulnar surface (20Robling A.G. Turner C.H. Bone. 2002; 31: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 21Hsieh Y.F. Robling A.G. Ambrosius W.T. Burr D.B. Turner C.H. J. Bone Miner Res. 2001; 16: 2291-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The left forearms were not loaded and served as an internal control for loading effects. All of the mice were allowed normal cage activity between loading bouts. Intraperitoneal injections of calcein and alizarin complexone (22 mg/kg body mass; Sigma) were administered to some of the mice 4 and 10 days after the first load day to monitor regional bone formation rates in the ulnae. To collect adequate amounts of ulnar diaphyseal tissue for gene expression analysis, nine adult female virgin Lewis rats were subjected to a single bout of ulnar loading at 17-newton peak force (∼2200 μϵ; 2 Hz; 360 cycles) using a similar device as described for mice. The rat ulnas were harvested 24 h after loading, snap frozen in liquid N2, and processed for RNA analysis as described below. In Vivo Tail Suspension—To achieve a disuse environment, 6-week-old male mice were outfitted with tail harnesses and suspended from an overhead pulley system in customized cages. The mice can ambulate within the cage using their forelimbs, which remain in contact with the cage floor, but their hindlimbs remain suspended in air and consequently cannot generate ground reaction forces (Fig. 1B). Food and water were provided on the cage floor. The mice were suspended for 72 h, after which they were sacrificed, and their hindlimbs were processed for immunohistochemistry or RNA isolation (see below). Immunohistochemistry—Minimally dissected mouse ulnae with attached radii were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered formalin for 48 h at 4 °C and then decalcified in a 2.3:1 mixture of 10% EDTA and 4% phosphate-buffered formalin for 10 days. Following decalcification, the right and left ulna/radius from each animal were bundled together with suture so that the right and left ulnae were properly aligned. The ulna bundles were infiltrated and then embedded in paraffin, with six to eight right-left ulna bundles to a block. Sections were taken from the blocks at the ulnar midshaft, 3 mm distal to midshaft, and 3 mm proximal to midshaft, at 8 μm thickness. Tibiae from the tail-suspended and ground control mice were sectioned at the tibiofibular junction. The sections were dried, deparaffinized, reacted for endogenous peroxidase activity, blocked, and incubated in anti-sclerostin primary antibody (R & D Systems). Secondary antibody labeling and detection were accomplished using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Labs, Inc.) with diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. The immunolabeled sections were counterstained with methyl green or left without counterstain and then coverslipped. The immunolabeled sections were photographed using 20× objective and imported into Image-Pro (MediaCybernetics, Inc.) analysis software for quantification. The number of sclerostin positive (Sclr+) osteocytes, defined as those osteocyte cell bodies exhibiting brown staining (Fig. 2), and the number of sclerostin-negative (Sclr-) osteocytes, defined as those osteocyte cell bodies exhibiting (methyl) green staining, were counted on each section. The percentage of sclerostin-positive cells (Sclr+) was calculated as the number of Sclr+ cells divided by the total number of cells (Sclr+ plus Sclr-). The load-induced change in the ulna samples was calculated for each animal as the percentage of Sclr+ cells in the right (loaded) sections minus the percentage of Sclr+ cells in the left (nonloaded control) section. Changes in sclerostin levels along the bone shaft were measured at the three section locations specified above (-3 mm, midshaft, and +3 mm) by quantifying and pooling all of the osteocytes within a section, regardless of their relation to the bending axis. For regional analysis within the ulnar midshaft cortex, each section was divided into three regions, corresponding to high, moderate, and low peak strain values during ulnar loading. To this end, two parallel lines were superimposed on each section, parallel to the neutral bending axis, and the cell counts were tallied separately within each region. The two lines were positioned at roughly ±1200 μϵ, which was located by quantifying the second moment of area and section modulus about the IMIN plane of each section, calculating the peak strain at the outermost fiber using the previously derived relation between strain/force and section modulus (20Robling A.G. Turner C.H. Bone. 2002; 31: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and deriving the distance from the neutral axis when strain is equal to 1200 μϵ. Because the ulnar loading model is characterized by bending with an additional axial compression component, the neutral axis is shifted slightly toward the tensile cortex, which has the effect of creating a larger compressive region, characterized by higher mean strains. Histomorphometry—From the mice that received calcein and alizarin to monitor load induced bone formation, ulnae were cleaned of soft tissue, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h, dehydrated in graded alcohols, cleared in xylene, and embedded in methyl methacrylate (Aldrich). Using a diamond-embedded wire saw (Histo-saw; Delaware Diamond Knives, Wilmington, DE), transverse thick sections (∼70 μm) were removed from the ulnar midshaft. The wafers were ground to a final thickness of ∼20 μm and were mounted unstained on standard microscope slides. The sections were photographed on a Nikon Optiphot fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Inc., Garden City, NJ) and imported into Image-Pro (MediaCybernetics, Inc.) analysis software for quantification. The following primary data were collected from the periosteal surface: total perimeter, single label perimeter, double label perimeter measured along the first label, and double label area. From these primary data, we calculated bone formation rates per unit of bone surface (BFR/BS) using standardized protocols (22Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4891) Google Scholar). To quantify load-induced changes in bone formation rates along the bone length (which is associated with a gradient in peak strains), histomorphometric measurements were collected at three section locations specified above (-3 mm, midshaft, and +3 mm). These three locations correspond to low, medium, and high strains during ulnar loading (21Hsieh Y.F. Robling A.G. Ambrosius W.T. Burr D.B. Turner C.H. J. Bone Miner Res. 2001; 16: 2291-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The fluorochrome-labeled midshaft ulnar sections were also subjected to cross-sectional regional analysis (three regions: high, moderate, and low strain) of BFR/BS, as described for the immunolabeled midshaft sections. Load-induced bone formation was calculated for each animal/section/region by subtracting left ulna (nonloaded control) values from right ulna values; this procedure results in a relative (r) bone formation rate (rBFR/BS). In Situ Hybridization—Sost antisense and sense RNA probes used for hybridization were prepared from an EcoRI- and NotI-linearized T7T3Pac DMP1subclone and transcribed in vitro in the presence of digoxigenin-U-NTP mixture with T3 and T7 polymerase, respectively. The in situ hybridization was performed using a modification of the procedure described by Wilkinson and Nieto (23Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Prior to hybridization, the sections were deparaffinized with xylene and 100% ethanol following rehydration. After treatment with proteinase K solution (proteinase K, 5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) for 10 min at 37 °C, the sections were refixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (0.2 m phosphate buffer, 3 m NaCl), acetylated (100 mm triethanolamine, 0.25% acetic anhydride), and prehybridized in 2× SSC. Hybridization was performed at 55 °C overnight in the hybridization solution (50% formamide, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m NaCl, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml denatured Salmon Sperm-DNA, 500 μ/ml tRNA) and 1 μg/ml DMP1 UTP-digoxigenin labeled RNA probe. After hybridization, the coverslips were removed in 5× SSC at room temperature, and sections were washed once in 5× SSC and twice in washing solution I (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1%SDS) at 55 °C for 30 min each. The sections were incubated with RNase (40 mg/ml RNase A1 and 10 units/ml RNase T1) in washing solution II (0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation in the washing solution II without RNase for 30 min. Consecutive washes at 55 °C were done twice with washing solution III (50% formamide, 2× SSC) for 30 min each and then three times 5 min each at room temperature in TBS-T (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mm levamisole) and one time at room temperature in blocking mix (100 mm maleic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 1% blocking reagent). Antibody to digoxigenin (alkaline phosphatase conjugated) was diluted 1:25 in blocking mix and was added after post-hybridization washing and blocking for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Next day, the sections were washed using TBS-T for 5 min, wash buffer (100 mm maleic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mm levamisole) twice for 15 min and predetection buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 9, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm levamisole) for 5 min. Detection of hybridization signal was done by adding alkaline phosphatase substrate (nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-phosphate, toluidine salt) in detection buffer (10% polyvinyl alcohol (10% polyvinyl alcohol with molecular mass of 70-100 kDa), 100 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm levamisole) overnight at 30 °C. When detection of hybridization signal was completed, the sections were washed in water three times (5 min/wash), counterstained with eosin for 5 s, and dehydrated in ethanol. Finally, the slides were in xylene and mounted with coverslips using a nonaqueous permount reagent. The dark purple hybridization signal in the osteocytes was quantitated for intensity using Image J. Average expression was determined at 3 mm proximal to the midshaft, at the midshaft, and at 3 mm distal to the midshaft, by analyzing 50-80 osteocytes/section. In the midshaft sections, Sost staining intensity was quantified in the three strain regions (high, medium, and low) as described for the immunolabeled sections. RNA Extraction and Quantitative PCR—Snap frozen rat ulnar diaphyses (central 75% of the bone) and whole mouse tibiae (from tail-suspended mice) were pulverized in liquid N2 using a mortar and pestle. The bone powder was suspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the bone grit. From the supernatant, total RNA was isolated and resuspended in H2O according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed using the Superscript II kit with oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). From the resulting cDNA, portions of the Sost, Dkk1, sFrp, and β-actin sequences were amplified using Taqman Assay-on-Demand gene expression assay kits (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Serial dilutions of one of the samples were amplified for each gene to calculate relative expression levels, which were then standardized to β-actin expression to facilitate comparison among samples. The reactions were performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. Statistical Methods—The data were analyzed using nonparametric statistics to avoid assumptions of normality. Trends across strain magnitudes, both within and along the diaphysis, were analyzed for association using Spearman's rs. Within group (loaded versus nonloaded) comparisons were executed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. For all tests, the level of significance was set at α = 0.05. Mechanical Loading Reduces Sclerostin, Particularly in High Strain Regions of the Bone—To investigate the cellular mechanisms involved in load-enhanced Wnt signaling through Lrp5, we probed tissue sections from loaded and control mouse ulnae for sclerostin (Fig. 2). The mice underwent brief ulnar loading sessions for 2 consecutive days and then were sacrificed on day 3. Quantification of the number of Sclr+ osteocytes in the ulnar cortex revealed a dramatic load-induced decrease in the number of Sclr+ osteocyte cell bodies but also in the degree of sclerostin staining within the canalicular network (Fig. 2). Sections from the proximal portion of the ulnar diaphysis, which experiences relatively small peak strains during ulnar loading, exhibited a modest (∼15%) reduction in Sclr+ cells, whereas sections from the distal diaphysis, which experiences relatively large peak strains during loading, showed a ∼60% reduction in Sclr+ cells (Fig. 3B). Sections from the midshaft, which experiences intermediate strains during loading, yielded an intermediate reduction in Sclr+ cells (∼30% decrease). The strain dose-responsive reduction in Sclr+ cells along the diaphysis corresponded to the strain dose-responsive increase in bone formation rates after loading (Fig. 3A; p = 0.002). In these experiments, the mice received ulna loading, were given fluorochrome labels 4 and 10 days afterward, and then euthanized on day 17. Quantification of bone formation rates in the loaded and control ulnae revealed small gains in load-induced bone formation proximally, moderate gains at midshaft, and large gains distally. Thus, the diaphyseal locations that underwent only modest increases in peak strains as a result of loading were associated with a small reduction in Sclr+ cells and a small increase in bone formation rates. Conversely, diaphyseal locations that underwent large increases in peak strains as a result of loading were associated with a large reduction in Sclr+ cells and a large increase in bone formation rates. We further probed the effect of mechanical strain on Sclr expression and bone formation by measuring the load-induced changes in Sclr+ cells and bone formation rates across the midshaft ulnar cortex. The ulnar axial loading model induces mediolateral bending at midshaft, with a superimposed axial compressive element that results in greater compressive than tensile strains. We took advantage of the unequal distribution of strains by dividing the cortex into a high strain region (compressive, medial portion), a moderate strain region (lateral, tensile portion), and a low strain region (central portion, straddling the neutral bending axis). Quantification of the number of Sclr+ osteocytes in those three cross-sectional regions also revealed a strain dose-responsive reduction (p = 0.027) in Sclr+ cells and a concomitant strain dose-responsive increase (p < 0.001) in bone formation rates in those same three regions (Fig. 4, left and center panels). Mechanical Loading Reduces Sost Expression, Particularly in High Strain Regions of the Bone—The observed load-induced reduction in sclerostin protein levels prompted us to explore whether the changes were transcriptionally regulated and whether other Wnt inhibitory transcripts were affected by loading. We measured mRNA levels of Sost, as well as two more Wnt inhibitors, Dkk1 and sFrp1, in loaded and control rat ulnar diaphyses 24 h after loading, using real time PCR. Mechanical loading reduced Sost mRNA levels by 73% (Fig. 5A). Dkk1 transcripts were also reduced significantly by loading, albeit to a lesser degree than Sost, reaching a 49% decrease induced by loading (Fig. 5B). sFrp1 expression was unchanged by loading (Fig. 5C). We further characterized the load-induced reduction in Sost expression by probing mouse ulnar tissue sections for Sost, using in situ hybridization, 24 h after a loading session. We quantified the level of Sost hybridization signal in 50-80 independent osteocytes at three diaphyseal locations that differed in the peak strain magnitudes endured during loading. As shown in Fig. 3C, loading induced a 24% reduction in sclerostin expression in the proximal location (p < 0.001) and a 37-51% reduction in the midshaft and distal regions (p < 0.001). We also analyzed Sost expression/osteocyte in more detail in the midshaft region. There was a greater reduction in Sost expression/osteocyte in the medial regions (high strain) than in the neutral axis (low strain) region or the lateral region (moderate strain) (Fig. 4, right panels). These data suggest that the mechanical loading response of the Sost gene is in part at the transcriptional level and correlates to mechanical strain magnitude. The gene expression pattern of Sost at midshaft is very similar to the sclerostin pattern revealed by immunohistochemistry. Reduction in Mechanical Loading (Disuse) Has No Effect on Sclerostin Levels—Our observation that enhanced loading results in a loss of sclerostin protein led us to determine whether the opposite is true, i.e. does reduced loading result in increased sclerostin levels? We suspended growing male mice by their tails for 3 or 7 days and then processed their tibiae for immunodetection of Sclr as describe"
https://openalex.org/W2125566732,"Background Recent neuroscientific evidence suggests that empathy for pain activates similar neural representations as the first-hand experience of pain. However, empathy is not an all-or-none phenomenon but it is strongly malleable by interpersonal, intrapersonal and situational factors. This study investigated how two different top-down mechanisms – attention and cognitive appraisal - affect the perception of pain in others and its neural underpinnings. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed one behavioral (N = 23) and two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments (N = 18). In the first fMRI experiment, participants watched photographs displaying painful needle injections, and were asked to evaluate either the sensory or the affective consequences of these injections. The role of cognitive appraisal was examined in a second fMRI experiment in which participants watched injections that only appeared to be painful as they were performed on an anesthetized hand. Perceiving pain in others activated the affective-motivational and sensory-discriminative aspects of the pain matrix. Activity in the somatosensory areas was specifically enhanced when participants evaluated the sensory consequences of pain. Perceiving non-painful injections into the anesthetized hand also led to signal increase in large parts of the pain matrix, suggesting an automatic affective response to the putatively harmful stimulus. This automatic response was modulated by areas involved in self/other distinction and valence attribution – including the temporo-parietal junction and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Conclusions/Significance Our findings elucidate how top-down control mechanisms and automatic bottom-up processes interact to generate and modulate other-oriented responses. They stress the role of cognitive processing in empathy, and shed light on how emotional and bodily awareness enable us to evaluate the sensory and affective states of others."
https://openalex.org/W2118385532,"The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a single-transmembrane, multiligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily. RAGE up-regulation is implicated in numerous pathological states including vascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration. The understanding of the regulation of RAGE is important in both disease pathogenesis and normal homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate the characterization and identification of human RAGE splice variants by analysis of RAGE cDNA from tissue and cells. We identified a vast range of splice forms that lead to changes in the protein coding region of RAGE, which we have classified according to the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC). These resulted in protein changes in the ligand-binding domain of RAGE or the removal of the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail. Analysis of splice variants for premature termination codons reveals approximately 50% of identified variants are targeted to the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Expression analysis revealed the RAGE_v1 variant to be the primary secreted soluble isoform of RAGE. Taken together, identification of functional splice variants of RAGE underscores the biological diversity of the RAGE gene and will aid in the understanding of the gene in the normal and pathological state."
https://openalex.org/W2084074983,"Most living organisms show circadian (∼24 h) rhythms in physiology and behavior. These oscillations are generated by endogenous circadian clocks, present in virtually all cells where they control key biological processes. Although circadian gating of mitosis has been reported for many years in some peripheral tissues, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained poorly understood. Here we show that the cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 is rhythmically expressed in mouse peripheral organs. This rhythmic pattern of mRNA and protein expression was recapitulated in vitro in serum-shocked differentiated skeletal muscle cells. p21WAF1/CIP1 circadian expression is dramatically increased and no longer rhythmic in clock-deficient Bmal1–/– knock-out mice. Biochemical and genetic data show that oscillation of p21WAF1/CIP1 gene transcription is regulated by the antagonistic activities of the orphan nuclear receptors REV-ERBα/β and RORα4/γ, which are core clock regulators. Importantly, p21WAF1/CIP1 overexpressing Bmal1–/– primary hepatocytes exhibit a decreased proliferation rate. This phenotype could be reversed using small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of p21WAF1/CIP1. These data establish a novel molecular link between clock and cell cycle genes and suggest that the G1 progression phase is a target of the circadian clock during liver cell proliferation.

Many physiological and behavioral processes display day-night oscillations in most organisms including mammals. These biological rhythms are controlled by endogenous self-sustained circadian (∼24 h) oscillators that operate not only in the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus but also in virtually all peripheral cells. Light is the main synchronizer of the central clock, which in turn coordinates the phases of peripheral oscillators regulating specific physiological outputs. Forward genetics and biochemical approaches have established the molecular basis underlying circadian oscillations in mammalian tissues (1Panda S. Hogenesch J.B. Kay S.A.

This mechanism involves complex interlocked positive and negative transcriptional/posttranslational feedback loops between the clock genes Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2 and their protein products. The robustness of the oscillations is ensured by additional regulators such as the REV-ERBα (NR1D1) and RORα (NR1F1) orphan nuclear receptors (5Preitner N. Damiola F. Lopez-Molina L. Zakany J.

Furthermore, extensive multilevel posttranslational regulation of various clock components has also been shown to play an important role in the molecular clock mechanism (7Harms E. Kivimae S.

There are substantial evidences that progression through the cell cycle occurs at specific times of the day/night cycle, suggesting that a function of the circadian clock system is to control this fundamental process. Notably, after the initial observation almost 40 years ago that cell division of the unicellular algae Euglena was controlled by an endogenous clock (8Edmunds Jr., L.N. Funch R.R. Science. 1969; 165: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), numerous studies have shown a circadian variation of the proliferative activity in mammalian tissues such as the epithelia of tongue, skin, oral mucosa, intestine, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and rectum as well as in bone marrow and pancreas (9Scheving L.E.

Here we investigate the molecular mechanism that links clock genes to p21 and show that genetic disruption of the circadian clock system results in aberrant p21 expression and altered cellular proliferation. Animals–All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the CNRS regulation on animal ethics. Bmal1–/– mice in the C57Bl/6j background (kindly provided by C. A. Bradfield, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) were used at 8–12 weeks of age, before they develop arthropathy (25Bunger M.K. Walisser J.A. Sullivan R. Manley P.A. Moran S.M. Kalscheur V.L.

Animals were housed in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (light/dark 12:12) in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment and fed ad libitum.

For the constant darkness experiment, light was kept off at constant darkness 0 for 24 h. Zeitgeber time small interfering RNA wild type. Cell Culture–NIH 3T3 cells were from ATCC and grown under standard conditions. C2C12 cells were maintained in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Undifferentiated C2C12 were grown to confluence and then transferred to differentiation medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 2% horse serum. Differentiation medium was changed every 48 h. After 10 days, cells were stimulated with 50% fetal bovine serum for 2 h, and then the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 2% horse serum. Cells were collected every 4 h, and extracts were prepared for mRNA and protein analysis. Primary hepatocytes were isolated by in situ perfusion procedure using purified Liberase (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were plated at 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in collagen-coated 35-mm culture dishes in William's E medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v), 100 IU penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 5 μg of bovine insulin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After cell attachment, medium was renewed without fetal calf serum and supplemented with 1 μm dexamethasone. Plasmid Construction and Cotransfection Assays–A 2240-bp fragment upstream of the first exon from the p21 gene has been amplified from mouse genomic DNA by PCR with the following primers: p21prom, forward, 5′-GCTCGAGTGTGTGCCTGGGGTGTGTATGTGTCAGG-3′; and reverse, 5′-CCAAGCTTCCCTCCCCCACACCTGGGCTATTCTCT-3′, and cloned between HindIII and Pst1 in front of the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3 basic vector containing the Sac1-HindIII polylinker fragment from pBKS to generate the p21Prom::Luc construct. The p21 promoter deletion construct p21PromΔ1663::Luc was generated by digesting the p21Prom::Luc construct with SpeI and NheI and religation. The (proRORE)4x-TATA::Luc, (proROREmut)4x-TATA:: Luc, (intRORE)4x-TATA::Luc, and (intROREmut)4x-TATA:: Luc reporter vectors were made by annealing phosphorylated oligonucleotides containing wild type or mutated RORE elements and surrounding sequences from p21 (proRORE) promoter or p21 first intron (intRORE) and ligating four copies of the resulting double strand fragment into a TATA box containing pGL2 reporter plasmid. Control reporter vectors for ROR and REV-ERB activity contained three copies of the previously described wild type and consensus RORE (26Burke L. Downes M. Carozzi A. Giguere V. Muscat G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3481-3489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used: (proRORE)4x-TATA::Luc, forward, 5′-GATCTGAGGAGGCCTGTCTAGGTCAGCTAAATCCGAGGAG-3′; and reverse, 5′-GATCCTCCTCGGATTTAGCTGACCTAGACAGGCCTCCTCA-3′; (proROREmut)4x-TATA::Luc, forward, 5′-GATCTGAGGAGGCCTGTCTAGAGTAGCTAAATCCGAGGAG-3′; and reverse, 5′-GATCCTCCTCGGATTTAGCTACTCTAGACAGGCCTCCTCA-3′; (intRORE)4x-TATA::Luc, forward, 5′-GATCTCCCGCGCGGCACAGTGACCTATTTGGCGGGCACAG-3′; and reverse, 5′-GATCCTGTGCCCGCCAAATAGGTCACTGTGCCGCGCGGGA-3′; (intROREmut)4x-TATA::Luc, forward, 5′-GATCTCCCGCGCGGCACAGTACTCTATTTGGCGGGCACAG-3′; and reverse, 5′-GATCCTGTGCCCGCCAAATAGAGTACTGTGCCGCGCGGGA-3′; (consRORE)3x-TATA:: Luc, forward, 5′-GATCTGACTGATCCATAAGTAGGTCAGGATCCTAGCAG-3′; and reverse, 5′-GATCCTGCTAGGATCCTGACCTACTTATGGATCAGTCA-3′; (consROREmut)3x-TATA::Luc, forward, 5′-GATCTGACTGATCCATAAGTAGAGTAGGATCCTAGCAG-3′; and reverse, 5′-GATCCTGCTAGGATCCTACTCTACTTATGGATCAGTCA. RORE elements are in bold, and mutated nucleotides are underlined. Expression vectors for RORα4 (NM_134262) and RORγ (NM_005060) were obtained by amplification of the respective open reading frames using HepG2 cell cDNA and the following primers: RORα4, forward, 5′-GCGCTTAAATGATGTATTTTGTGATCGC-3′; and reverse, 5′-CATTTACCCATCAATTTGCATTGCTG; RORγ forward, 5′-GGGAGCTGCACCATGGACAGGGC-3′; and reverse, 5′-GGGAGAGGCAAGGAGTCCCTCTTCC. The resulting fragments were then digested by EcoRI and ligated into pcDNA3.1. To construct expression vectors for REVERBα (NM_145434) and REVERBβ (NM_011582), the respective open reading frames were amplified by PCR from mouse liver cDNA using the following primers: REV-ERBα, forward, 5′-GGTGAAGACATGACGACCCTGGACTCC-3′; and reverse, 5′-CGGGTCACTGGGCGTCCACCCGGAAG-3′; REVERBβ, forward, 5′-CGCGGATCCCACCATGGAGCTGAACGCAGGAGG-3′; and reverse, 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAAGGATGAACTTTAAAGGC-3′. The resulting fragments were digested by NotI or BamHI, respectively, and ligated into pcDNA3.1. All the constructs were verified by sequencing. CLOCK and BMAL1 expression vector have described previously (27Grechez-Cassiau A. Panda S. Lacoche S. Teboul M. Azmi S. Laudet V. Hogenesch J.B. Taneja R. Delaunay F. J. Biol.

NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected for 7 h with reporter (100 ng) and expression (300 ng) vectors using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated for 48 h in fresh medium, and luciferase activity was determined using Promega reagents and a Berthold Centro LB960 luminometer. Luciferase activities were normalized to total protein concentrations. Real-time PCR–Measurements were performed with a Light Cycler 1.5 (Roche Applied Science, Meylan, France) using SYBR green I dye detection according to the manufacturer's recommendations. cDNA was added to a reaction mixture (Faststart DNA SYBR Green I; Roche Diagnostics) with appropriate primers at 0.5 μm each and amplified using the following PCR conditions: 10 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 65 °C, and 10 s at 72 °C for 45 cycles and then melting curve analysis. Relative mRNA abundance was calculated using a standard curve method. Expression levels were normalized to the levels of 36B4. The following primers were used: p21, forward, 5′-GCAGACCAGCCTGACAGATTT-3′; and reverse, 5′-GAGAGGGCAGGCAGCGTAT-3′; RORα4, forward, 5′-CGCAGCGATGAAAGCTCA-3′; and reverse, 5′-TTGGACATCCGACCAAACTT-3′; RORγ forward, 5′-TTTTGAGGAAACCAGGCATC-3′; and reverse, 5′-CCACATCTCCCACATTGACTTC-3′; Rev-erbα forward, 5′-AACCTCCAGTTTGTGTCAAGGT-3′; and reverse, 5′-GATGACGATGATGCAGAAGAAG-3′; Rev-erbβ forward, 5′-TTCCAGTAGGTGGATGTTCTCA-3′; and reverse, 5′-CTGCTGGGGTAAAACTCATTG-3′; p53, forward, 5′-GCTTCTCCGAAGACTGGATGA-3′; and reverse, 5′-GACACTCGGAGGGCTTCACT-3′; Wee1, forward, 5′-GAGCGTATTTTAATGATTCC-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGAGCCAGCCAATGGTTTT-3′; Cdk6, forward, 5′-GGCAAAGACCTACTTCTGAAATG-3′; and reverse, 5′-GCCAATGTGTTCAGATGACG-3′; Ccne2, forward, 5′-GCATCAGTATGAGATTAGGAATTG-3′; and reverse, 5′-CAGAATGCAGAACTTGAAAATGT-3′; 36B4, forward, 5′-GCTGATGGGCAAGAACACCA-3′; and reverse, 5′-CCCAAAGCCTGGAAGAAGGA-3′. Western Blot Analysis–Harvested cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (10 μg/ml aprotinin and pepstatin). Total cellular proteins (50–100 μg/lane) were loaded, separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), incubated with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline) for 2 h, and probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. The following primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:100 for p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Sc-397) and 1:1000 for EF-1α (Upstate Biotechnology). After incubation with second antibodies, peroxidase activity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) and using a LAS3000 imager (Fuji). [methyl-3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay–DNA synthesis was measured by adding 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences, 25 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml) to primary hepatocytes for 16–24 h. Radiolabeled cells were washed, scraped, and centrifuged, and the cell pellets were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer. DNA was precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid, and the incorporated radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting and normalized to total proteins. RNA Interference–Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: p21 siRNA control, sense, 5′-GCAGACCAGCCUAACAGAU-3′, and antisense, 5′-AUCUGUUAGGCUGGUCUGC-3′; p21 siRNA, sense 5′-CACGUGGCCUUGUCGCUGU-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACAGCGACAAGGCCACGUG-3′ plus two 2′-deoxythymidine overhangs on each strand. Transfection of siRNA (100 nm) was performed in 35-mm plates in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000. After 16 h of incubation, the medium was changed to William's E medium supplemented with 5 μg of insulin and 1 μm dexamethasone. [methyl-3H]Thymidine was added 4 h later. Cells were collected 24 h later and assayed for DNA synthesis and protein expression. p21 Is a Clock-controlled Gene–We and others previously identified through genome-wide analysis of rhythmic gene expression in peripheral tissues or cells several cell cycle genes including p21, a well known cell cycle inhibitor (18Grundschober C.

Real-time PCR analysis of p21 mRNA levels in the liver from mice kept in constant darkness confirmed that p21 expression is controlled by an endogenous oscillator, with peak and trough values at constant darkness 0 and constant darkness 8, respectively (Fig. 1A). Genomic analyses of circadian gene expression in peripheral tissues have shown that very few (10%) clock-controlled genes oscillate in more than one tissue (28Delaunay F. Laudet V. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 595-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Profiling different peripheral organs for p21 expression revealed that its rhythmic gene expression pattern was not restricted to the liver as the heart and skeletal muscle displayed a similar gene expression pattern (supplemental information, Fig. S1). These observations show that the high tissue specificity of clock-controlled gene expression does not apply to p21, possibly because its main function is related to an essential and ubiquitous cellular process. To test genetically that p21 is controlled by clock genes, we next analyzed its expression in Bmal1-null mice, a clock-deficient model that exhibits a profound alteration of the circadian system (25Bunger M.K.

Curtis A.M. Boston R.C. Panda S. Hogenesch J.B. Fitzgerald G.A. PLoS. Biol. 2004; 2: e377Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). A dramatic increase of p21 mRNA levels from ZT4 to ZT16 with 8–12-fold overexpression at ZT8 was observed in the liver of Bmal1–/– mice as compared with wild type animals (Fig. 1B). Although this observation suggests that BMAL1 represses p21 transcription, the lack of cognate E-box element in the p21 promoter and first intron makes unlikely a direct inhibitory mechanism. p53, a well known regulator of p21 that has also been reported to oscillate in the human oral mucosa (17Bjarnason G.A. Jordan R.C. Sothern R.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 31el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R.

Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar), is expressed identically in Bmal1–/– and wild type livers in which no significant rhythmicity can be detected (Fig. 1C). p53 is therefore not a putative circadian regulator of p21. Consistently, recent data showed that p53 expression is neither rhythmic in wild type mouse liver nor altered in Per2-null mice and that Per1 overexpression in colon cancer cells leads to the inhibition of p21 in response to ionizing radiation independently of p53 (19Fu L. Pelicano H. Liu J. Huang P. Lee C. Cell. 2002; 111: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 32Gery S. Komatsu N. Baldjyan L. Yu A. Koo D. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). These and our observations strongly suggest that clock genes regulate p21 through a p53-independent pathway. To extend our analyses of the interactions between clock and cell cycle genes in the liver, we also investigated the effect of the Bmal1 mutation on three additional genes, Wee1, Cdk6, and Ccne2. Wee1 is a known clock target regulating the G2/M transition (16Matsuo T. Yamaguchi S. Mitsui S. Emi A. Shimoda F. Okamura H. Science. 2003; 302: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) that is expressed at intermediate and constant levels in Bmal1–/– animals (Fig. 1D). Cdk6 and Ccne2, which encode cell cycle protein involved in the G1 phase and G1/S transition, respectively, showed neither a significant oscillation in wild type liver nor an alteration of their expression in the mutant liver (Fig. 1, E and F). The p21 protein is a short-lived molecule that undergoes proteasomal degradation and that is consequently nearly undetectable in adult mouse tissues unless cell cycle arrest is stimulated (33Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. DeMartino G. Pagano M. Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 34Jascur T. Brickner H. Salles-Passador I. Barbier V. El Khissiin A. Smith B. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 237-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As the p21 mRNA was also found to oscillate in the cardiac and skeletal muscles, we analyzed p21 protein expression in C2C12 cells, a well established cellular model of skeletal muscle terminal differentiation during which the p21 protein is induced (35Guo K. Wang J. Andres V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Differentiated C2C12 myotubes were subjected to a serum shock to synchronize the cellular circadian clocks, and p21 mRNA and protein level were monitored for 52 h (36Nagoshi E. Saini C. Bauer C. Laroche T. Naef F. Schibler U. Cell. 2004; 119: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Results show that the p21 gene is clock-controlled in differentiated myotubes and that the p21 protein display a rhythmic expression pattern that mirrors that of the mRNA (Fig. 2, A and B). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the cell cycle inhibitor p21 gene is a circadian clock output in addition to Wee1 and that these two genes are differentially affected by the Bmal1 mutation. They further suggest a regulatory mechanism that does not directly involve the core clock component BMAL1. REV-ERB and ROR Nuclear Receptors Regulate p21 Expression–A close analysis of the phase relationship between the profiles of p21 and other known clock components suggested the orphan nuclear receptors Rev-erbα and Rev-erbβ (NR1D2) as two putative direct negative regulators because they are Bmal1 targets, and both peak when p21 is low. Consistently, Rev-erbα is a known target of the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer (5Preitner N. Damiola F. Lopez-Molina L. Zakany J. Duboule D. Albrecht U. Schibler U. Cell. 2002; 110: 251-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 37Triqueneaux G. Thenot S. Kakizawa T. Antoch M.P. Safi R. Takahashi J.S. Delaunay F. Laudet V. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 585-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These two repressors bind to the same DNA response elements as ROR orphan nuclear receptors (termed RORE; consensus sequence: WAWNTRGGTCA), which in contrast, activates transcription. Although Rev-erbα and Reverbβ are ubiquitously expressed, ROR receptors display more complex expression patterns, with RORα4 and RORγ (NR1F3) being the only isotypes detected in liver. Interestingly, two evolutionary conserved RORE are present in the promoter and first intron regions of the p21 gene (Fig. 3A). This suggested that p21 oscillation could directly result from an alternative activation and repression mediated by ROR and REV-ERB proteins, respectively. However, because we could not exclude a direct negative regulation of the p21 gene by the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer as shown previously for c-myc (19Fu L. Pelicano H. Liu J. Huang P. Lee C. Cell. 2002; 111: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), we tested the response of a 2240-bp 5′ fragment of the p21 promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene (p21Prom::Luc construct) in a cotransfection assay. No significant increase over basal activity could be observed in contrast to the reporter gene driven by Per1 consensus E-box elements (Fig. 3B). In contrast, RORγ transactivated the same p21Prom::Luc reporter construct, which contained the proRORE, by ∼2.5-fold, whereas RORα4 did not (Fig. 3C). A deletion mutant lacking the proRORE site (p21PromΔ1663::Luc construct) abolished the RORγ-dependent activation (Fig. 3C). Both REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ could antagonize the RORγ-dependent transactivation of the p21 promoter (Fig. 3C). A reporter construct containing a multimerized proRORE ((proRORE)4x-TATA::Luc) was activated 2.2- and 1.6-fold in the presence of RORγ and RORα4, respectively, consistently with the results obtained using the full promoter sequence (Fig. 3D). Similarly, RORγ activity was antagonized by coexpressing REV-ERBα or REV-ERBβ. The relatively modest induction mediated by the proRORE suggested that part if not most of the p21 circadian regulation may involve additional response element(s). To address this issue, the identified intronic RORE (intRORE), which virtually matches the previously defined consensus RORE sequence, was tested. Cotransfection of the ((intRORE)4x-TATA::Luc) reporter construct together with RORγ and RORα4 resulted in a 2- and 9-fold activation, respectively (Fig. 3E), that is similar to that obtained with the consensus element (Fig. 3F). REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ significantly repressed the ROR-dependent activation (Fig. 3, E and F). Corresponding mutated elements showed no response (Fig. 3, D and E). Altogether, these data demonstrate that the p21 locus contains functional elements that specify the responsiveness to the ROR and REV-ERB clock components. The Bmal1 Mutation Disrupts the ROR/REV-ERB Balance–To genetically test in vivo the assumption that RORα4, RORγ, Rev-erbα, and Rev-erbβ are downstream of Bmal1 and upstream of p21, we analyzed their mRNA expression profiles throughout the 24-h cycle. RORα4 was not rhythmic in wild type liver and not significantly affected by the loss of Bmal1 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, RORγ exhibited a robust rhythmic expression pattern in wild type liver with peak levels at ZT20, hence 4 h before that of p21, consistent with an activating role (Fig. 4B). Notably, RORγ was significantly overexpressed at all time points in Bmal1–/– liver, a finding that, together with the functional RORE recently identified in the RORγ promoter (38Ueda H.R. Hayashi S. Chen W. Sano M. Machida M. Shigeyoshi Y. Iino M. Hashimoto S. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), suggests a positive autoregulation antagonized by REV-ERBα and/or REV-ERBβ. The opposite situation was observed with Rev-erbα and Rev-erbβ, which displayed a robust oscillation in WT animals but were nearly undetectable at all time points in Bmal1–/– animals (Fig. 4, C and D). These genetic data together with biochemical data suggest that p21 up-regulation in Bmal1–/– animals primarily results from the loss of Rev-erbα and Reverbβ expression possibly combined with the increased expression of RORγ. In this context, the release of the REV-ERB-dependent inhibition of RORα4 activity is also likely to play a role. Changes in additional unidentified positive and negative regulators of p21 expression may also play an additional role. From these data, we propose that in liver, the clock control of p21 high amplitude oscillation results from a RORa4- and RORγ-dependent activation, which is rhythmically repressed by REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ. Impaired Proliferation in Bmal1–/– Hepatocytes–Unlike a large number of cell types that undergo terminal differentiation associated with permanent withdrawal from the cell cycle, mature quiescent hepatocytes retain high proliferative potential. After partial hepatectomy or acute injury, growth-arrested hepatocytes can rapidly and synchronously enter the cell cycle (39Diehl A.M. Front Biosci. 2002; 7: e301-e314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the p21 protein is undetectable in normal adult liver, it is strongly induced following partial hepatectomy, during which it regulates cell cycle progression (40Ilyin G.P. Glaise D. Gilot D. Baffet G. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G115-G127Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p21 in Bmal1–/– mouse liver may thus compromise cell proliferation. Using a primary cell culture system, we observed that spontaneous proliferation of Bmal1–/– hepatocytes was significantly delayed by ∼24 h, whereas p21 protein induction was higher in comparison with that of WT cells (Fig. 5A). If this phenotype was the result of p21 overexpression, then reducing p21 expression would rescue the WT phenotype. To test this hypothesis, Bmal1–/– cells were assayed for proliferation in the presence of either a specific or a control p21 siRNA. Results show that specific siRNA-mediated knockdown of p21 expression caused a significant increased of the proliferation of hepatocytes as compared with untreated or siRNA control Bmal1–/– cells. In analogy to the work by Matsuo et al. (16Matsuo T. Yamaguchi S. Mitsui S. Emi A. Shimoda F. Okamura H. Science. 2003; 302: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar), who showed that loss of clock activity in Cry1–/–/Cry 2–/– double mutant animals resulted in a delayed liver regeneration, we show here that a mutation in another key core clock gene results in a very similar phenotype. The kinase Wee1, a critical regulator of the G2/M transition during cell division cycle, was proposed as a direct CLOCK: BMAL1 target mediating the circadian gating of mitosis in liver (16Matsuo T. Yamaguchi S. Mitsui S. Emi A. Shimoda F. Okamura H. Science. 2003; 302: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that progression through G1 may also undergo a circadian control through the ROR/REV-ERB pathway targeting the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Along this line, the clock Δ19 mutation was also reported to reduce the proliferation of embryonic fibroblasts (41Miller B.H. McDearmon E.L. Panda S. Hayes K.R. Zhang J. Andrews J.L. Antoch M.P. Walker J.R. Esser K.A. Hogenesch J.B. Takahashi J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3342-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was also recently shown that the mammalian PER1 protein interacts with the checkpoint kinase 2, an important link between DNA damage-activated kinases with checkpoint effectors and DNA repair (32Gery S. Komatsu N. Baldjyan L. Yu A. Koo D. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that the circadian clock can control cell proliferation at multiple levels including the G1 phase and G2/M transition as well as the DNA damage response pathway (Fig. 6). This raises the critical issue of how these actions are coordinated to provide an optimal circadian gating of the cell division cycle. These aspects are likely to become particularly relevant in the context of pathologies for which a strong circadian component is recognized including cancer as accumulating epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidences indicate that disruption of the circadian system is linked to tumor cell growth (19Fu L.

https://openalex.org/W2029690888,"Molecular chaperones may promote cell survival, but how this process is regulated, especially in cancer, is not well understood. Using high throughput proteomics screening, we identified the cell cycle regulator and apoptosis inhibitor survivin as a novel protein associated with the molecular chaperone Hsp60. Acute ablation of Hsp60 by small interfering RNA destabilizes the mitochondrial pool of survivin, induces mitochondrial dysfunction, and activates caspase-dependent apoptosis. This response involves disruption of an Hsp60-p53 complex, which results in p53 stabilization, increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bax, and Bax-dependent apoptosis. In vivo, Hsp60 is abundantly expressed in primary human tumors, as compared with matched normal tissues, and small interfering RNA ablation of Hsp60 in normal cells is well tolerated and does not cause apoptosis. Therefore, Hsp60 orchestrates a broad cell survival program centered on stabilization of mitochondrial survivin and restraining of p53 function, and this process is selectively exploited in cancer. Hsp60 inhibitors may function as attractive anticancer agents by differentially inducing apoptosis in tumor cells."

However, for three βAR ligands there is a marked bias toward β-arrestin signaling; these ligands stimulate β-arrestin-dependent receptor activities to a much greater extent than would be expected given their efficacy for G protein-dependent activity.

Clinically, 7TMR ligands are the single largest class of pharmacologic agents (3Wise A. Gearing K. Rees S. Drug Discov. Today. 2002; 7: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). According to a well established and evolutionarily conserved paradigm, 7TMRs signal through direct activation of heterotrimeric G proteins to promote the activation or inhibition of second messenger-generating enzymes and changes in second messenger-dependent effector activities (4Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). Thus, for example, agonist stimulation of β2AR promotes Gs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase, with subsequent cAMP production and cAMP-associated signaling events. Signal termination and 7TMR desensitization result from recruitment of β-arrestin proteins to the cytoplasmic surface of 7TMR following agonist-stimulated receptor phosphorylation by the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family of proteins (5Lefkowitz R.J. Rajagopal K. Whalen E.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 6Lefkowitz R.J. Whalen E.J. Curr. Opin.

When originally identified, the β-arrestin proteins were believed to play a role only in limiting 7TMR signaling by physically interceding between the receptor and G protein. Recent work has demonstrated, however, that for a variety of 7TMRs, β-arrestin proteins can mediate G protein-independent 7TMR signaling by selectively scaffolding signaling cascade components, including small GTP-binding proteins and members of the MAPK cascade (5Lefkowitz R.J. Rajagopal K. Whalen E.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 7Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). These findings have had a profound impact on our understanding of 7TMR ligand pharmacology. Historically, 7TMR ligands have been classified according to their ability to promote receptor activation (agonists) or inhibit agonist-mediated receptor activation (antagonists). This binary categorization underestimates, however, the true complexity of 7TMR ligand behavior. The identification of inverse agonists, which inhibit ligand-independent (i.e. constitutive) activity of 7TMRs for G protein activation (8Bond R.A. Leff P. Johnson T.D. Milano C.A. Rockman H.A. McMinn T.R. Apparsundaram S. Hyek M.F. Kenakin T.P. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), broadened the spectrum of 7TMR ligands to at least three fundamentally distinct classes. In this pharmacologic paradigm, 7TMR ligands were thought to exhibit “correlated efficacies,” stimulating or inhibiting all functions of a receptor to the same extent. Consistent with this were studies performed 2 decades ago in which purified β2AR was reconstituted in a phospholipid vesicle system either with GRK2 or with both Gs and adenylyl cyclase (9Benovic J.L. Staniszewski C. Mayor Jr., F. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3893-3897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the intrinsic abilities of a series of βAR ligands defined as partial agonists for G protein activation demonstrated a near-perfect correlation (coefficient of 0.996) in the ability of each ligand to stimulate G protein-mediated (adenylyl cyclase activation) or β-arrestin-associated (βAR phosphorylation) activities (9Benovic J.L. Staniszewski C. Mayor Jr., F. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3893-3897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recent results, however, suggest that some β2AR antagonists are actually agonists for some signaling pathways, thus, for example, stimulating MAPK activation while blocking G protein (10Azzi M.

We refer to such selective signal activation as “ligand bias” (13Violin J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 416-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), but the same phenomenon has also been described as “ligand-directed trafficking” (14Berg K.A. Maayani S. Goldfarb J. Scaramellini C. Leff P. Clarke W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), “protean agonism” (15Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol.

Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Recent evidence demonstrates that biased ligands can selectively activate β-arrestin signaling without activating G protein signaling. For example, angiotensin II-induced signaling via angiotensin II receptor type 1a (AT1aR) leads to Gαq/11-mediated activation of phospholipase C- and β-arrestin-dependent functions, whereas AT1aR activation by a peptide analogue of angiotensin II ([Sar1,Ile4,Ile4]angiotensin II, denoted SII) leads to β-arrestin-dependent MAPK activation alone (17Holloway A.C.

Because the standard approach to 7TMR ligand discovery and biochemical characterization is based solely on G protein-dependent activities such as second messenger accumulation, we set out to develop a systematic approach that would allow us to unequivocally distinguish the ability of a ligand to modulate classic G protein-dependent activities from distinct signals. Accordingly, we chose to use the prototypical 7TMR β2AR as a model system both because we have shown previously that a mutant β2AR was capable of G protein-independent/β-arrestin-dependent signaling and because a wealth of well characterized ligands that have been demonstrated previously to modulate G protein-dependent activities at β2AR are readily available commercially. Using a set of FRET-based live-cell biosensors, we interrogated a series of ligands in search of β-arrestin-biased agonists in hopes of establishing structure-activity relationships for β-arrestin ligand bias at β2AR.

Cells were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, placed in imaging buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and imaged in the dark on a stage heated to 37 °C. Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc.) with a Roper Micromax cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics) controlled by SlideBook 4.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). CFP and FRET images were obtained through a 436/20 excitation filter (20-nm bandpass centered at 436 nm), a 455DCLP dichroic longpass mirror, and separate emission filters (480/30 for CFP and 535/30 for FRET). YFP intensity was imaged from a 500/20 excitation filter, a 515LP dichroic mirror, and a 535/30 emission filter. All optical filters were obtained from Chroma Technologies. Excitation and emission filters were switched in filter wheels (Lambda 10-2; Sutter Instruments). Integration times were varied between 100 and 300 ms to optimize signal and minimize photobleaching. Cyclic AMP FRET Assays—G protein efficacy was measured by detection of the second messenger cAMP. cAMP was measured using the biosensor ICUE2 (28Violin J.D. DiPilato L.M. Yilderim N. Elston T.C. Zhang J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2949-2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), an improved version of ICUE (27DiPilato L.M. Cheng X. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16513-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). ICUE2 is an Epac1 (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP)-based sensor fused to both CFP and YFP; cAMP binds to Epac, causing conformational changes that induce a change in intramolecular FRET. G protein efficacy was quantified as the integrated change in the FRET ratio (CFP intensity over YFP intensity) over the 5 min following ligand addition. This measure captures both the kinetics and amplitude of G protein efficacy. β-Arrestin Translocation FRET Assays—GRK/β-arrestin efficacy was measured as the rate of β-arrestin recruitment to β2AR. We measured this rate by detecting formation of the receptor-arrestin complex, reported by FRET, between β2AR-mCFP and β-arrestin2-mYFP (13Violin J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 416-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Endocytosis FRET Assays—β2AR internalization was measured by co-expressing β2AR-mCFP and a membrane-targeted mYFP bearing a sequence coding for myristoylation and palmitoylation, MyrPalm-mYFP (29Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). In the basal state, these two proteins colocalize in the plasma membrane, where their effective concentration is sufficiently high to result in intermolecular FRET, even in the absence of any intermolecular affinity. This “packing” effect can lead to artifactual results when studying protein-protein interactions by FRET (30Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), but is used here simply to generate a marker of membrane colocalization. When β2AR-mCFP internalizes from the cell surface after stimulation, MyrPalm-mYFP remains behind; this loss of colocalization leads to a reduction in basal FRET in proportion to the amount of β2AR-mCFP that is sequestered. Thus, this assay provides a real-time kinetic measurement of receptor internalization and can in principle be extended to the study of any protein that traffics to or from the plasma membrane. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Silencing of Gene Expression—Chemically synthesized, double-stranded siRNAs with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′-dTdT overhangs were purchased from Xeragon (Germantown, MD) in a deprotected and desalted form. The siRNA sequence targeting human β-arrestin2 was 5′-AAGGACCGCAAAGUGUUUGUG-3′, corresponding to positions 148–168 relative to the start codon (31Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1740-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A nonsilencing RNA duplex, 5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′, was used, as per the manufacturer's instructions, as the control (31Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1740-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For siRNA experiments, early passage HEK-293 cells that were ∼40–50% confluent on 100-mm dishes were transfected with 20 μg of siRNA using the GeneSilencer transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems). Forty-eight hours later, the cells were split and seeded into 6- or 12-well dishes for pERK assays. Only experiments with validated silencing were analyzed; the average silencing of β-arrestin2 was 69.9 ± 1.6%. pERK Assays—HEK-293 cells in 6- or 12-well plates were starved for 4 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. After stimulation with the appropriate ligand for 5 min, cells were solubilized directly by adding 2× SDS sample buffer, followed by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. For each transfection, an equal aliquot of cells was set aside for protein determination (Bradford). Immunoblotting—Equal microgram quantities of cellular extracts were separated on 4–20% (for pERK1/2 detection) or 10% (for β-arrestin detection) Tris/glycine-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting, according to standard protocols. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 were detected by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (1:2000; Cell Signaling) and anti-MAPK1/2 (1:10,000; Millipore) antibodies, respectively. To determine β-arrestin2 protein silencing, endogenous β-arrestin1/2 were detected with anti-β-arrestin antibody (A1CT; 1:3000) as described previously (32Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemiluminescence detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce). Chemiluminescence was quantified by a charge-coupled device camera (Syngene ChemiGenius2) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GraphPad PRISM software was used for data analyses. Given the recent recognition that 7TMRs are capable of G protein-independent/β-arrestin-dependent signaling, we tested a broad panel of previously described full and partial agonists of G protein activity at β2AR for β-arrestin-biased activities using HEK-293 cells as the basis for our β2AR model systems. Accordingly, the ability of each compound to induce cAMP production via the endogenously expressed β2AR was assessed in HEK-293 cells stably expressing ICUE2, an improved version of the FRET-based cAMP reporter ICUE (27DiPilato L.M. Cheng X. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16513-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This highly sensitive technique allows for the quantitative comparison of both the relative amount of cAMP generated in response to ligand stimulation and the rigorous quantification of the rate at which cAMP production occurs. As shown in Fig. 1A, the classic βAR agonist isoproterenol (Iso) resulted in a rapid but transient cAMP response, as did a series of βAR partial agonists. The ICUE2 response was completely abrogated by pretreatment of cells with the βAR antagonist propranolol or ICI-118,551 and exhibited a standard dose-response relationship for varying concentrations of isoproterenol, with an EC50 similar to previous findings (28Violin J.D. DiPilato L.M. Yilderim N. Elston T.C. Zhang J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2949-2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The ICUE2 dose-response relationship was the same regardless of whether the ICUE2 response was measured as the initial linear rate, the maximum response, or the integrated response over time (data not shown). Because the integrated response captures both the kinetics and amplitude of cAMP dynamics, we chose that measure as the simplest representation of G protein efficacy. The proximal event in β-arrestin-dependent signaling is thought to be ligand-stimulated 7TMR phosphorylation by GRKs, followed by β-arrestin translocation from the cytosol to the phosphorylated 7TMR (5Lefkowitz R.J. Rajagopal K. Whalen E.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We thus used a FRET-based measurement of receptor/β-arrestin interaction as an indicator of β-arrestin-dependent signaling. We have found previously that the rate of β-arrestin recruitment, and not the amount of β-arrestin recruited, is sensitive to changes in GRK concentrations (26Violin J.D. Ren X.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20577-20588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); thus, differences in GRK/β-arrestin efficacy will manifest most acutely as changes in the kinetics of β-arrestin recruitment. Accordingly, we used the rate of β-arrestin recruitment to measure GRK/β-arrestin efficacy. HEK-293 cells with stable co-expression of β2AR-mCFP and β-arrestin2-mYFP were incubated with the same expanded panel of βAR ligands utilized in the initial screen described for Fig. 1A. As seen in Fig. 1B, these ligands demonstrated a range of efficacies. Interestingly, we found one ligand, CPB, that exhibits a marked bias: robust β-arrestin efficacy despite only moderate G protein efficacy. We investigated this bias more fully by characterizing a larger set of βAR ligands, including a number that are used clinically. The addition of each ligand at a receptor-saturating concentration (100-fold higher than published kd values) revealed a range of efficacies for G protein activation and β-arrestin recruitment. As seen in Fig. 2A, a correlation plot clearly shows that although most ligands were essentially Iso-efficacious for G protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent activities, several ligands were more efficacious for β-arrestin translocation to β2AR than for cAMP production. CPB exhibits G protein efficacy nearly identical to that of the partial agonist norepinephrine (Fig. 1A), but β-arrestin efficacy greater than that of the full agonist isoproterenol. Indeed, CPB engendered β-arrestin recruitment 3.2-fold more rapidly than did norepinephrine. Furthermore, relative to the full G protein agonist Iso, which did not demonstrate any bias in its ability to promote cAMP production or β-arrestin translocation, CPB was only 58% as efficient for G protein activation, but 1.3-fold more efficient for β-arrestin recruitment. Several additional ligands (Fig. 2A, shown in red) were also found to have significant β-arrestin bias. These were ethylnorepinephrine and isoetharine, structural derivatives of norepinephrine and Iso, respectively. Specificity of these ligands' activities was demonstrated by blocking all effects with the β2AR-specific antagonist ICI-118,551 and by the absence of any effect of blocking endogenous α-adrenergic receptors with the antagonist yohimbine (data not shown). We also measured the bias present among the tested ligands by calculating a “bias factor,” the ratio of β-arrestin efficacy to G protein (cAMP) efficacy (Fig. 2B). This analysis allowed us to rapidly discern which ligands appear biased and are of interest for further study. As a benchmark, we chose a guideline of twice the S.D. of isoproterenol's bias factor: although isoetharine and ethylnorepinephrine exhibit only modest bias factors, CPB exhibits a bias factor appreciably larger than this benchmark. Thus, we hypothesize that isoetharine, ethylnorepinephrine, and especially CPB are β-arrestin-biased ligands and as such will differ in downstream effects when compared with unbiased agonists. β-Arrestin translocation to 7TMRs in response to ligand stimulation follows receptor phosphorylation at cytoplasmic serines and threonines by the GRK family of kinases (6Lefkowitz R.J. Whalen E.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). As another measure of efficacy for GRK/β-arrestin functions, we assayed the rate of agonist-stimulated, GRK-mediated phosphorylation of β2AR. HEK-293 cells stably expressing β2AR (22Shenoy S.K. Drake M.T. Nelson C.D. Houtz D.A. Xiao K. Madabushi S. Reiter E. Premont R.T. Lichtarge O. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2088466646,"Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is fundamentally important throughout life, because non-cleared cells become secondarily necrotic and release intracellular contents, thus instigating inflammatory and autoimmune responses. Secreted “find-me” and exposed “eat-me” signals displayed by the dying cell in concert with the phagocyte receptors comprise the phagocytic synapse of apoptotic cell clearance. In this scenario, lysophospholipids (lysoPLs) are assumed to act as find-me signals for the attraction of phagocytes. However, both the identity of the lyso-PLs released from apoptotic cells and the nature of the phagocyte receptor are largely unknown. By a detailed analysis of the structural requirements we show here that lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), but none of the lysoPC metabolites or other lysoPLs, represents the essential apoptotic attraction signal able to trigger a phagocyte chemotactic response. Furthermore, using RNA interference and expression studies, we demonstrate that the G-protein-coupled receptor G2A, unlike its relative GPR4, is involved in the chemotaxis of monocytic cells. Thus, our study identifies lysoPC and G2A as the crucial receptor/ligand system for the attraction of phagocytes to apoptotic cells and the prevention of autoimmunity.

The elimination of apoptotic cells is a critical end point of apoptosis and of fundamental importance for multicellular organisms. Non-cleared apoptotic cells otherwise become secondarily necrotic and release intracellular contents into the surroundings, thus instigating inflammatory reactions. For the timely and efficient removal of apoptotic cells, a network of interactions between the dying cell and the phagocyte has evolved that are displayed at the phagocytic synapse. Secreted find-me and eat-me signals exposed by the dying cell, together with bridging proteins and phagocyte receptors, comprise the central elements for removal of apoptotic cells and prevention of secondary necrosis (1Lauber K. Blumenthal S.G. Waibel M. Wesselborg S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Growing evidence suggests that the defective clearance of apoptotic cells favors the onset of autoimmune diseases (2Gaipl U.S. Franz S. Voll R.E. Sheriff A. Kalden J.R. Herrmann M. Curr. Rheumatol.

Gershov D. Ma X. Brot N. Elkon K.B. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, we could demonstrate that lysoPC also acts as a chemotactic find-me signal attracting the phagocyte to the apoptotic cell (4Lauber K. Bohn E. Krober S.M. Xiao Y.J. Blumenthal S.G. Lindemann R.K. Marini P. Wiedig C. Zobywalski A. Baksh S. Xu Y. Autenrieth I.B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Belka C. Stuhler G. Wesselborg S. Cell. 2003; 113: 717-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). During apoptosis lysoPC is generated by the calcium-independent phospholipase-A2 that is activated by a caspase-3-dependent cleavage mechanism. Once released, lysoPC is assumed to bind to a phagocyte receptor, thereby triggering chemotaxis.The nature of the phagocyte receptor involved in the attraction to apoptotic cells is currently unknown. Receptors involved in phospholipid signaling often exhibit significant promiscuity with many receptors recognizing more than one ligand and vice versa. For lysoPC different receptors have been proposed, including the G-protein-coupled receptor G2A (5Kabarowski J.H. Zhu K. Le L.Q. Witte O.N. Xu Y. Science. 2001; 293: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and its structural relative GPR4 (6Zhu K. Baudhuin L.M. Hong G. Williams F.S. Cristina K.L. Kabarowski J.H. Witte O.N. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (Retraction in J. Biol. Chem. 280, 43280): 41325-41335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, due to the failure to reproduce the original receptor binding data, the role of G2A and GPR4 as high affinity lysoPC receptors remains controversial (6Zhu K. Baudhuin L.M. Hong G. Williams F.S. Cristina K.L. Kabarowski J.H. Witte O.N. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (Retraction in J. Biol.

Science. 2005; 307: 206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their biological role is further complicated by the fact that both G24 and GPR4 have been suggested to bind other ligands such as oxidized fatty acids (oxFAs) as well as extracellular protons, which implicated a pH-sensing function of both receptors (8Murakami N. Yokomizo T. Okuno T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42484-42491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 9Obinata H. Hattori T. Nakane S. Tatei K. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40676-40683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As the receptor for phagocyte recruitment remains unknown, it is also unclear whether lysoPC represents the sole lipid find-me signal or whether additional phospholipids secreted during apoptosis are involved in chemotaxis. Finally, it is unknown whether lysoPC mediates its chemotactic effect via direct receptor binding or indirectly via another unknown pathway.These open questions therefore stimulated us to further investigate the nature of lipid attraction signal and corresponding receptor involved in the macrophage recruitment to apoptotic cells. By a detailed characterization of the structural requirements of the lysoPL agonist, we report here that lysoPC, but no other lysoPLs or lysoPC derivatives, represents the major phospholipid find-me attraction signal released by apoptotic cells. Moreover, using RNA interference and overexpression studies, we identified the receptor G2A, in contrast to its relative GPR4, as the crucial phagocyte receptor mediating the chemotactic response. Thus, our study elucidates the essential ligand/receptor relationships involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells and prevention of autoimmunity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—Cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 0.1 mg of streptomycin/ml, and 10 mm HEPES (all from Invitrogen).

The cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 2 h. The resulting membrane pellet was solubilized in 5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl containing 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Subsequently, 100–200 μg of membrane protein extracts were applied to reducing 8–15% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as previously described (4Lauber K. Bohn E. Krober S.M. Xiao Y.J.

The following probes and primers (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) were used: G2A forward, 5′-TGT GCC CAA TGC TAC TGA AAA AC-3′; G2A reverse, 5′-CGA CCA GGA CTA TCC TGC TCT CT-3′; G2A probe FAM, 5′-TTA CAA TGG AAA CGC CAC CCC AGT GAC-3′-TAMRA; GPR4 forward, 5′-TTC GAG GAG CGC GTC TTT-3′; GPR4 reverse, 5′-GGT CCG CCA CAC AGT TGA-3′; GPR4 probe FAM, 5′-CTG CAT ACC ACA GCT CAC TGG CTT TCA C-3′-TAMRA; ALAS-1 forward, 5′-TCC ACT GCA GCA GTA CAC TAC CA; ALAS-1 reverse, 5′-ACG GAA GCT GTG TGC CAT CT-3′; ALAS-1 probe VIC, 5′-AAA GAA ACC CCT CCG GCC AGT GAG AA-3′-TAMRA.Total RNA from 2 × 106 cells was extracted with the NucleoSpin® RNA II kit (Macherey & Nagel, Dueren, Germany). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with 200 units of Superscript RT II™ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence 50 μm random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences), 400 μm dNTPs (Promega), and 1.6 units/μl RNAsIn™ (Invitrogen). 40–80 ng of the resulting cDNA were applied to the following qRT-PCR analyses (20-μl final volume) with 200 nm primers and 100 nm probe. For the study of siRNA knockdown effects, relative quantification was performed employing the standard curve method. The results were normalized on δ-aminolevulinate-synthase-1, and the cell population transfected with the control oligonucleotide was used as calibrator. The comparison of G2A and GPR4 expression in THP-1 cells was done with the (1+E)–CT-method (efficiency of amplification = 0.96 (G2A) or 0.92 (GPR4)). All experiments were performed in duplicates and are presented as mean values.RESULTSWe have previously found that apoptotic cells secrete find-me signals ensuring the recruitment of macrophages and their final engulfment (4Lauber K. Bohn E. Krober S.M. Xiao Y.J. Blumenthal S.G. Lindemann R.K. Marini P. Wiedig C. Zobywalski A. Baksh S. Xu Y. Autenrieth I.B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Belka C. Stuhler G. Wesselborg S. Cell. 2003; 113: 717-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). During this process, caspase-3-mediated activation of calcium-independent phospholipase-A2 was shown to result in the release of the phospholipid lysoPC that is involved in the chemotactic response. Our previous study, however, could not exclude that lysoPC derivatives or additional lipid signals contribute to the attraction of macrophages. Furthermore, the identity of the corresponding phagocyte receptor remained elusive. To address these objectives, we therefore first performed a detailed characterization of the lysoPL agonist(s), which also allowed us to narrow down the nature of the involved lipid receptor.Headgroup Specificity—The substrate and headgroup specificity of calcium-independent phospholipase-A2 is relatively unknown, and first reports demonstrated little preference for PC (12Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Thus, it was conceivable that apart from lysoPC other lysoPLs might be generated and involved in phagocyte attraction. To explore this possibility, we first investigated whether lysoPLs with different headgroups could compete with the chemoattractant signal in apoptotic culture supernatants (ACS). To neutralize the chemotactic gradient, we added lysoPC, lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS), and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysoPE) to THP-1 monocytes in the upper chamber of a transmigration plate and applied ACS of MCF-7casp3 cells to the lower chamber (diagram in Fig. 1A). Subsequent measurement of cell migration revealed that only lysoPC could efficiently block chemoattraction of THP-1 cells by ACS, whereas lysoPS and lysoPE had little effect (Fig. 1A). To confirm that this was not due to a potential cytotoxicity of the phospholipids, we performed a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide assay showing that the viability of THP-1 cells was not measurably altered by any lysoPL (Fig. 1B).Next, we performed the reverse assay and tested whether the lysoPLs could directly induce THP-1 cell migration. When the lysoPLs were added to the lower transmigration chamber (diagram Fig. 1C), only lysoPC was able to attract THP-1 cells. From these data we can conclude that (i) a phosphocholine headgroup in the lysoPL released by apoptotic cells is required to stimulate cell migration and that (ii) phosphoserine or phosphoethanolamine headgroups only weakly antagonize the apoptotic find-me signal.Role of the Lipid Backbone—It had been shown that, in addition to PC, calcium-independent phospholipase-A2 can also hydrolyze PAF to lysoPAF (12Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the structural requirement of the lipid backbone. Because of the similarity to lysoPC, we included PAF and lysosphingomyelin (lysoSM) in our experiments. With the same experimental design as in Fig. 1A, lysoPC, PAF, lysoPAF, and lysoSM were tested for their potential to compete with the lysoPL attraction signal in ACS. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, all lipids neutralized the apoptotic chemoattractant. Again, examination of THP-1 cell viability did not reveal any profound cytotoxic effect (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Role of the lipid backbone: lysoPC, PAF, lysoPAF, and lysoSM have similar antagonizing effects on the chemoattractant in ACS but only lysoPC and lysoSM stimulate THP-1 cell migration.

D, schematic diagram of the antagonist/agonist profile of the phagocyte receptor, which mediates migration in response to ACS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because of their antagonistic effects, we next studied whether PAF, lysoPAF, and lysoSM also induce migration directly. Remarkably, when applied to the lower transmigration chamber only lysoPC, and to a lesser extent lysoSM, could stimulate THP-1 cell chemotaxis (Fig. 2C). From these results we presume that migration can be induced by glycerol or sphingosine lysoPLs, whereas antagonizing effects on lysoPL-induced migration can also be exerted by sn-1 etherlipids with a free sn-2 OH- or small acyl residue (see Fig. 2D).Role of LysoPC Metabolites—Although lysoPC induced chemotaxis and neutralized the chemotactic activity in ACS, due to its inherent instability, we could not exclude that a lysoPC metabolite acts as the actual find-me signal. For lysoPC, different ways of metabolization are known (Fig. 3E). First, lysoPC can be reesterified to PC. Second, it can be hydrolyzed to lysophosphatidic acid (lysoPA) and a free choline residue by phospholipase D or to glycerophosphocholine and a free fatty acid (FA) by lysophospholipase A1. Therefore, we tested the metabolites PC, lysoPA, and glycerophosphocholine in the competition assay with ACS but could not detect any neutralizing potential (Fig. 3A) or cytotoxic effect (Fig. 3B). Next, we examined the role of the free FA. We deliberately focused on oxFAs because FA oxidation occurs during apoptosis (13Huber J. Vales A. Mitulovic G. Blumer M. Schmid R. Witztum J.L. Binder B.R. Leitinger N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and chemotaxis to oxFAs in contrast to non-oxFAs has been reported (14Henricks P.A.

Thus, these results suggest that only lysoPC itself, and no metabolic derivatives, acts as the effective chemoattractant.FIGURE 3LysoPC itself and no metabolic derivative is responsible for the induction of THP-1 cell migration.

Both receptors have originally been reported to bind lysoPC and, with a weaker affinity, lysoSM (5Kabarowski J.H. Zhu K. Le L.Q. Witte O.N. Xu Y.

Furthermore, whether these receptors are involved in the attraction of monocytes to apoptotic cells was completely unknown.To investigate a functional role of G2A and GPR4, we compared their expression levels in THP-1 cells by qRT-PCR. Fig. 4A shows that THP-1 cells expressed >5-fold more G2A than GPR4 mRNA. Furthermore, we found that, in contrast to THP-1 cells, the monocytic cell line U937 expressed considerably less G2A transcripts (Fig. 4B). The difference of G2A expression was even more evident on the protein level, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis that revealed no anti-G2A reactive band in U937 cells but a prominent expression in THP-1 cells (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4U937 cells do not migrate to lysoPL find-me signals.

https://openalex.org/W2024445551,"Cadmium triggers apoptosis of LLC-PK1 cells through induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We found that cadmium caused generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that cadmium-induced ER stress was inhibited by antioxidants. In contrast, suppression of ER stress did not attenuate cadmium-triggered oxidative stress, suggesting that ER stress occurs downstream of oxidative stress. Exposure of the cells to either O2.¯, H2O2, or ONOO- caused apoptosis, whereas ER stress was induced only by O2.¯ or ONOO-.

It is based on our following findings: 1) Cadmium chloride (CdCl2) induced expression of endogenous ER stress markers, 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), GRP94, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP) in a dose-dependent manner. 2) Attenuation of ER stress by overexpression of GRP78 or 150-kDa oxygen-regulated protein (ORP150) significantly suppressed CdCl2-induced apoptosis. 3) Among three major branches of unfolded protein response (UPR), the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathway and the inositol-requiring ER-to-nucleus signal kinase 1 (IRE1)-X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathway mediated apoptosis. 4) Induction of CHOP by ATF6, IRE1-initiated activation of XBP1, and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were responsible for the induction of apoptosis (1Yokouchi M. Hiramatsu N. Hayakawa K. Kasai A. Takano Y. Yao J. Kitamura M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, several previous studies also indicated involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cadmium-induced renal tubular injury. For example, exposure of LLC-PK1 cells to cadmium caused generation of ROS (2Gennari A. Cortese E. Boveri M. Casado J. Prieto P. Toxicology. 2003; 183: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which was associated with a decrease in glutathione levels and consequent cellular death (3Prozialeck W.C. Lamar P.C.

Another report showed that cadmium-triggered apoptosis of tubular cells was inhibited by an antioxidant (4Thevenod F. Friedmann J.M. Katsen A.D. Hauser I.A. J. Biol.

Oxygen normally accepts four electrons and is converted to water. In biological systems, partial reduction of oxygen occurs, resulting in the generation of cytotoxic ROS. That is, sequential reduction of oxygen leads to generation of superoxide anion (O2.¯) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (5Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) scavenges O2.¯ by catalyzing conversion of O2.¯ to H2O2. O2.¯ also rapidly reacts with nitric oxide (NO), yielding another reactive species, peroxynitrite (ONOO-) (6Szabo C. Ohshima H. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). All of these ROS may be potential triggers of apoptosis (5Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem.

In the present report, we first describe that cadmium induces generation of ROS and consequent ER stress and apoptosis in renal tubular cells. We show that, among ROS generated, O2.¯ but not downstream substances H2O2 and ONOO-, plays a crucial role in cadmium-triggered, ER stress-mediated apoptosis. We further demonstrate that cadmium induces both ER stress-dependent and -independent proapoptotic pathways, the latter of which involves H2O2, but not NO or ONOO-. We also provide evidence that O2.¯ has the potential to induce a novel, atypical proapoptotic pathway, i.e. the XBP1-JNK pathway, as well as the ATF6-CHOP pathway, and thereby critically contributes to cadmium-triggered apoptotic cell death.

Expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a loading control. Densitometric analysis was performed using Scion Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MO). Detection of ROS–Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and loaded with ROS-responsive fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (100 μm) for 3 h in the absence of fetal bovine serum. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were stimulated with CdCl2 or H2O2 for 2 h and subjected to fluorescent microscopy. Assessment of Apoptosis–After induction of apoptosis, morphologic examination was performed by phase-contrast microscopy and fluorescent microscopy for Hoechst 33258 staining, as described before (1Yokouchi M. Hiramatsu N. Hayakawa K. Kasai A. Takano Y. Yao J. Kitamura M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because, in some situations, round cells were easily detached from the bottoms of the plates, percentages of round cells were first evaluated by phase-contrast microscopy and then subjected to Hoechst staining. Apoptosis was identified using morphological criteria, including shrinkage of the cytoplasm (round shape), nuclear condensation, and membrane blebbing. Assays were performed in quadruplicate. Transient Transfection–Using GeneJuice Transfection Reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI), cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-XBP1(S) (18Park H.R. Tomida A. Sato S. Tsukumo Y. Yun J.

Western Blot Analysis–Western blot analysis of ATF6 and GRP78 was performed using anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich Japan) and anti-KDEL antibody (1:1000 dilution; Stressgen, Victoria, Canada). As a loading control, the level of β-actin was evaluated using anti-β-actin antibody (1:3000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich Japan). Phosphorylation of JNK was assessed using PhosphoPlus stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) Antibody Kit (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), as described before (21Hayakawa K. Meng Y. Hiramatsu N. Kasai A. Yamauchi K. Yao J. Kitamura M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Blots were visualized using Western blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Reverse Transcription-PCR–Splicing of XBP1 mRNA was examined by reverse transcription-PCR using following primers; 5′-AAACAGAGTAGCAGCTCAGACTGC-3′ and 5′-TCCTTCTGGGTAGACCTCTGGGAG-3′. As an internal control, expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was examined using the primers as follows; 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. Luciferase Assay–Activity of luciferase was evaluated by Luciferase Assay System (Promega) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Assays were performed in quadruplicate. Statistical Analysis–Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test to compare data in different groups. p value <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. ER Stress as an Event Downstream of Oxidative Stress in Cadmium-exposed Cells–Previous reports indicated involvement of ROS in cadmium-induced renal tubular injury (2Gennari A. Cortese E. Boveri M. Casado J. Prieto P. Toxicology. 2003; 183: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 3Prozialeck W.C. Lamar P.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1995; 134: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 4Thevenod F. Friedmann J.M. Katsen A.D. Hauser I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1887-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We first confirmed generation of ROS in LLC-PK1 cells exposed to cadmium. Cells were loaded with an ROS-responsive fluorescence probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein and stimulated with CdCl2 or H2O2 (positive control). Fluorescence microscopy showed that, under a basal culture condition, LLC-PK1 cells exhibited little fluorescence. Exposure of the cells to cadmium caused substantial and dose-dependent increases in the number of fluorescence-positive cells (Fig. 1A, bottom row). To examine whether the generation of ROS is causative of cadmium-induced apoptosis, cells were pretreated with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or SOD-like antioxidant MnTM-2-PyP, stimulated by CdCl2, and subjected to phase-contrast microscopy and Hoechst staining. As shown in Fig. 1B, CdCl2 induced rounding and detachment of the cells with nuclear condensation typical of apoptosis. Treatment with NAC or MnTM-2-PyP attenuated these morphological changes. Quantitative analysis revealed that percentages of round cells and apoptotic cells with condensed nuclei were significantly reduced by NAC from 43.5 ± 1.9% to 5.1 ± 0.5% (Fig. 1C, left) and from 39.2 ± 3.9% to 4.5 ± 1.0% (Fig. 1C, right), respectively (means ± S.E., p < 0.05). Similarly, percentages of round cells and apoptotic cells were reduced by MnTM-2-PyP from 43.5 ± 1.9% to 13.9 ± 0.9% and from 39.2 ± 3.9% to 12.1 ± 2.5%. Cadmium-induced apoptosis of LLC-PK1 cells is mediated, at least in part, by ER stress (1Yokouchi M. Hiramatsu N. Hayakawa K. Kasai A. Takano Y. Yao J. Kitamura M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To investigate relationship between oxidative stress and ER stress, LLC-PK1 cells were treated with CdCl2 in the absence or presence of NAC, and expression of endogenous ER stress markers GRP78 and GRP94 was examined. Northern blot analysis revealed that induction of GRPs by CdCl2 was partially attenuated by NAC (Fig. 2A, top). Similarly, induction of CHOP by CdCl2 was also inhibited by NAC (Fig. 2A, bottom), suggesting that ER stress is an event downstream of oxidative stress. Of note, induction of c-fos, a marker of oxidative stress (22Amstad P. Crawford D. Muehlematter D. Zbinden I. Larsson R. Cerutti P. Bull. Cancer. 1990; 77: 501-502PubMed Google Scholar, 23Meyer M. Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 91: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), by CdCl2 was completely abolished by NAC (Fig. 2B), indicating involvement of ROS-dependent and -independent induction of ER stress by CdCl2. To exclude a possibility that ER stress is located upstream of oxidative stress, LLC-PK1 cells were stably transfected with the ER chaperone GRP78, which attenuates ER stress. The established ER stress-resistant LL/GRP78 cells exhibited high levels of GRP78 mRNAs (supplemental Fig. S1) and resistance to tunicamycin-induced apoptosis (supplemental Fig. S2). Using LL/GRP78 cells, induction of c-fos by CdCl2 was compared with that in mock transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, expression of c-fos in LL/GRP78 cells was not attenuated when compared with that in LL/Mock cells. Similarly, attenuation of ER stress by overexpression of another ER chaperone ORP150 (1Yokouchi M. Hiramatsu N. Hayakawa K. Kasai A. Takano Y. Yao J. Kitamura M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Ozawa K. Kuwabara K. Tamatani M. Takatsuji K. Tsukamoto Y. Kaneda S. Yanagi H. Stern D.M. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Ogawa S. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6397-6404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) did not affect induction of c-fos by CdCl2 (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results evidenced that ER stress is an event downstream of oxidative stress in cadmium-exposed cells. Involvement of O2.¯ in Cadmium-triggered, ER Stress-dependent Apoptosis–The sequential reduction of oxygen leads to generation of O2.¯ and H2O2 (5Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). O2.¯ also rapidly reacts with NO, yielding another reactive species ONOO- (6Szabo C. Ohshima H. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). All of these ROS have the potential for triggering apoptosis (5Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 6Szabo C. Ohshima H. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 7Buttkea T.M. Sandstromb P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). A previous report indicated that, in HepG2 cells, cadmium triggered production of ROS including O2.¯ and H2O2 (24Oh S.H. Lim S.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2006; 212: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, the major ROS that contribute to CdCl2-induced apoptosis have not been identified. It is also unknown which ROS contribute to the induction of ER stress. To address these issues, we first examined involvement of O2.¯ in the induction of ER stress and apoptosis. LLC-PK1 cells were treated with serial concentrations of menadione, a generator of O2.¯, and expression of GRPs was examined by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, menadione induced expression of GRP78 and GRP94, suggesting that O2.¯ has the potential to induce ER stress. We created LLC-PK1 cells stably overexpressing MnSOD to examine involvement of O2.¯ in the effects of cadmium. Northern blot analysis confirmed abundant expression of MnSOD mRNA in LL/MnSOD-6 cells and LL/MnSOD-7 cells (Fig. 3B). Microscopic analysis revealed that these transfectants were resistant to menadione-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3C). Quantitative analysis showed that percentages of round cells and apoptotic cells with condensed nuclei (evaluated by Hoechst staining) were reduced by MnSOD from 52.6 ± 2.3% to 15.9 ± 0.3% (Fig. 3D, left), and from 44.4 ± 2.7 to 25.3 ± 2.0% (Fig. 3D, right), respectively. Using these transfectants, induction of ER stress by cadmium was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 3E, expression of GRP78 mRNA in response to CdCl2 was significantly reduced in LL/MnSOD cells (p < 0.05). The induction was approximately one-third of that in LL/Mock cells. Similar results were obtained in both LL/MnSOD-6 cells and LL/MnSOD-7 cells. The attenuated induction of GRP78 was associated with blunted accumulation of GRP78 protein (Fig. 3F). Furthermore, attenuation of cadmium-induced ER stress in LL/MnSOD cells was also evidenced by blunted induction of CHOP (Fig. 3G). Subsequent experiments revealed that apoptosis induced by CdCl2 was attenuated in LL/MnSOD cells, when compared with that in LL/Mock cells (Fig. 3H). Quantitative analysis showed that percentages of round cells and apoptotic cells were significantly reduced by MnSOD from 55.0 ± 2.9% to 16.4 ± 0.7% (Fig. 3I, left), and from 57.6 ± 1.9% to 19.8 ± 1.3% (Fig. 3I, right), respectively. These results suggested involvement of O2.¯ in cadmium-triggered ER stress and consequent apoptotic cell death. Involvement of H2O2 in Cadmium-triggered, ER Stress-independent Apoptosis–We next examined involvement of H2O2 in the induction of ER stress and apoptosis by cadmium. LLC-PK1 cells were treated with serial concentrations of H2O2, and expression of GRP78 as well as c-fos was examined by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, H2O2 induced expression of c-fos in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, expression of GRP78 was not increased by H2O2 at any concentration tested. This result indicated lack of involvement of H2O2 in the induction of ER stress and ER stress-dependent apoptosis by cadmium. To further examine this possibility, we created LLC-PK1 cells stably overexpressing catalase. Northern blot analysis confirmed abundant expression of catalase mRNA in LL/Catalase-9 cells and LL/Catalase-11 cells (Fig. 4B). Microscopic analysis revealed that these transfectants were resistant to H2O2-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C, left). Quantitative analysis by Hoechst staining showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells with condensed nuclei (supplemental Fig. S3) was markedly reduced by catalase from 50.4 ± 4.2% to 7.3 ± 0.5% (Fig. 4C, right). Using these transfectants, induction of ER stress by cadmium was re-tested. As shown in Fig. 4D, induction of GRP78 by CdCl2 was not different between LL/Mock cells and LL/Catalase cells. The similar results were obtained in both LL/Catalase-9 cells and LL/Catalase-11 cells. This result, together with the finding shown in Fig. 4A, indicated that H2O2 did not contribute to the induction of ER stress and ER stress-dependent apoptosis in response to cadmium. Interestingly, however, apoptosis induced by CdCl2 was significantly less in LL/Catalase cells, when compared with that in LL/Mock cells (Fig. 4E). Percentages of round cells and apoptotic cells were reduced by catalase from 55.0 ± 2.6% to 21.5 ± 2.9% (Fig. 4F, left), and from 57.6 ± 1.9% to 37.6 ± 5.1% (Fig. 4F, right), respectively. These results indicated that H2O2 was generated in response to CdCl2 and contributed to cadmium-induced apoptosis independent of ER stress. Lack of Involvement of ONOO- in Cadmium-triggered ER Stress and Apoptosis–We further examined involvement of ONOO- in the induction of ER stress and apoptosis by cadmium. LLC-PK1 cells were treated with serial concentrations of 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), a generator of ONOO-, and expression of GRP78 and CHOP, as well as c-fos, was evaluated by Northern blot analysis. Treatment with SIN-1 induced expression of c-fos, indicating induction of oxidative stress (supplemental Fig. S4). As shown in Fig. 5A, SIN-1 also induced expression of GRP78 and CHOP in a dose-dependent manner. Microscopic analyses revealed that treatment with SIN-1 induced membrane blebbing and nuclear condensation typical of apoptosis (Fig. 5B), suggesting the potential of ONOO- to induce ER stress and apoptosis in LLC-PK1 cells. To examine involvement of ONOO- in the effects of cadmium, we used uric acid, an inhibitor of ONOO-, as well as Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), an inhibitor of NO that is required for the generation of ONOO-. As shown in Fig. 5C, both inhibitors did not affect induction of the ER stress markers by CdCl2. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by CdCl2 was not attenuated by uric acid or l-NAME (Fig. 5D). Quantitative analysis showed that, even at the high concentration (5 mm), uric acid and l-NAME did not reduce percentages of round cells (Fig. 5E, left) and apoptotic cells (Fig. 5E, right). These results indicated that ONOO- was not involved in the induction of ER stress and apoptosis by cadmium in LLC-PK1 cells. Activation of the ATF6-CHOP Pathway and the XBP1-JNK Pathway via Cadmium-triggered Generation of O2.¯–Cadmium activates the ATF6-CHOP pathway and the IRE1-XBP1 pathway, both of which contribute to the induction of apoptosis (1Yokouchi M. Hiramatsu N. Hayakawa K. Kasai A. Takano Y. Yao J. Kitamura M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We therefore examined roles of O2.¯ in the activation of these proapoptotic cascades. First, LLC-PK1 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged p90 ATF6, exposed to menadione for up to 6 h, and subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment of the cells with menadione generated active p50 ATF6, suggesting the potential of O2.¯ to activate the ATF6 pathway. To examine whether O2.¯ produced by cadmium is causative of ATF6 activation, LL/Mock cells and LL/MnSOD cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged p90 ATF6, exposed to CdCl2, and subjected to Western blot analysis. Compared with LL/Mock cells, the increase in the level of p50 ATF6 was attenuated in LL/MnSOD cells (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, induction of CHOP in LL/MnSOD cells, but not in LL/Catalase cells, was lower than that in LL/Mock cells (Fig. 6C). These results suggested that the ATF6-CHOP proapoptotic pathway was activated, at least in part, by O2.¯ generated in cadmium-exposed cells. We next examined a role of O2.¯ in the activation of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway. LLC-PK1 cells were treated with menadione for up to 4 h, and splicing of XBP1 mRNA was examined by reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 6D, following the exposure to O2.¯, the spliced form of XBP1 mRNA (XBP1(S)) appeared within 1 h, which was sustained for at least 4 h, confirming the potential of O2.¯ to activate the IRE1-XBP1 pathway. To examine whether cadmium-triggered O2.¯ is causative of activation of this proapoptotic pathway, LL/Mock cells and LL/MnSOD cells were transiently transfected with a reporter plasmid pCAX-F-XBP1ΔDBD-Luc. As described previously, the transfected cells produce luciferase exclusively under the conditions that trigger splicing of XBP1 mRNA (20Iwawaki T. Akai R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In CdCl2-exposed LL/Mock cells, luciferase activity was increased by 73.2% compared with untreated cells. However, this induction was significantly less in LL/MnSOD cells (39.3%) (Fig. 6E). These results suggested that O2.¯ was also involved in the activation of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway in cadmium-exposed cells. In general, the IRE1 pathway is proapoptotic via activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and JNK. Indeed, in our previous report, we demonstrated that JNK was rapidly activated following exposure to cadmium, and pharmacological suppression of JNK substantially attenuated apoptosis (1Yokouchi M. Hiramatsu N. Hayakawa K. Kasai A. Takano Y. Yao J. Kitamura M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, we also found that dominant-negative inhibition of XBP1, which is generally not involved in the IRE1-JNK pathway, markedly attenuated cadmium-induced apoptosis independently of GRP78 or CHOP (1Yokouchi M. Hiramatsu N. Hayakawa K. Kasai A. Takano Y. Yao J. Kitamura M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We speculated that activation of JNK could be an event downstream of XBP1 in cadmium-exposed cells. To examine this possibility, LLC-PK1 cells were stably transfected with a gene coding for XBP1-DN, and LL/XBP1-DN cells were established. Northern blot analysis confirmed substantial expression of the transgene in the established transfectants (supplemental Fig. S5). LL/Mock cells and LL/XBP1-DN cells were then treated with menadione or CdCl2 and subjected to Western blot analysis of phosphorylated JNK. As shown in Fig. 6, F and G (left), both menadione and CdCl2 induced rapid phosphorylation of JNK in LL/Mock cells. In contrast, the activation of JNK was markedly suppressed in LL/XBP1-DN cells (Fig. 6, F and G, right). Furthermore, transfection of LLC-PK1 cells with XBP1(S) enhanced cadmium-triggered phosphorylation of JNK (Fig. 6H), confirming involvement of XBP1 in the activation of JNK. Interestingly, the role of XBP1 was specific to the O2.¯-triggered JNK activation, because 1) phosphorylation of JNK by H2O2 was observed to the same extent in LL/Mock cells and LL/XBP1-DN cells (Fig. 6I) and 2) CdCl2-induced phosphorylation of JNK was similarly observed in LL/Catalase cells (Fig. 6J). Taken together, these results evidenced that cadmium caused activation of the ATF6-CHOP and IRE1-XBP1 proapoptotic pathways via generation of O2.¯ and that activation of JNK was located downstream of XBP1. ROS is implicated in heavy metal-induced renal injury. However, cadmium-induced apoptosis of renal tubular cells is also dependent on ER stress (1Yokouchi M. Hiramatsu N. Hayakawa K. Kasai A. Takano Y. Yao J. Kitamura M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The present study was performed to elucidate roles of individual ROS and downstream events in cadmium-triggered, ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Our results elucidated that 1) cadmium caused ER stress via generation of ROS, 2) O2.¯, but not H2O2 and ONOO-, mediated cadmium-triggered, ER stress-induced apoptosis via activation of the ATF6-CHOP and IRE1-XBP1 pathways, 3) phosphorylation of JNK, a mediator of cadmium-induced apoptosis, was caused via O2.¯-triggered activation of XBP1, and 4) H2O2 was involved in cadmium-induced apoptosis independently of ER stress. The outline of our current hypothesis is summarized and illustrated in Fig. 7. Consistent with our current results, some reports indicated that O2.¯ may be selectively involved in ER stress-associated pathologies. Ischemic injury is a well known pathological situation in which both oxidative stress and ER stress are involved (25Ferrari R. Ceconi C. Curello S. Cargnoni A. Pasini E. Visioli O. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1991; 5: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Using copper/zinc SOD transgenic rats, Hayashi et al. examined induction of ATF4 and CHOP, markers of ER stress, in the brain after cerebral ischemia (27Hayashi T. Saito A. Okuno S. Ferrand-Drake M. Dodd R.L. Chan P.H. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2005; 25: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In wild-type rats, ischemia induced expression of ATF4 and CHOP in the hippocampus, leading to neuronal apoptosis. In contrast, transgenic rats overexpressing SOD showed only a modest increase of these molecules and exhibited minimal neuronal degeneration, indicating that O2.¯ is involved in both induction of ER stress and consequent neuronal death. In biological systems, O2.¯ is rapidly reduced by SOD to H2O2. O2.¯ also rapidly reacts with NO, yielding ONOO-. Once O2.¯ is generated, therefore, H2O2 and ONOO- may be subsequently produced and could contribute to the apoptotic process. In the present study, we found that all these ROS have the potential to induce apoptosis in LLC-PK1 cells. However, H2O2 did not cause ER stress in this cell type. Although ONOO- triggered ER stress, scavenging of ONOO- did not attenuate cadmium-induced ER stress and apoptosis. These results evidenced selective and differential roles of ROS in the cadmium-triggered, ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathway. Interestingly, overexpression of catalase significantly attenuated cadmium-induced apoptosis without affecting the level of ER stress. This result indicated that, although H2O2 is not involved in ER stress-dependent apoptosis, it does contribute to cadmium-induced apoptosis independently of ER stress, possibly via the mitochondrial pathway (28Thevenod F. Nephron Physiol. 2003; 93: 87-93Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Our current data indicated that cadmium induces apoptosis of tubular cells through ER stress-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The fact that cadmium-induced apoptosis was markedly attenuated by antioxidants (Fig. 1, B and C) suggested that oxidative stress is the major mechanism for cadmium-induced apoptosis, as was reported previously (4Thevenod F. Friedmann J.M. Katsen A.D. Hauser I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1887-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 24Oh S.H. Lim S.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2006; 212: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved were found to be not so simple, i.e. oxidative stress-induced apoptosis is mediated by, at least in part, ER stress, and only O2.¯ participates in the ER stress-dependent apoptotic process. H2O2 mediates apoptosis independently of ER stress. Furthermore, ONOO- is not involved in both ER stress-dependent and -independent apoptotic processes. NAC completely inhibited oxidative stress but only partially attenuated the level of ER stress (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating a possibility that cadmium could also induce ER stress independently of oxidative stress. The relationship between oxidative stress and ER stress is not well understood. Haynes et al. recently reported that prolonged activation of UPR resulted in oxidative stress and consequent cellular death in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Accumulation of ROS by UPR may be caused through two mechanisms; the oxidative folding machinery in the ER and the mitochondria-dependent ROS generation (29Haynes C.M. Titus E.A. Cooper A.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). However, our current results evidenced that oxidative stress was upstream, but not downstream of ER stress in cadmium-exposed cells. Consistent with our results, some recent reports also indicated that ER stress may be involved downstream of ROS. For example, in rat brain tumor cells, the anticancer agent geldanamycin caused expression of GRP78 via a ROS-dependent mechanism (30Lai M.T. Huang K.L. Chang W.M. Lai Y.K. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In human vascular endothelial cells, ONOO- caused modest increases in GRP78 and GRP94 proteins (31Dickhout J.G. Hossain G.S. Pozza L.M. Zhou J. Lhotak S. Austin R.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2623-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The source of ROS in cadmium-exposed cells was not investigated in the present study, but the mitochondrial pathway is possibly responsible for the generation of ROS in cadmium-exposed tubular cells (28Thevenod F. Nephron Physiol. 2003; 93: 87-93Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Currently, it is still unclear how ROS induces ER stress. Previous reports showed that oxidative stress caused inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase (32Kaplan P. Babusikova E. Lehotsky J. Dobrota D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 248: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 33Moreau V.H. Castilho R.F. Ferreira S.T. Carvalho-Alves P.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a known trigger of ER stress. One possibility is, therefore, that ROS may cause depletion of the calcium store in the ER via inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase (34Viner R.I. Huhmer A.F. Bigelow D.J. Schoneich C. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 24: 243-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that ROS might cause ER stress through generation and accumulation of oxidatively modified, abnormal proteins. Unfolded proteins may also be accumulated in the ER through ROS-induced functional perturbation of ER foldases and/or chaperones (35Brunet S. Thibault L. Lepage G. Seidman E.G. Dube N. Levy E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Among three major UPR branches, the ATF6 pathway and the IRE1 pathway mediate cadmium-triggered apoptosis, and induction of CHOP by ATF6 and activation of both XBP1 and JNK by IRE1 are involved in the apoptotic process (1Yokouchi M. Hiramatsu N. Hayakawa K. Kasai A. Takano Y. Yao J. Kitamura M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we disclosed that O2.¯ produced in cadmium-exposed cells can trigger the ATF6-CHOP and the IRE1-XBP1 proapoptotic pathways. An interesting finding is that activation of JNK, an important mediator of cadmium-induced apoptosis (1Yokouchi M. Hiramatsu N. Hayakawa K. Kasai A. Takano Y. Yao J. Kitamura M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), was located downstream of XBP1. In general, it is believed that, in response to ER stress, activation of JNK occurs following recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) by IRE1. ASK1 is also required for the TRAF2-dependent JNK activation, and the IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1-mediated phosphorylation of JNK plays a crucial role in ER stress-induced apoptosis independently of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway (36Kim R. Emi M. Tanabe K. Murakami S. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the existence of the XBP1-JNK proapoptotic pathway involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis. ROS are involved in a wide range of cellular events under various pathophysiological circumstances. Our current finding that ER stress can locate downstream of oxidative stress raises a possibility that ER stress and UPR may also be involved not only in cadmium-induced apoptosis but also in a variety of other biological responses. Further investigation will be required to elucidate the spectrum of pathophysiological significance of the oxidative stress-ER stress axis in living cells and animals.

https://openalex.org/W2027226057,"Transcriptional feedback loops are a feature of circadian clocks in both animals and plants. We show that the plant circadian clock also incorporates the cytosolic signaling molecule cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR). cADPR modulates the circadian oscillator's transcriptional feedback loops and drives circadian oscillations of Ca 2+ release. The effects of antagonists of cADPR signaling, manipulation of cADPR synthesis, and mathematical simulation of the interaction of cADPR with the circadian clock indicate that cADPR forms a feedback loop within the plant circadian clock."

Participants made up to 12 monthly visits for HIV testing, adverse event reporting, and study product supply. The study was conducted between March 2004 and February 2006 in Accra and Kumasi, Ghana. We enrolled 2142 HIV-negative women at high risk of HIV infection, and randomized them to SAVVY or placebo gel. Main outcome measures were the incidence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection as determined by detection of HIV antibodies from oral mucosal transudate specimens and adverse events. We accrued 790 person-years of follow-up in the SAVVY group and 772 person-years in the placebo group. No clinically significant differences in the overall frequency of adverse events, abnormal pelvic examination findings, or abnormal laboratory results were seen between treatment groups. However, more participants in the SAVVY group reported reproductive tract adverse events than in the placebo group (13.0% versus 9.4%). Seventeen HIV seroconversions occurred; eight in participants randomized to SAVVY and nine in participants receiving placebo. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative probability of HIV infection through 12 months were 0.010 in the SAVVY group and 0.011 in the placebo group (p = 0.731), with a hazard ratio (SAVVY versus placebo) of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.33, 2.27). Because of a lower-than-expected HIV incidence, we were unable to achieve the required number of HIV infections (66) to obtain the desired study power.SAVVY was not associated with increased adverse events overall, but was associated with higher reporting of reproductive adverse events. Our data are insufficient to conclude whether SAVVY is effective at preventing HIV infection relative to placebo.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00129532."
https://openalex.org/W2168452237,"Copper and zinc play important roles in Alzheimer disease pathology with recent reports describing potential therapeutics based on modulation of metal bioavailability. We examined the ability of a range of metal bis(thiosemicarbazonato) complexes (MII(btsc), where M = CuII or ZnII) to increase intracellular metal levels in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (APP-CHO) and the subsequent effect on extracellular levels of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). The CuII(btsc) complexes were engineered to be either stable to both a change in oxidation state and dissociation of metal or susceptible to intracellular reduction and dissociation of metal. Treatment of APP-CHO cells with stable complexes resulted in elevated levels of intracellular copper with no effect on the detected levels of Aβ. Treatment with complexes susceptible to intracellular reduction increased intracellular copper levels but also resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of monomeric Aβ. Treatment with less stable ZnII(btsc) complexes increased intracellular zinc levels with a subsequent dose-dependent depletion of monomeric Aβ levels. The increased levels of intracellular bioavailable copper and zinc initiated a signaling cascade involving activation of phosphoinositol 3-kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Inhibition of these enzymes prevented Aβ depletion induced by the MII(btsc) complexes. Inhibition of metalloproteases also partially restored Aβ levels, implicating metal-driven metalloprotease activation in the extracellular monomeric Aβ depletion. However, a role for alternative metal-induced Aβ metabolism has not been ruled out. These studies demonstrate that MII(btsc) complexes have potential for Alzheimer disease therapy.

Alzheimer disease is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease. The onset of the disease is associated with the formation of senile plaques that are a pathological marker of the disorder. The primary constituent of the plaques is the aggregated peptide β amyloid (Aβ), 3The abbreviations used are: Aβamyloid-β peptideADAlzheimer diseaseAPPamyloid precursor proteinAPP-CHOChinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing APPcqclioquinolPI3Kphosphoinositol 3-kinaseGSK3glycogen synthase kinase 3MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseMMPmatrix metalloproteasebtscbis(thiosemicarbazone)gtsmglyoxalbis(N (4)-methylthiosemicarbazonato)ncneuocuproineICP-MSinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered salinegtseglyoxalbis(N(4)-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone)gtspglyoxalbis(N(4)-phenyl-3-thiosemicarbazone)atsmdiacetylbis(N(4)-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone)atsediacetylbis(N(4)-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone). a 39–43-amino acid peptide derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP). Aβ is generally accepted as being toxic and as such is a key therapeutic target as well as a diagnostic marker. Recent evidence suggests that altered metal homeostasis is a key factor in the etiology of Alzheimer disease (1Pajonk F.-G. Kessler H. Supprian T. Hamzei P. Bach D. Schweickhardt J. Herrmann W.

Chem. 2004; 57: 511-518Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, biometals modulate the structure and redox activity of both the parental APP and the prion protein involved in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (6Brown D.R. Kozlowski H.

Because of the importance of metals in neurodegenerative diseases, research has been directed toward harnessing the capability of metal-complexing ligands as therapeutic agents (9Barnham K.J.

Agents. 2003; 3: 309-315Crossref Google Scholar). Important progress has been made with the cell-permeable ligand clioquinol (cq), which has been shown to inhibit amyloid plaque formation in brains of APP transgenic mice (11Cherny R.A. Atwood C.S. Xilinas M.E. Gray D.N. Jones W.D. McLean C.A. Barnham K.J. Volitakis I. Fraser F.W. Kim Y.-S. Huang X. Goldstein L.E. Moir R.D. Lim J.T. Beyreuther K. Zheng H. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I.

In a recent study, we investigated the influence of MII(cq)2 complexes upon Aβ metabolism in cell culture (13White A.R. Du T. Laughton K.M. Volitakis I. Sharples R.A. Xilinas M.E. Hoke D.E. Holsinger R.M.D. Evin G. Cherny R.A. Hill A.F. Barnham K.J. Li Q.-X. Bush A.I. Masters C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17670-17680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). CuII(cq)2 and ZnII(cq)2 were taken up by the cells, triggering activation of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and subsequent phosphorylation of the downstream target molecules Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (such as JNK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)) were also activated. This resulted in the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and the degradation of extracellular Aβ (13White A.R. Du T. Laughton K.M. Volitakis I. Sharples R.A. Xilinas M.E. Hoke D.E. Holsinger R.M.D. Evin G. Cherny R.A. Hill A.F. Barnham K.J. Li Q.-X. Bush A.I. Masters C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17670-17680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrated that cell-permeable metal transporting agents might be developed as therapeutic agents for modulation of Aβ turnover in AD patients. Metal complexes of cq cannot be given directly to patients via oral administration because of the moderate affinity of cq metal complexes (11Cherny R.A. Atwood C.S. Xilinas M.E. Gray D.N. Jones W.D. McLean C.A. Barnham K.J. Volitakis I. Fraser F.W. Kim Y.-S. Huang X. Goldstein L.E. Moir R.D. Lim J.T. Beyreuther K. Zheng H. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Neuron. 2001; 30: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). As a result cq metal complexes offer little or no control over metal release and retention. In an attempt to overcome this difficulty, we have been investigating the use of metal complexes of bis(thiosemicarbazone) (btsc) ligands (see Fig. 1). btsc complexes have been investigated as metallodrugs for a number of years and proven to have a broad range of pharmacological activity (14West D.X. Liberta A.E. Padhye S.B. Chikate R.C. Sonawane P.B. Kumbhar A.S. Yerande R.G. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1993; 123: 49-71Crossref Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 15Beraldo H. Gambino D. Mini-Rev. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In particular, recent interest has focused on the use of btsc ligands as vehicles for the selective delivery of radioactive copper isotopes to hypoxic tissue and leukocytes in assessment of their potential as radiopharmaceuticals (16Lewis J.S. Laforest R. Buettner T.L. Song S.-K. Fujibayahsi Y. Connet J.M. Welch M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1206-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 17Green M.A. Klippenstein D.L. Tennison J.R. J. Nucl. Med. 1988; 29: 1549-1557PubMed Google Scholar). CuII(btsc) complexes are stable (log KA = 18) (17Green M.A. Klippenstein D.L. Tennison J.R. J. Nucl. Med. 1988; 29: 1549-1557PubMed Google Scholar, 18Petering D.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), neutral, low molecular weight compounds capable of crossing cell membranes. In some cases, it has been demonstrated that, once inside cells, CuII is reduced by intracellular reductants to CuI, which subsequently dissociates from the ligand (19Kraker A. Krezoski S. Schneider J. Minkel D. Petering D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13710-13718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Anderson C.J. Welch M.J. Chem.

S. A. 2002; 99: 3030-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Other CuII(btsc) complexes are more resistant to reduction and dissociation and are trapped only in hypoxic cells. This selectivity is remarkably sensitive to the nature of alkyl groups attached to the diimine backbone of the ligand. For example, diacetylbis(N (4)-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) (CuII(atsm); see Fig. 1) features two methyl substituents on the backbone and is not released in normal cellular conditions. On the other hand, glyoxalbis(N (4)-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) (CuII(gtsm); see Fig. 1) releases copper intracellularly (22Fujibayahsi Y. Taniuchi H. Yonekura Y. Ohtani H. Konishi J. Yokoyama A. J. Nucl. Med. 1997; 38: 1155-1160PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dearling J.L.J. Lewis J.S. Mullen G.D. Welch M.J. Blower P.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The selective release of copper has been correlated with the CuII/CuI reduction potential because CuII(atsm) is more difficult to reduce than CuII(gtsm) (by some 160 mV) (23Dearling J.L.J. Lewis J.S. Mullen G.D. Welch M.J. Blower P.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, differences in pKa values, and the stability of the reduced state to dissociation of the metal may also be important (24Blower P.J. Castle T.C. Cowley A.R. Dilworth J.R. Donnelly P.S. Labisbal E. Sowrey F.E. Teat S.J. Went M.J. Dalton Trans. 2003; : 4416-4425Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 25Cowley A.R. Dilworth J.R. Donnelly P.S. Labisbal E. Sousa A. J. Am Chem.

Acta. 2005; 358: 2770-2780Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Importantly, because of the ligand donor set (N2S2), these ligands do not bind CaII with any appreciable affinity and therefore should have no effect on other intracellular metals. btsc complexes are also capable of transporting ZnII into cells, and the intrinsic fluorescence of certain ZnII(btsc) complexes has been used to probe their intracellular distribution in several lines of cancer cells (27Cowley A.R. Davis J. Dilworth J.R. Donnelly P.S. Dobson R. Nightingale A. Peach J.M. Shore B. Kerr D. Seymour L. Chem. Commun. 2005; 21: 845-847Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ZnII, like Cu, is central to a number of cell signal pathways including modulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activity (28Frederickson C.J. Koh J.Y. Bush A.I. Natl. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar), expression of metallothioneins (29Mocchegiani E. Bertoni-Freddari C. Marcellini F. Malavolta M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 367-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 30Burdette S.C. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and activation of MAPK-mediated signal transduction pathways (31Wu W. Samet J. Silbajoris R. Dailey L.A. Sheppard D. Bromberg P.A. Graves L.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is apparent that both CuII(btsc) and ZnII(btsc) uptake could have complex effects on down-stream metal-mediated cell signaling. MII(btsc) complexes have a number of properties that make them worthy of investigation as potential therapeutic agents for AD. Several CuII(btsc) complexes are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, and certain examples of the ligands have low toxicity (17Green M.A. Klippenstein D.L. Tennison J.R. J. Nucl. Med. 1988; 29: 1549-1557PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dearling J.L.J. Lewis J.S. Mullen G.D. Welch M.J. Blower P.J. J. Biol. Inorg.

Importantly, the ligands can be modified readily by varying the nature and number of alkyl substituents, and these modifications allow subtle control of subcellular targeting and metal release/retention properties. Therefore, we examined the ability of CuII(btsc) and ZnII(btsc) complexes to deliver bioavailable metals to APP-CHO cells and how this affected Aβ turnover. Our studies found that intracellular release of zinc or copper from btsc complexes abrogated extracellular levels of Aβ. The general synthetic procedures are described in thesupplemental data. 5-Chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline (cq), Me2SO, neuocuproine (nc), LY294002, SB203580, and SP600125 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. GM6001, MMP inhibitor-I, MMP-2 inhibitor-I, and MMP-9 inhibitor-I were obtained from Merck. Antibodies to total or phospho-specific forms of Akt, JNK, and GSK3 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). APP-transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells–APP-CHO cells were generated by expressing the 695-amino acid APP cDNA in the pIRESpuro2 expression vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) as described previously (13White A.R. Du T. Laughton K.M. Volitakis I. Sharples R.A. Xilinas M.E. Hoke D.E. Holsinger R.M.D. Evin G. Cherny R.A. Hill A.F. Barnham K.J. Li Q.-X. Bush A.I. Masters C.L. J. Biol.

Transfected cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 mm glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen) selected and maintained using 7.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Exposure of Cells to MII(btsc)–APP-overexpressing cells were passaged at a ratio of 1:6 and grown in 6- or 12-well plates for 2–3 days before experiments. The cells were treated when ∼90% confluent. MII(btsc), cq, and nc were prepared as 10 mm stock solutions in Me2SO and added to serum-free RPMI medium supplemented with puromycin as above. Basal metal levels in the medium were 0.5 and 1.3 μm for copper and zinc, respectively, as determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Additional metals were added where indicated, and medium was briefly mixed by aspiration prior to addition to cells. The control cultures were treated with vehicle (Me2SO) alone. Inhibitors of Akt, (LY294002), JNK (SP600125), p38 (SB203580), or metalloproteases (GM6001, MMP inhibitor I, MMP-2 inhibitor-I, and MMP-9 inhibitor-I) were prepared as 10 mm stock solutions in Me2SO and added at the indicated concentrations. The cultures were incubated for 6 h, and conditioned media were taken for measurement of Aβ levels by ELISA. For immunoblotting, the cells were harvested into Phosphosafe extraction buffer (Novagen) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and stored at –80 °C until use. Alternatively, the cells were washed three times with PBS and harvested for analysis of metal levels by ICP-MS. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry–The cells were treated with MII(btsc) for 6 h and washed three times with Chelex 100-treated PBS, pH 7.4. The cells were scraped into PBS, an aliquot was taken for protein determination (Protein Microassay; Bio-Rad), and the remaining cells were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min in a Hermle Microfuge (Labnet, Woodbridge, NJ). The metal levels were determined in cell pellets by ICP-MS as described previously and converted to fold increase in metal compared with untreated controls (37Caragounis A. Du T. Filiz G.

Keck Laboratory (Yale University, New Haven, CT) and dissolved in Me2SO at 1 mg/ml. The dissolved peptide was further diluted into Chelex 100-treated dH2Oat 100 ng/ml before addition to M17 neuroblastoma cell cultures in serum-free medium at 10 ng/ml without aging as previously reported (13White A.R.

After 6 h (with or without the addition of 25 μm CuGTSM), medium was collected, and the remaining Aβ1–40 levels were determined by ELISA. Double Antibody Capture ELISA for Aβ Detection–Aβ levels were determined in culture medium using the DELFIA® Double Capture ELISA. 384-well plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated with monoclonal antibody G210 in coating buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6) for Aβ1–40 detection. The plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween (PBST) and blocked with 0.5% (w/v) casein. Biotinylated monoclonal antibody WO2 (epitope at Aβ5–8) and culture medium or Aβ peptide standards were added (50 μl) to each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed with PBST and streptavidin-labeled Europium (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. The plates were washed, enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added, and the plates were read in a WALLAC Victor2 plate reader with excitation at 340 nm and emission at 613 nm. Aβ1–40 peptide standards and samples were assayed in triplicate. The values obtained from the triplicate wells were used to calculate the Aβ concentration (expressed as ng/ml) based on the standard curve generated on each plate. Western Blot Analysis of Protein Expression and Phosphorylation– Cell lysates prepared in Phosphosafe buffer were mixed with electrophoresis SDS sample buffer (Novex) and separated on 12% Novex SDS-PAGE Tris-glycine gels. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked with milk solution in TBST before immunoblotting for total or phospho-specific proteins. For detection of signal transduction molecules, the membranes were probed with polyclonal antisera against JNK or phospho-JNK, Akt or phospho-Akt, GSK3α, or phospho-GSK3α/β all at 1:5000. Secondary antiserum was goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase at 1:10,000. Blots were developed using Amersham Biosciences ECL Advance Chemiluminescence and imaged on a Gene-Gnome Chemiluminescence Imager (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). We found that the expression of total levels of kinases (Akt and JNK) was unaffected by metal uptake in APP-CHO cells. In contrast, actin, tubulin and other proteins normally used for equalizing protein loading were found to be altered depending on metal levels. 4P. S. Donnelly, A. Caragounis, T. Du, K. M.

Therefore, equal sample loading and protein transfer was assessed by the consistency of total kinase protein levels on immunoblots rather than unrelated proteins. Statistical Analysis–The data are the means ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments unless stated. The results were analyzed using the analysis of variance test. Cellular Uptake of CuII(btsc) Complexes–APP-CHO cells were treated for 6 h with the four Cu(btsc) complexes (1–50 μm) shown in Fig. 1A, all of which feature dialkyl backbones. Typical results are shown in Fig. 2. Significant increases were observed in intracellular copper levels when compared with treatment with the free ligands or with Cu2+ alone. The highest levels were induced by treatment with CuII(atsm), where a 177 (±9)-fold increase in copper levels was detected compared with untreated control cells. This corresponded to cellular copper levels of 4.5 and 800 ng/mg protein for control and CuII(atsm)-treated cells, respectively. The other three CuII(btsc) complexes provided 90–115-fold increases in copper levels and were comparable with those achieved by treatment with other cell-permeable complexes CuII(nc)2 and CuII(cq)2 (Fig. 2) (13White A.R.

Redox Stable CuII(btsc) Complexes Do Not Affect Secreted Aβ Levels–We have reported that copper uptake induced by CuII(cq)2 resulted in lower levels of secreted Aβ from APP-CHO cells (13White A.R. Du T. Laughton K.M. Volitakis I. Sharples R.A. Xilinas M.E. Hoke D.E. Holsinger R.M.D. Evin G. Cherny R.A. Hill A.F. Barnham K.J. Li Q.-X. Bush A.I. Masters C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17670-17680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether CuII(btsc) complexes also affected Aβ levels by measuring extracellular Aβ1–40 levels in the culture medium from the treated cells (13White A.R. Du T. Laughton K.M. Volitakis I. Sharples R.A. Xilinas M.E. Hoke D.E. Holsinger R.M.D. Evin G. Cherny R.A. Hill A.F. Barnham K.J. Li Q.-X. Bush A.I. Masters C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17670-17680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Treatment with the free ligands (btscH2) and the CuII(btsc) complexes had no significant effect on the level of Aβ1–40 (Fig. 3). In contrast, treatment with CuII(cq)2 and CuII(nc)2 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of secreted Aβ1–40 in the culture medium, confirming our previous study of CuII(cq)2 (13White A.R. Du T. Laughton K.M. Volitakis I. Sharples R.A. Xilinas M.E. Hoke D.E. Holsinger R.M.D. Evin G. Cherny R.A. Hill A.F. Barnham K.J. Li Q.-X. Bush A.I. Masters C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17670-17680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A small decrease in total APP expression was observed consistent with cq-treated APP-CHO cells (13White A.R. Du T. Laughton K.M. Volitakis I. Sharples R.A. Xilinas M.E. Hoke D.E. Holsinger R.M.D. Evin G. Cherny R.A. Hill A.F. Barnham K.J. Li Q.-X. Bush A.I. Masters C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17670-17680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, this was insufficient to account for the loss of Aβ (80–90%). The form of decreased extracellular Aβ detected by ELISA was monomeric. This was supported by the loss of monomeric Aβ in CuII(gtsm)-treated cell culture medium by Western blot and is consistent with our previous report on cq inhibition of extracellular monomeric Aβ levels in APP-CHO cells (13White A.R. Du T. Laughton K.M. Volitakis I. Sharples R.A. Xilinas M.E. Hoke D.E. Holsinger R.M.D. Evin G. Cherny R.A. Hill A.F. Barnham K.J. Li Q.-X. Bush A.I. Masters C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17670-17680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Whether oligomers are also affected by CuII(gtsm) is not known because these were not observed by Western blot, and the ELISA does not detect aggregated Aβ. However, because there was a substantial loss of monomeric Aβ (∼90%), this is likely to preclude formation of higher oligomeric forms. The lack of effect of CuII(btsc) complexes (featuring two alkyl substituents on the backbone of the ligand) on Aβ turnover may be related to their high thermodynamic stability (log KA = 18) and their resistance to reductively assisted transchelation reactions (for example Cu(atsm): E1/2(CuII/CuI) = –0.59 V versus SCE) (23Dearling J.L.J.

These properties would promote retention of structural integrity inside the cell, ensuring that the copper is not bioavailable. In comparison, less stable cell-permeable complexes such as CuII(nc)2 and CuII(cq)2 (log KA = 9) are susceptible to dissociation of the metal from the ligand inside the cell (11Cherny R.A.

Dissociation would allow the copper to become bioavailable and, as reported previously (13White A.R. Du T. Laughton K.M. Volitakis I. Sharples R.A. Xilinas M.E. Hoke D.E. Holsinger R.M.D. Evin G.

Cu(gtsm) Induces Loss of Secreted Aβ–To investigate the hypothesis that dissociation of copper from the ligand is required to decrease the levels of secreted Aβ, cells were treated with CuII(gtsm), CuII(gtse), and CuII(gtsp), analogues of CuII(atsm), CuII(atse) and CuII(atsp), respectively. These analogues lacked the two methyl groups on the diimine backbone of the ligand (Fig. 1B). The complexes still exhibit a high thermodynamic stability but are more susceptible to reduction to CuI (for example Cu(gtsm): E1/2(CuII/CuI) = –0.43 V). The ligands exhibit a lower affinity for CuI and are more likely to dissociate under the reducing conditions of the normal intracellular environment (21Adonai N. Nguyen K.N. Walsh J. Iyer M.

https://openalex.org/W2002771652,"Dehydration-responsive element-binding proteins (DREBs) and ethylene-responsive element (ERE) binding factors are two major subfamilies of the AP2/ethylene-responsive element-binding protein family and play crucial roles in the regulation of abiotic- and biotic-stress responses, respectively. In the present work, we have reported a previously identified DREB-like factor, TINY, that was involved in both abiotic- and biotic-stress signaling pathways. TINY was capable of binding to both DRE and ERE with similar affinity and could activate the expression of reporter genes driven by either of these two elements in tobacco cells. The 15th amino acid in the APETALA2 (AP2)/ethylene-responsive element-binding factor domain was demonstrated to be essential for its specific binding to ERE, whereas the 14th and 19th amino acids were responsible for the binding to DRE. The expression of TINY was greatly activated by drought, cold, ethylene, and slightly by methyl jasmonate. Additionally, overexpression of TINY in Arabidopsis resulted in elevated expressions of both the DRE- and the ERE-containing genes. Moreover, the expression of DRE-regulated genes, such as COR6.6 and ERD10, was up-regulated upon ethylene treatment, and the expression of ERE-regulated genes, such as HLS1, was also increased by cold stress, when the expression of TINY was being induced. These results strongly suggested that TINY might play a role in the cross-talk between abiotic- and biotic-stress-responsive gene expressions by connecting the DRE- and ERE-mediated signaling pathways. The results herein might promote the understanding of the mechanisms of specific DNA recognition and gene expression regulation by DREBs."
https://openalex.org/W2080610037,"Photosystem II (PSII) is a large membrane protein complex that uses light energy to convert water to molecular oxygen. This enzyme undergoes an intricate assembly process to ensure accurate and efficient positioning of its many components. It has been proposed that the Psb27 protein, a lumenal extrinsic subunit, serves as a PSII assembly factor. Using a psb27 genetic deletion strain (Δpsb27) of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we have defined the role of the Psb27 protein in PSII biogenesis. While the Psb27 protein was not essential for photosynthetic activity, various PSII assembly assays revealed that the Δpsb27 mutant was defective in integration of the Mn4Ca1Clx cluster, the catalytic core of the oxygen-evolving machinery within the PSII complex. The other lumenal extrinsic proteins (PsbO, PsbU, PsbV, and PsbQ) are key components of the fully assembled PSII complex and are important for the water oxidation reaction, but we propose that the Psb27 protein has a distinct function separate from these subunits. We show that the Psb27 protein facilitates Mn4Ca1Clx cluster assembly in PSII at least in part by preventing the premature association of the other extrinsic proteins. Thus, we propose an exchange of lumenal subunits and cofactors during PSII assembly, in that the Psb27 protein is replaced by the other extrinsic proteins upon assembly of the Mn4Ca1Clx cluster.

This important reaction connects solar energy to the chemical energy used by the vast majority of life on earth and generates molecular oxygen as a byproduct to sustain the aerobic atmosphere of the planet. PSII is a membrane protein complex comprised of more than 20 protein subunits and numerous cofactors. A number of recent structural studies have increased our understanding of the architecture of the functional complex and provided new insights into the mechanism of this important enzyme (1Zouni A.

Briefly, photons initiate the transfer of electrons from a pair of chlorophylls at the reaction center through a series of cofactors to a membrane-soluble quinone. To reset the PSII reaction center, a catalytic center of Mn4Ca1Clx removes electrons from water, yielding molecular oxygen. Photosystem II wild type chlorophyll variable fluorescence yield hydroxylamine. Photosystem II wild type chlorophyll variable fluorescence yield hydroxylamine. The electron transfer reactions through PSII require precise positioning of its redox active cofactors. Proper assembly of the numerous PSII components is essential, and the PSII biogenesis pathway entails an ordered assembly of the constituent proteins and cofactors (5Baena-Gonzalez E. Aro E.M.

J. 2005; 388: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, PSII assembly occurs frequently because this enzyme continually undergoes a cycle of damage and repair. As a consequence of its normal function, the D1 membrane protein of PSII is irreversibly damaged and must be replaced with a newly synthesized copy (reviewed in Refs. 7Andersson B. Aro E.M. Aro E.M.

During this repair cycle, the complex is at least partially disassembled as the damaged D1 protein is proteolytically removed. Key events in the reassembly pathway include (1Zouni A. Witt H.T.

Clearly, PSII is a dynamic protein complex, and elucidation of the details of the PSII assembly pathway has been the focus of intense research. Many studies have been directed at defining the order of association of various PSII protein subunits (6Rokka A. Suorsa M. Saleem A. Battchikova N. Aro E.M. Biochem.

In the absence of these factors, PSII assembly is adversely affected. Psb27, a component of the PSII complex, has also been hypothesized to play a role in PSII assembly (reviewed in Ref. 16Roose J.L. Wegener K.M. Pakrasi H.B. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 92: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This small (11-kDa) protein has been shown to localize to the thylakoid lumen in cyanobacteria and plants (17Rajalahti T. Huang F. Klement M.R. Pisareva T. Edman M. Sjostrom M. Wieslander A.

Sequence and biochemical analysis corroborates that the Psb27 protein is extrinsically associated with the lumenal side of the PSII complex. However, in cyanobacteria it is tightly associated with the thylakoid membrane via an N-terminal lipid modification (21Nowaczyk M.M. Hebeler R. Schlodder E. Meyer H.E. Warscheid B. Rogner M. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3121-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Several biochemical studies in cyanobacteria have demonstrated that the Psb27 protein associates with PSII pre-complexes that are incapable of evolving oxygen (20Roose J.L. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45417-45422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Nowaczyk M.M. Hebeler R. Schlodder E. Meyer H.E. Warscheid B. Rogner M.

In contrast, PSII complexes purified using a histidine-tagged version of the extrinsic protein PsbQ are highly active for oxygen evolution and lack the Psb27 protein (23Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2548-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, there appears to be an exchange of the Psb27 protein for the other extrinsic proteins on the lumenal side of the PSII complex during the assembly of the oxygen-evolving machinery. Chen et al. (24Chen H. Zhang D. Guo J. Wu H. Jin M. Lu Q. Lu C. Zhang L. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 61: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have previously reported that the Psb27 protein is necessary for efficient PSII repair in the vascular plant Arabidopsis. In the current study, we have used a genetic deletion mutant of the psb27 (slr1645) gene in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to more precisely define the function of the Psb27 protein. We report that the Psb27 protein is required for optimal PSII assembly in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, we show that the Psb27 protein specifically facilitates assembly of the Mn4Ca1Clx cluster in PSII by preventing the premature binding of the other PSII extrinsic subunits. Culture Conditions–Wild type (WT), Δpsb27, ΔpsbO, and ΔpsbO, Δpsb27 strains of Synechocystis 6803 were grown in BG11 medium (25Allen M.M. J. Phycol. 1968; 4: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar) at 30 °C under 30 μmol photons/m2·s. Δpsb27, ΔpsbO, and ΔpsbO,Δpsb27 cells were grown in BG11 medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 10 μg/ml spectinomycin, and 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol plus 10 μg/ml spectinomycin, respectively. To assess photoautotrophic growth, cells were diluted to an OD at 730 nm = 0.05 in BG11 medium and grown at 30 °C with shaking under 30 μmol photons/m2·s. The OD at 730 nm was measured every 24 h on a μQuant Microplate spectrophotometer (Biotek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Mutant Strain Generation–The construction of the ΔpsbO strain used in this study has been described previously (26Chandler L.E. Bartsevich V.V. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5508-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For the Δpsb27 mutant, the region surrounding slr1645 (psb27) was amplified from genomic DNA and replacement of the coding region of the gene with a chloramphenicol resistance cassette was achieved by using a fusion PCR technique (supplemental Fig. 1) (27Wang H.L.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1666-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Table 1 provides the primer sequences used in this method. The resulting fusion PCR product was used to transform WT Synechocystis cells. The double mutant ΔpsbO,Δpsb27 was generated by transforming the ΔpsbO strain with the Δpsb27 PCR product. Complete segregation of all strains was confirmed by PCR analysis of each locus.TABLE 1Primer sequences for Δpsb27 mutant construction The portions of the primers Psb27B and Psb27C corresponding to the chloramphenicol resistance marker are shown in italics.Amplification of upstream regionPsb27ATACCTCAGTCAAAATCGCCCPsb27BCATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCCAGCCGTGACAACTGATTTTTAmplification of downstream regionPsb27CACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACCTGGAATTTACCCAGGCAGAPsb27DATGGTCGGCACTAGTTTTGGSegregation analysisPsb27ECCTGGCCAACTGGTAGGATAPsb27FAGCCGGTCATAGGAAGGAGT Open table in a new tab Oxygen Evolution–Oxygen evolution activity was measured on a Clark-type electrode in the presence of artificial electron acceptors (1 mm potassium ferricyanide and 0.5 mm 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone. Cells were diluted to 5 μg of Chl/ml in BG11 medium. The light intensity was adjusted between 237 and 8250 μmol photons/m2·s using neutral density filters. Spectrophotometric Assays–Chl a concentration was determined spectrophotometrically after extraction with methanol (29Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4534) Google Scholar). Photoinhibition and Recovery–To assay high light photoinhibition of PSII in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor lincomycin, WT and Δpsb27 cells were diluted to 3 μg of Chl/ml in BG11 medium and subjected to 200 μmol photons/m2·s of monochromatic red (627 nm) and blue light (455 nm) (equivalent to ∼1000 photons/m2·s white incandescent light) from an LED light source (PSI, Brno, Czech Republic) with air bubbling at 30 °C in the presence of 20 μg/ml of lincomycin. To measure the recovery of PSII activity after photoinhibition, cells were washed twice with fresh BG11 to remove the lincomycin and allowed to recover under non-damaging light intensity (50 μmol photons/m2·s, equivalent to ∼100 photons/m2·s white incandescent light). Variable fluorescence yield (Fv/Fm) was monitored throughout photoinhibition and recovery using an FL-200 fluorometer (PSI).

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 31Qian M. Al-Khaldi S.F. Putnam-Evans C. Bricker T.M. Burnap R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15244-15252Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. Specifically, WT and Δpsb27 cells were treated with HA to disassemble their manganese clusters. Late log phase cells were harvested and suspended in HN buffer (10 mm Hepes and 30 mm NaCl at pH 7.0) to a concentration of 200 μg of Chl/ml. These cells were incubated with 2 mm HA for 10 min. This and all subsequent steps prior to the photoactivation assay were performed in darkness. The HA-treated cells were diluted with 10 ml of HN buffer and centrifuged at 25 °C and 10000 × g for 6 min. The cells were washed three times with 30 ml of HNMC buffer (10 mm Hepes, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 50 μm MnCl2 at pH 7.0). Finally, the cells were suspended in HNMC buffer at 200 μg of Chl/ml. For photoactivation under continuous light conditions, WT and Δpsb27 cells were treated with HA to remove the manganese clusters from PSII. Treated cells were kept in the dark prior to assay. Cells were then diluted to 5 μg of Chl/ml in HNMC buffer and incubated under photoactivation light at either 13, 67, or 129 μmol photons/m2·s white light. After incubation at the indicated light intensity, oxygen evolution was measured at 8250 μmol photons/m2·s in the presence of the electron acceptors 0.5 mm 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone and 1 mm potassium ferricyanide on a Clark-type electrode. For flash-induced photoactivation assays, HA-treated cells were deposited on a bare platinum electrode (Artisan Scientific), covered with an agarose disc of HNMC buffer, dark-incubated for 2 min, and subjected to a series of pre-flashes (0–2000) at 0.3 s and then a train of 20 measuring flashes at 0.3 s. The normalized average oxygen yield of flashes 16–20 for each measuring train is graphed as a function of pre-flashes. Mixed Culture Assays–The mixed culture analyses of WT and Δpsb27 cells were performed essentially as described in Ref. 32Ivleva N.B. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar. Cultures of WT and Δpsb27 cells were grown in 50 ml of BG11 to mid-exponential phase. Mixed cultures containing an equal number of WT and Δpsb27 cells were started and grown under 30 μmol photons/m2·s in either BG11 or BG11 lacking CaCl2. The mixed culture was diluted to an OD at 730 nm = 0.05 every 48 h in fresh medium, and the remaining culture was used for total DNA extraction. Each mixed culture was subcultured a total of six times during the course of the experiment. PCR analysis of the psb27 locus was performed with the segregation analysis primers Psb27E and Psb27F (Table 1) to determine the relative amounts of WT and Δpsb27 cells in the mixed cultures. The total DNA isolated from each subculture of the mixed cultures was diluted to a final concentration of 20 ng/μl. The PCR reactions contained 10 ng of template DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 250 μm dNTP mixture, PCR buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 16 mm ammonium sulfate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20) and 1 unit of KlenTaq polymerase (W. Barnes, Washington University School of Medicine). PCR amplification involved 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. Agarose gels of the PCR products were visualized using the Kodak 1D Image Analysis software (Rochester, NY), and the relative amount of each product was quantified using the ImageJ software. The Psb27 Protein Is Not Essential for Photosynthetic Activity in Synechocystis 6803–It has been shown previously that the Psb27 protein associates with PSII pre-complexes that cannot evolve oxygen (20Roose J.L. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45417-45422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Nowaczyk M.M. Hebeler R. Schlodder E. Meyer H.E. Warscheid B. Rogner M.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5542-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of an Arabidopsis mutant line lacking the Psb27 protein indicated that this protein plays a role in efficient reassembly of PSII after light-induced damage (24Chen H. Zhang D. Guo J. Wu H. Jin M. Lu Q. Lu C. Zhang L. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 61: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To more precisely define the role of Psb27 in PSII biogenesis and function, a genetic deletion of the psb27 (slr1645) gene in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 was constructed (supplemental Fig. S1). In this Δpsb27 mutant, the majority of the coding sequence of the psb27 gene has been replaced by a chloramphenicol resistance gene (Fig. 1). Because Synechocystis 6803 cells usually contain multiple copies of their genome, PCR analysis of the psb27 locus was used to confirm complete segregation of the Δpsb27 mutant allele (Fig. 1C). To assay for possible photosynthetic defects in the Δpsb27 mutant, photoautotrophic growth and oxygen-evolving activity were measured. The Δpsb27 mutant grew at the same rate as WT cells in BG11 medium (Fig. 2A). WT and Δpsb27 cells also displayed similar oxygen evolution rates at the light intensities measured (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the Psb27 protein is not absolutely essential for photosynthetic activity in Synechocystis 6803 cells, similar to previously published observations for the Arabidopsis mutant lacking the Psb27 protein (24Chen H. Zhang D. Guo J. Wu H. Jin M. Lu Q. Lu C. Zhang L. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 61: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Psb27 Protein Is Necessary for Efficient PSII Repair upon Photodamage–Although the Psb27 protein is not required for PSII activity, previous studies have indicated a possible role for Psb27 in PSII assembly or during the repair cycle (24Chen H. Zhang D. Guo J. Wu H. Jin M. Lu Q. Lu C. Zhang L. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 61: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As described previously, the D1 protein within the PSII complex is damaged, resulting in loss of activity, and must be replaced with a newly synthesized copy to regenerate functional PSII complexes. This damage, termed photoinhibition, is induced by exposure to high light intensities. To determine whether the Psb27 protein plays a role in the PSII damage and repair cycle in Synechocystis, high light photoinhibition and recovery of PSII activity were measured in WT and Δpsb27 cells. To monitor PSII photoinhibition and recovery, WT and Δpsb27 cells were subjected to high light illumination in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor lincomycin and PSII activity was monitored as the variable fluorescence yield (Fv/Fm) throughout the experiment. To assay recovery after the photoinhibition treatment, the lincomycin was removed and cells were incubated under a lower non-damaging light intensity to allow for reassembly of functional PSII complexes (Fig. 3). WT and Δpsb27 cells showed a similar decrease in Fv/Fm upon high light treatment in the presence of lincomycin. Thus, PSII stability in the Δpsb27 mutant was not significantly different from that of WT cells. However, the Δpsb27 cells did not recover after photoinhibition to the same extent as WT cells. Therefore, the Psb27 protein is necessary for efficient PSII repair. The Psb27 Protein Specifically Functions in PSII Manganese Cluster Assembly–To probe a more specific role of Psb27 during PSII assembly, we tested the efficiency of manganese cluster assembly in WT and Δpsb27 cells. Assembly of the manganese cluster into PSII complexes is a multistep process, termed photoactivation, that involves sequential binding and photo-oxidation of manganese atoms, interspersed with one dark rearrangement step and the incorporation of Ca2+ and Cl- ions to yield the functional catalytic Mn4Ca1Clx core of the oxygen-evolving machinery (reviewed in Ref. 9Burnap R.L. Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics. 2004; 6: 4803-4809Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To assay manganese cluster assembly in vivo, cells were treated with the small reductant HA to release the manganese clusters from functional PSII complexes and then illuminated in the absence of HA to allow for reassembly of functional manganese clusters capable of oxygen evolution. HA-treated WT and Δpsb27 cells were photoactivated using continuous white light of varying intensity (Fig. 4). In these assays, WT and Δpsb27 cells showed similar photoactivation kinetics under the lowest light intensity (Fig. 4A). However, upon incubation under higher light intensities, Δpsb27 cells failed to assemble manganese clusters to the extent observed in WT cells (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicate that the Psb27 protein specifically facilitates manganese cluster assembly in PSII and its role is more critical under higher light intensities. Although the manganese cluster assembly process requires light, light can also result in damage to the PSII complexes. Moreover, photoinhibition is especially damaging to manganese-depleted PSII complexes (33Theg S.M. Filar L.J. Dilley R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 849: 104-111Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Klimov V.V. Shafiev M.A. Allakhverdiev S.I. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 23: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, photoactivation and photoinhibition are competing processes during the manganese cluster assembly assays. WT cells, which are very efficient in manganese cluster assembly, are less susceptible to photoinhibition, whereas the Δpsb27 cells, which are less efficient at manganese cluster assembly, are more prone to photoinhibition. For the Δpsb27 mutant, photoinhibition predominates at higher light intensities in manganese-depleted cells, resulting in lower recovery of oxygen-evolving activity. The Psb27 Protein Excludes Other Extrinsic Proteins during Manganese Cluster Assembly–Several roles for the Psb27 protein have been postulated. Among them is the role of this protein as a metal delivery chaperone to PSII. This scenario is unlikely because the Psb27 protein lacks any known metal binding motifs and previous studies reported that Psb27-associated PSII complexes lack manganese atoms. Another hypothesis is that the Psb27 protein may facilitate manganese cluster assembly into PSII by inducing an optimal conformation of the lumenal side of the complex. This may also involve exclusion of the extrinsic proteins (PsbO, PsbU, PsbV, and PsbQ) normally associated with active PSII complexes as their premature binding may act as a hindrance to the incoming manganese atoms. In fact, the PsbO protein has been described as a barrier to the PSII manganese binding sites (35Chu H.A. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6150-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and ΔpsbO mutant cells show an increase in photoactivation efficiency compared with WT cells (30Burnap R.L. Qian M. Pierce C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To more precisely assay the efficiency of manganese cluster assembly in PSII, a different photoactivation assay was used. HA-treated cells were subjected to a series of intense flashes from a Xenon lamp, and the resultant oxygen yield measured on a bare platinum electrode was used as a gauge of assembled active PSII centers. If a strain is more efficient at manganese cluster assembly, then a reduced number of flashes will be required to produce the saturating oxygen yield. WT cells displayed a typical photoactivation curve, in that with increasing flash number WT cells were able to assemble more functional manganese clusters in PSII, resulting in an increase in oxygen yield (Fig. 5). The ΔpsbO mutant had a faster kinetics in manganese cluster assembly as published previously (30Burnap R.L. Qian M. Pierce C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Δpsb27 cells did not reassemble manganese clusters during this assay (Fig. 5). The difference in the ability of Δpsb27 cells to assemble manganese clusters in this assay relative to the previous assay is likely due to the difference in photoactivation light (continuous versus intense flashes) used in the two assays. Clearly, Δpsb27 cells were unable to effectively use the discrete flashes produced by the xenon flash lamp. Overall, the manganese cluster assembly phenotype of Δpsb27 cells is strikingly different from that of the previously characterized PSII extrinsic protein mutants such as ΔpsbO. If the Psb27 protein facilitates manganese cluster assembly by preventing the premature binding of other extrinsic proteins such as PsbO, then we predict that manganese cluster assembly would be more efficient in the double mutant ΔpsbO,Δpsb27 than the Δpsb27 mutant. In other words, if the Psb27 protein normally functions to exclude proteins such as PsbO, the genetic removal of the psbO gene in the Δpsb27 mutant background should restore a more normal manganese cluster assembly phenotype. To test this hypothesis, manganese cluster assembly was also assayed in the double mutant ΔpsbO,Δpsb27 (Fig. 5). Indeed, the double mutant ΔpsbO,Δpsb27 was capable of photoactivation under these conditions whereas the Δpsb27 mutant was not (Fig. 5). This result implies that one function of the Psb27 protein is to exclude PsbO, and presumably also the other extrinsic proteins, until the manganese cluster is assembled. The Psb27 Protein Provides a Selective Advantage for Cellular Growth–The experiments outlined in this study indicate that Psb27 is necessary for efficient PSII repair after photodamage and has a specific role in the assembly of the manganese cluster. However, under a variety of culture conditions and during other photosynthesis assays, the Δpsb27 mutant was not measurably different from WT yet the psb27 gene is found in the vast majority of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms (16Roose J.L. Wegener K.M. Pakrasi H.B. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 92: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Hence, it is reasonable to expect that the presence of the Psb27 protein benefits these organisms during their growth in nature, where deprivation of key nutrients and fluctuating light conditions are often encountered. In contrast, the commonly used laboratory conditions for organisms such as Synechocystis consist of unnaturally high concentrations of nutrients. To evaluate the effect of Psb27 on organismal fitness, mixed culture experiments with WT and Δpsb27 cells were performed. In these experiments, a mixed culture inoculated with an equal number of WT and Δpsb27 cells was grown under different conditions and samples were taken to determine the relative amounts of each strain over a time course. If the absence of the Psb27 protein reduces the fitness of the organism, then the WT cells should overgrow the Δpsb27 cells in such a mixed culture. During growth in BG11, the relative amounts of the two strains remained unaltered during the entire time course of the experiment (Fig. 6). In contrast, during growth in a medium lacking CaCl2, the Δpsb27 cells were completely out-competed by WT cells after four rounds of subculturing and the PCR band corresponding to the Δpsb27 locus could not be detected (Fig. 6). In medium lacking CaCl2, manganese cluster assembly must occur with optimal efficiency because calcium and chloride, two key ionic cofactors, are limiting. Therefore, the Psb27 protein provides a significant benefit to cells under conditions where efficient manganese cluster assembly is important for survival. It has been previously hypothesized that the Psb27 protein functions in the PSII assembly pathway, but the precise step was unknown. In this work, we used a genetic deletion mutant in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 to more precisely define the function of Psb27. When grown in nutrient-rich BG11 medium, the Synechocystis Δpsb27 mutant was similar to WT with respect to photoautotrophic growth and photosynthetic activity. However, the recovery of the Δpsb27 mutant after photoinhibition was slower relative to WT cells, in agreement with observations published for the Arabidopsis mutant (24Chen H. Zhang D. Guo J. Wu H. Jin M. Lu Q. Lu C. Zhang L. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 61: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Altogether, the results of this work and previous studies indicate that the Psb27 protein assists in the reassembly of functional PSII complexes after photodamage. The PSII repair process entails multiple steps such as partial disassembly to remove the damaged D1 protein followed by reassembly of the manganese cluster and binding of the extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbU, PsbV, and PsbQ in cyanobacteria. A deficiency in any of these events would result in slower recovery from photoinhibition. Two lines of evidence from previous studies suggested that the Psb27 protein functions during PSII reassembly rather than disassembly of damaged PSII complexes: (a) the degradation of the damaged D1 protein was not affected in the Arabidopsis psb27 mutant (24Chen H. Zhang D. Guo J. Wu H. Jin M. Lu Q. Lu C. Zhang L. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 61: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and (b) 15N-labeling studies have indicated that the Psb27 protein is associated with PSII pre-complexes containing newly synthesized D1 protein (21Nowaczyk M.M. Hebeler R. Schlodder E. Meyer H.E. Warscheid B. Rogner M. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3121-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine the specific function of the Psb27 protein, we focused on the assembly steps of the lumenal side of PSII complexes. In this study, we show that the Psb27 protein facilitates assembly of the PSII Mn4Ca1Clx cluster. The Δpsb27 mutant exhibited significant defects during photoactivation assays. Previous biochemical studies have shown that the Psb27 protein is associated with PSII complexes that lack manganese (20Roose J.L. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45417-45422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Nowaczyk M.M. Hebeler R. Schlodder E. Meyer H.E. Warscheid B. Rogner M.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5542-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Conversely, purified PSII complexes that are highly active and contain stoichiometric amounts of manganese lack the Psb27 protein (23Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2548-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data suggest that the Psb27 protein associates with PSII pre-complexes to facilitate integration of the Mn4Ca1Clx cluster and then dissociates from the complex. Another distinct characteristic of the Psb27-associated PSII complexes is the lack of the other extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbU, PsbV, and PsbQ that are normally associated with active PSII complexes (20Roose J.L. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45417-45422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Nowaczyk M.M. Hebeler R. Schlodder E. Meyer H.E. Warscheid B. Rogner M. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3121-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Mamedov F. Nowaczyk M.M. Thapper A. Rogner M. Styring S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5542-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that the Psb27 protein aids the photoactivation process at least in part by excluding the other extrinsic proteins to allow for efficient access of the manganese, calcium, and chlorine atoms. Because the photoactivation process entails a number of steps and distinct intermediates, a more detailed analysis is necessary to evaluate the effect of Psb27 on the incorporation of the individual ionic cofactors as well as the specific kinetic steps during Mn4Ca1Clx cluster assembly. From these data along with those from previous studies, we propose the following sequence of events for the biogenesis of the lumenal side of PSII complexes (Fig. 7). The Psb27 protein associates with PSII pre-complexes early during the biogenesis pathway, perhaps even prior to the processing of the pD1 protein (20Roose J.L. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45417-45422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The pD1 protein is processed by the CtpA protease to remove the C-terminal extension that protrudes from the lumenal side of the complex. Upon generation of the mature D1 protein, the Mn4Ca1Clx cluster is assembled with the assistance of the Psb27 protein. Psb27 then dissociates to allow for the binding of the extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbU, PsbV, and PsbQ. Note that these events in the assembly of the lumenal side of PSII are relevant for both de novo PSII synthesis and the PSII repair cycle after D1 photodamage. Photosynthetic organisms daily experience fluctuations in light intensity and must survive in a variety of environments with different nutrient availability. The standard laboratory conditions that are routinely used in studies of Synechocystis mutants do not accurately reflect that of the natural environment. Thus, it may be difficult to interpret the significance of subtle phenotypic differences between WT and mutant cells. Under natural conditions where the concentrations of critical elements such as calcium and chlorine are low, the Psb27 protein provides a distinct benefit for cells by assisting optimal PSII assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2058482910,"Perfringolysin O (PFO) is a sterol-dependent, pore-forming cytolysin. To understand the molecular basis of PFO membrane interaction, we studied its dependence upon sterol and lipid structure and aqueous environment. PFO interacted with diverse sterols, although binding was affected by double bond location in the sterol rings, sterol side chain structure, and sterol polar group structure. Importantly, a sterol structure promoting formation of ordered membrane domains (lipid rafts) was not critical for interaction. PFO membrane interaction was also affected by phospholipid acyl chain structure, being inversely related to tight acyl chain packing with cholesterol. Experiments using the pre-pore Y181A mutant demonstrated that sterol binding strength and specificity was not affected by whether PFO forms a transmembrane β-barrel. Combined, these observations are consistent with a model in which the strength and specificity of sterol interaction arises from both sterol interactions with domain 4 and sterol chemical activity within membranes. The lipid raft-binding portions of sterol bound to PFO may remain largely exposed to the lipid bilayer. These results place important constraints upon the origin of PFO raft affinity. Additional experiments demonstrated that the structure of membrane-inserted PFO at low and neutral pH was similar as judged by the effect of phospholipid and sterol structure upon PFO properties and membrane interaction. However, low pH enhanced PFO membrane binding, oligomerization, and pore formation. In lipid vesicles mimicking the exofacial (outer) membrane leaflet, PFO-membrane binding was maximal at pH 5.5–6.

Once associated with the membrane, PFO oligomerizes into complexes of 20–50 subunits (forming a pre-pore structure) (6Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the pre-pore state, the insertion domain (Domain 3) is held ∼60 Å above the surface of the membrane by Domain 2 (7Ramachandran R. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To induce pore formation, Domain 2 undergoes a vertical collapse, which brings Domain 3 within range to insert into the bilayer (8Czajkowsky D.M. Hotze E.M. Shao Z. Tweten R.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3206-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Additionally, a major structural rearrangement takes place within Domain 3 whereby six α-helices rearrange into two amphipathic β-hairpins that insert into the membrane to form a transmembrane (TM) structure (8Czajkowsky D.M. Hotze E.M. Shao Z. Tweten R.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3206-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The resulting pore ranges in size from 250–300 Å in diameter (6Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E.

A model in which PFO binds to a membrane surface involving several sterol molecules has recently been proposed (12Geoffroy C. Alouf J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9968-9972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, cholesterol is required for the PFO pre-pore to pore conversion, and has also been shown to be necessary for pore formation by intermedilysin, a related CDC, which does not use cholesterol as a receptor, but requires it for pore formation (6Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11315-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). CDC proteins are also of interest because they are believed to bind to lipid rafts via their affinity for sterol. Lipid rafts are tightly packed sphingolipid and sterol-rich liquid-ordered (Lo) membrane domains which are believed to co-exist in eukaryotic cellular membranes with loosely packed disordered (Ld) domains composed mostly of unsaturated lipids (for recent reviews see Refs. 13London E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 203-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 14Simons K. Vaz W.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Rafts are believed to serve many functions in cellular processes at the plasma membrane and have been proposed to serve as platforms that regulate protein-protein interactions (15Lafont F. van der Goot F.G. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). While these lipid domains have been highly studied in model membranes, where their existence is widely accepted, their formation and functional role in cells remains controversial. Both intact PFO and isolated Domain 4 have been used as markers of cholesterol-rich regions of cell membranes (4Shimada Y. Maruya M. Iwashita S. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6195-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Ohno-Iwashita Y. Shimada Y. Waheed A.A. Hayashi M. Inomata M. Nakamura M. Maruya M. Iwashita S.

Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4926-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The details of PFO-raft affinity are of particular interest because PFO is a TM protein, and the origin of TM protein-raft affinity is not clear. Although biochemical studies detect TM proteins within detergent-resistant membranes that may be derived from ordered domains in cells, TM proteins should not be able to pack well with lipids in an ordered state (18Fastenberg M.E. Shogomori H. Xu X. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12376-12390Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because the TM insertion of PFO can be controlled, it is an ideal protein to study this issue. Furthermore, like other CDCs, PFO interaction with membranes is affected by sterol structure (19Rebolj K. Ulrih N.P. Macek P. Sepcic K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Bavdek A. Gekara N.O. Priselac D. Gutierrez Aguirre I. Darji A. Chakraborty T. Macek P. Lakey J.H. Weiss S. Anderluh G.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and sterol interaction with PFO should yield useful information on PFO affinity for rafts. In this study we found that the interaction of PFO with membranes does not require that the sterol to which it binds has the ability to promote raft formation. Furthermore, tightly packing phospholipids, which interact strongly with sterols, tended to weaken the PFO-membrane interaction. These results do not mean that PFO does not interact with rafts, but, together with the observation that a pre-pore mutant has a similar sterol specificity as wild-type protein, it does place important constraints on the origin of PFO affinity for rafts. In the course of these experiments we also found that a low pH strongly promoted the interaction of PFO with membranes. Combined with recent cellular studies (3O'Brien D.K. Melville S.B. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5204-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), this supports the hypothesis that at least one physiological function of PFO involves low pH. Materials–Unlabeled phospholipids, cholesterol, and 1,2-dibromostearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (BrPC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-N-pyrenesulfonyl phosphatidylethanolamine (pyrene-PE) was purchased from the Molecular Probes Division of Introgen (Carlsbad, CA). Lanosterol (97% pure) and β-sitosterol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All other sterols were purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI). Lipids were stored dissolved in ethanol or chloroform at –20 °C. Concentrations were determined by dry weight (or for pyrene-PE by absorbance using an ϵ of 35,000 cm–1 m–1 at 350 nm). Streptavidin BODIPY-FL conjugate (BOD-SA) (discontinued except as a custom labeling product) was purchased from Invitrogen and reconstituted with water to give a 100 μm solution. Biocytin (ϵ-biotinoyl-l-lysine) was purchased from Anaspec (San Jose, CA). TALON bead resin was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). All other chemicals were reagent grade. Sterol purity was analyzed on HP-TLC plates (Merck & Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ). Approximately 2 μg of sterol dissolved in ethanol was applied to the plate, dried, and then chromatographed using a sequential solvent system. The first solvent (50:38:3:2 (v/v) chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water) was allowed to migrate halfway up the plate. The plate was then dried, introduced into a second chamber containing the solvent system 1:1 hexane/ethyl acetate (v/v), and chromatographed until the solvent migrated to near the top of the plate. For each step, solvent chambers were equilibrated with solvents for at least 2 h before chromatography. The plate was then dried and sprayed with 5% (w/v) cupric acetate, 8% (v/v) phosphoric acid in water. To detect sterol, plates were charred at 180 °C for 5 min. Sterols deemed impure (zymosterol and desmosterol) were purified by TLC (28Megha Bakht O. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21903-21913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and purity was confirmed by HP-TLC. A functional cysteine-less derivative of wild-type PFO (PFO C459A) and a pre-pore mutant (PFO C459A Y181A, gift of A. Heuck, University of Massachusetts, Amherst) were expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (29Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Both WT and pre-pore PFO were then purified by a modification of the previously reported protocol (29Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Three hours after induction of expression with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), two liters of cultured E. coli expressing PFO were pelleted at 4 °C. The bacteria were resuspended in NiA buffer (10 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) containing 150 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 μg/ml chicken egg white lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich), incubated for 30 min at room temperature, subjected to tip sonication with a cell disruptor (Heat Systems, Ultasonics, Inc, Plainview, NY) for 15 s while cooled on ice, and then cooled a further 15 s. The sonication and cooling steps were repeated two times. Next, the mixture was spun down at 15,000 rpm in a SS-34 rotor at 4 °C using a Dupont RC-5 centrifuge. The supernatant from this step was incubated for 20 min. at room temperature while mixing with TALON metal affinity resin (3 ml). Resin was pelleted with a tabletop centrifuge, added to a 0.8 × 4 cm poly-prep plastic column (BioRad, Hercules, CA), washed with about 5 ml of NiA buffer followed by a 1-ml aliquot of NiA buffer containing 50 mm, and then washed with a 1-ml aliquot of NiA buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The PFO was then eluted with several 1-ml aliquots containing NiA buffer with 400 mm imidazole. Fractions containing PFO were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of Buffer B (10 mm MES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5) with one buffer change. The pooled PFO-containing fractions were then subjected to gravity anion-exchange chromatography using SP-Sephadex resin (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) in a 0.8 × 4 cm poly-prep plastic column and stepwise eluted using 1-ml aliquots of Buffer B containing increasing concentrations of NaCl in 100 mm steps, with duplicate aliquots at 300 mm and 400 mm NaCl. The majority of purified PFO eluted in Buffer B containing 300–400 mm NaCl. It was then dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4 (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm potassium phosphate, 137 mm sodium chloride, 13 mm potassium chloride), and stored at –20 °C. Preparation of Liposomes–Multilamellar vesicles (MLV) were prepared at a concentration of 500 μm lipid in PBS, pH 7.4 or 5.1 (PBS at pH < 7.4 being prepared by titrating PBS pH 7.4 with acetic acid) similarly as described previously (30Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Dried lipid mixtures (redissolved in CHCl3 and redried under N2 and then high vacuum for at least 1 h) were dispersed in buffer at 70 °C and agitated at 70 °C for 15 min using a VWR multitube vortexer (Westchester, PA) placed within a convection oven (GCA Corp, Precision Scientific, Chicago, IL). The samples were then cooled to room temperature. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared from MLV (prepared at a lipid concentration of 10 mm) by subjecting the MLV to 7 cycles of freezing in a mixture of dry ice and acetone for 30 s and thawing at room temperature. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared at a concentration of 100 μm lipid in PBS (pH 7.4, 6.8, or 5.1) by ethanol dilution in a manner similar to that described previously (30Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). (SUV samples for quenching experiments contained 5 μm pyrene-PE in addition to 100 μm unlabeled lipids.) Lipids mixed in ethanol were diluted slightly more than 50-fold in PBS buffer heated to 70 °C, briefly vortexed, incubated at 70 °C for about 5 min, re-vortexed, and then cooled to room temperature. Fluorescence Intensity Measurements–Fluorescence emission intensity was measured at room temperature on a SPEX Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorimeter. For fixed wavelength measurements, excitation and emission wavelength sets used (in nm) were (295, 340) for tryptophan and (485, 518) for BODIPY-FL labeled streptavidin. Duplicate samples were prepared for fluorescence measurements. Fluorescence intensity in single background samples lacking fluorophore was subtracted. For protein emission spectra, samples, and backgrounds were excited at 280 nm and emission was acquired from 300–400 nm. Vesicle Binding Experiments–The ability of PFO to associate with vesicles was assessed by measuring the increase in intrinsic Trp emission intensity, which occurs when the Trp residues located within Domain 4 come into contact with sterol-containing membranes (31Nakamura M. Sekino N. Iwamoto M. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6513-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, PFO (5 μg from a stock solution containing ∼1–2 mg/ml) was added to 1-ml UV preparations at the desired pH (5.1, 6.8, or 7.4) and lipid composition, allowed to incubate for 1.5–2 h at room temperature, and then fluorescence emission intensity was measured as described above. Binding and Oligomerization Assays–To assess PFO oligomerization, MLV (500 μm lipid) composed of DOPC, BrPC and sterol (with BrPC being 10 mol% of total lipid) were prepared in 200 μl of PBS at pH 7.4 or 5.1 (depending on desired experimental conditions) and incubated with 10 μg PFO for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were spun down at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge model 5415C (Westbury, NY) for 20 min at room temperature. Pellets containing the MLV and bound PFO were resuspended in 20 μl of PBS (pH 7.4), solubilized with 5 μl of SDS loading buffer (40% glycerol (v/v), 25% SDS (w/v), and 0.1% bromphenol blue (w/v)), and then analyzed using denaturing SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis (SDS-AGE) as described previously (29Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) Briefly, 2% (w/v) agarose gels were run for 1–1.25 h at 103 volts in SDS gel reservoir buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris-base in 0.1% (w/v) SDS) and fixed overnight in 30% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid. The gels were then dried for 3 h at 70 °C in a Savant slab gel dryer (Holbrook, NY), stained with 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Blue dissolved in 30% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid for 2 h, and then destained for 30 min to 1 h in the fixing solution. Assay for Pore Formation–PFO-induced pore formation was measured by assaying the efflux of vesicle-entrapped biocytin via the increase in the BODIPY fluorescence emission intensity upon binding of biocytin to BODIPY-labeled streptavidin (BOD-SA) in the external solution. LUVs with trapped biocytin were prepared by freezing and thawing MLVs (10 mm lipid), as described above, in the presence of 537 μm biocytin. The mixture was dialyzed against 4 liters of PBS overnight with one change of dialysis buffer to remove external biocytin. 10 μl of LUVs with entrapped biocytin were diluted to a lipid concentration of 100 μm and a volume of 990 μl with PBS and then BOD-SA (10 μl from the stock solution) was added externally to vesicles to give a BOD-SA concentration of 10 nm. BODIPY emission intensity was then measured. PFO was added to a concentration of 5 μg/ml, samples were briefly mixed, and then BODIPY intensity was monitored as a function of time for up to 45 min. PFO Interacts with Membranes at Both Low and Neutral pH–Because low pH-induced unfolding often aids protein toxin insertion into membranes, we compared the behavior of PFO at low and neutral pH. First, the interaction between (Cys-less) PFO and model membrane vesicles was measured. (The removal of the Cys eliminates the sensitivity of PFO to spontaneous inactivation by oxidation (32Pinkney M. Beachey E. Kehoe M. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).) Previous studies have shown that the interaction of PFO with membranes can be detected by the large increase in Domain 4 Trp emission intensity that accompanies association with membranes (31Nakamura M. Sekino N. Iwamoto M. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6513-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A similar (4-fold) increase of Trp emission intensity relative to that in aqueous solution is observed when PFO is incubated with vesicles at pH 7.4 and pH 5.1, suggesting PFO interacts with membranes in a similar fashion at low and neutral pH (Fig. 1). Notice that there is a small red shift in the emission spectrum at low pH in aqueous solution relative to that at neutral pH. This is consistent with an increased Trp exposure to a polar environment, e.g. aqueous solution, at low pH, and suggests that there is a small unfolding event at low pH. In the presence of lipid vesicles, this red shift is not observed, and spectra at low and neutral pH are nearly identical. The kinetics of PFO interaction with vesicles at neutral and low pH were also compared. Measurements of the time dependence of the increase in emission intensity upon incubation of PFO with vesicles demonstrates that PFO-membrane binding occurs faster at pH 5.1 (t½ = 1.5 min) than at pH 7.4 (t½ = 6.5 min) (data not shown). A similar difference in the rate of interaction at pH 5.1 and 7.4, is observed at 37 °C, although the half-times for membrane interaction decrease by a factor of about two relative to those at room temperature and the increase in fluorescence is about 3-fold (data not shown). PFO-Vesicle Interactions at Low pH Occur at Lower Cholesterol Concentrations Than at Neutral pH–The above results suggest that low pH might enhance the interaction PFO with membranes. To examine this, the interaction of PFO with vesicles containing various amounts of cholesterol was compared at low and neutral pH. Fig. 2A shows that the cholesterol concentration that induces PFO interaction with DOPC/cholesterol vesicles is less at low pH than at neutral pH, with the increase in fluorescence emission intensity being half-maximal at 15–20 mol% cholesterol at pH 5.1 (○) and 25–30 mol % cholesterol at pH 7.4 (•). It is possible binding to vesicles might occur without an increase in Trp fluorescence emission intensity. To confirm that the increase in Trp fluorescence emission intensity accurately reports when binding to vesicles occurs, more direct methods were used. First, a pyrene-labeled lipid was used as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) acceptor for Trp, and binding as a function of cholesterol concentration assayed via the amount of FRET, as detected by quenching of Trp fluorescence emission intensity. Fig. 2B shows that the cholesterol concentration dependence of Trp fluorescence quenching is very similar to the cholesterol dependence of the Trp intensity increase in the absence of acceptor, with lipid interaction occurring at a lower cholesterol concentration at low pH than at neutral pH. As commonly observed (33Chung L.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), FRET-induced quenching is incomplete because not all of the donors are close enough to the pyrene-labeled lipid to take part in energy transfer. Thus, the maximal level of FRET-induced quenching, 80%, presumably represents complete binding of PFO to the vesicles. It should also be noted that the small amount of apparent FRET at low cholesterol concentration is largely an inner filter artifact arising from a small amount of pyrene absorbance. These results were further confirmed by measuring the association of PFO with vesicles via centrifugation of PFO mixed with MLV. The amount of bound PFO in the MLV-containing pellet was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis in SDS (SDS-AGE). The cholesterol concentration dependence of PFO binding detected by sedimentation (Fig. 2C) is similar to that obtained from fluorescence intensity measurements in terms of the threshold sterol concentration for binding PFO and its pH dependence. The position of the main PFO band on the gels indicates that when membrane-bound, PFO efficiently forms characteristic SDS-resistant oligomers (29Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) at both pH values (although a variable amount of monomers can be often observed). PFO Forms Pores Efficiently at Low pH–While the experiments above show that PFO exhibits similar binding and oligomerization behavior at low and neutral pH, under some circumstances PFO can form pre-pore oligomers that do not deeply membrane-insert (29Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether PFO pore-forming behavior is retained at low pH. To assay pore formation, we measured the efflux of biocytin encapsulated inside LUVs. In this method, efflux is detected by the increase in the BODIPY emission intensity that occurs when biocytin binds to BODIPY-tagged streptavidin added externally to the vesicles (34Emans N. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 716-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35Nicol F. Nir S. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biophys.

Biol. 1999; 16: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that PFO forms pores efficiently in DOPC vesicles containing 50 mol% cholesterol at both pH 5.1 and 7.4, with the rate of biocytin efflux being slightly faster at low pH. The difference between neutral and low pH is even larger at lower cholesterol concentrations (data not shown), presumably because PFO binds to a greater extent at low pH than at neutral pH. Fig. 3 also shows no pore formation occurred in the absence of cholesterol. A control experiment using a previously identified mutant (PFO C459A/Y181A) that remains in the pre-pore state (37Hotze E.M. Heuck A.P. Czajkowsky D.M. Shao Z. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2045142914,"Epithelial cell-cell interactions require localized adhesive interactions between E-cadherin on opposing membranes and the activation of downstream signaling pathways that affect membrane and actin dynamics. However, it is not known whether E-cadherin engagement and activation of these signaling pathways are locally coordinated or whether signaling is sustained or locally down-regulated like other receptor-mediated pathways. To obtain high spatiotemporal resolution of immediate-early signaling events upon E-cadherin engagement, we used laser tweezers to place beads coated with functional E-cadherin extracellular domain on cells. We show that cellular E-cadherin accumulated rapidly around beads, reaching a sustained plateau level in 1-3 min. Phosphoinositides and Rac1 co-accumulated with E-cadherin, reached peak levels with E-cadherin, but then rapidly dispersed. Both E-cadherin and Rac1 accumulated independently of Rac1 GTP binding/hydrolysis, but these activities were required for Rac1 dispersal. E-cadherin accumulation was dependent on membrane dynamics and actin polymerization, but actin did not stably co-accumulate with E-cadherin; mathematical modeling showed that diffusion-mediated trapping could account for the initial E-cadherin accumulation. We propose that initial E-cadherin accumulation requires active membrane dynamics and involves diffusion-mediated trapping at contact sites; to propagate further contacts, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Rac1 are transiently activated by E-cadherin engagement and initiate a new round of membrane dynamics, but they are subsequently suppressed at that site to allow maintenance of weak E-cadherin mediated adhesion."

In the kidney, TK that is synthesized in large amounts by connecting tubule cells (1Proud D. Knepper M.A. Pisano J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F510-F515PubMed Google Scholar) is mainly secreted into the urinary fluid and to a lesser extent to the peritubular interstitium. In the renal interstitium it cleaves locally produced kininogen to yield bradykinin that in turn can activate type-2 (B2) bradykinin receptors. Bradykinin-dependent activation of B2 receptor increases sodium excretion by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct (2Tomita K. Pisano J.J. Knepper M.A. J. Clin.

Med. 1978; 55: 51-55PubMed Google Scholar, 4Seino M. Abe K. Otsuka Y. Saito T. Irokawa N. Tohoku J. Exp.

Carretero O.A. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 483-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, inactivation of the TK gene in the mouse does not alter blood pressure (6Meneton P. Bloch-Faure M. Hagege A.A. Ruetten H. Huang W. Bergaya S. Ceiler D. Gehring D. Martins I. Salmon G. Boulanger C.M. Nussberger J. Crozatier B. Gasc J.M. Heudes D. Bruneval P. Doetschman T. Menard J. Alhenc-Gelas F. Proc. Natl.

This finding suggests that low urinary kallikrein excretion observed in hypertensive patients is not a primary cause of high blood pressure (HBP) but rather a consequence of hypertension or of HBP-associated renal defects. An alternative explanation is that TK-deficient mice develop compensatory mechanisms to keep blood pressure at normal levels. tissue kallikrein potential difference sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate cortical collecting duct aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron wild type alveolar fluid clearance channel-activating protease. The role of the large amount of TK that is secreted into the urinary fluid remains unknown. One possibility would be that this protease acts directly on the different transporters expressed at the apical side of the tubular cells to modulate their activities. Apical sodium reabsorption along the renal tubule is achieved through multiple sodium transporters. Particularly, in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN, i.e. distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), connecting tubule, and collecting duct), the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel ENaC, consisting of α-, β-, and γ-subunits, mediates Na+ uptake across the apical plasma membrane of principal cells and connecting tubule cells (10Loffing J. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 284: 628-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In all renal tubule cells, the Na+ is extruded on the basolateral side in exchange for K+ by the Na+,K+-ATPase. Although sodium transport occurs throughout the length of the renal tubule, the fine regulation of sodium excretion occurs in the ASDN, mostly through aldosterone-dependent regulation of ENaC. Because TK production localizes to connecting tubule cells, the urinary side of connecting and collecting duct cells, where ENaC is expressed, is exposed to large amounts of the active enzyme. Because a novel mechanism of proteolytic activation of ENaC by locally produced serine protease has been recently proposed (11Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q.

To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model with TK gene disruption (TK–/–) to study molecular and functional expression of ENaC. Animals–The TK–/– mice were previously generated in our laboratory (6Meneton P. Bloch-Faure M. Hagege A.A. Ruetten H. Huang W. Bergaya S. Ceiler D. Gehring D. Martins I. Salmon G. Boulanger C.M. Nussberger J. Crozatier B. Gasc J.M. Heudes D. Bruneval P. Doetschman T. Menard J. Alhenc-Gelas F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2634-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Type 2-bradykinin receptor knock out mice (B2–/–) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) (13Borkowski J.A. Ransom R.W. Seabrook G.R. Trumbauer M. Chen H. Hill R.G.

All the experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the French government animal welfare policy (agreement RA024647151FR). Aldosterone Infusion Study–7 TK–/– and 7 WT mice were infused continuously with aldosterone 100 μg·kg body weight–1·day–1 diluted in 0.9% NaCl and 5% Me2SO administrated by osmotic minipump (Alzet model 2004, Durect Corp., Cupertino, CA). In this particular set of experiments standard laboratory diet was supplemented with 3% Na+ and 0.4% K+. Control mice received vehicle alone. Infusion of aldosterone or vehicle was continued over a 28-day period. Physiological Studies–Animals were housed in metabolic cages and were pair-fed. After 3–5 days adaptation, urines were collected daily for electrolyte measurements. Animals were sacrificed with ketamine and xylazine (0.1 and 0.01 mg·g of body weight–1, respectively). Plasma and urine electrolytes, creatinine, and aldosterone were determined as described (14Vallet M. Picard N. Loffing-Cueni D. Fysekidis M. Bloch-Faure M. Deschenes G. Breton S. Meneton P. Loffing J. Aronson P.S. Chambrey R. Eladari D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Plasma renin concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay of angiotensin I generated by incubation of the plasma at pH 8.5 in the presence of an excess of rat angiotensinogen (15Menard J. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1972; 90: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay (Amersham Biosciences). Membrane Fraction Preparation–At the time of the sacrifice, kidneys were removed and cut into 5-mm slices. The renal cortex was excised under a stereoscopic microscope and placed into ice-cold isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-Hepes, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors in 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 28 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Lungs were also removed, minced, and placed in the same ice-cold isolation buffer. Minced tissues were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (pestle A, 5 passes) followed by 10 passes through a Teflon glass homogenizer rotating at 1000 rpm. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 360,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer. Protein contents were determined using the Bradford protein assay (microBradford, Bio-Rad). Exosome Preparation–Urinary exosomes were prepared as previously described by Pisitkun et al. (16Pisitkun T. Shen R.F. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13368-13373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). Briefly, urines from TK–/– and WT mice housed in metabolic cages were collected daily in tubes containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml leupeptin and 100 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride) and sodium azide. A pool of 75–90 ml of urine per group was used. Urine samples were extensively vortexed immediately after they thawed. The urines were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove whole cells, large membrane fractions, and other debris. Supernatants were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain a low density membrane pellet. The exosome-associated proteins isolated from the pooled urine samples were suspended in isolation solution (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm ethanolamine, pH 7.6, containing protease inhibitors in 1 μg/ml leupeptin and 100 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Protein contents were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Values were normalized for urine creatinine to ensure adequate protein loading in Western blot experiments, i.e. to allow comparison of the abundance in exosome-associated proteins from urine samples of the same time for each group, as proposed by others (17Zhou H.

Antibodies–Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to NHE3 and NKCC2 have been characterized previously (18Kim G.H. Ecelbarger C. Knepper M.A. Packer R.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to NaPi-2a was given by J. Biber (Zürich University, Switzerland) and has been characterized previously (19Custer M. Lotscher M. Biber J. Murer H. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F767-F774PubMed Google Scholar). Chicken anti Na+,K+-ATPase polyclonal antibody was purchased from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed to α-ENaC (amino acids 46–68), β-ENaC (amino acids 617–638), and γ-ENaC (amino acids 629–650) were raised by G. Deschenes using exactly the same peptides originally described by Masilamani et al. (20Masilamani S. Kim G.H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). All these antibodies have been described and characterized previously (21Lourdel S. Loffing J. Favre G. Paulais M. Nissant A. Fakitsas P. Creminon C. Feraille E. Verrey F. Teulon J. Doucet A. Deschenes G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 3642-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When necessary, new batches of antibodies were tested in preliminary experiments to verify that the specificity was identical to that of the antibodies from the original batch (not shown). Immunoblot Analyses–Membrane proteins were solubilized in SDS-loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and bromphenol blue), incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Electrophoresis was initially performed for all samples on 7.5% polyacrylamide minigels (XCell SureLock Mini-cell, Invitrogen), which were stained with Coomassie Blue to provide quantitative assessment of loading, as previously described (14Vallet M. Picard N. Loffing-Cueni D. Fysekidis M. Bloch-Faure M. Deschenes G. Breton S. Meneton P. Loffing J. Aronson P.S. Chambrey R. Eladari D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred electrophoretically (XCell II Blot Module, Invitrogen) for 1.5 h at 4 °C from unstained gels to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and then stained with 0.5% Ponceau S in acetic acid to check for uniformity of protein transfer onto the nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were first incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding of antibody followed by overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (anti-NHE3 1:1,000, anti-NaPi2a 1:20,000, anti-NCC 1:50,000, anti-NKCC2 1:5,000, anti-α-ENaC 1:3,000, anti-β-ENaC 1:20,000, anti-γ-ENaC 1:2,000, anti-Na+/K+-ATPase 1:20,000) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% nonfat dry milk. After four 5-min washes in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) or peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-chicken IgY (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were washed as above, and luminal-enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Science Products) was used to visualize bound antibodies before exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The autoradiography was digitized with use of a laser scanner (Epson Perfection 1650, Epson), and quantification of each band was performed by densitometry using NIH Image software. Densitometric values were normalized to the mean for the control group that was defined as 100%, and results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. For deglycosylation experiments protein samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with or without peptide N-glycosidase F according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics) and processed for immunoblotting as described above. To assess whether or not TK promotes γ-ENaC cleavage in vitro, renal cortical membrane fractions from TK–/– mice were prepared as described above except that proteases inhibitors were omitted. To compare their ability to promote γ-ENaC cleavage, urines from TK–/– and WT mice were first desalted against Tris buffer (0.2 m, pH 8.2) in a Centricon column (Centricon-10, cut-off 10 kDa, Millipore). The final volume of the desalted urine was one-third that of the initial volume of urine introduced in the column. Membrane fractions were incubated with desalted urines for 1.5 h at 37 °C or with purified TK from porcine pancreas (Sigma-Aldrich) before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-γ-ENaC antibody as described above. Measurement of Alveolar Fluid Clearance in Mouse–Sodium-driven alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) was measured in vivo using an in situ non-ventilated mouse lung model, as previously described (22Fukuda N. Folkesson H.G. Matthay M.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Planes C. Leyvraz C. Uchida T. Angelova M.A. Vuagniaux G. Hummler E. Matthay M. Clerici C. Rossier B. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2005; 288: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This model has been shown to give AFC values similar to those obtained with the ventilated mouse model over a 15-min period. Briefly, male or female WT or TK–/– mice aged 2–5 months were euthanized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (250 mg/kg) and maintained at 37–38 °C using a heating pad, an infrared lamp, and an intra-abdominal monitoring thermistor. A 20-gauge venous catheter was inserted in the trachea through a tracheotomy and tightly fixed. The lungs were inflated with 100% O2 at 7 cm H2O continuous positive airway pressure throughout the experiment. Then, 10 ml/kg instillate was delivered to the lungs over 30 s through the tracheal catheter. The instillate consisted of Ringer's lactate, pH 7.4, adjusted to 325 mosmol/kg of H2O with NaCl, containing 5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 μCi/ml 125I-labeled albumin (Cis Bio International, Gif-sur Yvette, France) as a labeled alveolar fluid volume tracer. An alveolar fluid sample (50–100 μl) was aspirated 1 min after instillation and at the end of experiment (15 min later). The aspirates were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min, and the radioactivity in supernatants was counted in duplicate. Alveolar fluid clearance (percentage fluid absorption at 15 min) was calculated from the increase in alveolar fluid albumin as AFC (%) = (Cf – Ci)/Cf × 100, where Ci and Cf represent the initial and final concentrations of 125I-labeled albumin in the aspirate at 1 and 15 min, respectively, as assessed by radioactivity measurements. In some experiments amiloride (1 mm) was added to the instillate, and AFC was measured at 15 min as described above. ENaC-mediated AFC represents the difference between total AFC values (in the absence of amiloride) and amiloride-insensitive AFC values (in the presence of amiloride). Results are presented as the means ± S.E. One-way variance analyses were performed and, when allowed by the F value, results were compared by the modified least significant difference (Statview software). p < 0.05 was considered significant. Measurement of Rectal Transepithelial Potential Difference– The mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of Ketalar (Parke-Davis), 75 μg/g of body weight, and Rompun (Bayer, Puteaux, France), 2.3 μg/g of body weight, and placed on a heated table. A winged needle filled with isotonic saline was placed in the subcutaneous tissue of the back. A double-barreled pipette was prepared from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.0-mm outer diamater/0.5-mm inner diameter, Hilgerberg, Malsfeld, Germany) and pulled to a ∼0.2-mm tip diameter. The first barrel was filled with isotonic saline buffered with 10 mm Na+-HEPES, pH 7.2, and the second barrel with the same solution containing 25 μm amiloride. The tip of the double-barreled pipette was placed in the rectum about 3–5 mm from the skin margin. The electrical potential difference was measured between the first barrel and the subcutaneous needle, both connected to Ag+/AgCl electrodes by means of plastic tubes filled with 3 m KCl in 2% agar. The rectal potential difference (PD) was monitored continuously by a VCC600 electrometer (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA) connected to a chart-paper recorder. After stabilization of the rectal PD (about 1 min), 0.05 ml of saline solution was injected through the first barrel as a control maneuver, and the PD was recorded for another 30-s period. A similar volume of saline solution containing 25 μm amiloride was injected through the second barrel of the pipette, and the PD was recorded for another minute. The amiloride-sensitive PD was calculated as the difference between the PD recorded before and after the addition of amiloride. Evaluation of Apical Na+ Entry in Isolated CCDs Microperfused in Vitro–Experiments were performed as previously described by others (24Komlosi P. Fuson A.L. Fintha A. Peti-Peterdi J. Rosivall L. Warnock D.G. Bell P.D. Hypertension. 2003; 42: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, CCD segments were dissected from C57Bl/6 mouse, mounted on concentric pipettes, and perfused in vitro. During intracellular pH measurement experiments, the average tubule length exposed to bath fluid was limited to 300–350 μm to prevent motion of the tubule. The dissection and initial luminal and peritubular solutions were composed of 25 mm NaCl, 119 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine gluconate, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm K2HPO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES and was adjusted to a pH of 7.4. Tubules were bathed and perfused with this same solution. For the experiments CCDs were bathed in a modified solution in which NaCl was iso-osmotically replaced with N-methyl-d-glucamine gluconate to achieve an NaCl concentration of 0 mmol/liter and containing the Na+ ionophore monensin (10–5 m). This maneuver effectively eliminated the basolateral membrane as a barrier for Na+ movement. Under these conditions Na+ entry across the apical membrane is the only means of altering [Na]i. To identify principal and intercalated cells, we labeled intercalated cells by adding fluorescein-labeled peanut lectin (Vector Laboratories) to the luminal perfusate for 5 min and observed which cells were fluorescent with excitation and emission wavelengths of 440 and 530 nm, respectively. [Na]i in CCD cells was assessed with imaging-based, dual-excitation wavelength fluorescence microscopy with use of the fluorescent probe sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI, Molecular Probes). Tubules were loaded with 2 × 10–5 m of the acetoxymethyl ester of SBFI added to the luminal perfusate. Intracellular dye was excited alternatively at 340 and 380 nm with a 100-watt xenon lamp and a computer-controlled chopper assembly. Emitted light was collected through a dichroic mirror, passed through a 510-nm filter, and focused onto a CCD camera (ICCD 2525F, Videoscope International, VA) connected to a computer. The measured light intensities were digitized with 8-bit precision (256 gray level scale) for further analysis. For each tubule 2–4 principal cells were analyzed; the mean gray level for each excitation wavelength was calculated with the Starwise Fluo software (Imstar, Paris, France). SBFI fluorescence ratios (340/380 nm) were used as an estimator of [Na]i values. Evidence for Decreased Sodium Channel Activity in the Kidney and the Distal Colon–TK is secreted into the luminal fluid of the distal part of the ASDN, where ENaC is believed to be the limiting step for Na+ reabsorption, and a strong inverse relationship has been described between the amount of TK excreted in the urine and blood pressure in humans (3Lechi A. Covi G. Lechi C. Corgnati A. Arosio E. Zatti M. Scuro L.A. Clin. Sci. Mol. Med. 1978; 55: 51-55PubMed Google Scholar, 4Seino M. Abe K. Otsuka Y. Saito T. Irokawa N. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1975; 116: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We speculated that TK might be a factor regulating ENaC activity. To test renal ENaC function in vivo, we first tested the effects of amiloride on urinary sodium excretion in TK–/– mice. Fig. 1A shows that a single dose of amiloride (subcutaneous injection of 1.45 mg·kg of body weight–1) significantly increased urinary Na+ excretion during the next 2 h after the injection in WT mice, whereas the effect of amiloride on Na+ excretion was blunted in TK–/– mice. This result indicated that renal ENaC activity was decreased in mice lacking TK production. The distal colon also expresses all three ENaC subunits, mRNA for TK has been found to be highly expressed in the colon, and abundant TK activity is measurable in the feces (6Meneton P. Bloch-Faure M. Hagege A.A. Ruetten H. Huang W. Bergaya S. Ceiler D. Gehring D. Martins I. Salmon G. Boulanger C.M. Nussberger J. Crozatier B. Gasc J.M. Heudes D. Bruneval P. Doetschman T. Menard J. Alhenc-Gelas F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2634-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that if TK activates ENaC, this effect may be detectable in the distal colon. We tested this hypothesis in vivo by measuring amiloride-sensitive transepithelial rectal potential difference, an index of ENaC-mediated Na+ transport, in WT and TK–/– mice. As shown in Fig. 1B, the amiloride-sensitive rectal potential difference was significantly decreased in TK–/– mice compared with WT mice, indicating that, as in the kidney, TK is an activating factor of ENaC in the distal colon. Table 1 shows that TK–/– mice were able to maintain normal Na+ balance with no evidence for extracellular fluid volume depletion. Moreover, the animals were pair-fed, and hence, identical urinary excretion of Na+ and Cl– (see Table 1) indicated that they were able to achieve a steady state. Thus, although the TK–/– mice are able to excrete the full amount of NaCl taken in the diet and maintain a steady state, they do so with a concomitant decrease in amiloride-sensitive (ENaC-mediated) sodium absorption, implying that amiloride-independent Na+ absorption, presumably upstream from the collecting duct system, is increased.TABLE 1Physiological parameters from WT and TK–/– mice kept under a Na+-replete dietWT (n = 7)TK-/- (n = 7)pPlasmaRenin activity (ng of angiotensin I/h/ml)868 ± 133531 ± 71.40.049Atrial natriuretic peptide (pg/ml)325 ± 27361 ± 230.35Aldosterone (pm)555 ± 172504 ± 1020.81Protein (g/liter)48.7 ± 0.947.5 ± 0.60.32UrineUrinary volume (ml/24 h)1.28 ± 0.611.45 ± 0.250.60Creatinine (μmol/day)4.28 ± 1.755.91 ± 1.050.34Aldosterone (nmol/mmol creatinine)1.74 ± 0.201.82 ± 0.130.76Na+ (mmol/mmol creatinine)23.6 ± 3.519.2 ± 1.80.29K+ (mmol/mmol creatinine)24.0 ± 3.119.1 ± 1.20.19Cl- (mmol/mmol creatinine)40.3 ± 0.936.5 ± 1.10.07 Open table in a new tab Luminal TK Activates ENaC in Principal Cells of Cortical Collecting Duct Isolated and Microperfused in Vitro–Our preceding experiments indicate that TK–/– mice have a decreased in ENaC-mediated Na+ transport in kidney. Therefore, to confirm more directly that TK is able to activate ENaC, we next examined the effects of extracellular (luminal) TK on ENaC in CCDs isolated and microperfused in vitro. Intercalated cells were identified by adding fluorescein-labeled peanut lectin to the luminal perfusate for 5 min and observed which cells were fluorescent. [Na]i in principal cells was then assessed with use of the fluorescent probe sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI), as previously described (24Komlosi P. Fuson A.L. Fintha A. Peti-Peterdi J. Rosivall L. Warnock D.G. Bell P.D. Hypertension. 2003; 42: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). ENaC is the limiting step for Na+ entry into principal cells; therefore, if TK activates ENaC, [Na]i is expected to increase when TK is perfused to the luminal surface of the CCD. Accordingly, Fig. 2 shows that TK was able to increase significantly the ratio of F340/F380 SBFI fluorescence, which reflects an increase in [Na+]i, whereas no change was observed in CCDs perfused with vehicle only. Moreover, a TK-dependent increase in [Na+]i was prevented when the tubules were"

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are activated by static and dynamic compression of cartilage, which simultaneously induce intratissue fluid flow, pressure gradients, cell, and matrix deformation. First, to determine whether cell and matrix deformation alone could induce MAPK activation, we applied dynamic shear to bovine cartilage explants. Using Western blotting, we measured ERK1/2 and p38 activation at multiple time points over 24 h. Distinct activation time courses were observed for different MAPKs: a sustained 50% increase for ERK1/2 and a delayed increase in p38 of 180%. We then investigated the role of MAPK activation in mechano-induced chondrocyte gene expression. Cartilage explants were preincubated with inhibitors of ERK1/2 and p38 activation before application of 1–24 h of three distinct mechanical stimuli relevant to in vivo loading (50% static compression, 3% dynamic compression at 0.1 Hz, or 3% dynamic shear at 0.1 Hz). mRNA levels of selected genes involved in matrix homeostasis were measured using real-time PCR and analyzed by k-means clustering to characterize the time- and load-dependent effects of the inhibitors. Most genes examined required ERK1/2 and p38 activation to be regulated by these loading regimens, including matrix proteins aggrecan and type II collagen, matrix metalloproteinases MMP13, and ADAMTS5, and transcription factors downstream of the MAPK pathway, c-Fos, and c-Jun. Thus, we demonstrated that the MAPK pathway is a central conduit for transducing mechanical forces into biological responses in cartilage.

We then investigated the role of MAPK activation in mechano-induced chondrocyte gene expression. Cartilage explants were preincubated with inhibitors of ERK1/2 and p38 activation before application of 1–24 h of three distinct mechanical stimuli relevant to in vivo loading (50% static compression, 3% dynamic compression at 0.1 Hz, or 3% dynamic shear at 0.1 Hz). mRNA levels of selected genes involved in matrix homeostasis were measured using real-time PCR and analyzed by k-means clustering to characterize the time- and load-dependent effects of the inhibitors. Most genes examined required ERK1/2 and p38 activation to be regulated by these loading regimens, including matrix proteins aggrecan and type II collagen, matrix metalloproteinases MMP13, and ADAMTS5, and transcription factors downstream of the MAPK pathway, c-Fos, and c-Jun. Thus, we demonstrated that the MAPK pathway is a central conduit for transducing mechanical forces into biological responses in cartilage. In vitro models of chondrocyte mechanobiology relevant to physiological loading of cartilage in vivo have shown that biosynthesis and gene transcription of the major matrix proteins in cartilage are regulated by distinct tissue deformations (reviewed in Ref. 1Grodzinsky A.J.

Therefore, understanding the pathway(s) by which chondrocytes transduce mechanical forces into biological responses is of great importance to the treatment of osteoarthritis and to cartilage tissue engineering.

In cartilage explants, static compression can induce the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and p38 (17Fanning P.J. Emkey G. Smith R.J. Grodzinsky A.J. Szasz N.

ERK1/2, p38, and JNK are the central components of the MAPK cascade that coordinate incoming signals generated by a variety of extracellular and intracellular mediators in many cell types. The phosphorylation and activation of MAPKs transmits the signal down the cascade, resulting in the activation of many downstream regulatory proteins such as other protein kinases, transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, and other enzymes (for review (20Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Whitmarsh A.J. Gene. 2003; 320: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar)). In chondrocytes, the MAPKs are known to play an important role in response to inflammatory cytokines (21Berenbaum F. Curr. Opin.

For example, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α regulate the transcription and synthesis of a number of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (23Borden P. Solymar D. Sucharczuk A.

Interestingly, regulatory binding sites for transcription factors that are downstream targets of the MAPKs, such as activating protein-1, are present in the promoter regions of MMP1, MMP3, and MMP13 (22Vincenti M.P.

There is some evidence that the MAPK pathway may also mediate effects of anabolic growth factors in cartilage (such as insulin-like growth factor-1, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-β) (17Fanning P.J.

We have previously shown that mechanical loads applied to intact cartilage explants, which imitate different aspects of in vivo loading, regulate a number of genes involved in cartilage homeostasis, including matrix proteins, matrix proteases, TIMPs, transcription factors, and signaling molecules (6Fitzgerald J.B.

Using clustering techniques we demonstrated that genes responded in functionally related groups and in a specific time- and load-dependent manner, with a number of genes requiring calcium-activated pathways. Here we investigate the role of MAPK signaling in mechano-regulation of gene expression by utilizing real-time PCR, gene clustering techniques (38Alter O. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10101-10106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 39Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 8409-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and molecular inhibitors of ERK, p38, and protein synthesis. First, we confirm that ramp-and-hold static compression, which during the initial ramp phase contains aspects of dynamic compression such as fluid flow and pressure gradients, regulates ERK1/2 and p38. Then we demonstrate that dynamic shear, which induces purely cyclic matrix deformation with little or no fluid flow or pressure gradients, is capable of regulating ERK1/2 and p38 activation in a time-dependent fashion. Finally we show that MAPK activation is necessary for the induction of many genes in response to both compression and shear loading regimens. Cartilage Preparation and Mechanical Loading—Cartilage explants were harvested from the patello-femoral groove of 1–2-week-old bovine calves as described previously (41Lee J.H. Fitzgerald J.B. Dimicco M.A. Grodzinsky A.J. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 2386-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cylindrical explant disks (3-mm diameter, 1-mm thick) were taken from the middle zone layer, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and equilibrated for 2–5 days in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes buffer, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 20 μg/ml ascorbate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Medium was changed every second day and 16 h before the loading commenced. Anatomically matched explants were placed in 12-well polysulphone loading chambers to allow multiple explants to receive identical loading. One of following loading regimens was then applied (Fig. 1). Ramp-and-hold compression (6Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Dean D. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19502-19511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) involved applying a 50% strain (0.5 mm compression) slowly over a period of 5–10 min, and compression was then maintained statically for the indicated duration (Fig. 1, A and F). Explants, maintained in free swelling conditions, were used as controls for static compression. Dynamic compression (8Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24095-24103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) involved compressing explants slowly over a period of 5 min to an offset compression of 5%, allowing stress relaxation to occur for an additional 5 min, and then applying a continuous sinusoidal compression (0.1 Hz, 3% strain amplitude in axial displacement control) for the indicated duration (Fig. 1B). Explants statically compressed to a 5% offset were used as controls for dynamic compression. Dynamic shear (9Jin M. Frank E.H. Quinn T.M. Hunziker E.B. Grodzinsky A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) involved maintaining explants at cut thickness and applying a continuous sinusoidal shear strain (0.1 Hz, 3% strain amplitude in angular displacement control) for the indicated duration (Fig. 1, C and E). Explants maintained at cut thickness were used as controls. For dynamic shear dose-response experiments, anatomically matched cartilage explants were subjected to sinusoidal shear strain amplitudes of 1.5–4.5% at 0.1 Hz for 20 min or to 0% static compression control or free swelling conditions (Fig. 1D; 8–10 explants per condition). Upon loading completion, 4–6 explants that received identical loading and inhibitor treatments were pooled and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Inhibitor Treatment—To investigate the role of MAPK activation, cartilage explants were preincubated with small molecule inhibitors for 1 h before commencement of loading (inhibitors were also present in the medium during loading). U0126 (Sigma) is a highly potent MEK (ERK pathway) inhibitor and was used at 25 μm, a concentration equal to or greater than previously shown to inhibit ERK induced effects in chondrocytes (28Klooster A.R. Bernier S.M. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2005; 7: R127-R138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Liacini A. Sylvester J. Li W.Q. Huang W. Dehnade F. Ahmad M. Zafarullah M. Exp.

SB203580 (Sigma) is a p38 kinase activity blocker and was used at 20 μm, a concentration equal to or greater than previously shown to inhibit the effects of p38 activation in chondrocytes (31Mengshol J.A.

Four U0126 treated explants, four SB203580 treated explants, and four inhibitor-free explants were placed in a 12-well chamber and subjected to identical loading regimens. For comparison with previous results (6Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Dean D. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19502-19511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 8Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24095-24103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) static compression was applied for 2 or 24 h (Fig. 1A), or dynamic compression was applied for 1 or 24 h (Fig. 1B), or dynamic shear was applied for 1 or 24 h (Fig. 1C). Control explants were subjected to the same inhibitor treatments (see Fig. 1). Three to five experimental replicates were performed for each loading condition. To assess the impact of protein synthesis during mechanical loading, three separate experiments were performed in which explants were pretreated for 1 h with the protein synthesis blocker cycloheximide (100 μg/ml; Sigma). 50% static compression was then applied for 1, 16, or 24 h to examine the effects of blocking protein synthesis on short and long term mRNA expression (Fig. 1F). Explants not treated with cycloheximide were placed in the same loading chambers, and free swelling control explants were subjected to the same inhibitor treatments. Immunoblotting—After loading, frozen tissue specimens were first pulverized and then homogenized in Nonidet P-40 type homogenization buffer with protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 40 μg/ml leupeptin) used at 10 μl/mg of tissue. The supernatants were then extracted by rotating at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 h. Total protein concentration of each supernatant was quantified by the bicinchoninic acid method. For measurement of ERK1/2 and p38, aliquots containing 20 μg of protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at 37 °C and incubated with total or phospho-specific anti-ERK1/2 or anti-p38 antibody (1:1000) in TBST (Cell Signaling Technology. Inc.), overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed five times in TBST for 10 min, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed in TBST. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance™ ECL, NEN Life Science Products) and quantified using densitometry. For measuring MAPKAPK2, aliquots containing 40 μgof protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and were transferred to an Immun-blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with total or phospho-specific anti-MAPKAPK2 antibody 1:1000 in blocking solution (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times in TBST for 10 min, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed in TBST. Phosphorylated MAPKAPK2 were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus™, GE Healthcare). Real-time PCR—RNA extraction and real-time PCR were performed as described previously (6Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Dean D. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19502-19511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4–6 pooled, frozen cartilage explants were pulverized, lysed by blade homogenization in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and separated using phase-gel spin columns (Eppendorf). RNA was purified using the Qiagen RNeasy mini columns with the DNase digest, and 1–2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed with previously described primers (8Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24095-24103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) on a MJ Research Opticon 2 using Applied Biosystems SYBR Green reagents. Housekeeping genes (18 S & G3PDH) and control samples were run on every plate for normalization purposes. Cycle threshold levels were converted to relative copy numbers using primer specific standard curves. Expression levels from loaded samples were normalized to the average of the housekeeping genes and also to similarly treated control samples. Clustering and Statistical Analyses—Our previously described clustering technique was used to place genes with similar expression patterns into a predefined number of groups (6Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Dean D. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19502-19511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 8Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24095-24103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In brief, the average expression levels of each gene from each loading condition, duration, and MAPK inhibitor treatment were combined into expression vectors forming a data matrix of 17 genes by 18 conditions (3 loading regimens, 2 durations, 3 treatment conditions). Each gene expression vector was normalized by the vector standard deviation to emphasize the pattern of expression rather than overall magnitude. Principal component analysis was then used to reduce dimensionality and visualize the similarity between genes in a three-dimensional space, so that the number of distinct groups could be estimated. The three-dimensional gene coordinates were then iteratively clustered by minimizing the total Euclidean distance between the genes and corresponding group centroids. A second technique, applying k-means clustering to the entire gene expression vectors, was used to maximize the average gene-to-group centroid correlation. The optimal grouping was chosen based on both Euclidean distance and correlation metrics, and the group centroid was calculated as the average expression profile from the genes within a group. The top five suboptimal groupings were compared with the optimal grouping to ensure that the trends were robust. Distinct separation between group profiles was tested using the three-dimensional group coordinates and Student's t test (8Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24095-24103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Comparisons between inhibitor treated and non-treated mechanically induced gene expression levels were performed by two-tailed Student's t test. Expression levels from group centroids were similarly compared. Statistical significance was attributed for p < 0.05. MAPK Phosphorylation due to Mechanical Loading—Phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels in free swelling culture, 0% compression static control, and 1.5–4.5% shear strain amplitude at 0.1 Hz for 20 min loading were detected using phospho-specific antibodies. Three experiments for each condition were performed, and a representative blot is shown in Fig. 2A. The increase in the phosphorylated ERK1/2 level reached a maximum value at 3% shear strain and slightly decreased at 4.5% shear strain; therefore time course experiments were performed at the 3% shear strain, 0.1 Hz condition. Interestingly, there was a dramatic increase in the phosphorylated ERK1/2 level even at 0% compression over the free swelling condition (Fig. 2A). Consistent with our previous study (17Fanning P.J.

In contrast, 3% dynamic shear induced a consistent 25–50% increase in ERK1/2 activation, compared with activation levels in statically held control explants, over the entire 0.5–24 h period (Fig. 2B). 50% static compression increased p38 phosphorylation ∼3-fold within 2 h and remained elevated at 24 h (Fig. 2C), similar to our previous findings (17Fanning P.J.

In contrast to the ERK1/2 response to dynamic shear, dynamic shear-induced p38 phosphorylation was delayed, with an observed peak activation of ∼2-fold after 6 h and remained elevated at 24 h. As a control we tested whether MAPK inhibitors could prevent the mechanical loading-induced activation of ERK1/2 and p38 in chondrocytes within cartilage explants. In a previous study it was observed that 1 h of 50% static compression of explants, similar to that used in this study, strongly activated ERK1/2 and p38 (17Fanning P.J. Emkey G. Smith R.J.

We therefore used this loading protocol to test the inhibitory effects of U0126 and SB203580 (Fig. 2A). 1 h preincubation with U0126 prior to loading prevented the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 during loading (Fig. 2D); preincubation with SB203580 prevented the phosphorylation of MAPKAPK2 (D), a major downstream targe"

The role of S100A1 in skeletal muscle has been less well defined. Additionally, the precise molecular mechanism underlying S100A1 modulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in striated muscle has not been fully elucidated. Here, utilizing a genetic approach to knock out S100A1, we demonstrate a direct physiological role of S100A1 in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle. We show that the absence of S100A1 leads to decreased global myoplasmic Ca2+ transients following electrical excitation. Using high speed confocal microscopy, we demonstrate with high temporal resolution depressed activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in S100A1-/- muscle fibers. Through competition assays with sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles and through tryptophan fluorescence experiments, we also identify a novel S100A1-binding site on the cytoplasmic face of the intact ryanodine receptor that is conserved throughout striated muscle and corresponds to a previously identified calmodulin-binding site. Using a 12-mer peptide of this putative binding domain, we demonstrate low micromolar binding affinity to S100A1. NMR spectroscopy reveals this peptide binds within the Ca2+-dependent hydrophobic pocket of S100A1. Taken together, these data suggest that S100A1 plays a significant role in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling, primarily through specific interactions with a conserved binding domain of the ryanodine receptor. This warrants further investigation into the use of S100A1 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of both cardiac and skeletal myopathies.

The S100 family of proteins, so named because of their solubility in 100% ammonium sulfate, are small (16-26 kDa), acidic, Ca2+-binding proteins that possess no intrinsic enzymatic activity (1Moore B.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 19: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Instead, S100 proteins function through interaction with target proteins, usually via a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, to elicit biological responses (2Landar A. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Zimmer D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17429-17438Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At least 21 different S100 proteins are known in humans, and they are expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner (3Donato R. Int. J. Biochem.

S100A1 is most highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle and is present in lower levels in the brain (5Haimoto H. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The structures of both apoS100A1 and Ca2+-S100A1 have been solved via NMR spectroscopy techniques (6Wright N.T. Varney K.M.

These reveal that S100A1 exists as a homodimer, with each subunit consisting of two EF-hand motifs connected by a loop, termed the hinge region. When S100A1 binds to Ca2+, one of the EF hands, consisting of helices 3 and 4, undergoes a large conformational change, exposing a previously buried hydrophobic pocket made up of residues from the hinge region, helix 3, and helix 4 (6Wright N.T.

More recently, S100A1 has been linked to a protective role against cardiomyopathy; S100A1-/- mice demonstrate an increased incidence of heart failure in stressed hearts, and S100A1 expression levels are decreased in cardiomyopathic conditions (13Most P.

These and similar studies suggest a potential therapeutic role for S100A1 in the treatment of cardiomyopathy. However, the specifics of how S100A1 achieves this beneficial effect are uncertain; the precise region on RyR that S100A1 binds and whether this event is the basis for increased cardiomyocyte contraction have not been fully explored (16Pleger S.T.

Circulation. 2007; 115: 2506-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).Although a relatively large body of knowledge has accumulated about how S100A1 behaves in cardiac myocytes, skeletal muscle research has lagged behind. Addition of S100A1 has been shown to increase caffeine-evoked force transients in skinned skeletal muscle fibers (19Most P. Remppis A. Weber C. Bernotat J. Ehlermann P. Pleger S.T. Kirsch W. Weber M. Uttenweiler D. Smith G.L. Katus H.A. Fink R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26356-26364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). S100A1 has also been shown to bind the skeletal muscle RyR isoform (RyR1), to potentiate the open probability of RyR1 in lipid bilayer experiments, and to modulate ryanodine binding activity at high and low Ca2+ in SR terminal cisternae (20Treves S. Scutari E. Robert M. Groh S. Ottolia M. Prestipino G. Ronjat M. Zorzato F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11496-11503Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, S100A1 may regulate Ca2+ signaling and contractility through similar mechanisms of RyR modulation in cardiac and skeletal muscle. However, the particulars of how S100A1 alters the kinetics of Ca2+ release and the physiological relevance of this mechanism to excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscle have not been well studied.In an attempt to delve further into how S100A1 modulates EC coupling in skeletal muscle, we examined the effect of S100A1 on the electrically evoked Ca2+ transient in an endogenous experimental setting using enzymatically dissociated, intact, flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle fibers. We demonstrate here the novel finding that the Ca2+ transient following action potential (AP) stimulation is depressed in S100A1-/- skeletal muscle fibers. Using both whole cell epifluorescent and high speed confocal microscopy, we show that the peak amplitude of the Ca2+ transient and the rising rate of the Ca2+ transient are significantly decreased in the absence of S100A1. We also demonstrate rescue of this depressed Ca2+ release phenotype via adenoviral expression of S100A1 in S100A1-/- muscle fibers. To elucidate the biophysical interface between S100A1 and RyR1, we have performed competition experiments between calmodulin (CaM) and S100A1 on intact RyR1 in SR vesicles and located the CaM-binding site on RyR1 as an S100A1 interaction domain. Furthermore, we show that Ca2+-S100A1 binds to a peptide from this domain with low micromolar affinity. Utilizing NMR spectroscopy we have probed the molecular interaction between these two proteins on a residue by residue basis. Based on these data, we suggest that S100A1 regulates Ca2+ release through coupling to this discrete area on RyR. This domain of interest is conserved between RyR1 and RyR2, and thus we postulate that the molecular mechanism by which S100A1 modulates the Ca2+ release apparatus may be conserved between cardiac and skeletal muscle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials–All chemical reagents were ACS grade or higher and purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. All buffers were passed through Chelex-100 resin (Bio-Rad) to remove trace metals. Perdeuterated Tris, d11-Tris (1 m solution in D2O >98.7 atom % deuterium) was purchased from C/D/N Isotopes Inc. (Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada), and D2O (100.0 at % deuterium) was purchased from Aldrich. 15NH4Cl (>99%) and 13C-labeled glucose were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Woburn, MA).Generation of S100A1-/- Mice–Hybridization screening was used to isolate an EcoRI fragment containing the S100A1 gene from a P1 mouse 129 genomic DNA library (Genome Systems, St. Louis). The targeting vector was constructed by replacing a portion of the S100A1 locus with a DNA cassette containing a bacterial β-galactosidase reporter gene with a nuclear localization signal and a neomycin resistance gene under the control of a phosphoglycerokinase promoter (Fig. 1A). The β-galactosidase reporter gene coding sequence was inserted in-frame at the A8 codon in exon 2 of the S100A1 gene. The targeting vector was electroporated into W4/129S6 embryonic stem cells (Taconic Farms Inc., Germantown, NY), and drug-resistant colonies were selected by growth in G418-containing media (21Matise M.P. Auerbach W. Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2000Google Scholar). Colonies containing homologous recombination events were identified by Southern blot analysis using a BamHI/SmaI fragment located outside the targeting construct (Fig. 1B). Gene-targeted clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts (The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), and the resulting chimeric male offspring were mated with C57BL/6 females to obtain S100A1+/- progeny. The line was maintained on a mixed C57BL/6-129S6 line. All procedures and breeding were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals and institutional regulations at Texas A&M University.Genotyping–Tail biopsies were digested in proteinase K mixture (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 75 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K). After phenol/chloroform (1:1 v/v) extraction, genomic DNAs were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in water. The same Southern strategy that was used to identify homologous recombination events in embryonic stem cells was used to identify F1 founders. Subsequent generations were genotyped using a three-allele PCR strategy. Amplification of a 500-bp product using PCR primers for the mouse β-casein gene (forward primer 5′ GAT GTG CTC CAG GCT AAA GTT 3′ and reverse primer 5′ AGA AAC GGA ATG TTG TGG AGT 3′) was used to assess genomic DNA quality. Amplification of an 800-bp band using oligonucleotide primers for the β-galactosidase reporter gene (forward primer 5′ GAC ACC AGA CCA ACT GGT AGC GAC 3′ and reverse primer 5′ GCA TCG AGC TGG GTA ATA AGG GTT GGC AAT 3′) indicated the presence of a mutated allele. Amplification of a 1300-bp band using oligonucleotide primers for the wild type S100A1 gene (forward primer 5′ CAG TTT GTA GCA GGT CTT TCA GCT C 3′ and reverse primer 5′ AAA CAC AAA CCA GCC CTA GCC TGC TCC 3′) indicated the presence of a wild type allele. All PCR programs consisted of a 5-min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min and a final extension step consisting of 72 °C for 7 min.FDB Fiber Preparation–Fibers were prepared using enzymatic dissociation of FDB muscles of 4-6-week-old C57 × 129 WT and S100A1 KO mice and were cultured as described previously (22Liu Y. Kranias E.G. Schneider M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1915-C1924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six mouse pairs from four different litters were used to ensure robustness and meaningful statistical significance. Isolated fibers were cultured on laminin-coated glass bottom Petri dishes. Fibers were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After ∼24 h in MEM, fiber culture medium was changed to 2 ml of Ringer's solution (135 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm glucose, 1.8 mm CaCl2).Immunocytochemistry and Analysis–Following enzymatic dissociation and ∼24 h in culture, fibers were rinsed three times in Ringer's solution at room temperature. Fibers were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 4% normal horse serum. Subsequently fibers were incubated for 48 h at 4 °C with either mouse monoclonal antibody against S100A1 (1:200; Sigma) or goat monoclonal antibody against RyR (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). This was followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-goat or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), respectively. These chambers were then mounted to an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with an Olympus FluoView 500 laser scanning confocal imaging system, using an excitation wavelength of 488 or 543 nm. Fibers were viewed with an Olympus 60×/1.2 NA water immersion objective and scanned at ×4 zoom using constant laser power. The gain between the knock-out and wild type S100A1 staining was kept constant. Background fluorescence and noise filtering of images were performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).Indo-1AM Ratiometric Recordings–Cultured fibers were transferred to Ringer's solution and loaded for 30 min with 1 μm Indo-1 AM in 0.1% Me2SO, rinsed three times with Ringer's solution, and equilibrated for 30 min before recording. The culture chamber was mounted on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope and viewed with an Olympus 60×/1.20 NA water immersion objective. Fibers were illuminated at 360 nm, and the fluorescence emitted at 405 and 485 nm was detected simultaneously. The emission signal was digitized and sampled repetitively at 0.5-ms intervals with the data collection program LabView 7.1 (National Instruments, Austin, TX), and the fluorescence ratio F405/F485 was calculated. Two parallel platinum electrodes were used to stimulate fibers with a single pulse of 1-ms duration. The stimulation voltage was adjusted to give observed fiber contraction in all cases (10-12 V). Selection criteria for fibers analyzed included morphological integrity, consistent response to twitch stimulation, and reproducibility of transient responses. Fibers were stimulated three times, and responses were averaged. Analysis of emission ratio recordings was performed using OriginPro 7.5.Adenoviral Expression of S100A1-GFP–Both adenoviral constructs (Ad-GFP, Ad-S100A1) were graciously supplied by Walter J. Koch, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia. Generation of these constructs has been described previously (15Most P. Pleger S.T. Volkers M. Heidt B. Boerries M. Weichenhan D. Loffler E.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼24 h following enzymatic dissociation of FDB fibers, WT and KO dishes received 20 μl of Ad-S100A1 or Ad-GFP in MEM without serum. Fibers were incubated for 1 h with adenovirus, and then the medium was changed to MEM containing both fetal bovine serum and gentamicin to stop infection and for continuous culture. 48 h following infection fibers were imaged on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope with 470 ± 10 nm excitation filter and 505LP emission filter to detect GFP fluorescence.Fluo-4 AM Fluorescence Recordings–Cultures were loaded with 2 μm Fluo-4 AM in 0.1% Me2SO for 30 min, rinsed three times with Ringer's solution, and equilibrated for 30 min before recording. The culture chamber was mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope on a Zeiss LSM 5 Live confocal system and viewed with a ×63, NA water immersion objective. Excitation was provided by a 488 nm 100-milliwatt diode laser with emission collected using an LP 505 filter. Fibers were stimulated as detailed above at a set time after the start of a confocal scan. Fibers were selected based on the above inclusion criteria as well as an additional criterion of minimum fiber movement in the line scan plane to prevent movement artifacts in recordings. The confocal system was operated in line scan x-t mode, with images collected at either 50 or 100 μs/line for 500-ms acquisition time using Zeiss LSM 5 live software. Three trials were taken for each fiber at each of two regions of interest. In separate experiments, fibers were imaged on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope using a 60×/1.20 NA water immersion objective coupled to a Bio-Rad Cell Map laser scanning confocal system. The system was again operated in line scan x-t mode at a scanning speed of 2 ms/line for 512 ms. Line scan images were processed and fluorescent recordings were converted to ΔF/Fo. Images were then analyzed using OriginPro 7.5 to characterize the rising and decaying phase of the fluorescence recording.Statistical Analysis–All statistical analysis was performed using OriginPro7.5. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise noted. Normality of data sets was ensured for each statistical calculation. All significance tests were done using Student's t test, and significance was set at p < 0.05.Isolation of SR Vesicles–SR was isolated from a New Zealand White rabbit. The method of MacLennan (24MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4508-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used with some modifications. Following euthanasia, white muscle from hind legs and back of the rabbit was isolated, cut into small pieces, and transferred into a working buffer containing NaCl (120 mm), imidazole (10 mm), DTT (0.1 mm), and EGTA (0.1 mm) at pH 7.4 in the presence of the protease inhibitor leupeptin. The muscle was blended into a fine homogenate and centrifuged in a large Fiberlite F10-6x500y GSA rotor for 10 min at 3300 rpm. The fat layer at the top of the centrifuge tubes was removed, and the supernatant was strained through four layers of cheesecloth. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7.4 with dry imidazole. Mitochondria were removed by centrifuging the supernatant at 7700 rpm for 15 min in the Fiberlite GSA rotor. This supernatant was centrifuged in a Beckman Ti-19 rotor at 19,000 rpm for 70 min. The resulting pellet was transferred into a homogenizer. Myosin was removed by spinning the homogenate in a Ti-50.2 rotor at 10,500 rpm for 10 min. The final spin yielded SR pellets by spinning the supernatant in a Ti-50.2 rotor at 32,000 rpm for 30 min. SR pellets were transferred into a homogenizer and resuspended using a resuspension buffer (100 mm KCl and 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.0) to a final working concentration of 13.0 mg/ml protein.Western Blots–5 μl of CaM-linked agarose beads (Sigma) were washed three times with binding buffer that included bovine serum albumin (15 μm), NaCl (50 mm), CaCl2 (100 nm to 2mm), TES (5 mm), pH 7.5. Higher bovine serum albumin and NaCl concentrations, along with 1 mm MgCl2, were also tested and did not affect the outcome of the experiments. Various concentrations of S100A1 or CaM were added to the beads and mixed with 2 μl of the SR vesicle preparation for a final volume of 50 μl. After a 2-h incubation period at 4 °C, the solutions were spun down; the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed three times in the binding buffer including the appropriate amounts of S100A1 or CaM. The beads were then boiled, run on a 4-12% acrylamide gel for 3 h, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. A mouse anti-RyR monoclonal antibody (34C) (1:5000; Alexis, San Diego) was used to visualize the RyR band, which was observed to run on the gel with a molecular weight of ∼550 kDa. ImageJ software was used to quantify the intensity of each band.Tryptophan Fluorescence–Ca2+-S100A1 was added slowly toa20 μm RyRP12 peptide solution containing 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 15 mm DTT, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.2, at 37 °C. Fluorescence intensity was monitored during the titrations upon complex formation using excitation at 280 nm and measuring the tryptophan emission at 350 nm.S100A1 NMR Sample Preparation–The RyRP12 peptide (KKAVWHKLLSKQ) was purified via high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (25Rustandi R.R.

Unlabeled, 15N-, and 13C,15N-labeled S100A1 protein was purified using standard purification procedures (6Wright N.T. Varney K.M. Ellis K.C. Markowitz J. Gitti R.K. Zimmer D.B. Weber D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 410-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The identity and purity of S100A1 were confirmed by amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry. The samples used for NMR spectroscopy were passed through an additional G-25 gel filtration column, and the final NMR sample contained 13C,15N-labeled or 15N-labeled S100A1 (0.5-1.0 mm), unlabeled RyRP12 peptide (1.0-3.0 mm), d11-Tris pH 7.2 (20 mm), CaCl2 (10 mm), NaN3 (0.35 mm), NaCl (20 mm), DTT (20 mm), and D2O (10%). Samples prepared in this manner were stable for at least 2 weeks at 37 °C as judged by no changes in their NMR spectra.NMR Spectroscopy–NMR spectra were collected at 37 °C with a Bruker DMX600 NMR spectrometer (600.13 MHz for protons) and a Bruker AVANCE 800 NMR spectrometer (800.27 MHz for protons) equipped with four frequency channels and a triple-resonance z axis gradient 5 mm cryogenic probe head. Unless otherwise stated, multidimensional NMR data were collected in the indirect dimensions using States-TPPI phase cycling using a 1-s relaxation delay (26Marion D. Driscoll P.C. Kay L.E. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). For most experiments, initial delays in the indirect dimension were set to give zero- and first-order phase corrections of 90 and 180°, respectively (27Spera S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5490-5492Crossref Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Sequential backbone and side chain assignments of S100A1 were obtained using standard heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy as described previously (28Baldisseri D.M. Rustandi R.R. Zhang Z. Tang C. Bair C.L. Landar A. Landar A. Zimmer D.B. Weber D.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In general, pulse field gradients were included to purge undesired transverse magnetization, and the WATERGATE technique was used in most cases to suppress the solvent signal in samples dissolved in H2O. In samples dissolved in D2O, low power pre-saturation of the HDO resonance was used. The backbone coupling constants (3JNH-Hα) of S100A1 were measured using the HNHA experiment and evaluated as described (29Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Biomol.

The 13C and 15N chemical shifts were indirectly referenced using the following ratios of the zero-point frequencies at 37 °C: 0.10132905 for 15N-1H and 0.25144953 for 13C-1H (31Spera S. Ikura M.

A functional proteomics approach utilizing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry was employed to identify differentially expressed proteins in response to T cell activation. Two members of the prohibitin family of proteins, Phb1 and Phb2, were determined to be up-regulated 4–5-fold upon activation of primary human T cells. Furthermore, their expression was dependent upon CD3 and CD28 signaling pathways that synergistically led to the up-regulation (13–15-fold) of Phb1 and Phb2 mRNA levels as early as 48 h after activation. Additionally, orthophosphate labeling coupled with phosphoamino acid analysis identified Phb1 to be serine and Phb2 serine and tyrosine phosphorylated. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Phb2 was mapped to Tyr248 using mass spectrometry and confirmed by mutagenesis and phosphospecific antibodies. In contrast to previous reports of Phb1 and Phb2 being nuclear localized, subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescent, and electron microscopy revealed both proteins to localize to the mitochondrial inner membrane of human T cells. Accordingly, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Phbs in Kit225 cells resulted in disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, Phb1 and Phb2 protein levels were up-regulated 2.5-fold during cytokine deprivation-mediated apoptosis of Kit225 cells, suggesting this complex plays a protective role in human T cells. Taken together, Phb1 and Phb2 are novel phosphoproteins up-regulated during T cell activation that function to maintain mitochondrial integrity and thus represent previously unrecognized therapeutic targets for regulating T cell activation, differentiation, viability, and function.

Complete activation of T cells requires three threshold-limited sequential signals. Naïve T cells receive induction signals through engagement of the T cell receptor complex (TCR/CD3) via specific antigens (signal 1). This signal is amplified by co-stimulatory molecules such as B7-1/CD28 (signal 2), which promotes the synthesis and secretion of cytokines, which activate cell surface receptors (signal 3) to drive clonal expansion and functional differentiation. Each extracellular signal induces an intracellular cascade of tyrosine, serine, threonine, and lipid kinases. Early TCR signaling is mediated by the tyrosine kinase p56lck, which phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs within the cytoplasmic domains of the TCR subunits (1Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 2Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A.

These phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs recruit Zap70, which in turn propagates the signal by phosphorylating multiple proteins including linker of activated T cells (4Wange R.L. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein acts as a scaffold to recruit a number of downstream signaling molecules, including Grb2 to drive Ras signaling (5Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), and phospholipase C-γ1 to produce inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol from the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (6Finco T.S.

These effector pathways ultimately promote activation of key T cell transcription factors (NFAT via inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, NF-κB via diacylglycerol, and AP-1 via Ras) to regulate the expression of genes required for proliferation and differentiation including interleukin 2 (IL-2), 2The abbreviations used are: IL-2interleukin 2ConAconcanavalin AJakJanus tyrosine kinaseLATlinker of activated T cellsPBMCperipheral blood mononuclear cellsPHAphytohemagglutininPhbprohibitinPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionTCRT cell receptorFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasePBSphosphate-buffered salineRTreverse transcriptaseMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightsiRNAsmall interfering RNAPIphosphatidylinositolPARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseWTwild type. which serves as an auto-crine growth factor (8Lowenthal J.W.

Signaling from IL-2 through its receptor is primarily delivered by two molecular families, namely Janus tyrosine kinases (Jaks) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATS) (10Ross J.A.

Additionally, the IL-2 receptor α chain (CD25), which is required for a high affinity IL2R complex, is also up-regulated upon T cell activation (14Dang N.H. Torimoto Y. Shimamura K. Tanaka T. Daley J.F. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2825-2832PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have provided a molecular rationale for therapeutic strategies targeting the IL-2 signaling pathway to treat lymphoid-derived diseases (15Stepkowski S.M. Kao J. Wang M.E. Tejpal N. Podder H. Furian L. Dimmock J. Jha A. Das U. Kahan B.D. Kirken R.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4236-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Additional insight into other proteins up-regulated or phosphorylated during T cell activation will likely harbor yet to be realized therapeutic strategies. To identify these potential regulatory proteins, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry have been critical. Using these technologies, we have identified the highly conserved prohibitin (Phb) family of proteins, Phb1 and Phb2, to be differentially expressed upon T cell activation. The Phbs have been found in multiple cellular compartments and possess diverse functions ranging from acting as scaffolding proteins at the plasma membrane to transcriptional regulators in the nucleus. Phb2 was originally identified as a B cell receptor-associated protein termed Bap37 (16Terashima M. Kim K.M. Adachi T. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. Kohler G. Lamers M.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3782-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). More recently, Phb1 was shown to be required for activation of c-Raf by Ras in modulating epithelial cell adhesion and migration, thus providing evidence for a signaling component to the Phb mechanism of action (17Rajalingam K. Wunder C. Brinkmann V. Churin Y. Hekman M. Sievers C. Rapp U.R. Rudel T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Conversely, Phb nuclear localization has been described in a variety of cell lines predominantly from breast and prostate cancers (18Fusaro G. Dasgupta P. Rastogi S. Joshi B. Chellappan S. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2996-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Prohibitins were shown to modulate the transcriptional activity of various transcription factors, including steroid hormone receptors, either directly or through interactions with chromatin remodeling proteins (20Wang S.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2293-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, numerous studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans suggest the evolutionarily conserved Phb mechanism of action is as chaperone proteins in mitochondria, which has been extensively reviewed (2Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 23Nijtmans L.G. Artal S.M. Grivell L.A. Coates P.J. Cell Mol.

Biol. 1997; 7: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is worth noting that Phb1 and Phb2 null yeast strains have a reduced lifespan (25Coates P.J. Jamieson D.J. Smart K. Prescott A.R. Hall P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, higher eukaryotes are more dependent upon their presence, suggesting enhanced biological function(s). For example, the Phb homologue in Drosophila is reported to be in a lethal complementation group (26Eveleth Jr., D.D. Marsh J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6169-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and genetic deletion of Phb1 or Phb2 in mice is lethal before embryonic day 9.0, implying these proteins play a critical role in the early stages of development (27Park S.E.

Katzenellenbogen B.S. Lydon J.P. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 10.1210/me.2007-0400Google Scholar). Little is known about the Phb family in lymphocytes. Phb1 has been proposed to inhibit cell proliferation and to promote differentiation of lymphocytes. Indeed, its expression is increased during pregnancy-associated thymic involution with a pattern of limited tissue distribution localized to the medulla of the thymus that primarily contains only mature, non-proliferating thymocytes (29Dixit V.D. Sridaran R. Edmonsond M.A. Taub D. Thompson W.E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1496-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The present study sought to identify proteins differentially expressed upon T cell activation. Evidence is provided that Phb1 and Phb2 form a phosphocomplex in the mitochondrial inner membrane of primary human T cells. Furthermore, functional analysis reveals that this complex is required for mitochondrial homeostasis that may be critical for differentiated T cell survival. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from buffy coats obtained from the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Bank or WBF2 filters (Pall Corporation) obtained from El Paso United Blood Services and purified by isocentrifugation (Ficoll-Hypaque). PBMCs were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (complete RPMI). Explanted normal human T lymphocytes (3 × 106/ml) were activated for 72 h using one of the following agents: anti-CD3-coated 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) in the presence or absence of soluble anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml), phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (10 μg/ml), concanavalin A (ConA) (10 μg/ml), or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (100 nm) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml). CD3+ T cells were purified by negative selection (R&D Systems) and their purity and activation status determined by flow cytometry (Cytomics FC500, Beckman Coulter) using directly conjugated anti-CD3-PE and anti-CD25-FITC, respectively.

Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were obtained by hypotonic lysis as previously described (34Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Xu J. DaSilva L. Erwin R.A. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Rui H. Farrar W.L. J. Biol.

For subcellular fractionation, activated primary human T cells (2 × 108) were suspended in isotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm potassium chloride, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 250 mm sucrose, 1.0 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and mechanically disrupted with passage through a 30-gauge needle until >90% were trypan blue positive. Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to obtain the soluble cytoplasmic (supernatant) and mitochondrial (pellet) fractions. For whole cell lysis, frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice and solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 containing lysis buffer as previously described (11Kirken R.A. Rui H. Malabarba M.G. Howard O.M. Kawamura M. O'Shea J.J. Farrar W.L. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (35Kirken R.A. Erwin R.A. Taub D. Murphy W.J. Behbod F. Wang L. Pericle F. Farrar W.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A novel and specific affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against the extreme C-terminal 15 amino acids of human Phb2. Monoclonal anti-Phb1 (Molecular Probes), anti-actin (Sigma), anti-GAPDH (Research Diagnostics), and the affinity purified anti-Phb2 were used at a dilution of 1/1000 for Western blot. For all samples, total protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). First Dimension Separation–CD3+ naïve or PHA-activated whole cell lysates (500 μg) were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid and washed twice with cold acetone before dissolving in sample rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2% Triton X-100, 0.2% carrier ampholytes (pH 3–10), and 0.001% bromphenol blue). Lysates were loaded onto 7-cm IPG ReadyStrips (Bio-Rad) through passive rehydration overnight at room temperature. Following rehydration, these proteins were isoelectrically focused on the Bio-Rad Protean IEF Cell with the following step protocol: 250 V for 15 min, 4000 V for 150 min, and maintained at 4000 V for a total of 10,000 V-h. ReadyStrip IPG strips were stored at –80 °C until second dimension processing. Second Dimension Separation–IPG ReadyStrips from the first dimension separation were equilibrated in succession with buffer I (375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 130 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) and buffer II (375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 135 mm iodoacetamide, 20% glycerol) for 10 min each. The IPG strips were then washed in Tris glycine SDS running buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, pH 8.3), secured on top of 12% SDS-PAGE gels using low melting point agarose, and electrophoresed at 200 V for 1 h. The resulting gels were stained using the mass spectrometry compatible Silver Stain Plus kit from Bio-Rad according to the manufacturer's protocol and gel images collected in a 16-bit grayscale format using an Epson 1680 Professional dual bed scanner at 600 dpi resolution. Protein spots of interest were excised and submitted to the Center for Functional Genomics (University at Albany) or the Border Biomedical Research Center Biomolecule Analysis Core Facility (University of Texas, El Paso) for identification following their standard procedure. PBMCs were plated at a concentration of 3 × 105 cell per well in either uncoated or anti-CD3-coated 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) in the presence or absence of anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml). Total RNA was isolated from ∼5 × 106 cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), DNase treated, and reverse transcribed (100 ng, 50 °C for 30 min, Superscript II; Invitrogen) with specific reverse primers. Quantification based on real-time monitoring of amplification was determined using a Bio-Rad IQ5 with SYBR Green dye. Absolute numbers of mRNA molecules were normalized to 18 S rRNA to correct for RNA concentration differences. Samples were run in triplicates with one control reaction containing no reverse transcriptase enzyme to test for potential DNA contamination. Values of transcripts in unknown samples were obtained by interpolating threshold cycle (PCR cycle number at threshold) values on a standard curve. Standard curves were prepared from known amounts of purified, PCR-amplified amplicon. Primer sets for human Phb1 and Phb2 were as follows: Phb1 forward, GGAGGCGTGGTGAACTCTG; Phb1 reverse, CTGGCACATTACGTGGTCGAG; Phb2 forward, CTTGGTTCCAGTACCCCATTATC; Phb2 reverse, CGAGACAACACTCGCAGGG. Primer sets for human CD25 (ID number 4557667a1) were obtained from PrimerBank. For confocal microscopy, primary human T cells were cyto-centrifuged and fixed on glass slides with cold methanol and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Immunofluorescent staining was performed at room temperature. Slides were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum for 1 h, and incubated with either mouse monoclonal anti-Phb1 (Neomarkers), and affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Phb2 for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS-T (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) and incubated with secondary Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody or Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at a 1:50 dilution. After three washes in PBS-T and one wash with deionized water, slides were mounted in FluorSave mounting medium (Calbiochem), and imaged with a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope using a ×63 oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss) in the multitrack scanning mode with excitation wavelengths set at 488 (Argon laser), 543, and 633 nm (HeNe lasers); emission wavelengths were 505 to 530 nm and >560 nm for Cy2 and Cy3 signal detection, respectively. Collected images were processed using LSM Image Browser (Carl Zeiss) and exported in a 12-bit TIFF RGB format. For immunoelectron microscopy, naïve or PHA-activated primary human T cells (5 × 105) were pelleted with agar at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature and fixed with modified Karnovsky solution (2% paraformaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde in 120 mm Millonig phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and 50 mm potassium ferricyanide, washed, dehydrated with a series of ethanol gradients and acetone, and embedded in Poly/Bed 812 resin mixture. The resin was polymerized for 72 h at 60 °C. Ultrathin sections (60–90 nm) were obtained using a Leica Ultracut R microtome with a Microstar diamond knife. Immunogold labeling was performed at room temperature. The sections were treated with 10% sodium periodate for 15 min and 50 mm glycine for 30 min to remove resin and block residual aldehyde groups, respectively. After three washes with PBS, sections were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum for 1 h and incubated with 1:50 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-Phb1 (Neomarkers) and 1:50 dilution of affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Phb2 for 1 h. The sections were washed five times with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS and incubated with secondary 6-nm gold particle-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody or 12-nm golf particle-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at a 1:50 dilution. Post-fixation was performed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 5 min. The sections were post-stained using the Kai Chien procedure with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynold's (36Reynolds E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17746) Google Scholar) lead citrate for 6 min each. The sections were observed using a Zeiss EM-10 transmission electron microscope operating at 60–80 kV in the Border Biomedical Research Center Analytical Cytology Core Facility (University of Texas, El Paso). Photographs were obtained with Kodak SO-163 film, and negatives were scanned with a Nikon Super Coolscan 5000 ED scanner to obtain digital images. Naïve and PHA-activated primary human T cells and Kit225 cells were metabolically labeled with 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) overnight at 37 °C. The cells were lysed and Phb2 was immunoprecipitated as described above. The corresponding proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue R-250 stain (Bio-Rad) and autoradiography, excised, and subjected to limited hydrolysis in 6 n HCl at 100 °C for 30 min. The samples were then dried and resuspended in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid:acetic acid:water at 50:156:1794 ratio) containing 1 μg of phosphoamino acid standards. The samples were spotted on a thin layer cellulose-acetate gel and electrophoresis was performed in the first dimension at 1500 V for 30 min in pH 1.9 buffer and in the second dimension at 1300 V for 15 min in pH 3.9 buffer (pyridine:acetic acid:water at 10:100: 1890 ratio) using the Hunter Thin Layer Electrophoresis apparatus. Standards were visualized with ninhydrin and radiolabeled samples detected by autoradiography. Phosphopeptide mapping of immunoaffinity purified Phb2 by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed by the proteomics core facility at the Center for Functional Genomics (University at Albany). A rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated (Sigma Genosys) against the Phb2 phosphopeptide, CKNPGpYIKLR. Anti-Phb2 Tyr(P)248 antiserum was purified through negative selection using the corresponding non-phosphopeptide. The affinity purified anti-Phb2 Tyr(P)248 was diluted to 100 μg/ml and a 1:5000 dilution with overnight incubation at room temperature was used for Western blot analysis. For peptide competition assays, a 1:5000 dilution of anti-Phb2 Tyr(P)248 was incubated with 100–500 μm of either Phb2 Tyr(P)248 phosphopeptide or non-phosphopeptide for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were then cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The resulting supernatant was used to Western blot Phb2 immunoprecipitate from human T cells. Phb2 was PCR amplified from mRNA purified from the tumor T cell line, Kit225. The pLenti6/V5-d-TOPO-Phb2-WT was constructed by subcloning Phb2 cDNA from pcDNA3.1-Phb2 donor plasmid using TOPO technology. The Phb2 Y248F mutant was prepared using the QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primer (sense strand) was used for Phb2 Y248F mutation: 5′-AGCAAGAACCCTGGCTTCATCAAACTTCGCAAG-3′. Before use, subclones and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The pLenti6-Phb2WT-V5 (2.5 μg) or pLenti6-Phb2Y248F-V5 (2.5 μg) plasmid transfections were performed in Kit225 (5 × 106) cells using Amaxa nucleofection technology using protocol X-001 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 36 h post-nucleofection and total cell lysates or anti-V5 (Invitrogen) immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described above. Phb1 (SMARTpool catalog number M-010530-00) and Phb2 (SMARTpool catalog number M-018703-00) specific siRNA as well as control non-targeting (siControl pool catalog number D-001206-13) siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon. Transfection of Kit225 cells was carried out by electroporation using the Nucleofection system by Amaxa. Briefly, Kit225 cells (5 × 106) were suspended in 100 μl of transfection solution V and transfected with 1.5 μg of Phb1, Phb2, or control siRNA using the X-001 program. Transfected cells were immediately diluted with pre-warmed complete RPMI containing IL-2 (100 IU/ml) and cultured for the time indicated. Mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed using the lipophilic cation 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (DePsipher, R&D Systems). Kit225 cells (1 × 106) were electroporated alone or with control non-targeting siRNA (500 nm) or Phb1/Phb2 siRNA (250 nm each) and cultured for 36 h. The potassium ionophore valinomycin was used as a positive control for disruption of ΔΨm. Kit225 cells (1 × 106) were treated with valinomycin (100 nm) for 6 h at 37 °Cand 5% CO2. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, resuspended in DePsipher reagent (5 μg/ml), and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, and fluorescence observed by flow cytometry (Cytomics FC500, Beckman Coulter) and quantitated with CXP analysis software version 2.2 (Beckman Coulter). Kit225 cells (1 × 106) were washed with PBS and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of Annexin-V-FLUOS staining solution (for 10 assays, 20 μl of Annexin V-Fluorescein, and 20 μl of PI in 1000 μl of HEPES buffer) (Roche) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Stained cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry (Cytomics FC500, Beckman Coulter) and quantitated with CXP analysis software version 2.2 (Beckman Coulter) using 488-nm excitation and 515-nm band pass filter for fluorescein detection and a filter >600 nm for PI detection. Additionally, caspase activation was determined by detection of PARP degradation by Western blot analysis with rabbit polyclonal anti-PARP (Cell Signaling). Proteomic Identification of Phb2 as a Differentially Expressed Protein during T Cell Activation–In an effort to identify differentially expressed proteins during T cell activation, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry was employed. Lysates from primary human naïve or PHA activated CD3+ T cells were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and visualized with silver stain. Landmark spots were selected to confirm equal loading and proper gel alignment. Several proteins were differentially expressed upon T cell activation including a 37-kDa protein, with a pI of 9.0, was great"
https://openalex.org/W2035909509,"CYP130 is one of the 20 Mycobacterium tuberculosis cytochrome P450 enzymes, only two of which, CYP51 and CYP121, have so far been studied as individually expressed proteins. Here we characterize a third heterologously expressed M. tuberculosis cytochrome P450, CYP130, by UV-visible spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and x-ray crystallography, including determination of the crystal structures of ligand-free and econazole-bound CYP130 at a resolution of 1.46 and 3.0A(,) respectively. Ligand-free CYP130 crystallizes in an ""open"" conformation as a monomer, whereas the econazole-bound form crystallizes in a ""closed"" conformation as a dimer. Conformational changes enabling the ""open-closed"" transition involve repositioning of the BC-loop and the F and G helices that envelop the inhibitor in the binding site and reshape the protein surface. Crystal structure analysis shows that the portion of the BC-loop relocates as much as 18A between the open and closed conformations. Binding of econazole to CYP130 involves a conformational change and is mediated by both a set of hydrophobic interactions with amino acid residues in the active site and coordination of the heme iron. CYP130 also binds miconazole with virtually the same binding affinity as econazole and clotrimazole and ketoconazole with somewhat lower affinities, which makes it a plausible target for this class of therapeutic drugs. Overall, binding of the azole inhibitors is a sequential two-step, entropy-driven endothermic process. Binding of econazole and clotrimazole exhibits positive cooperativity that may reflect a propensity of CYP130 to associate into a dimeric structure."

The essential function of yFACT is not disrupted by deletion of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Spt16 or by mutation of the middle domain of Pob3, but either alteration makes yeast cells sensitive to DNA replication stress. We have determined the structure of the Spt16 NTD and find evidence for a conserved potential peptide-binding site. Pob3-M also contains a putative binding site, and we show that these two sites perform an overlapping essential function. We find that yFACT can bind the N-terminal tails of some histones and that this interaction is important for yFACT-nucleosome binding. However, neither the Spt16 NTD nor a key residue in the putative Pob3-M-binding site was required for interactions with histone N termini or for yFACT-mediated nucleosome reorganization in vitro. Instead, both potential binding sites interact functionally with the C-terminal docking domain of the histone H2A. yFACT therefore appears to make multiple contacts with different sites within nucleosomes, and these interactions are partially redundant with one another. The docking domain of H2A is identified as an important participant in maintaining stability during yFACT-mediated nucleosome reorganization, suggesting new models for the mechanism of this activity. yFACT (heterodimers of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt16-Pob3 combined with Nhp6) binds to and alters the properties of nucleosomes.

Reorganization activity therefore appears to be important in a range of chromatin-based processes, including initiation and elongation of transcription, establishment and maintenance of normal chromatin, and survival during DNA replication stress. Consistent with this broad functional importance, FACT family members have been found in all eukaryotes examined, and at least one of the subunits is essential for viability in all cases reported (9Malone E.A.

Altering this patch caused increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea (HU) (23VanDemark A.P. Blanksma M. Ferris E. Heroux A. Hill C.P. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22 (Correction (2007) Mol.

This suggests that the Pob3-M domain contributes to a binding interaction that is of increased importance when yeast cells encounter replication stress. Consistent with a role as a protein-binding module, Pob3-M was shown to interact physically and genetically with Rfa1 (23VanDemark A.P. Blanksma M. Ferris E. Heroux A. Hill C.P. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22 (Correction (2007) Mol. Cell 27, 171-172): 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), a subunit of the eukaryotic single-stranded DNA binding factor RPA. yFACT and RPA appear to have overlapping functions in a process that affects nucleosome deposition during DNA replication (23VanDemark A.P. Blanksma M. Ferris E. Heroux A. Hill C.P. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22 (Correction (2007) Mol. Cell 27, 171-172): 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, mutations in the conserved putative interaction surface on Pob3-M did not disrupt the yFACT-RPA interaction in vitro (23VanDemark A.P. Blanksma M. Ferris E. Heroux A. Hill C.P. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22 (Correction (2007) Mol. Cell 27, 171-172): 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Pob3-M may therefore have multiple binding partners, with each interaction contributing to different functions of yFACT in different contexts.The N-terminal domain (NTD) of Spt16 forms an independent structural unit (16O'Donnell A.F.

Surprisingly, although this domain is conserved among all known Spt16 homologs, it is not essential for viability in yeast cells, although it is required for normal growth in the presence of high levels of HU (16O'Donnell A.F. Brewster N.K. Kurniawan J. Minard L.V. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5894-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Spt16 NTD shares limited sequence similarity with a class of aminopeptidases, but it does not have peptidase active site residues (see Ref. 24Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R111-R113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and this study). These observations suggest that the Spt16 NTD may have peptide binding activity but that this role is dispensable for the core activity of yFACT.Here we report the structure of the Spt16 NTD and the results of studies examining the role of this domain in yFACT function. The Spt16 NTD is structurally similar to aminopeptidases, and the most highly conserved surface residues line a cleft equivalent to the aminopeptidase substrate-binding site. The presence of potential peptide-binding sites in each subunit of yFACT led us to examine candidate substrates, initially focusing on the attractive possibility that these sites bind to the N-terminal tails of histones that extend beyond the structured core of the nucleosome and are known to influence yFACT functions in vivo (6Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 25Biswas D. Dutta-Biswas R. Mitra D. Shibata Y. Strahl B.D. Formosa T. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4479-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The N-terminal tails of histones were found to have an important role in yFACT function and to be bound by yFACT with high affinity. However, this activity and other measurable functions of yFACT in vitro remained intact after mutating Pob3-M or deleting the Spt16 NTD. Instead, the Spt16 NTD and Pob3-M domains were found to have overlapping roles in a process that involves the C-terminal extension of H2A. This stirrup-like “docking domain” of histone H2A acts to stabilize the binding of H2A-H2B dimers to (H3-H4)2 tetramers within histone octamers (26Park Y.J. Dyer P.N. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24274-24282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27White C.L. Suto R.K. Luger K.

Biol. 2007; 27: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These results suggest that yFACT makes multiple additive contacts with nucleosomes during reorganization, and that some of these contacts are important after yFACT has induced the reorganization of the nucleosome. The docking domain of H2A is identified as an important contributor to this process, perhaps tethering nucleosomal components together or controlling the insertion of H2A-H2B dimers during nucleosome formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification–DNA fragments encoding Spt16 residues 1-451 or 1-465 were amplified by PCR and inserted into a modified pET bacterial expression vector that fused eight histidines and a TEV protease site to the N termini. TEV cleavage leaves the sequence “GHM...” at the N terminus in place of the native methionine. Each protein was expressed in Codon+(RIL) cells (Stratagene) and purified by nickel chelation chromatography (Qiagen). After TEV protease digestion and nickel chelation chromatography to remove tagged N termini, proteins were further purified by gel filtration on Superdex-200 (GE Healthcare) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The Spt16 NTD fragments eluted as apparent monomers and were then concentrated in gel filtration buffer.Spt16-Pob3 complexes with 12 histidines and a TEV site fused to the N terminus of Pob3 were purified from yeast cells overexpressing each protein from the Gal1 promoter after growth in galactose medium, as described (19Wittmeyer J. Joss L. Formosa T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8961-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Complexes were purified from extracts using nickel chelation and gel filtration as above, except using Sephacryl S300 (GE Healthcare) and omitting the TEV cleavage.Nucleosomes were prepared by dialysis from high ionic strength solutions using derivatives of a sea urchin rDNA nucleosome positioning sequence and chicken histones or bacterially expressed yeast histones, as described previously (7; see the supplement material for details).Crystallography–Single plate crystals of Spt16-(1-451) were grown at 4 °C over 2-3 weeks by sitting drop vapor diffusion against a reservoir solution of 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 35% polyethylene glycol 300. The drop consisted of 1 μl of protein concentrated to 10-15 mg/ml, 1 μl of reservoir solution, and 0.4 μl of 100 mm cysteine. Selenomethionine-substituted Spt16-(1-451) was expressed as described (29Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar) and then purified and crystallized using conditions similar to those described above. Crystals were cryoprotected by emersion in reservoir solution made up with 25% glycerol and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. SAD data were collected at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X26-C and processed with HKL2000 and SCALEPACK (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Data were collected and processed as above. The refined model of Spt16-(1-451) was used as a starting model for molecular replacement (PHASER; 33) into both native datasets. Model building for all structures reported here was performed using COOT (34Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Experimental phases were determined by the SAD method using selenomethionine-substituted protein, and the model was refined to Rfactor/Rfree values of 18.0/22.3% against data to 1.9 Å resolution (crystallographic statistics are given in Table 1). This model was used in molecular replacement calculations to determine two different crystal forms of native Spt16 NTD that were refined to Rfactor/Rfree values of 17.6/24.4% and 15.1/21.0% against data to 1.94 and 1.75 Å resolution, respectively. The five independent Spt16 NTD molecules in these three crystal forms displayed only minor differences, with a maximum root mean square deviation of 0.7 Å for overlap on 440 pairs of C-α atoms in pairwise comparisons.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsNative form INative form IISelenomethionine form IIIData collectionSpace groupP1P21P21Cell dimensions (Å)a = 51.1, b = 60.1, c = 85.9a = 60.3, b = 50.8, c = 79.2a = 40.7, b = 144.6, c = 88.5Unit cell angles (°)α = 72.6, β = 77.1, γ = 89.9β = 107.1β = 101.4Resolution (Å)50-1.9450-1.7540-1.90Detector edge shell (Å)aDetector edge outer shell represents the bin of data that extended to the edge of the detector.

Open table in a new tab Comparison with Other Structures–The Spt16 NTD includes a smaller N-terminal lobe (residues 1-175) and a larger C-terminal lobe (residues 176-447; Fig. 1). The extensive packing between the lobes and the similarity of crystallographically independent molecules suggest that the two lobes maintain a fixed relative orientation in solution. The N-terminal lobe structure is similar to the RuvC/RNase H family, with a root mean square deviation of 3.3 Å for overlap with RuvC (38; PDB 1HJR) over 89 pairs of C-α atoms (supplemental Fig. S1). Structures in this family include a 3-layer α/β/α sandwich in which the central β-sheet is composed of five strands (order 32145) that, with the exception of strand 2, are parallel to each other. The RuvC active site is formed by a cluster of four acidic residues that lie in a deep cleft formed by both the β-sheet and the helical regions on one side of the sheet. The Spt16 NTD lacks these catalytic residues and contains an additional helix (residues 36-62) that fills this cleft. Furthermore, the charged nucleic acid binding surface of RuvC and RNase H is not conserved in the Spt16 NTD. The limited structural similarity therefore does not indicate a shared biochemical activity of Spt16 with RuvC/RNase H, consistent with the earlier finding that yFACT does not bind DNA in affinity purification or electrophoretic mobility shift experiments (6Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Wittmeyer J. Joss L. Formosa T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8961-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).The Spt16 NTD C-terminal lobe adopts a “pita bread” fold, in which two ααβββ motifs associate with approximate 2-fold symmetry to form a half-barrel structure (Fig. 1). This architecture is also found in the aminopeptidases that share limited sequence similarity with the Spt16 NTD, including methionine aminopeptidase, prolidase, and aminopeptidase P. Other structurally similar proteins include creatinase (39Coll M. Knof S.H. Ohga Y. Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Moellering H. Russmann L. Schumacher G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Padmanabhan B. Paehler A. Horikoshi M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and the ErbB-3 receptor-binding protein (Ebp1; 41, 42). The C-terminal lobe shows closest structural similarity to the prolidase enzyme from Pyrococcus furiosus (PDB 1PV9; 43), which overlaps with a root mean square deviation of 2.0 Å over 215 pairs of C-α atoms that share 23% sequence identity (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2The Spt16 NTD aligns with other pita bread fold proteins. A, Spt16 NTD (turquoise and blue) is superimposed with prolidase (yellow). The loop of Spt16 that encloses the putative binding cleft is colored orange. B and C, a peptide substrate in aminopeptidase P (AminoP) (green), an inhibitor of methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) (pink), and the substrate creatine in creatinase (blue) are superimposed on the Spt16 NTD structure. The surface of the loop is omitted in B and included in C to view different aspects of the tunnel and cleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The cleft formed at the open side of the half β-barrel in enzymes with a pita bread fold is often found to house the active site. The Spt16 NTD displays a cleft at this position that measures ∼22 × 20 Å and is ∼10 Å deep. A portion of this cleft is loosely covered by a loop (residues 267-276), forming a short tunnel or covered region within the cleft (orange in Figs. 1 and 2). Surface residues that are evolutionarily conserved among Spt16 homologs cluster within the tunnel region and the adjacent section of the cleft (see Fig. 5 below), suggesting that this region is functionally important in Spt16.FIGURE 5Conservation correlates with the strength of synthetic defects with pob3-Q308K. Top, residues that are identical among at least 70% of the 31 Spt16 homologs aligned (see Fig. 1) are indicated in red, revealing clustering near the canonical binding/active site cleft for prolidase, methionine aminopeptidase, aminopeptidase P, and creatinase (asterisk). The full surface is shown on the left, and the loop residues 266-274 are removed in the middle panel to reveal the enclosed tunnel region. The right panel shows a view rotated 180° about the vertical axis. Bottom, severity of the synthetic defect when combined with pob3-Q308K is indicated (Table 2); severe defects are shown in red, moderate defects in orange, and mild defects in yellow. If residues were tested individually and in multiple mutations, only the score from the single mutation is used here. Otherwise, the score for the complex mutation is assigned to all residues altered. WT sequences are indicated along with the number of the first residue. The orientations are the same as in the top panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Prolidase, methionine aminopeptidase, and aminopeptidase P are peptidases that cleave Xaa-Pro dipeptides, Met-Xaa, and Xaa-Pro peptides, respectively. Consistent with the related chemistry, their active sites are similar structures that feature a dinuclear metal ion cluster. Creatinases are also hydrolases that cleave a C-N bond, although in this case creatine is cleaved to sarcosine and urea. Notably, although ligand complex structures demonstrate that the creatinase and peptidase active sites overlap spatially (Fig. 2), creatinase uses a histidine side chain rather than coordinated metal ions to drive catalysis. Spt16 does not contain either the metal ion coordinating residues of the peptidases or the histidine of creatinase. Additionally, yFACT purified from yeast cells was not found to contain metal atoms, 5D. Winge, University of Utah, personal communication. and neither yFACT nor the Spt16 NTD displayed peptidase activity with a variety of substrates (see supplemental material). 6M. Rechsteiner, University of Utah, personal communication. We therefore disfavor the model that Spt16 NTD is an enzyme, although the remarkable divergence of the peptidase and creatinase active sites cautions that this possibility cannot be completely discounted. Our preferred hypothesis is that the Spt16 NTD groove is a binding site, perhaps for a peptide ligand from a nucleosome or other associated protein. Like the Spt16 NTD, the pita bread fold domain of Ebp1 appears to lack enzymatic activity but retains a distinctive cleft that might function as a binding site (41Kowalinski E. Bange G. Bradatsch B.

A monoclonal IgM from a patient with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia hydrolyzed Aβ40 at the Lys-28–Gly-29 bond and Lys-16–Ala-17 bonds. The catalytic activity was inhibited stoichiometrically by an electrophilic serine protease inhibitor. Treatment with the catalytic IgM blocked the aggregation and toxicity of Aβ40 in neuronal cell cultures. IgMs purified from the sera of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) hydrolyzed Aβ40 at rates superior to IgMs from age-matched humans without dementia. IgMs from non-elderly humans expressed the least catalytic activity. The reaction rate was sufficient to afford appreciable degradation at physiological Aβ and IgM concentrations found in peripheral circulation. Increased Aβ concentrations in the AD brain are thought to induce neurodegenerative effects. Peripheral administration of Aβ binding antibodies has been suggested as a potential treatment of AD.

Accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ)2 peptide aggregates is thought to play a crucial role in the neurodegenerative events underlying AD (1Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). The Aβ aggregates are composed of 39–43 residue peptides generated upon proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein by the β- and γ-secretases. The predominant product of this processing pathway is Aβ-(1–40) (Aβ40; corresponding to amyloid precursor protein (APP) residues 597–636) with Aβ-(1–42) (Aβ42; APP residues 597–638) being the next-most abundant product (2Wolfe M.S. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Aβ42 and Aβ40 tend to form oligomeric aggregates and fibrillar structures (3Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M.

Both peptides can be detected in amyloid plaques found in AD brains, but Aβ42 tends to form aggregates more rapidly and is the majority species (2Wolfe M.S. Curr. Top. Med.

Hampel H. Frolich L. Haag A. Hemmeter U. Paulsen S. Teipel S.J. Brettschneider S. Spottke A. Nolker C. Moller H.J. Wei X. Farlow M. Sommer N. Oertel W.H. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2004; 75: 1472-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar)). Phase 1 human clinical trials have suggested that infusion of pooled human IgG into the peripheral circulation may be useful in treating AD (7Dodel R.C. Du Y. Depboylu C. Hampel H. Frolich L. Haag A. Hemmeter U. Paulsen S. Teipel S.J. Brettschneider S. Spottke A. Nolker C. Moller H.J. Wei X. Farlow M. Sommer N. Oertel W.H. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2004; 75: 1472-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Similarly, intravenous administration of Aβ binding monoclonal antibodies (Abs) of the IgG class to transgenic mice expressing human Aβ, which are frequently used as an experimental model of AD, clears amyloid plaques from the brain and improves cognitive performance (for review, see Refs. 8White A.R. Hawke S.H. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 9Schenk D. Hagen M. Seubert P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The following mechanisms are thought to explain the amyloid-clearing effect of intravenously administered Aβ binding IgGs. (a) Small amounts of the IgGs cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and bind Aβs in the brain, and microglial cells clear the resultant immune complexes by Fc-receptor mediated uptake (9Schenk D. Hagen M. Seubert P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); and (b) according to the “peripheral sink” hypothesis (10DeMattos R.B. Bales K.R. Cummins D.J. Dodart J.C. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8850-8855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar), Aβs can be cleared from the brain without the requirement for IgG entry into the brain. In this hypothesis peripheral Aβ-Ab binding perturbs the equilibrium between the peptide pools in the brain and periphery, thereby stimulating Aβ release from the brain. In principle, both mechanisms can be triggered by the same Ab. Studies on human autoantibody preparations yielded the first empirical evidence that certain Abs can catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds (11Paul S. Volle D.J. Beach C.M. Johnson D.R. Powell M.J. Massey R.J. Science. 1989; 244: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Abs with proteolytic activity can inactivate polypeptide antigens permanently, and a single catalyst molecule can hydrolyze multiple antigen molecules. This results in improved antigen inactivation by catalytic Abs compared with reversibly binding Abs (which bind antigens stoichiometrically; e.g. two antigen molecules/IgG molecule) (12Berisha H.I. Bratut M. Bangale Y. Colasurdo G. Paul S. Said S.I. Pulm. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 15: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We reported previously the hydrolysis of Aβ40 by the cross-reactive light chain subunit of catalytic Abs to the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (13Rangan S.K. Liu R. Brune D. Planque S. Paul S. Sierks M.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14328-14334Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Free light chain subunits of Abs are not found at appreciable levels in extracellular fluids. Moreover, light chains with catalytic activity in their free state frequently fail to express this activity when paired with the heavy chain subunit as components of intact Abs (14Mei S. Mody B. Eklund S.H. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15571-15574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hifumi E. Hatiuchi K. Okuda T. Nishizono A. Okamura Y. Uda T. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4497-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is not clear, therefore, whether Abs in their physiological structures can catalyze the hydrolysis of Aβ. B lymphocytes synthesize structurally and functionally distinct classes of Abs at different stages of their life cycle. IgM class Abs are distinguished by the ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of model peptide substrates at rates substantially greater than IgGs produced at the later B cell differentiation stages after class switch recombination has occurred (16Planque S. Bangale Y. Song X.T. Karle S. Taguchi H. Poindexter B. Bick R. Edmundson A. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol.

Improved cognitive performance in the Aβ-overexpressing mouse model of AD has been reported upon immunization with certain Aβ analogs that induce an Aβ binding IgM response in peripheral blood without an appreciable IgG response (17Sigurdsson E.M.

In the present study we examined the ability of monoclonal and polyclonal IgM preparations from humans to catalyze the hydrolysis of Aβ40. We report the properties of specific Aβ-hydrolyzing IgMs in aged humans and AD patients, and we present alternative arguments supporting their beneficial versus deleterious roles.

Polyclonal IgM and IgG preparations were from sera obtained from human subjects of either sex without evidence of neurodegenerative or autoimmune disease (non-elderly subjects, 1 female and 5 males, 35 ± 8 years old; elderly undemented subjects, 13 females and 12 males, 76 ± 6 years) and from AD patients (11 females and 12 males, 76 ± 6 years; Ref 19Friedland R.P.

The IgMs were purified by affinity chromatography on columns of immobilized Abs to human IgM, quantified by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit, and determined to be electrophoretically homogeneous by reducing SDS-electrophoresis and immunoblotting with goat anti-human IgM and anti-human IgG Abs (18Paul S.

The reaction mixtures were fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC; Nova-Pak C18 3. 9 ×150-mm column, Waters DELTA-600 system, 2487 UV/visible detector; Milford, MA; linear gradient of 10–80% solvent B in 40 min; solvent A, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile; 1 ml/min) with online electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry (LCQ DECA XP plus, Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA; spray voltage 4.5 kV, heat capillary at 200 °C; scan range m/z 400 to 2000). The zoom scan function and collision-induced desorption function after electron spray ionization were utilized as needed (collision-energy value 35%). The reaction rates were computed from the area of the Aβ1–28 product peak interpolated from a standard curve constructed using increasing amounts of synthetic Aβ1–28. Apparent kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting hydrolysis rates observed at varying Aβ40 concentrations (3, 10, 30, and 100 μm) to the Michaelis-Menten equation v = (Vmax[Aβ40])/Km + [Aβ40], where Vmax is the maximum velocity at saturating Aβ40 concentrations, and Km is the concentration at which half-maximal velocity was observed. Aβ40 hydrolysis in certain assays was determined using 125I-labeled Aβ40 as substrate as described previously (20Qiu W.Q. Walsh D.M. Ye Z. Vekrellis K. Zhang J. Podlisny M.B. Rosner M.R. Safavi A. Hersh L.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32730-32738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Briefly, 125I-labeled Aβ40 was prepared using the chloramine-T method and purified by RP-HPLC (retention time 43.5 min; specific activity 2.2 Ci/μmol). The 125I-labeled Aβ40 (∼0.1 nm, ∼30,000 cpm/tube) was treated with the Abs (0.1 ml, 37 °C) in TG-CHAPS buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. 1 ml of 5.5% trichloroacetic acid was added, and the acid-insoluble (intact peptide) and acid-soluble (peptide fragments) fractions were separated by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 30 min). The acid-soluble radioactivity was counted by γ-spectrometry and corrected for background values measured in control assay tubes incubated in diluent without Abs (mean ± S.D., 18 ± 6%; n = 7). Ab-catalyzed hydrolysis of Glu-Ala-Arg-AMC (Boc-Glu-(OBzl)-Ala-Arg with 7-aminomethylcoumarin linked to the C terminus; 0.2 mm, Peptides International, Louisville, KY) was measured in 96-well plates in TG-CHAPS buffer containing 0.5% Me2SO at 37 °C (16Planque S. Bangale Y. Song X.T. Karle S. Taguchi H. Poindexter B. Bick R. Edmundson A. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14024-14032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). AMC release was determined by fluorometry (λem 470 nm; λex 360 nm). The synthesis of electrophilic hapten 1 (EP-hapten 1) employed as an inhibitor of catalysis has been described (21Nishiyama Y. Taguchi H. Luo J.Q. Zhou Y.X. Burr G. Karle S. Paul S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of biotinylated proteins was determined by SDS-electrophoresis using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin to stain the proteins (18Paul S. Karle S. Planque S. Taguchi H. Salas M.

Aβ40 binding was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 96-well microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc). The plates were prepared by coating with streptavidin (10 μg/ml 100 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.3, 1 h, 37 °C; Sigma), blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.025% Tween 20 (PBS-Tween), and treatment with biotinylated Aβ40 (4 μg/ml, 1 h, 37 °C; American Peptide). Thereupon, the wells were treated with the IgM for 2 h in PBS-Tween containing 5% skim milk, and bound IgM was measured using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgM (μ chain-specific, 1:500; Sigma (18Paul S.

Molecular Modeling–Complexes of Aβ-(14–24) and Aβ-(26–36) with the putative catalytic triad of IgM Yvo were modeled based on the published NMR structures of these Aβ regions (Protein Data Bank code 1BA4 (22Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11064-11077Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar)) and the crystal structure of the IgM Fab fragment (PDB code 2AGJ (23Ramsland P.A. Terzyan S.S. Cloud G. Bourne C.R. Farrugia W. Tribbick G. Geysen H.M. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Edmundson A.B. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). The Aβ-(15–24) and Aβ-(28–36) regions form well defined α-helices in solutions of Aβ40 monomers in organic solvents and membrane mimicking environments (22Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11064-11077Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Initial docking of Aβ-(14–24) and Aβ-(26–36) was performed using the program ZDOCK (24Chen R. Tong W. Mintseris J. Li L. Weng Z. Proteins. 2003; 52: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with the condition that the scissile bonds (Lys-16–Leu-17 and Lys-28–Gly-29) should establish “contact” with the catalytic triad of the IgM (Ser-94L, Arg-96L, and Glu-100aH) as defined in the ZDOCK algorithm. Aβ-(14–24) docked immediately to a plausible position with the scissile bond Lys-16 carbonyl carbon about 4 Å from the putative Ser-94L Oγ nucleophile. Docking of the Aβ-(26–36) helix was done by superimposition onto the Aβ-(14–24) helix in the complex. Both docked models were energy-minimized in CNS 1.1 (200 cycles (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar)). Certain minor steric clashes in the Aβ-(32–36) region were removed during the energy minimization procedure. After completion of the modeling procedure, an example conformation of Aβ40 from the NMR structure (22Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11064-11077Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) was superposed upon the corresponding Aβ-(14–24) and Aβ-(26–36) regions to assess whether the full-length peptide can occupy the IgM binding site. No steric clashes were observed. Neurotoxicity–Human neuroblastoma cells (SHSY5Y cell line, American Type Center Collection) were maintained in culture and harvested according to the supplier's instructions in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The method of Liu et al. (26Liu R. McAllister C. Lyubchenko Y. Sierks M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9999-10007Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was employed to determine neural cell death. Briefly, the cells were plated in 96-well polystyrene plates (0.1 ml/well; 20,000 cells/well), incubated for 24 h to allow attachment, and then cultured for 3 days with diluent, Aβ40 alone (0.4 μm), IgM alone (0.54 mg/ml), or Aβ40 (8 μm) previously incubated for 12 days with the IgM (0.54 mg/ml). Cell viability was determined using an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay kit (Cell-Titer 96 Assay; Promega). Cell viability data are reported using the control diluent wells as reference (100%) after subtraction of the background A560 value observed in wells containing diluent without cells. Atomic Force Microscopy–Peptide aggregates were visualized according to Dahlgren et al. (3Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M. Stine Jr., W.B. Baker L.K. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32046-32053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) using a NanoScope IIIa atomic force microscope (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a MultiMode head and an E-series piezoceramic scanner (xy range 10 μm; tapping mode, silicon microcantilevers with 300-kHz resonant frequency and 42 newtons/meter spring constant; probe OMCL-AC160TS-W2, Olympus). The peptide-Ab mixture (10 μl) was spotted on freshly cleaved mica (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA), incubated at room temperature for 5 min, washed with water, and dried under vacuum. Image data were acquired at scan rates between 1 and 2 Hz with drive amplitude and contact force kept to a minimum. At least three regions of the mica surface were examined to ensure that similar structures existed throughout the sample. Aβ Hydrolysis by Monoclonal IgMs–We previously reported the proteolytic activity of monoclonal IgMs from patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia using model peptide substrates (16Planque S. Bangale Y. Song X.T. Karle S. Taguchi H. Poindexter B. Bick R. Edmundson A. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14024-14032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, the same panel of identically purified monoclonal IgMs was examined for the ability to cleave Aβ40. Treatment of Aβ40 with two monoclonal IgMs depleted the intact Aβ40 peak accompanied by appearance of peptide products absent in control reversed-phase HPLC chromatograms of the IgM alone or Aβ40 alone (Fig. 1; the two IgMs generated identical Aβ40 product profiles). No depletion of Aβ40 or appearance of product peaks was observed after treatment with the remaining eight IgMs as in Fig. 1A. Neither Aβ40-hydrolyzing IgM displayed binding of biotinylated Aβ40 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test (A490 < 0.1; 100 μg of IgM/ml). Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry of the 3 product peptides generated by IgM Yvo yielded mass values identical to the theoretical mass of Aβ1–16, Aβ1–28, and Aβ29–40 (RP-HPLC retention times, respectively, 10.2, 18.0, and 21.0 min; calculated (M+H)+ values, respectively, 1955.0, 3262.5, and 1085.6; observed (M+H)+ values, respectively, 1955.1, 3262.5, and 1085.5; Fig. 1B). The observed b- and y-fragment series generated by collision-induced desorption after electron spray ionization confirmed the identity of the product peptides (supplemental Table S1). We concluded that IgM Yvo cleaved the Lys-28–Gly-29 and Lys-16–Leu-17 bonds. From the HPLC product peak heights, the Lys-28–Gly-29 bond was the major cleavage site, and the Lys-16–Leu-17 bond was the minor cleavage site. The C-terminal Aβ17–40 fragment corresponding to minor cleavage (Lys-16–Leu-17 bond) was not detected, presumably due to loss on the HPLC column or precipitation before fractionation. A product corresponding to Aβ1–28 was also identified by HPLC/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry after treatment of Aβ42 with IgM Yvo but not the non-hydrolytic IgM 1816 under the conditions described in Fig. 1, indicating hydrolysis of the Lys-28–Gly-29 bond. Accurate measurement of Aβ42 hydrolysis was not possible because of visible peptide aggregation before the HPLC procedure. Aβ40 hydrolysis by IgM Yvo was saturable with progressively increasing peptide concentration, and the observed rates were consistent with the Michaelis-Menten kinetics (r2 = 0.94; Table 1). Over 25 h, 0.6 μmol of IgM Yvo cleaved 24 μmol of Aβ40 in Fig. 1A, confirming the turnover capability of the IgM. Electrophilic phosphonate diesters are class-specific irreversible inhibitors of serine proteases (27Oleksyszyn J. Powers J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 423-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that inhibit IgM-catalyzed hydrolysis of peptide-AMC substrates (16Planque S. Bangale Y. Song X.T. Karle S. Taguchi H. Poindexter B. Bick R. Edmundson A. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14024-14032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of Glu-Ala-Arg-AMC by IgM Yvo was inhibited by Aβ40 (Fig. 2A), indicating that the two substrates are cleaved by the same catalytic site. The reaction stoichiometry was determined by plotting residual catalytic activity observed versus varying electrophilic phosphonate diester:IgM molar ratios (Fig. 2B). The x intercept of the plot was 10.2, compared with the theoretical value of 10 antigen combining sites per molecule IgM. The observed stoichiometry of 10.2 substrate molecules cleaved per molecule of IgM is inconsistent with the possibility of trace contamination as the explanation for catalysis, as only small amounts of the electrophilic phosphonate diester relative to the total IgM concentration should suffice to inhibit trace contaminants. Previously published control studies have indicated that the catalytic activity is retained in the Fab fragments of IgM Yvo and maintained at constant levels after successive purification steps (16Planque S. Bangale Y. Song X.T. Karle S. Taguchi H. Poindexter B. Bick R. Edmundson A. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14024-14032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the catalytic activity is attributable to the IgM.TABLE 1Apparent kinetics parameters for Aβ40 hydrolysis by monoclonal IgM Yvo and pooled polyclonal IgM from elderly non-demented human subjectsAntibodyVmaxKmVmax/KmComputed physiological Aβ40 hydrolysis after 5 daysaFor illustration, included are computed values of % Aβ40 hydrolysis at 5 days and % Aβ40 binding by catalytic and non-catalytic IgM antibodies with equivalent Kd.

Open table in a new tab The presence of a serine protease-like catalytic triad in IgM Yvo has been inferred from its crystal structure (23Ramsland P.A. Terzyan S.S. Cloud G. Bourne C.R. Farrugia W.

NMR studies have suggested a random coil conformation of the N and C termini of Aβ40 with a tendency to form α-helices at residues 15–24 and 28–36 (22Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11064-11077Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The peptide bonds hydrolyzed by IgM Yvo are located in these regions (Lys-16–Leu-17 and Lys-28–Gly-29). Alternate molecular models of Aβ-(14–24) or Aβ-(26–36) docked as helices with the V regions of the IgM were prepared (Fig. 3). The models suggested the feasibility of close encounter between the putative Ser-94L Oγ nucleophile and the carbonyl C atom of the two scissile peptide bonds (Lys-16–Leu-17 and Lys-28–Gly-29 bonds; observed interatomic distance, 3.8–4 Å). The docked complex of Aβ-(26–36) containing the major scissile bond is about 6 kcal/mol more advantageous energetically than the complex of Aβ-(14–24) containing the minor cleavage site.

https://openalex.org/W1976111574,"Efficient expression of innate immunity is critically dependent upon the capacity of the neutrophil to be activated rapidly in the face of an acute threat and to involute once that threat has been eliminated. Here we report a novel mechanism regulating neutrophil survival dynamically through the tyrosine phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of caspase-8. Caspase-8 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in freshly isolated neutrophils but spontaneously dephosphorylates in culture, in association with the progression of constitutive apoptosis. Phosphorylation of caspase-8 on Tyr-310 facilitates its interaction with the Src-homology domain 2 containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and enables SHP-1 to dephosphorylate caspase-8, permitting apoptosis to proceed. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Lyn, can phosphorylate caspase-8 on Tyr-397 and Tyr-465, rendering it resistant to activational cleavage and inhibiting apoptosis. Exposure to lipopolysaccharide reduces SHP-1 activity and binding to caspase-8, caspase-8 activity, and rates of spontaneous apoptosis. SHP-1 activity is reduced and Lyn increased in neutrophils from patients with sepsis, in association with profoundly delayed apoptosis; inhibition of Lyn can partially reverse this delay. Thus the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of caspase-8, mediated by Lyn and SHP-1, respectively, represents a novel, dynamic post-translational mechanism for the regulation of neutrophil apoptosis whose dysregulation contributes to persistent neutrophil survival in sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W1994313286,"Recent studies suggest that overexpression of the polyamine-acetylating enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) significantly increases metabolic flux through the polyamine pathway. The concept derives from the observation that SSAT-induced acetylation of polyamines gives rise to a compensatory increase in biosynthesis and presumably to increased flow through the pathway. Despite the strength of this deduction, the existence of heightened polyamine flux has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we use the artificial polyamine precursor 4-fluoro-ornithine to measure polyamine flux by tracking fluorine unit permeation of polyamine pools in human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. Conditional overexpression of SSAT was accompanied by a massive increase in intracellular and extracellular acetylated spermidine and by a 6-20-fold increase in biosynthetic enzyme activities. In the presence of 300 μm 4-fluoro-ornithine, SSAT overexpression led to the sequential appearance of fluorinated putrescine, spermidine, acetylated spermidine, and spermine. As fluorinated polyamines increased, endogenous polyamines decreased, so that the total polyamine pool size remained relatively constant. At 24 h, 56% of the spermine pool in the induced SSAT cells was fluorine-labeled compared with only 12% in uninduced cells. Thus, SSAT induction increased metabolic flux by ∼5-fold. Flux could be interrupted by inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis but not by inhibition of polyamine oxidation. Overall, the findings are consistent with a paradigm whereby flux is initiated by SSAT acetylation of spermine and particularly spermidine followed by a marked increase in key biosynthetic enzymes. The latter sustains the flux cycle by providing a constant supply of polyamines for subsequent acetylation by SSAT.

Intracellular levels of the polyamines, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are thought to be homeostatically maintained within a relatively constant range by three main effector systems: biosynthesis, acetylation/export, and transport (1Porter C.W.

The cytosolic enzyme SSAT acetylates spermine (Spm) and spermidine (Spd) to form N1-acetylspermine (AcSpm), N1,N12-diacetylspermine (DAS), and N1-acetylspermidine (AcSpd), which are then rendered susceptible to either export out of the cell or oxidation to lower polyamines by polyamine oxidase (PAO) (20Seiler N.

In other words, SSAT acetylation of polyamines leads to increased biosynthesis and heightened metabolic flux (Fig. 1). The adverse downstream consequences of sustained metabolic flux that account for growth inhibition and other effects are potentially 2-fold: pathway precursor depletion or accumulation of toxic pathway by-products (23Kee K.

Detailed studies in LNCaP cells strongly relate growth inhibition to the fatty acid precursor acetyl-CoA, a finding supported by the lean phenotype seen in SSAT transgenic mice (26Pietila M.

More particularly, acetyl-CoA was depleted in SSAT-overexpressing LNCaP cells and in the adipose tissue of SSAT transgenic mice. Thus far, the existence of SSAT-induced metabolic flux has only been indirectly inferred on the basis of increased SSAT activity, increased ODC and SAMDC activities, accumulation of acetylated polyamines, and persistence of Spd and Spm pools. Although the heightened flux paradigm is compelling and seemingly without an alternative interpretation, it has not yet been experimentally demonstrated by direct measurement, which is the intention of this present study. Previously, we reported a method for quantifying polyamine flux that makes use of (a) the ability of fluoro-ornithine (Fl-Orn) to substitute for ornithine as a precursor to putrescine (Put) biosynthesis, (b) the metabolic processing of fluorinated Put to higher polyamines in the absence of overt cytotoxicity, and (c) our ability to distinguish fluorinated polyamines from endogenous polyamines by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (31Kramer D. Stanek J. Diegelman P. Regenass U. Schneider P. Porter C.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The method was used to characterize metabolic flux under various growth states and pharmacological conditions but not during selective induction of SSAT. In similarity to flux measurements based on radioactive tracers, this approach allows for unambiguous separation of newly synthesized polyamines from preexisting polyamines. However, fluorotagging allows these pools to be visualized and quantified on the same chromatogram and without the need for additional processing steps or equipment. Here, this methodology was used to demonstrate that sustained induction of SSAT increases metabolic flux through the polyamine pathway. Given the many factors that induce SSAT (32Seiler N. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1987; 65: 2024-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 33Casero Jr., R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 34Hector S.

Materials–4-Fluoro-l-ornithine (Fl-Orn) was synthesized according to a published procedure (31Kramer D. Stanek J. Diegelman P. Regenass U. Schneider P. Porter C.W. Biochem.

The arginase inhibitor Nω-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine (nor-NOHA) was purchased from EMD Chemicals, Inc. (La Jolla, CA). Tetracycline (Tet), aminoguanidine, polyamines, and the acetylated polyamines AcSpd and AcSpm were purchased from Sigma. The 2-fluoroputrescine (Fl-Put) and DAS was obtained from the late Dr. Nikolaus Seiler (University of Rennes, France). Radioactive [3H]Spd (27.6 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell Culture Conditions–LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells constitutively expressing the Tet-repressible transactivator (35Gschwend J.E. Fair W.R. Powell C.T. Prostate. 1997; 33: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were used to transfect human SSAT cDNA and select for conditional overexpression of SSAT (23Kee K. Vujcic S. Merali S.

Designated SSAT/LNCaP, these cells were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% Tet-approved fetal bovine serum (Clontech), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA), 150 μg/ml hygromycin B, 150 μg/ml G418, and 1 μg/ml Tet at 37 °C in the presence of humidified 5% CO2. Of significance, RPMI 1640 medium is ornithine-free. For optimal cell attachment enzyme induction and cell growth, experiments were conducted with poly-d-lysine-coated dishes (BD Biosciences). This differs from our previous studies in which LNCaP cells were grown on standard uncoated dishes (23Kee K. Vujcic S. Merali S. Diegelman P. Kisiel N. Powell C.T. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. J. Biol.

Aminoguanidine (1 mm) was routinely added to inhibit serum amino oxidases and prevent conversion of extracellular polyamines to toxic products. Cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin and counted electronically (Coulter model ZM, Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Just prior to plating, exponentially growing cells were placed in medium containing 10% NuSerum IV (Collaborative Research, Boston, MA), no addition of hygromycin and G418, and 100 ng/ml Tet. Cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes in the absence (induced SSAT) and presence (basal SSAT) of 1 μg/ml Tet. After 24 h, fresh medium was applied immediately prior to the addition of 300 μm Fl-Orn. Control cells were treated with 300 μm ornithine (Orn) in place of Fl-Orn. Some experiments included co-treatments at fixed time points with a 50 μm concentration of the polyamine oxidase inhibitor MDL-72527, 30 μm SAMDC inhibitor MDL-73811, or 100 μm arginase inhibitor nor-NOHA. From 0 to 48 h following the addition of Fl-Orn, both medium and cells were collected and frozen at -20 °C until HPLC analysis was performed. HPLC Detection of Polyamines and Fluoropolyamines–Cell samples were extracted with 0.6 m perchloric acid and centrifuged. The supernatant extract was assayed for polyamines by reverse phase HPLC. We obtained sharp polyamine peaks with good separation (Fig. 3) by introducing major modifications to a previously described procedure (36Seiler N. Knodgen B. J. Chromatogr. 1980; 221: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) as detailed below. Polyamines in 50 μl of each acid extract were injected onto an autosampler (model 717 Plus, Waters Associates, Milford, MA) using a C-18 column (250 × 3 mm; 5 μm) (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) with an acetonitrile/sodium acetate gradient buffer system and detected with an o-phthalaldehyde postcolumn derivatization system. The column was maintained at 35 °C in a column heater (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). The mobile phase consisted of Buffer A (0.1 m sodium acetate and 15 mm octane sulfonic acid, pH 4.5) and Buffer B (0.25 m sodium acetate and 15 mm octane sulfonic acid, pH 4.5, with 30% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. A low pressure gradient generator (model 6005 controller; Waters Associates) and a programmable pump (model 616; Waters Associates) were used to mix buffers A and B as a linear gradient: at 0 min, 100% A; at 25 min, 100% B; and at 30 min, re-equilibration with 100% A. The column eluate was derivatized according to the Pickering Laboratories (Mountain View, CA) reagent bulletin, mixed with column eluates in a flow cell at 0.5 ml/min, and passed through a fluorescent detector (model 2475; Waters Associates) with fixed excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 and 465 nm, respectively. The data were collected and analyzed using Millennium 32 chromatography software version 3.05 (Waters Associates). Authentic standards of the natural polyamines AcSpd and AcSpm were analyzed separately to identify and quantitate each peak. Fl-Put was verified by an authentic standard, and the other fluorinated compounds (Fl-Spd, Fl-Spm, Fl-AcSpd, and Fl-AcSpm) were presumed from their faster retention time (∼1 min ahead) relative to the parent natural polyamine. Elution times were as follows: Fl-Put, 14.2 min; Put, 14.9 min; Fl-AcSpd, 17.6 min; AcSpd, 18.4 min; 6-Fl-Spd, 20.4 min; Spd, 20.9 min; Fl-AcSpm, 22.2 min; AcSpm, 22.8 min; 6-Fl-Spm, 23.2 min; and Spm, 23.6 min. The ratio of Fl-Put/Put was used for calculating the relative values of all other fluorinated compounds. With sensitivity in the range of 20 pmol, polyamine pools were expressed as nmol/106 cells. The OPA reagent used for postcolumn detection will only bind to primary amines; thus, monoacetylated polyamines bind the dye, but diacetylated polyamines like DAS (22Vujcic S. Halmekyto M.

DAS was analyzed by rerunning the samples using a precolumn dansylation methodology (37Kabra P.M. Lee H.K. Lubich W.P. Marton L.J. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 380: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) with additional modifications (38Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol.

Extracellular Polyamines–Due to high levels of Put found in fetal bovine serum, duplicate experiments were performed using 10% NuSerum containing 5-fold less Put. Experimental medium was also prepared without the addition of antibiotics hygromycin and G418 due to their interference with peak detection by HPLC analysis. At the indicated times, 10 ml of medium collected from each dish was passed through a Millipore Centriprep filter chamber (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) per the manufacturer's instructions to remove serum proteins >50 kDa. To 6 ml of each filtered sample, 12 ml of 0.01 m ammonium phosphate buffer was added and brought to pH 8.0. Samples were then loaded onto preconditioned Bond Elut LRC CBA columns (Varian Associates, Harbor City, CA) and washed with 2 ml of 0.01 m ammonium phosphate buffer. To elute each sample, 1.5 ml of 0.1 n HCl in methanol was applied. Each eluate was dried on a Savant SpeedVac (Thermo-Savant, Holbrook, NY) for 1.5 h, reconstituted with 400 μl of double-distilled H2O, and injected (50 μl) onto the HPLC for analysis as described above. The data expressed as pmol/50 μl were converted to nmol/ml equivalents for 106 cells. Enzyme Activities–SSAT, ODC, and SAMDC enzyme activities were measured with soluble protein extracts as previously described (39Libby P.R. Ganis B. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 40Porter C.W. Cavanaugh Jr., P.F. Stolowich N. Ganis B. Kelly E. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2050-2057PubMed Google Scholar). SSAT was expressed as pmol of N1-[14C]acetylspermidine generated/min/mg of protein. ODC and SAMDC were expressed as nmol of [14C]O2 released/h/mg of protein. Spd Transport–This assay was performed as previously described (41Kramer D.L. Miller J.T. Bergeron R.J. Khomutov R. Khomutov A. Porter C.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were grown in 6-well coated dishes (BD Biosciences) in the absence and presence of Tet 48 h prior to assay, washed with serumfree RPMI 1640 medium, and placed on ice. Triplicate wells were exposed to 2 ml of [3H]Spd (220 cpm/pmol) mixed with cold Spd to final concentrations of 2 and 10 μm in RMPI 1640 medium and incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min (a time within the linear range of uptake for these concentrations). After three washes with PBS containing excess cold Spd, cells were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, neutralized with an equal volume of 0.1 n HCl, and counted using a scintillation detector (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Data were expressed as pmol/min/mg protein. Measurement of Acetyl-CoA and Malonyl-CoA–Coenzymes A were monitored using a high performance capillary electrophoresis as previously described (30Jell J. Merali S. Hensen M.L. Mazurchuk R. Spernyak J.A. Diegelman P. Kisiel N.D. Barrero C. Deeb K.K. Alhonen L. Patel M.S. Porter C.W. J. Biol.

Statistics–Analysis of data obtained from three or more separate experiments included averages ± S.D. values. Significant differences determined by Student's t test are indicated as p values <0.05 to compare basal SSAT with induced SSAT conditions. Effects of SSAT Overexpression on Polyamine Metabolic Parameters and Cell Growth–In the presence of Tet, the SSAT/LNCaP cells grew logarithmically with a doubling time of ∼25-30 h. Following Tet removal, SSAT activity was maximally induced by ∼50-fold at 24 h, after which growth inhibition became apparent (Fig. 1). Although the ∼50-fold induction in activity achieved with the Tet-regulatable SSAT plasmid-borne gene (Table 1) is probably higher than most physiological modulation of the endogenous gene, it is less than the increases seen with various pharmacological perturbations (32Seiler N.

Cripto is required for signaling by certain transforming growth factor-β superfamily members, such as Nodal, but also antagonizes others, such as activin. The opposing effects of Cripto on Nodal and activin signaling seem contradictory, however, because these closely related ligands utilize the same type I (ALK4) and type II (ActRII/IIB) receptors. Here, we have addressed this apparent paradox by demonstrating that Cripto forms analogous receptor complexes with Nodal and activin and functions as a noncompetitive activin antagonist. Our results show that activin-A and Nodal elicit similar maximal signaling responses in the presence of Cripto that are substantially lower than that of activin-A in the absence of Cripto. In addition, we provide biochemical evidence for complexes containing activin-A, Cripto, and both receptor types and show that the assembly of such complexes is competitively inhibited by Nodal. We further demonstrate that Nodal and activin-A share the same binding site on ActRII and that ALK4 has distinct and separable binding sites for activin-A and Cripto. Finally, we show that ALK4 mutants with disrupted activin-A binding retain Cripto binding and prevent the effects of Cripto on both activin-A and Nodal signaling. Together, our data indicate that Cripto facilitates Nodal signaling and inhibits activin signaling by forming receptor complexes with these ligands that are structurally and functionally similar.

TGF-β ligands exert their biological effects by binding and assembling two types of transmembrane receptors (type I and type II) with intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activities (3Shi Y. Massague J.

Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 970-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). There are five type II receptors and seven type I receptors; therefore, these receptors display varying degrees of promiscuity with regard to the ligands they bind (3Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4693) Google Scholar). Activin type II (ActRII and ActRIIB) and type I (ALK4) receptors are especially promiscuous and form signaling complexes with activins but also several other superfamily members, including GDF1, GDF3, GDF8 (myostatin), and Nodal (5Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Vale W.W. Robertson D.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 16: 73-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In cases where multiple TGF-β ligands share the same receptors, signaling specificity can be achieved via ligand-specific differences, including variable expression patterns, processing of mature ligands from propeptides, stabilities, receptor affinities, susceptibility to extracellular ligand traps, and modulation by co-receptor proteins (3Shi Y.

As an example, activin and Nodal utilize the same signaling receptors, but their mechanisms of ligand-mediated receptor assembly and use of co-receptor proteins differ significantly. On the one hand, activins initiate signaling by first binding ActRII/IIB with high affinity (7Mathews L.S. Vale W.W.

Science. 1994; 264: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). By contrast, Nodal lacks intrinsic affinity for ActRII/IIB and ALK4 and requires Cripto (Cripto-1, TDGF1) or a related co-receptor to facilitate its binding to these receptors (12Yeo C. Whitman M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13Schier A.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cripto is a small, GPI-anchored protein that possesses two modular cysteine-rich domains, an epidermal growth factor-like domain that binds Nodal and a CFC domain that binds ALK4 (13Schier A.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 589-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 15Shen M.M. Schier A.F.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5731-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Structure/function studies have shown that Nodal assembles type II and type I receptors only in the presence of Cripto. In fact, disruption of Nodal binding to the epidermal growth factor-like domain or ALK4 binding to the CFC domain completely abolishes Cripto-dependent Nodal signaling (12Yeo C. Whitman M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 17Minchiotti G. Manco G. Parisi S. Lago C.T. Rosa F. Persico M.G.

Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Following receptor assembly, propagation of activin and Nodal signals is thought to be essentially the same (i.e. ALK4 is phosphorylated and activated by the constitutively active ActRII/ActRIIB receptor kinase and in turn phosphorylates cytoplasmic Smad2 and Smad3 proteins). Once phosphorylated, Smad2 and Smad3 assemble into complexes together with Smad4 and then migrate into the nucleus, where they interact with transcription factors, co-activators, and corepressors to regulate transcription of target genes (3Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4693) Google Scholar). In contrast to its requirement for Nodal signaling, Cripto has been shown to antagonize activin signaling apparently by preventing activin from assembling its receptors (19Shen M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 500-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For example, we have demonstrated that Cripto forms complexes with activin-A and ActRII/IIB and reduces activin-A cross-linking to ALK4 (20Gray P.C. Harrison C.A. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5193-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This observation led us to propose a model in which Cripto inhibits activin-A signaling by competing with ALK4 for access to activin-A-ActRII/IIB complexes. Cripto was also shown to bind activin-B, and in this case it was proposed that Cripto inhibits activin-B signaling by forming nonproductive complexes with activin-B and/or ALK4 (21Adkins H.B. Bianco C. Schiffer S.G. Rayhorn P. Zafari M. Cheung A.E. Orozco O. Olson D. De Luca A. Chen L.L. Miatkowski K. Benjamin C. Normanno N. Williams K.P. Jarpe M. LePage D. Salomon D. Sanicola M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although these studies reported distinct inhibitory complexes, they each presented models in which Cripto competitively inhibits activin signaling by blocking receptor assembly. Notably, these models appear to be incompatible with the well documented role of Cripto as a Nodal co-receptor that facilitates receptor assembly. Specifically, it remains unclear how Cripto can form functional signaling complexes with Nodal while inhibiting activin-dependent receptor assembly. In the present study, we provide evidence supporting a new model that explains the seemingly contradictory effects of Cripto on activin and Nodal signaling. We demonstrate that Cripto is a noncompetitive activin antagonist and that activin and Nodal assemble Cripto-containing receptor complexes that are structurally and functionally similar. We also identify ALK4 mutants that bind Cripto and block its effects on activin-A and Nodal signaling. Together, our data suggest that Cripto functions as a molecular switch that causes cellular responses to activin and Nodal to converge via the formation of analogous signaling complexes. Materials–NuPAGE gels and molecular weight markers were obtained from Invitrogen. Recombinant human activin-A was generated using a stable activin-A-expressing cell line generously provided by Dr. J. Mather (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and was purified by Wolfgang Fischer (Peptide Biology Laboratory, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Recombinant mouse Nodal was purchased from R&D Systems. 125I-Activin-A was prepared using the chloramine T method as described previously (22Vaughan J.M. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2038-2050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody and protein G-agarose were purchased from Calbiochem. Polyclonal antibodies directed against ALK4 (23Tsuchida K. Vaughan J.M. Fischer W.H. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5493-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have been described. A polyclonal anti-Cripto antibody (6900) was produced in rabbits immunized with a peptide from the epidermal growth factor-like domain of Cripto (82CPPSFYGRNCEHDVRKE98). Anti-FLAG (M2) antibody and FLAG (M2)-agarose were from Sigma. Anti-phospho-Smad2, anti-Smad2/3, and anti-pan-actin antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG, anti-mouse IgG, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate, chemiluminescent substrate (Supersignal™), and the BCA protein assay kit were obtained from Pierce. All DNA constructs used in this study were in the pcDNA3.0 expression vector (Invitrogen). Expression Constructs–The mouse Cripto construct has been described (12Yeo C. Whitman M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and was a generous gift from Malcolm Whitman (Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The ΔCFC Cripto deletion mutant was generated using a previously described PCR strategy (24Harms P.W. Chang C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2624-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), in which the CFC domain was replaced with an in-frame BamHI site (GGATCC) encoding the amino acids Gly-Ser. The kinase-deleted ALK4 constructs (ALK4-trunc) encode the first 206 amino acids of ALK4 and were generated using standard PCR techniques, as previously described (25Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Koerber S.C. Fischer W. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21129-21135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similar standard PCR strategies were used to make kinase-deleted ActRII constructs (ActRII-trunc) and to introduce epitope tags (25Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Koerber S.C. Fischer W. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21129-21135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Gray P.C. Greenwald J. Blount A.L. Kunitake K.S. Donaldson C.J. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol.

Transfection and Detection of Cell Surface Protein Expression in HEK 293T Cells–HEK 293T cells were grown in 5% CO2 to 40–60% confluence in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 10% bovine calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine) on poly-l-lysine-coated wells or plates. Cells were transfected with indicated DNA constructs using Perfectin (Gene Therapy Systems). For Western blotting, cells were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing standard protease inhibitors. SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose were carried out using NuPAGE gels and a NOVEX X-cell II apparatus as described previously (26Gray P.C. Greenwald J. Blount A.L. Kunitake K.S.

To detect proteins expressed at the cell surface, intact cells were washed with Hepes dissociation buffer (HDB), blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/HDB, incubated with anti-FLAG antibody, washed with HDB, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Specific antibody staining was measured using the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate, as described previously (26Gray P.C. Greenwald J. Blount A.L. Kunitake K.S. Donaldson C.J. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3206-3212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays–Luciferase assays were carried out using the A3-luciferase reporter essentially as previously described (20Gray P.C. Harrison C.A. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5193-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The A3-luciferase construct contains three copies of the activin response element from the Xenopus laevis Mix.2 promoter linked to a basic TATA box and a luciferase reporter gene. HEK 293T cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well and transfected (Perfectin) in triplicate ∼24 h later with 500 ng of DNA/well using 10–400 ng of DNA constructs (indicated combinations of pcDNA 3.0 vector, Cripto, wild type (WT) or mutant ActRII-trunc, and WT or mutant ALK4-trunc) and 50 ng FAST2 (FoxH1), 25 ng of A3-luciferase, 25 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase. Cells were treated ∼24 h following the transfection and then harvested ∼16 h following treatment. Cells were incubated in solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min on ice, and luciferase reporter activity was measured and normalized relative to CMV-β-Gal activities. Smad2 Phosphorylation–HEK 293T cells were plated on 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. 24 h after plating, cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA (1 μg of vector and 1 μg of Cripto) using Perfectin. 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight prior to treatment. Cells were left untreated or treated for 30 min with the indicated doses of activin-A or Nodal. Cells were harvested by adding 150 μl of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 20 mm NaF, and standard protease inhibitors. Fifty μl of 4× SDS-PAGE loading buffer were then added to each sample, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose. Blots were treated with anti-phospho-Smad2 or anti-Smad2/3 antibodies, followed by anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. Covalent Cross-linking–HEK 293T cells were plated on 6-well plates coated with poly-l-lysine at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well. Approximately 24 h later, cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA/well (1 μg of ActRII-Myc, 0.5 μg of ALK4-untagged and 0.5 μg of WT-FLAG) using Perfectin and then incubated an additional 48 h before harvesting. Covalent cross-linking was performed by first washing cells in HDB (12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl) and then incubating cells with 125I-activin-A in binding buffer (HDB containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2) at room temperature for 4 h. Cells were washed with HDB and incubated in 0.5 mm disuccinimidyl suberate in HDB for 30 min on ice. Cross-linking reactions were quenched with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and then cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (TBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA) with lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation by using anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, or anti-ALK4 antibodies. Immune complexes were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For Nodal competition, cells were pretreated with 100 nm Nodal for 30 min prior to incubating cells with 125I-activin-A tracer. Alternatively, P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were plated on 10-cm plates coated with poly-l-lysine at 2 × 105 cells/well. Approximately 48 h later, covalent cross-linking was performed by first washing cells in HDB, treating with 10 nm cold activin-A, or leaving cells untreated and then incubating cells with 125I-activin-A in binding buffer at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were washed with HDB and incubated in 0.5 mm disuccinimidyl suberate in HDB for 30 min on ice. Cross-linking reactions were quenched with TBS, and cells were solubilized in lysis buffer. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Cripto or nonspecific rabbit IgG antibodies. Immune complexes were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Co-Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis–1 × 106 HEK 293T cells were plated in 10-cm plates. Approximately 24 h later, cells were transfected with 12 μg of DNA/plate (6 μg of vector or untagged WT or ΔCFC Cripto and 6 μg of vector or FLAG-tagged WT or mutant ALK4-trunc) using polyethyleneimine, and cells were incubated another 48 h before harvesting. Cells were lysed and scraped on ice in 0.8 ml of cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing standard protease inhibitors. Cellular lysates were precleared by centrifugation, and 75 μl of the total lysates were heated and frozen in 4× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (with dithiothreitol), whereas the remainder of the lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with FLAG (M2)-agarose. Precipitated complexes were washed three times with cold radioimmune precipitation buffer for 1 h each, eluted from beads, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose, followed by Western blotting using the Cripto antibody. Cripto Reduces Maximal Activin-A-dependent Luciferase Induction to a Level That Converges with That of Nodal–In order to compare the roles of Cripto as a co-receptor for Nodal and an inhibitor of activin-A signaling, 293T cells were transfected with the Smad2-responsive luciferase reporter A3-Lux and FAST2 (FoxH1) in the presence of vector or Cripto and then treated with a range of doses of each ligand. Consistent with previous reports that Nodal requires Cripto as an obligatory co-receptor (14Shen M.M. Development. 2007; 134: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), we did not observe Nodal signaling in the absence of Cripto even at the highest dose of 180 nm Nodal (Fig. 1A). By contrast, in the presence of Cripto, Nodal caused a dose-dependent induction of luciferase with an EC50 of ∼14 nm and a maximal induction of ∼20-fold basal (Fig. 1A). In parallel experiments, we measured the dose-response relationship for activin-A in the absence or presence of Cripto. In the absence of Cripto, maximal doses of activin-A elicited a robust ∼40-fold induction of luciferase, which was significantly larger than that observed in response to maximal doses of Nodal in the presence of Cripto (Fig. 1, A and B). Activin-A had an EC50 of ∼60 pm and was therefore nearly 250 times more potent than Nodal (EC50 ∼ 14 nm). Consistent with our previous findings (20Gray P.C. Harrison C.A. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5193-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), activin-A signaling was inhibited by the presence of Cripto, and this inhibition was observed at each dose of activin-A tested (Fig. 1B). However, the potency of activin-A in the presence of Cripto (EC50 of ∼41 pm) was essentially the same as in the absence of Cripto (EC50 of ∼60 pm), suggesting that activin-A affinity for the type II receptor (ActRII/IIB) was unaffected by Cripto. Notably, despite their disparate potencies, activin-A and Nodal displayed a similar maximal level of luciferase induction (∼20-fold basal) in the presence of Cripto (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, Cripto reduced the maximal signaling capacity of activin-A to a level similar to that of Nodal. Next, we asked how the level of Cripto expression in these cells affects Nodal and activin-A signaling. 293T cells were transfected with a range of doses of the Cripto expression vector, treated with 30 nm Nodal or 250 pm activin-A, and then resulting luciferase induction was measured. As shown in Fig. 1C, Nodal signaling increased as the level of Cripto DNA was increased, and this effect was mirrored by a corresponding decrease in the activin-A response. Strikingly, as Cripto DNA doses were increased, Nodal and activin-A responses converged at ∼20-fold basal (Fig. 1C). The Nodal and activin-A responses were indistinguishable following transfection of 300 or 500 ng of Cripto DNA (Fig. 1C), despite the fact that the level of cell surface Cripto expression was substantially higher following transfection with 500 ng of Cripto DNA than it was following transfection of 300 ng (Fig. 1D). Therefore, since maximal inhibition of activin-A signaling by Cripto was partial and achieved at submaximal Cripto levels, we conclude that Cripto is a noncompetitive activin-A antagonist. Cripto Reduces Activin-A-induced Smad2 Phosphorylation to a Level Similar to That of Nodal–In order to further compare the effects of Cripto on activin-A and Nodal signaling, we measured the relative ability of these ligands to activate Smad2 phosphorylation in the absence or presence of Cripto. In agreement with the luciferase data presented above, we have shown that transfection of Cripto is necessary for Nodal-induced Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2). By contrast, activin-A induced robust Smad2 phosphorylation in these cells in the absence of Cripto. Importantly, and consistent with the luciferase assays, transfection of Cripto into these cells reduced the extent of activin-A-induced Smad2 phosphorylation to a level resembling that of Nodal (Fig. 2). In summary, three novel conclusions can be drawn from these data measuring the effects of Cripto on Nodal and activin-A signaling: 1) activin-A has a higher intrinsic efficacy than Nodal; 2) Cripto does not change the potency (EC50) of activin-A but rather acts in a noncompetitive manner to reduce activin-A efficacy; and 3) the efficacies of activin-A and Nodal converge as Cripto expression increases. Activin-A Assembles Complexes Containing ActRII, ALK4, and Cripto–The similar magnitudes of activin-A and Nodal signaling responses in the presence of Cripto suggested that these ligands form structurally similar complexes containing Cripto and both receptor types. To test this, we transfected 293T cells with ActRII-Myc, ALK4, and/or Cripto-FLAG constructs, as indicated (Fig. 3), labeled them with 125I-activin-A, and then subjected them to covalent cross-linking. Resulting cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies targeting ActRII-Myc (Fig. 3A), ALK4 (Fig. 3B), or Cripto-FLAG (Fig. 3C). As expected, anti-Myc immunoprecipitation of ActRII led to the isolation of 125I-activin-A-labeled ActRII (lane 2), ActRII and ALK4 (lane 3), ActRII and Cripto (lane 4), and ActRII, ALK4, and Cripto (lane 5) (Fig. 3A). Although Cripto reduced cross-linking of activin-A to ALK4, it is notable that Cripto does not completely abolish this interaction, raising the possibility that Cripto may exist in a complex with activin-A and both receptor types (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 3 and 5). However, since ActRII was the target in the immunoprecipitation, we could not rule out the possibility that the labeled bands corresponding to ALK4 and Cripto (Fig. 3A, lane 5) were derived from distinct complexes consisting of activin-A-ActRII-Cripto or activin-A-ActRII-ALK4. This issue was resolved by immunoprecipitation with an anti-ALK4 antibody that resulted in the clear detection of labeled bands corresponding to ActRII, ALK4, and Cripto (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Since ALK4 and Cripto do not bind activin-A in the absence of ActRII (20Gray P.C. Harrison C.A. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5193-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), this result demonstrates that activin-A, ActRII, ALK4, and Cripto are each indeed present in the same complexes. This finding was further confirmed by our visualization of bands corresponding to 125I-activin-A-labeled ActRII, ALK4, and Cripto following anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3C, lane 3). Having shown that activin-A can form complexes with ActRII, ALK4, and Cripto when they are overexpressed in 293T cells, we attempted to demonstrate the formation of these complexes in cells expressing these proteins at endogenous levels. Mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells express relatively high levels of endogenous Cripto, and we therefore subjected these cells to 125I-activin-A labeling, covalent cross-linking, and immunoprecipitation using an antibody that targets Cripto. To control for nonspecific immunoprecipitation effects of rabbit antisera, we assessed the ability of rabbit IgG to immunoprecipitate similar complexes. As shown in Fig. 3D, 125I-activin-A-labeled bands corresponding to ActRII, ALK4, and Cripto were visualized following immunoprecipitation with an anti-Cripto antibody but not with nonspecific IgG (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the appearance of these labeled bands was almost completely abolished when cells were preincubated with 10 nm unlabeled activin-A. Significantly, this is the first evidence that demonstrates that activin-A can form receptor complexes that contain endogenous ActRII, ALK4, and Cripto. Nodal Competes with Activin-A for the Formation of Cripto-ActRII-ALK4 Complexes–Our results indicate that, like Nodal, activin-A can form complexes that contain both receptor types and Cripto. Given the apparent similarity of Cripto-containing activin and Nodal complexes, we reasoned that Nodal and activin-A might compete with each other to assemble receptor complexes containing Cripto. To test this possibility, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs (Fig. 4A) and then subjected to 125I-activin-A labeling in the absence or presence of 100 nm Nodal. As shown in Fig. 4A, pretreatment of cells with 100 nm Nodal substantially decreased the intensity of 125I-activin-A-labeled receptor and Cripto bands, as visualized following Cripto immunoprecipitation, indicating that Nodal competitively disrupted the formation"
https://openalex.org/W2007582317,"Steatotic livers are not used for transplantation because they have a reduced tolerance for ischemic events with reduced ATP levels and greater levels of cellular necrosis, which ultimately result in total organ failure. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) is highly expressed in steatotic livers and may be responsible for liver sensitivity to ischemia through mitochondrial and ATP regulation. To test this hypothesis, experiments were conducted in lean and steatotic (ob/ob), wild-type, and UCP2 knock-out mice subjected to total warm hepatic ischemi-a/reperfusion. Although ob/ob UCP2 knock-out mice and ob/ob mice have a similar initial phenotype, ob/ob UCP2 knock-out animal survival was 83% when compared with 30% in ob/ob mice 24 h after reperfusion. Serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations and hepatocellular necrosis were decreased in the ob/ob UCP2 knock-out mice when compared with ob/ob mice subjected to ischemia. Liver ATP levels were increased in the ob/ob UCP2 knock-out animals after reperfusion when compared with the ob/ob mice but remained below the concentrations from lean livers. Lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) increased after reperfusion most significantly in the steatotic groups, but the increase was not affected by UCP2 deficiency. These results reveal that UCP2 expression is a critical factor, which sensitizes steatotic livers to ischemic injury, regulating liver ATP levels after ischemia and reperfusion."

As such, plant PMMs are involved in ascorbic acid (AsA) biosynthesis and N-glycosylation. We report on the conditional phenotype of the temperature-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana pmm-12 mutant. Mutant seedlings were phenotypically similar to wild type seedlings when grown at 16–18 °C but died within several days after transfer to 28 °C. This phenotype was observed throughout both vegetative and reproductive development. Protein extracts derived from pmm-12 plants had lower PMM protein and enzyme activity levels. In vitro biochemical analysis of recombinant proteins showed that the mutant PMM protein was compromised in its catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km). Despite significantly decreased AsA levels in pmm-12 plants, AsA deficiency could not account for the observed phenotype. Since, at restrictive temperature, total glycoprotein patterns were altered and glycosylation of protein-disulfide isomerase was perturbed, we propose that a deficiency in protein glycosylation is responsible for the observed cell death phenotype.

Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes utilize GDP-mannose in the synthesis of complex structural carbohydrates. Accordingly, this sugar nucleotide contributes to the synthesis of different structural carbohydrates in plant cell walls (1Seifert G.J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and fulfills a key role in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid (AsA) in plants (2Wheeler G.L. Jones M.A. Smirnoff N.

GDP-mannose is also essential for post-translational modifications, such as protein glycosylation and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring in eukaryotes, because mannose, derived from GDP-mannose, is a crucial building block of the core glycan chain attached to the modified proteins (4Lerouge P.

Because of their involvement in such fundamental processes, mutations in PMM genes often lead to severe and pleiotropic phenotypes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant affected in the PMM homolog SEC53 is arrested in growth at restrictive temperature. In fact, SEC53 has been classified as an essential gene because of the lethal phenotype of its null mutant (6Bernstein M. Hoffmann W. Ammerer G. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2374-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Kepes F. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9155-9161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PMM gene deletion mutants of the protozoan parasite Leishmania mexicana remain viable but are no longer able to establish an infection (8Garami A. Mehlert A. Ilg T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8168-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In mouse, disruption of the PMM2 gene causes early embryonic lethality (9Thiel C. Lübke T. Matthijs G. von Figura K. Körner C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5615-5620Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and in humans mutations in PMM2 lie at the basis of Jaeken syndrome (also termed carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type Ia), a severe clinical disorder that provokes impaired neurological development and increased childhood mortality (10Van Schaftingen E. Jaeken J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In both S. cerevisiae and humans, defects in protein glycosylation due to lack of GDP-mannose have been pinpointed as the underlying cause for the observed phenotypes (7Kepes F. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9155-9161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Van Schaftingen E. Jaeken J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The AsA deficiency of the Arabidopsis thaliana vitamin c1 (vtc1) mutant demonstrated that GDP-mannose is also involved in the biosynthesis of AsA (11Conklin P.L. Norris S.R. Wheeler G.L. Williams E.H. Smirnoff N. Last R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4198-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The VTC1 locus encodes a GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMPP), the enzyme that produces GDP-mannose from mannose 1-phosphate and acts immediately downstream of PMM (Fig. 1). As a consequence, vtc1 plants contain only ∼25% of wild type AsA levels (11Conklin P.L. Norris S.R. Wheeler G.L. Williams E.H. Smirnoff N. Last R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4198-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 12Conklin P.L. Pallanca J.E. Last R.L. Smirnoff N. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Very recently, evidence has been provided for the role of PMM in AsA biosynthesis in plants (3Qian W. Yu C. Qin H. Liu X. Zhang A. Johansen I.E. Wang D. Plant J. 2007; 49: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Reduction of PMM expression levels through virus-induced gene silencing caused a substantial decrease in AsA content in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, whereas raising PMM expression levels using viral vector-mediated ectopic expression resulted in an increase in AsA content. Consistently, overexpression of PMM in Arabidopsis also increased AsA content. However, no Arabidopsis T-DNA insertional knock-out mutants were reported, and attempts to produce knockdown plants using RNA interference technology were unsuccessful, suggesting that the PMM gene is essential. This inability to obtain plants with permanently decreased PMM levels impeded further studies into the possible involvement of PMM in other cellular processes (3Qian W. Yu C. Qin H. Liu X. Zhang A. Johansen I.E. Wang D. Plant J. 2007; 49: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, we screened an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population of Arabidopsis seeds in search for ts mutations affecting plant growth and development. Screening for conditional mutants provides an unbiased means to identify essential genes. Contrary to null mutants generated via T-DNA insertional mutagenesis, conditional mutants generally allow for straightforward cultivation and propagation under specific (permissive) conditions. ts mutations are the most widely used type of conditional mutations and are usually characterized by a marked drop in activity of the gene product when the gene is expressed above (or below) a certain temperature. We describe the identification, positional cloning, and detailed characterization of a ts Arabidopsis mutant affected in the PMM gene. Upon exposure to restrictive temperature, pmm-12 mutant plants were marked by reduced PMM enzyme activity and protein levels, developmental arrest, and subsequent cell death. The pmm-12 mutant plants also had a lower AsA content, but it is demonstrated that this AsA deficit cannot account for the cell death phenotype. Instead, we propose that a ts deficiency in protein glycosylation is responsible for the observed cell death phenotype. Plant Material, Growth Conditions, and Screening Procedure—A. thaliana (L.) Heyhn. (ecotype Col-0) plants were grown either on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, including 10 g/liter sucrose or in soil at continuous light (∼60 μmol of photons m-2 s-1), unless otherwise stated. The permissive temperature used was either 16 or 18 °C, and the restrictive temperature was 28 °C. The pmm-12 line was generated by treating ∼200,000 seeds with 15 μm EMS for 24 h at 24 °C. Mutagenized seeds (M1) were subdivided into batches consisting of ∼1000 individual seeds (25 mg), grown at 18 °C, and allowed to self-pollinate, resulting in the corresponding M2 seed batches. For 150 M2 batches, aliquots of 25 mg of seeds were plated, grown at permissive temperature for 7 days, and subsequently screened for ts growth defects at restrictive temperature. Seedlings grown on MS medium containing 1 μm 1-naphthaleneacetic acid that showed growth defects within 4 days after transfer to restrictive temperature (compared with wild type) were considered putative mutants and subsequently rescued by transferring them back to the permissive temperature on fresh MS medium. Heritability of the observed phenotype was tested with M3 plants produced by self-fertilization of M2 plants of putative mutants. M3 seeds were used to characterize the identified mutants. For complementation, the AtPMM cDNA was first cloned into pDONR221 and subsequently cloned into the binary vector pK7WG2D (13Karimi M. Inzé D. Depicker A. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 193-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar) using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). M3 plants were transformed at permissive temperature via the floral dip method (14Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA Extraction—Individual plants were ground and mixed with 400 μl of buffer composed of 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, and 2% N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide, followed by a 60-min incubation at 65 °C. After 15 min on ice, samples were extracted once with 250 μl of chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24:1). The aqueous phase was mixed with 200 μl of isopropyl alcohol, and samples were centrifuged. The DNA pellet was rinsed once with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in 50 μl of 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1 mm EDTA. Map-based Cloning and Fine Mapping—To obtain pmm-12 mutants with a more homogeneous genetic background, pmm-12 M3 mutants were back-crossed (BC) into the Col-0 wild type genetic background. The resulting BC1 plants were self-fertilized to obtain BC1F2 seeds, and the 3:1 (wild type/mutant) segregation ratio was tested at restrictive temperature. Subsequently, mutant BC1F2 plants were rescued by transfer to soil and growth at the permissive temperature. Self-pollination of these mutant plants led to lines whose genetic background was purified by 50%. Homogeneity of the resulting BC M3 mutant lines was verified by growing at least 50 plants and checking the consistency of the mutant phenotype at restrictive temperature. To generate mapping populations, BC M3 mutant lines were reciprocally crossed with Landsberg erecta (Ler) wild type. In a first step, a genome-wide mapping procedure using the physical AFLP map described by Peters et al. (15Peters J.L. Cnops G. Neyt P. Zethof J. Cornelis K. Van Lijsebettens M. Gerats T. Theor. Appl. Genet. 2004; 108: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Peters J.L. Constandt H. Neyt P. Cnops G. Zethof J. Zabeau M. Gerats T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), was applied to 310 F2 plants to determine the chromosomal location of the PMM gene. All AFLP markers, including the 85 Col-0/Ler framework AFLP markers resulting from a standard set of AFLP SacI/MseI primer combinations, were generated as described (17Vuylsteke M. Peleman J.D. van Eijk M.J.T. Nat. Protocols. 2007; 2: 1387-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). AFLP markers were scored co-dominantly with the aid of the specific image analysis software AFLP-QuantarPro (Keygene Products, Wageningen, The Netherlands). For fine-mapping, a large population of 9,900 F2 segregants were phenotyped, and 1,317 F2 mutants (13.3%) were selected for further fine mapping of the mutant locus. In the case of a monogenic recessive trait, F2 mutants are the individuals of choice. These 1,317 mutant F2 segregants were subsequently genotyped for insertion/deletion (InDel) polymorphisms of the Cereon InDel collection (18Jander G. Norris S.R. Rounsley S.D. Bush D.F. Levin I.M. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In the subsequent steps, gradually decreasing subsets of recombinants were genotyped with pairs of InDel markers flanking the genomic area containing the PMM gene until no recombinants were left. InDel polymorphisms were scored co-dominantly. PCR primers were designed based on the Arabidopsis genome sequence (available on the World Wide Web) using Primer3 software (19Rozen S. Skaletsky H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conditions used for PCR amplification were as follows: 2 min at 94 °C; 10 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 63 °C, 30 s at 72 °C with a touch-down of 1 °C per cycle; 35 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 53 °C, 30 s at 72 °C; 2 min at 72 °C. Sequence Analysis—PCR primers were designed based on the Arabidopsis information resource (TAIR) annotation (available on the World Wide Web) using Primer3 software (19Rozen S. Skaletsky H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to amplify 500-bp exonic and intronic fragments having a minimal overlap of 100 bp. Amplicons were amplified by PCR using 50 ng of genomic DNA template, Silverstar DNA polymerase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), and a final concentration of 0.5 μm for each primer. The conditions used for the PCR amplification were as follows: 2 min at 95 °C; 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at Tm (depending on the primer sets), 2 min at 72 °C. PCR products were purified with ExoSAP-IT (U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, Ohio) and transferred to a 96-well PCR plate (∼10 ng/100 bp) together with 50 μm primer. After the plate had been dried at 65 °C for 30–120 min, sequencing mix and buffer were added. The conditions for a second PCR were as follows: 2 min at 95 °C; 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 48 °C, 2 min at 60 °C. Samples were sequenced with an automated sequencer (ABI3700 or ABI377; Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Production of Recombinant Proteins—The open reading frame of PMM (at2g45790) and its mutant isoforms were PCR-amplified using cDNA obtained from wild type or mutant plants as a template. The pmm-1 mutation was introduced using the ATGGCGGCGAAAATTCCCAG primer, the pmm-2 mutation with cDNA from pmm-12 plants, and the above primer adapted to the wild type sequence. Fragments were cloned into pDONR221, verified by DNA sequence analysis, and then cloned into pDEST17 using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). Escherichia coli (strain BL21(DE3)pLysE) harboring the various constructs were, by means of a preculture, inoculated at OD 0.15 in 5 ml of Luria broth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cultures were subsequently grown for 1.5 h at 37 °C and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 5 h of incubation at room temperature, 1 ml of bacteria was harvested. Recombinant proteins were purified with TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech), using 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1:1.5, w/v) as equilibration buffer and equilibration buffer including 250 mm imidazole as elution buffer. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (207602) Google Scholar). Enzyme Activity Assays—PMM activity was determined via a coupled assay; the conversion of mannose 1-phosphate to mannose 6-phosphate was coupled to the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH (catalyzed by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) through the activities of phosphomannose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. The reaction was monitored through the increase in absorbance at 340 nm as a result of the increase in NADPH. In planta PMM activity was determined essentially as described (21Hancock R.D. McRae D. Haupt S. Viola R. BMC Plant Biol. 2003; 3: 7.1-7.13Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In short, leaf tissue ground in liquid nitrogen was resuspended in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ethylene glycolbis(β-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1:1.5, w/v). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and sample supernatants were desalted on Sepharose G25 NAP5 columns (GE Healthcare). PMM activity was determined in a reaction mixture consisting of protein extract, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm NADP, 50 μm glucose 1,6-biphosphate (as a hexose biphosphate activator), 0.5 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.5 units/ml phosphoglucose isomerase, and 0.5 units/ml phosphomannose isomerase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the relevant concentration of d-mannose 1-phosphate, and the absorbance at 340 nm was recorded for 120 min. For each sample, material from at least 40 seedlings was pooled. In vitro activity of purified recombinant PMM was measured similarly in the same reaction mixture. The PMM content of each recombinant protein fraction was verified by protein gel blot analysis using penta-His antibody (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Ascorbate Measurements and Protein Gel Blotting—The AsA content of control and mutant Arabidopsis leaves was determined as described previously (22Vernon L.P. Anal. Chem. 1960; 32: 1144-1150Crossref Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 23Foyer C. Rowell J. Walker D. Planta. 1983; 157: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For concanavalin A (ConA) staining, 5 μg of total soluble (NAP5 column-purified) protein from Arabidopsis leaves was resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a Hybond ECL membrane (GE Healthcare). The membrane was incubated for 1 h in PBSCT buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Tween 20, pH 7.2) and then for 1 h in PBSCT buffer containing 0.1 mg/liter ConA conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). The membrane was washed five times for 5 min with PBSCT. ConA-binding glycoproteins were detected with Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Wild type and pmm-12 protein extracts for Western blotting were prepared as described (24Lukowitz W. Nickle T.C. Meinke D.W. Last R.L. Conklin P.L. Somerville C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Rabbit antiserum against Arabidopsis PMM was raised using purified recombinant protein as the antigen (Eurogentec). The AtPMM antibody was used at a dilution of 1:2,500, and antibodies against Arabidopsis protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and SKU5 were used at a dilution of 1:2,500 and 1:1,000, respectively. Reacting material was visualized with goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare), followed by a luminescence reaction (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For each sample, material from at least 40 seedlings was pooled. Identification of a ts Cell Death Mutant—An EMS-mutagenized population of ∼200,000 Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col-0) seeds was screened for deficiencies in growth and development when grown at a restrictive temperature of 28 °C. Candidate mutants with severe growth-related phenotypes were rescued by transfer to permissive temperature (16 to 18 °C) to allow self-pollination. M3 progenies were rescreened to confirm the heritability of the ts phenotype, resulting in the isolation of 12 ts lines. General phenotypic analysis allowed classification of the 12 mutants into two categories; one category consisted of four mutants, specifically impaired in the formation of particular plant organs, and the other consisted of eight mutants that were inhibited in overall plant growth. The observed phenotype was either reversible or irreversible, which, at restrictive temperature, resulted in growth arrest or lethality, respectively (25Vaeck, E. (2006) Ph.D. thesis, Ghent University, Gent, BelgiumGoogle Scholar). One of the identified mutants, initially designated defective in growth 1 (dgr1), showed a growth arrest followed by cell death at restrictive temperature. After back-crossing dgr1 M3 plants to Col-0 wild type plants, a segregation analysis of the BC1F2 families revealed the recessive nature of the mutation (data not shown). Map-based Cloning of the Mutant Locus—F2 mapping populations were obtained by reciprocal crosses of BC dgr1 mutant plants (Col-0) with Ler wild type plants. Each F1 cross was checked for heterozygosity with the SSLP marker “nga8” that is polymorphic between Col-0 and Ler (26Bell C.J. Ecker J.R. Genomics. 1994; 19: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Segregating F2 populations were used for the subsequent map-based cloning process. In a first step of the genome-wide mapping of dgr1, a total of 126 F2 plants, together with the BC dgr1 mutant plants (Col-0) and Ler as parental lines, were analyzed with an initial set of eight primer combinations (15Peters J.L. Cnops G. Neyt P. Zethof J. Cornelis K. Van Lijsebettens M. Gerats T. Theor. Appl. Genet. 2004; 108: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Segregation analysis of the 85 AFLP markers revealed complete linkage of the mutant phenotype to a 4.7-Mb region on chromosome II bordered by the upper flanking marker SM240_448.2 and the lower end of chromosome II. In the next step, 13 additional primer combinations, amplifying AFLP markers in the vicinity and within the defined region of interest, were used for further linkage analysis. This way, the region containing the mutant locus could be narrowed down to 1.3 Mb, delimited by SM26_495.4 and the lower end of chromosome II. Because analysis of eight additional AFLP markers did not result in the identification of further recombinants for the 1.3-Mb region, an additional population of 184 F2 plants was analyzed with other SacI/MseI AFLP markers polymorphic between Col-0 and Ler, localized within the defined 1.3-Mb interval. This step allowed mapping of the affected gene to a 673-kb region delineated by the upper flanking marker SM120_153.8 and the lower flanking marker SM190_142.6. AFLP markers SM61_107.7 and SM117_193.1, localized within the 673-kb region (Fig. 2), showed complete linkage to the mutant phenotype. For fine mapping of the mutant locus, an F2 population of 9,900 plants was grown. Since the DGR1 gene harbored a recessive mutation, homozygous and heterozygous wild type plants could not be distinguished solely based on their phenotypes. Therefore, to avoid the time-consuming step of self-fertilizing the relevant wild type recombinants and growing the F3 progeny to determine their genotype, we only used the mutant F2 individuals for subsequent analysis. In total, 1,317 F2 mutants (13.3%) were identified, harvested, and submitted to linkage analyses using InDel markers developed from the Cereon InDel collection (18Jander G. Norris S.R. Rounsley S.D. Bush D.F. Levin I.M. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Initially, two InDel polymorphisms (CER452389 and CER449256) flanking the previously defined 673-kb interval were identified and used to screen the F2 mutant population. Forty recombinants were isolated and subsequently analyzed with six additional InDel markers localized in the region delineated by the two originally flanking InDel markers. As a result, the interval could be narrowed down to 224 kb with CER452385 and CER452346 as the upper and the lower flanking marker, respectively. The remaining nine recombinants were screened with 11 additional InDel markers localized within the 224-kb interval, finally resulting in a 35-kb region delimited by CER449813 and CER452353/54 that contained the DGR1 gene (Fig. 2). According to the gene annotations for chromosome II in the Arabidopsis genome data base (available on the World Wide Web), the 35-kb region comprising the DGR1 gene encompassed 12 (putative) genes. To determine which of them carried the dgr1 mutation, the 35-kb region was sequenced both in the mutant and wild type background. In mutant plants, we detected two differences (G19A and G101A) in gene at2g45790, relative to the sequence of the bacterial artificial chromosome clone F4I18. In the remaining 11 genes, no differences were detected. To verify the presence of the two mutations, the at2g45790 gene was sequenced in 20 Col-0 plants and in the 40 mutant recombinants that had been identified and used during the fine mapping of dgr1. Both mutations were absent from the wild type gene and present in all 40 mutant recombinants (data not shown). The Mutant Locus Encodes a PMM—The at2g45790 gene that contained the two point mutations encoded a eukaryotic PMM. In the Arabidopsis genome, only one PMM gene is present (3Qian W. Yu C. Qin H. Liu X. Zhang A. Johansen I.E. Wang D. Plant J. 2007; 49: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, we will hereafter refer to the dgr1 mutant as the pmm-12 mutant. The two point mutations, designated pmm-1 and pmm-2, both occurred in the first exon. Comparison of wild type and mutant cDNAs and their deduced amino acid sequences revealed that point mutation pmm-1 resulted in a GGA to AGA codon change (codon 7), leading to a substitution of a neutral glycine residue with a basic arginine. The pmm-2 mutation resulted in a CGA to CAA codon change (codon 37), thereby replacing an arginine with a neutral glutamine (Fig. 3). PMMs are phosphotransferases belonging to the superfamily of haloalkanoic acid dehalogenases (27Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Members of the phosphotransferase branch share a conserved N-terminal DXDX(T/V) domain that is directly involved in the phosphoryl transfer (28Collet J-F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Both mutations were located outside this DXDX(T/V) motif. However, the pmm-2 mutation affected a highly conserved arginine residue, whereas the pmm-1 mutation involved the substitution of an apparently less conserved amino acid (Fig. 3). Complementation and Identification of a T-DNA Insertional Mutant—To confirm that the mutations in the at2g45790 locus were responsible for the pmm-12 phenotype, homozygous pmm-12 plants were transformed with a construct containing the wild type at2g45790 coding region under control of the CaMV 35 S promoter. T2 seeds with a 3:1 segregation ratio on selective medium, indicative of a single insertion locus, also unambiguously displayed a 3:1 phenotypic segregation ratio when grown on nonselective medium at restrictive temperature (data not shown). This indicated that the pmm-12 mutant phenotype could be complemented by overexpression of the at2g45790 locus. We retrieved the T-DNA insertion line 045D04 from the GABI-Kat collection (29Rosso M.G. Li Y. Strizhov N. Reiss B. Dekker K. Weisshaar B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 53: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). This line contains an insertion 5 bp upstream from the start codon of the PMM gene, as verified via the standard GA"

(2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 29766–29776). In this work experiments were undertaken with manganese-containing cyt b5 (Mn-cyt b5) to test this hypothesis. Because Mn-cyt b5 does not undergo oxidation state changes under our experimental conditions, interpretation of the experimental results was unambiguous. The rate of electron transfer from cyt P450 reductase to ferric cyt P450 2B4 was decreased by Mn-cyt b5 in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, reduction of cyt P450 2B4 by cyt P450 reductase was incomplete in the presence of Mn-cyt b5. At a Mn-cyt b5:cyt P450 2B4:cyt P450 reductase molar ratio of 5:1:1, the rate of reduction of ferric cyt P450 was decreased by 10-fold, and only 30% of the cyt P450 was reduced, whereas 70% remained oxidized. It could be demonstrated that Mn-cyt b5 had its effect by acting on cyt P450, not the reductase, because the reduction of cyt c by cyt P450 reductase in the presence of Mn-cyt b5 was not effected. Furthermore, under steady-state conditions in the cyt P450 reconstituted system, Mn-cyt b5, which lacks the ability to reduce oxyferrous cyt P450 2B4, was unable to stimulate the activity of cyt P450. Mn-cyt b5 only inhibited the cyt P450 2B4 activity. In conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis studies and experiments that strongly suggested that cyt b5 competed with cyt P450 reductase for binding to cyt P450, the current investigation demonstrates unequivocally that cyt b5 inhibits the activity of cyt P450 2B4 by preventing cyt P450 reductase from binding to cyt P450, a prerequisite for electron transfer from cyt P450 reductase to cyt P450 and catalysis.

Microsomal cytochromes (cyt) 3The abbreviations used are:cytcytochrome P450cyt b5cytochrome b5CPRNADPH-cytochrome P450 reductaseDLPCdilauroylphosphatidylcholineMn-cyt b5manganese protoporphyrin IX cytochrome b5NHEnormal hydrogen electrodeeqequivalent. P450, functioning as monooxygenases, catalyze the oxidative biotransformation of numerous pharmaceuticals, carcinogens, pro-carcinogens, and endogenous compounds like fatty acids and steroids. Cyts P450 require two electrons and two protons to carry out catalysis that leads to insertion of a single oxygen atom into the substrate. In the mammalian microsomal cyt P450 system, the two electrons are delivered to cyt P450 by NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). Like cyt P450, CPR is membrane-bound and located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. CPR contains two flavin molecules, FMN and FAD. The diflavin moiety of CPR is essential for sequential electron transfer to cyt P450 as it permits CPR to accept two electrons from NADPH and transfer one electron at a time to cyt P450. The first electron from CPR reduces ferric cyt P450 to ferrous cyt P450, which rapidly binds oxygen to form oxyferrous cyt P450. The second electron is then delivered to oxyferrous cyt P450. This is followed by protonation of the reduced oxyferrous intermediate leading to heterolytic cleavage of the oxygen bond to form water and an oxyferryl intermediate, the putative, active, oxidizing species of cyt P450. An oxygen atom is inserted into the substrate, and the more hydrophilic product dissociates from the enzyme. Readers are referred to a recent review for further details about the cyt P450 reaction cycle (1Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. Schlichting I. Chem.

An alternative electron donor to cyt P450 is cyt b5, another microsomal hemoprotein also located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Because of its relatively high mid-point redox potential (+25 mV versus NHE), cyt b5 can deliver only the second electron to oxyferrous cyt P450 but not the first electron to ferric cyt P450. It has been recognized for 3 decades that cyt b5 may either increase, decrease, or not alter the activity of selected cyts P450 (2Schenkman J.B. Jansson I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 3Zhang H. Myshkin E. Waskell L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cyt b5 has been reported to affect the catalytic activity of more than 20 cyt P450 isoforms, including the majority of the human drug-metabolizing cyt P450 isoforms like cyt P450 3A4, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, and 2E1 (1Denisov I.G.

Ther. 2003; 97: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 9Canova-Davis E. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2541-2546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of cyt P450 2B4 and 2E1, the electron donating properties of cyt b5 are required for its stimulatory activity (6Yamazaki H. Gillam E.M. Dong M.S. Johnson W.W. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T.

Dispos. 1984; 12: 358-364PubMed Google Scholar), although some studies suggest that apo-cyt b5 can stimulate the activity of cyt P450 3A4 via an allosteric effect (12Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27438-27444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). At present, the ability of apo-cyt b5 to stimulate cyt P450 3A4 is controversial (13Guryev O.L. Gilep A.A. Usanov S.A. Estabrook R.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5018-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Experiments performed in the reconstituted system with purified proteins have demonstrated that ferrous cyt b5 can rapidly reduce oxyferrous cyt P450 2B4 (14Bonfils C. Balny C. Maurel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9457-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pompon D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15377-15385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that cyt P450 2B4 forms a 1:1 complex with CPR and with cyt b5 in a purified, reconstituted system (16Tamburini P.P. White R.E. Schenkman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4007-4015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17French J.S. Guengerich F.P. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4112-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A site-directed mutagenesis study of the interactions of cyt P450 2B4 with CPR and cyt b5 has identified residues, primarily in the C-helix on the proximal side of cyt P450 2B4, that participate in binding both CPR and cyt b5 (18Bridges A. Gruenke L. Chang Y.T. Vakser I.A. Loew G. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17036-17049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that CPR and cyt b5 have nonidentical but nevertheless overlapping binding sites on the proximal surface of cyt P450 2B4 and predict that cyt b5 and CPR will compete for this binding site. On the basis of a cross-linking study with a carbodiimide, Schenkman and co-workers (19Tamburini P.P. Schenkman J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have proposed a two-site model, hypothesizing that cyt b5 and CPR bind at two distinct, functional sites on cyt P450 and form a ternary complex. Recently we investigated the interaction of cyt P450 2B4 with CPR and cyt b5 by examining product formation under both single turnover and steady-state conditions in an effort to understand the complex effects of cyt b5 on cyt P450 2B4 catalysis (20Zhang H. Im S.-C. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29766-29776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It was possible to demonstrate under single turnover conditions that catalysis by cyt P450 2B4 occurred faster in the presence of cyt b5 than with CPR and that at high concentrations cyt b5 appeared to displace CPR from cyt P450 2B4. These observations suggested an explanation for the results under steady-state conditions where cyt b5 stimulated product formation at low concentrations but inhibited activity at higher concentrations. The stimulatory activity at low cyt b5 concentrations was attributed to the ability of cyt b5 to mediate a more rapid formation of product, thereby decreasing side product (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) formation. This meant that the efficiency of catalysis increased, i.e. more NADPH was used to form product rather than side products. Inhibition of product formation and NADPH consumption at high levels of cyt b5 was attributed to the ability of cyt b5 to bind to the proximal surface of cyt P450 2B4 and prevent CPR from binding and reducing ferric cyt P450 2B4. Site-directed mutagenesis data demonstrating that cyt b5 and CPR shared an overlapping binding site on cyt P450 2B4 supported the hypothesis that cyt b5 and CPR compete for a binding site on cyt P450 2B4 (18Bridges A. Gruenke L. Chang Y.T. Vakser I.A. Loew G. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17036-17049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because CPR is also known to reduce cyt b5, it could be argued that cyt b5 inhibited cyt P450 activity by binding directly to CPR and preventing CPR from reducing cyt P450 2B4. If cyt b5 stimulates activity by enhancing the rate of catalysis compared with CPR and inhibits cyt P450 activity by binding directly to cyt P450 but not CPR as hypothesized, then Mn-cyt b5, which does not undergo oxidation or reduction under our experimental conditions, should only inhibit, not stimulate, activity in the purified, reconstituted system. Furthermore, Mn-cyt b5 should significantly decrease the reduction of ferric cyt P450 2B4 by CPR, but should not decrease the ability of CPR to reduce its redox partner cyt c. The results presented in this work demonstrate the following: 1) that Mn-cyt b5 does not stimulate the activity of cyt P450 2B4 under steady-state conditions, and 2) that Mn-cyt b5 inhibits the reduction of ferric cyt P450 but not cyt c by CPR, confirming that, under steady-state conditions, cyt b5 stimulates activity by enhancing the rate of catalysis by cyt P450 2B4 and that cyt b5 inhibits activity by binding to cyt P450 2B4 and preventing CPR from binding and reducing it. Chemicals—All chemicals were of the highest purity available unless otherwise specified. NADPH, benzphetamine, sodium dithionite, and horse heart cytochrome c were purchased from Sigma. Dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) was purchased from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratory (Toronto, Canada). Carbon monoxide gas (purity > 99.5%) was purchased from Matheson Tri-Gas (Parsippany, NJ). Mn(III) protoporphyrin IX chloride was purchased from Frontier Scientific Inc. (Logan, UT). Re-distilled glycerol was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Protein Expression and Purification—Cyt P450 2B4, cyt b5, and CPR were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (20Zhang H. Im S.-C. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29766-29776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The concentration of cyt P450 was determined using an extinction coefficient of Δϵ450–490 nm of 91 mm cm–1 as described by Omura and Sato (21Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of CPR was determined using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm cm–1 at 456 nm for the oxidized enzyme (22Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2694-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of cyt b5 was determined using an extinction coefficient of 185 mm–1 cm–1 between ferrous and ferric cyt b5 (23Estabrook R.W. Werringloer J. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Kinetics of the Reduction of Ferric Cyt P450 2B4 by CPR in the Presence of Various Concentrations of Holo-cyt b5—The rate of electron transfer from CPR to ferric cyt P450 2B4, or the first electron transfer, was measured to probe the interaction between cyt P450 2B4, CPR, and cyt b5. The kinetics were determined with stopped-flow spectrophotometry by monitoring the absorbance increase at 450 nm as a result of formation of the ferrous cyt P450-CO adduct following reduction of ferric cyt P450 by CPR. The stopped-flow experiments were performed with a Hi-Tech SF61DX2 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Hi-Tech, Wiltshire, UK) housed in an anaerobic chamber (Belle Technology, Dorset, UK) as reported previously (24Oprian D.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8935-8944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The temperature of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer reaction chamber and observation cell was maintained at 30 °C using a circulating water bath. Cyt P450 2B4, CPR, and cyt b5 (when present) were pre-mixed by incubating cyt P450 (3 μm), CPR (3 μm), and various concentrations of cyt b5 (0–15 μm) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, buffer containing 15% glycerol, 0.18 mm DLPC, and 1 mm benzphetamine at 4 °C overnight. The anaerobic protein mixture was rapidly mixed with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 15% glycerol, 1 mm benzphetamine, and 3 μm NADPH. Both solutions had been saturated with CO by blowing CO gas over the sample solutions. The absorbance change at 450 nm was recorded as a function of time. Reduction of Ferric Cyt b5 by Ferrous Cyt P450-CO—The kinetics of the reduction of ferric cyt b5 by ferrous cyt P450-CO were determined with a stopped-flow spectrophotometer, basically as described for reduction of ferric cyt P450 2B4 by CPR. The experiment was performed under anaerobic conditions to avoid possible side reactions involving oxygen. Cyt P450 2B4 was reduced with a stoichiometric amount of dithionite in a tonometer. The ferrous cyt P450 solution was saturated with CO gas to form the cyt P450-CO adduct. Cyt P450-CO and ferric cyt b5 were loaded into separate syringes in the stopped-flow instrument. The transient spectra were recorded with a photodiode array detector following rapid mixing of ferric cyt b5 with cyt P450-CO. The absorbance was also measured in the single wavelength mode at 450 nm. The final concentration of cyt b5 and cyt P450 after mixing was 5 μm in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 15% glycerol. Preparation of Full-length and Soluble Mn-Cyt b5—The full-length Mn-cyt b5 was prepared by reconstituting full-length apo-cyt b5 with Mn(III) protoporphyrin IX as described by Morgan and Coon (11Morgan E.T. Coon M.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1984; 12: 358-364PubMed Google Scholar). The heme of cyt b5 was removed from holo-cyt b5 by acidifying the cyt b5-containing solution to pH 2.0, and the dissociated heme was extracted from the aqueous solution with 2-butanone. Apo-cyt b5 was then reconstituted with Mn(III) protoporphyrin IX at molar ratio of 2:1 to apo-cyt b5. Mn-cyt b5 was recovered from a Sephadex G-25 size-exclusion column where free Mn(III) protoporphyrin was bound. Soluble Mn-cyt b5 was prepared by reconstitution of soluble bovine apocytochrome b5 with Mn(III) protoporphyrin IX as described previously (25Gruenke L.D. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7114-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The concentration of Mn-cyt b5 was determined using an extinction coefficient of 57 mm–1cm–1 at 469 nm (25Gruenke L.D. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7114-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Kinetics of Reduction of Ferric Cyt P450 2B4 by CPR in the Presence of Full-length Mn-Cyt b5—The kinetics of reduction of ferric cyt P450 by CPR in the presence of Mn-cyt b5 was measured in the same way as in the presence of holo-cyt b5 as described above. Because it is redox-silent under our experimental conditions, Mn-cyt b5 does not participate in the electron transfer processes and does not undergo spectral changes under the experimental conditions. It is therefore possible to deconvolute the end point spectra recorded in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer as only 1 m eq of NADPH was used in the reaction. Deconvolution of the spectra by linear regression gives the concentration of each species at the end of the reaction. The concentration of each species at the end of the reaction was obtained by iterative regression of the observed spectrum as a linear combination of the standard spectrum of each species. When all three proteins were present, theoretically there are six possible species at the end of the reaction, including cyt P450-CO, ferric cyt P450 in the presence of 1 mm benzphetamine, oxidized Mn-cyt b5, reduced Mn-cyt b5, 1-electron-reduced CPR, and 2-electron-reduced CPR. The observed spectrum, Aobs, is expressed as in Equation 1, Aobs=∑i=1i=6∈i×Ci×I(Eq. 1) where ϵi and Ci represent the extinction coefficient and concentration of each of the six species, and l is the 1-cm path length. Linear regression was performed with SigmaPlot software (Systat Inc., San Jose, CA). Because of the low extinction coefficient of the 1- and 2-electron-reduced forms of CPR, it was not possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the amount present. Kinetics of Reduction of Cyt c by CPR in the Presence of Full-length Mn-Cyt b5—The effect of Mn-cyt b5 on reduction of cyt c by CPR was studied to examine whether Mn-cyt b5 forms a tight complex with CPR, capable of diminishing the ability of CPR to transfer electrons to cyt P450. A solution containing 8 μm of CPR and full-length Mn-cyt b5 (4, 8, 16, 24, and 40 μm) was preincubated at 4 °C overnight at the specified concentration in a glove box in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, that contained 15% glycerol and a 60-fold molar excess of DLPC with respect to CPR. The concentration of CPR in syringe 1 of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer was 8 μm before mixing, whereas the concentration of Mn-cyt b5 varied from 0 to 40 μm. The pre-mixed CPR and Mn-cyt b5 were rapidly mixed with an equal volume of the 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 15% glycerol, that contained cyt c (8 μm) and NADPH (8 μm). The kinetics of cyt c reduction were monitored at 550 nm, using an Δϵ of 21.1 mm–1cm–1 at 550 nm between ferric and ferrous cyt c (26Van G.B. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 58: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Measurement of the Activity of Cyt P450 2B4 Under Steady-state Conditions in the Presence of Full-length Mn-Cyt b5—The rates of NADPH consumption and benzphetamine metabolism in the presence of Mn-cyt b5 were determined under steady-state conditions in the purified reconstituted cyt P450 2B4 system at 30 °C as described earlier (20Zhang H. Im S.-C. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29766-29776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by adding excess NADPH to a final concentration of 0.3 mm and terminated after 5 min by adding 70% trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%. The amount of formaldehyde produced from metabolism of benzphetamine was analyzed with Nash's reagent as described (27Nash T. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4127) Google Scholar). NADPH consumption was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6.2 mm–1cm–1. Data Analysis—Apparent rate constants and amplitudes for the rate of electron transfer from CPR to ferric cyt P450 and cyt c were obtained by fitting the absorbance changes at the selected wavelength as a single or double exponential function using SigmaPlot software (Systat Inc.). Electron Transfer from CPR to Ferric Cyt P450 in the Presence of Holo-cyt b5—In an attempt to test our hypothesis that cyt b5 inhibited the activity of cyt P450 2B4 by preventing cyt P450 reductase from binding to and reducing cyt P450 2B4, the rate of electron transfer from CPR to ferric cyt P450 was measured in the presence of cyt b5. The reduction of ferric cyt P450 2B4 was measured in the presence of carbon monoxide and 1 m eq of NADPH in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Reduction of CPR by NADPH (k ≅ 28 s–1) and the binding of CO to ferrous cyt P450 (k ≅ 100 s–1) occur significantly faster than reduction of cyt P450 2B4. Therefore, the rate of electron transfer to cyt P450 2B4 can be determined by observing the absorbance changes at 450 nm after mixing the pre-formed cyt P450-CPR complex with NADPH in the presence of CO (28Gray R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4364-4369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vatsis K.P. Oprian D.D. Coon M.J. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1979; 38: 459-473PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the absorbance changes at 450 nm during the course of the first electron transfer to cyt P450 in the presence of various concentrations of holo-cyt b5. Reduction of ferric cyt b5, which also occurs under these conditions, was monitored at 422 nm as shown in Fig. 1B. As expected, ferric cyt P450 was reduced by CPR biphasically in the absence of cyt b5. The biphasic rate constants are 4.1 and 0.51 s–1, and the amplitude of the fast phase, k1, is 81% (see Table 1). This result is similar to that reported by other investigators (29Vatsis K.P. Oprian D.D. Coon M.J. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1979; 38: 459-473PubMed Google Scholar, 30Backes W.L. Reker-Backes C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 247-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of holo-cyt b5, the rate of reduction of ferric cyt P450 2B4 decreases as observed for cyt P450 1A2 and 2E1 (31Guengerich F.P. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14741-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A 5-fold molar excess of cyt b5 completely eliminated formation of the cyt P450-CO complex as evidenced by the absence of an absorbance increase at 450 nm. In fact, a small decrease in absorbance was observed at this concentration, which reflects partial reduction of the excess cyt b5 (32Spatz L. Strittmatter P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). With higher concentrations of cyt b5, the absorbance at 422 nm increased rapidly. The absorbance change at 422 nm in the presence of cyt b5 is a net result of reduction of cyt b5 and formation of cyt P450-CO. The former process results in an absorbance increase at 422 nm (Δϵ = 110 mm–1cm–1), whereas the latter results in an absorbance decrease (Δϵ =–20 mm–1cm–1) as shown by the absorbance decrease in the absence of cyt b5 (Fig. 1B, solid line). The increase in absorbance at 422 nm demonstrates that cyt b5 is reduced. In the presence of a 5-fold excess of cyt b5, cyt b5 is reduced at an apparent rate constant of 1.2 s–1.TABLE 1The rate constants and amplitudes observed during the electron transfer process from CPR to ferric cyt P450 in the presence of varying amounts of the membrane form cyt b5 at 30 °CConcentrationλobsPhase IPhase IIP450CPRCyt b5k1A1k2A2μmμmμm%%1.51.504504.1 ± 0.3281 ± 70.51 ± 0.05719 ± 3.51.51.50.754504.0 ± 0.5260 ± 50.73 ± 0.09140 ± 54220.39 ± 0.04100 ± 111.51.51.54501.7 ± 0.1349 ± 60.54 ± 0.06551 ± 84220.60 ± 0.04100 ± 121.51.53.04500.38 ± 0.05100 ± 84220.69 ± 0.09100 ± 131.51.54.54500.25 ± 0.042100 ± 114220.87 ± 0.056100 ± 141.51.57.54504221.2 ± 0.23100 ± 12 Open table in a new tab The decrease in the rate of reduction of ferric cyt P450 in the presence of cyt b5 is the net result of the following processes: 1) cyt b5 binding to the proximal surface of cyt P450 2B4, which inhibits the binding of CPR; 2) oxidation of cyt P450-CO by ferric cyt b5; and 3) reduction of cyt b5 by CPR. The three simultaneous reactions occurring under the experimental conditions are illustrated in Scheme 1. It is well documented that CPR reduces cyt b5 (33Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 440: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Wu F.F. Vergeres G. Waskell L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Peterson et al. (35Peterson J.A. White R.E. Yasukochi Y. Coomes M.L. O'Keeffe D.H. Ebel R.E. Masters B.S. Ballou D.P. Coon M.J. J. Biol.

A rate of 45 s–1 was calculated for oxidation of the CO adduct of cyt P450 1A2 by ferric cyt b5 based on kinetic simulation (31Guengerich F.P. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14741-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To better understand the relative importance of the different electron transfer processes, we have directly measured the rate of reduction of ferric cyt b5 by cyt P450 2B4-CO. Reduction of Ferric Cyt b5 by Ferrous Cyt P450-CO—Experiments were performed anaerobically in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer to directly measure the rate of reduction of ferric cyt b5 by ferrous cyt P450-CO by mixing equimolar amounts of cyt P450-CO with ferric cyt b5. The results are presented in Fig. 2. As shown, the absorbance at 450 nm bleaches whereas the absorbance at 422 and 555 nm increases over time (Fig. 2A). The bleaching at 450 nm indicates that CO dissociates from cyt P450, presumably because of oxidation of ferrous cyt P450 to ferric cyt P450, whereas the increase in intensity at 422 and 555 nm is indicative of reduction of cyt b5. The absorbance change at 450 nm is fit to give biphasic rate constants of 0.6 and 0.1 s–1 (fast phase, 45%). Fitting the kinetic trace at 422 nm gave rate constants of 0.8 and 0.2 s–1 (fast phase, 50%). The simultaneous change in absorbance at 450 and 422 nm indicates that electron transfer from ferrous cyt P450-CO to ferric cyt b5 occurs without an observable intermediate. Approximately 40% of the cyt P450-CO is oxidized under these conditions. The rate of electron transfer from ferrous cyt P450 2B4 to ferric cyt b5 in the absence of CO was reported to be ∼2.7 and 0.44 s–1 at 5 °C (15Pompon D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15377-15385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The slower oxidation of cyt P450-CO by ferric cyt b5 may result from the increased redox potential of cyt P450-CO or the slow dissociation of CO from cyt P450-CO and subsequent reduction of cyt b5 by ferrous cyt P450.

NTE was originally identified as target enzyme for organophosphorus compounds that cause a delayed paralyzing syndrome with degeneration of nerve axons. Here we show that the structurally related murine protein NTE-related esterase (NRE) is a potent lysophospholipase. The enzyme efficiently hydrolyzes sn-1 esters in lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidic acid. No lipase activity was observed when triacylglycerols, cholesteryl esters, retinyl esters, phosphatidylcholine, or monoacylglycerol were used as substrates. Although NTE is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, we found the highest NRE mRNA levels in testes, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and adipose tissue. Induction of NRE mRNA concentrations in these tissues during fasting suggested a nutritional regulation of enzyme expression and, in accordance with this observation, insulin reduced NRE mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A green fluorescent protein-NRE fusion protein colocalized to the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets. Thus, NRE is a previously unrecognized ER- and lipid droplet-associated lysophospholipase. Regulation of enzyme expression by the nutritional status and insulin suggests a role of NRE in the catabolism of lipid precursors and/or mediators that affect energy metabolism in mammals.

Patatin domain (Pfam01734)-containing enzymes comprise a large number of proteins from bacteria to men and can be divided by bootstrap techniques into six families (1Smirnova E. Goldberg E.B. Makarova K.S. Lin L. Brown W.J. Jackson C.L. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The patatin domain is characterized by comprising a canonical α/β hydrolase fold and a GXSXG motif, both common structural features of lipases. The eponym of patatin domain-containing proteins is the potato tuber storage protein patatin (2Shewry P.R. Ann. Bot.

Patatin has a Ser-Asp catalytic dyad instead of the classical catalytic triad observed in most lipid hydrolases. Patatin domain-containing proteins were found in bacteria, fungi, plants, as well as animals from flies to mammals. The family of mammalian patatin domain-containing proteins was officially named “patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing” (PNPLA) and comprises nine members divided into three subgroups (3Wilson P.A. Gardner S.D. Lambie N.M. Commans S.A. Crowther D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1940-1949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The first group PNPLA1-5 includes patatin-like phospholipase containing 1 (PNPLA1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL, also called desnutrin, TTS2.2, PNPLA2, and iPLA2z), adiponutrin (PNPLA3), GS2 (PNPLA4), and GS2-like (PNPLA5). Members of this subfamily were shown to act as triacylglycerol lipases (ATGL, GS-2, and adiponutrin) (4Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A.

ATGL-deficient animals exhibited a major defect in the catabolism of stored TG in adipose and non-adipose tissues resulting in a multisystemic TG accumulation, obesity, cardiac dysfunction, and premature death. The second group of proteins includes two phospholipases, PLA2G6 (PNPLA9), iPLA2γ (PNPLA8), and a pseudogene (PNPLA10) (3Wilson P.A. Gardner S.D. Lambie N.M. Commans S.A. Crowther D.J. J.

The NTE family has a distinct evolutionary origin from that of the other mammalian patatin-like lipase subfamilies that is consistent with the different domain architecture of NTE family members compared with other PNPLAs and its closer relation to bacterial patatin-like proteins (1Smirnova E.

OPIDN is characterized by the degeneration of long axons in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves (16Glynn P. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Symptoms include lack of muscular coordination, weakness, and paralysis of the lower limbs. Sensitive species include human, pig, sheep, cat, dog, and chicken whereas mice and rats appear refractory to OPIDN (16Glynn P. Prog.

Tissue-specific deletion of NTE in murine brain provoked severe neuropathologic symptoms in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum and led to disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum, vacuolation of nerve cell bodies, and abnormal reticular aggregates suggesting a central role of this enzyme in phospholipid metabolism in the nervous system (19Akassoglou K.

A similar role was indicated for the Drosophila orthologue Swiss Cheese (SWS) (20Muhlig-Versen M. da Cruz A.B. Tschape J.A. Moser M. Buttner R. Athenstaedt K. Glynn P. Kretzschmar D. J.

SWS mutant flies show spongiform lesions within the CNS, glial hyperwrapping around neurons, and neuronal apoptosis. Recently, it was found that NTE also has an important function in mammalian renal cells (22Gallazzini M. Ferraris J.D. Kunin M. Morris R.G. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15260-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). High NaCl concentrations in the renal inner medulla induce an increase of glycerophosphocholine (GPC), an organic osmolyte and osmoprotective compatible that is derived from PC. NTE was shown to contribute to the increased production and accumulation of GPC in mammalian renal cells. In contrast to NTE, neither the enzymatic properties nor the physiologic role of NRE has been studied so far. Here, we show that murine NRE is a potent lysophospholipase that is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue, muscle, and testis. Regulation of NRE by the nutritional status and by insulin suggests a role of this enzyme in energy metabolism.

All reagents used were of “per analysis” grade. Animals—Adult male C57BL/6 mice between 12 and 16 weeks of age were maintained on a regular light-dark cycle (14 h light, 10 h dark) and fed a standard laboratory chow diet (4.5% wt/wt fat). Tissue samples were collected from fed (ad libitum access to food and water overnight) or fasted (food was removed for 16 h) animals between 9 and 10 AM. cDNA Cloning of Recombinant-tagged Proteins—Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissue using the TRIzol® Reagent procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from liver and brain total RNA using the Oligotex® mRNA Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The mRNA was transcribed into first-strand cDNA using SuperScript™ Reverse Transcriptase protocol from Invitrogen. Second-strand cDNA was obtained on a first-strand template by adding Escherichia coli DNA ligase buffer, E. coli DNA ligase, E. coli DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), and dNTPs (Carl Roth GmbH & Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) to the mixture (total 100 μl) and incubation at 16 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was added, and the mixture was further incubated for 20 min at 16 °C to obtain blunt-end cDNA. Full-length coding sequences of NRE and NTE were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using liver or brain cDNA as template, respectively. Primers were designed according to the sequence of the murine NRE gene (GenBank™ accession: NM_146251) and the murine NTE gene (GenBank™ accession: NM_015801), respectively. The following primers were used: NRE forward primer, 5′-CGAATTCGAGGAGCAGTCCCAGTCCAC-3′; NRE reverse primer, 5′-GCTCGAGTCAG-GAAGGATGTTCCAGTCTT-3′; NTE forward primer, 5′-GAGCGGCCGCGAGGCCCCACTGCAAACCGG-3′; NTE reverse primer, 5′-GATCTAGACTAGGCATCTGCAGCTGAGCTGG-3′.

The PCR cycling profile included initial incubation at 98 °C for 2 min and 25 cycles of denaturation (98 °C, 30 s), primer annealing (60 °C, 40 s), and elongation (72 °C, 4 min). The amplified cDNAs of NRE and NTE were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent elution by centrifugation using Ultrafree-MC 0.45 μm centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The purified cDNAs were ligated into pcDNA4/HisMax vectors (Invitrogen) between EcoRI/XhoI and NotI/XbaI sites, respectively. A control pcDNA4/HisMax vector expressing β-galactosidase (LacZ) was provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). For generating an NRE-GFP fusion construct full-length NRE coding sequence was amplified using the pcDNA4/Hismax-NRE as template and the primers: forward, 5′-ATCTCGAGCTGAGGAGCAGTCCCAGTCCACC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCGAATTCTCAGGAAGGATGTTCCAGTCTTGG-3′. The PCR mixture contained 10 ng of pcDNA4/Hismax-NRE, 10 pmol of primers, 10 nmol of dNTPs, 1 unit of Phusion™ High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, and 6 μl of Phusion™ HF buffer in a total volume of 30 μl. The cycling profile, with the exception of primer annealing (63 °C, 30 s), and cDNA purification were the same as mentioned above. The purified NRE cDNA was fused to a GFP gene by cloning it into the XhoI/EcoRI sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). The resulting fusion construct encoded GFP at the N terminus of NRE. P. Glynn (24Li Y. Dinsdale D. Glynn P. J. Biol.

Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Cells and Insulin Treatment—3T3-L1 cells (ecacc, Salisbury, UK) were seeded in 100-mm dishes (Greiner Bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany) and grown to 2 days postconfluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified air (89-91% saturation) and 5% CO2. Differentiation was induced by changing the medium to DMEM containing 10% FCS, antibiotics, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), 0.4 μg/ml dexamethasone (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma). After 48 h the medium was replaced by DMEM containing 10% FCS, antibiotics, and 10 μg/ml insulin (day 0 of differentiation). After another 48 h of incubation and every 2 days thereafter, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% FCS, antibiotics, and 0.5 μg/ml insulin. For studying insulin regulation of mRNA expression, fully differentiated adipocytes (10 days after induction) were incubated for 14 h in serum-free DMEM containing 2% defatted BSA and insulin at the doses indicated. Cultivation and Transient Transfection of OP9 Cells—OP9 cells were a generous gift from Dr. Toru Nakano (25Nakano T. Kodama H. Honjo T. Science. 1994; 265: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). These bone marrow-derived mouse stromal cells can be differentiated into adipocytes accumulating TG and expressing adipocyte late marker proteins (26Wolins N.E. Quaynor B.K. Skinner J.R. Tzekov A. Park C. Choi K. Bickel P.E. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 450-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells were cultivated in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM)α (Invitrogen) with 20% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified air (89-91% saturation) and 5% CO2. For transfection, OP9 cells were seeded at a density of 150,000 cells per well on 24 × 24 mm coverslips positioned at the bottom of 6-well plates and cultivated overnight. OP9 cells were transiently transfected using 4 μg of DNA and 12 μl of Optifect reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 4-5 h, the transfection medium was replaced by MEMα with 20% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, antibiotics, 500 μm sodium oleate, 2.7% defatted BSA, and 1 μg/ml bovine insulin to induce differentiation. For fluorescence microscopy analyses, OP9 cells were cultivated in differentiation medium for 60 h. Cultivation and Transient Transfection of COS7 Cells—COS7 cells (ecacc) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified air (89-91% saturation) and 5% CO2. The day before transfection COS7 cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 150,000 cells per well and cultivated overnight. For fluorescence microscopy analyses cells were seeded on 24 × 24 mm coverslips positioned at the bottom of the wells. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA and 4 μl of Metafectene (Biontex GmbH, Munich, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 4 h, the transfection medium was replaced by DMEM containing 10% FCS and antibiotics. 24 h after transfection, cells were collected for preparation of cell extracts. For simultaneous localization of NRE and lipid droplets by fluorescence microscopy COS7 cells were cultivated for additional 16 h with DMEM containing 10% FCS, antibiotics, 500 μm sodium oleate, and 2% defatted BSA. Preparation of Cell Extracts—Two days after transfection COS7 cells were collected by trypsinization and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (0.01 m phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.3). Cells were disrupted on ice in lysis buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.0) by sonication (Virsonic 475, Virtis, Gardiner, NJ). Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h to obtain membrane (pellet) and cytosolic (supernatant) fractions. The membrane fractions were resuspended in lysis buffer. For anion exchange chromatography cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer containing high detergent concentration (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cells were disrupted by repeated sonication alternated with incubation on ice for 10 min to enhance solubilization. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, mitochondria by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 60,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h to obtain the microsomal fraction (pellet) and the cytosolic fraction (supernatant). The cytosolic fraction was used for anion exchange chromatography. Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts or fractions (50 μl) obtained by anion exchange chromatography were boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, bromphenol blue), and proteins were separated by 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). Subsequently, proteins were electro-transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride transfer membrane (Pall Life Sciences, Pensacola, FL). Nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked by incubation of the membrane with 5% blotting grade milk powder (Carl Roth) in Tris/NaCl/Tween 20. Specific His-tagged proteins were detected with a mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody (His6, Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:5,000 in blocking solution. Following incubation, the blots were washed three times in Tris/NaCl/Tween 20 for 10 min, incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:10,000, and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL plus, Amersham Biosciences). Anion Exchange Chromatography—The cytosolic fractions of cell extracts containing His-tagged NRE or the negative control LacZ were loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (HiTrap, 1 ml, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 5 ml of start buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.01% Triton X-100). The matrix was washed with the same buffer to remove unbound protein. Proteins were eluted with an increasing linear gradient (15 ml) of 0 to 100% NaCl. Before starting the gradient fractions of 1 ml were collected, during the gradient fractions of 0.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using theÄkta prime protein purification system (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions were analyzed by Western blotting and examined for lysophosphatidylcholine hydrolase activity. Assays for Lipid Hydrolase Activities—For determination of triacylglycerol, cholesteryl ester, and retinyl ester hydrolase activities in cytosolic extracts of transfected COS7 cells, 0.1 ml of 1,000 × g supernatant (100 μg of protein) were mixed with 0.1 ml of radiolabeled substrate and incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 60 min. For the determination of phosphatidylcholine hydrolase activities 0.1 ml of the membrane fraction (100,000 × g pellet, 100 μg of protein) of COS7 cells were used. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 3.25 ml of methanol/chloroform/heptane (10:9:7) and 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium carbonate, 0.1 m boric acid, pH 10.5 and samples were vigorously mixed for extraction. After centrifugation (800 × g, 20 min) radioactivity in 1 ml of the upper phase was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Lipid substrates were prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and 2.5% defatted BSA and contained 33 nmol of glycerol trioleate/assay (glycerol tri[9,10(n)-3H]oleate 40,000 cpm/nmol), 20 nmol/assay of cholesteryl oleate (cholesteryl [9,10-3H]oleate, 50,000 cpm/nmol), 20 nmol/assay retinyl palmitate (9,10(n)-3H]palmitate, 50,000 cpm/nmol) or 20 nmol/assay phosphatidylcholine (dioleoyl-1-14C]phosphatidylcholine, 35,000 cpm/nmol). All lipid substrates were prepared by sonication on ice (Virsonic 475, Virtis). MG hydrolase activities in lysates of transfected COS7 cells were determined by incubating 10 μg of total membrane fraction (100,000 × g pellet) with 1 mm 1(rac)-oleoyl glycerol complexed with equimolar defatted BSA in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 in a total volume of 0.1 ml. The mixture was incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of CHCl3 and samples were vigorously mixed for extraction. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 1 min the glycerol concentration in the upper aqueous phase was determined using the Free Glycerol Reagent and the Glycerol Standard Solution from Sigma according to the manufacturer's instructions. The hydrolysis of lysophospholipids was determined according to Zaccheo et al. (12Zaccheo O. Dinsdale D. Meacock P.A. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24024-24033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Microsomal proteins (50-80 μg; 100,000 × g pellet) were incubated with 1.5 mm lysophosphatidylcholine (1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) or lysophosphatidic acid (1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate) in 0.1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, and 2.4 mm CHAPS for 20-60 min at 37 °C in a water bath. Reactions were stopped by chilling the assay mixture on ice. Fatty acids liberated were determined using a commercially available assay kit (WAKO Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany). For analysis of anion exchange chromatography fractions (20 to 37), 0.05 ml of each fraction were incubated with 3 mm lysophosphatidylcholine in 0.1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 for 60 min at 37 °C and chilled on ice to stop the reaction. Liberated fatty acids were determined as described above. p-Nitrophenyl Valerate Esterase Assay—p-Nitrophenyl valerate hydrolysis was determined in a microtiter plate using 5 μg of microsomal protein (100,000 × g pellet) in 100 μl of Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA) containing either no inhibitor (control) or various concentrations of the organophosphorus inhibitors diisopropyl fluorophosphate, mipafox, or paraoxon. Preincubations with these inhibitors were performed at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, 100 μl of 3 mm p-nitrophenyl valerate in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, containing 0.2 mm EDTA and 0.03% Triton X-100, were added. The absorbance of released p-nitrophenol was measured at 405 nm at room temperature over a time period of 15-30 min. The molar extinction coefficie"

The pro-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues BAX and BAK are activated following the induction of apoptosis and induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria. A second class of BCL-2 homologues, the BH3-only proteins, is required for the activation of BAX and BAK. The activity of both BAX/BAK and BH3-only proteins is opposed by anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues such as BCL-2 and MCL-1. Here we show that anti-apoptotic MCL-1 inhibits the function of BAX downstream of its initial activation and translocation to mitochondria. Although MCL-1 interacted with BAK and inhibited its activation, the activity of MCL-1 against BAX was independent of an interaction between the two proteins. However, the anti-apoptotic function of MCL-1 required the presence of BAX. These results suggest that the pro-survival activity of MCL-1 proceeds via inhibition of BAX function at mitochondria, downstream of its activation and translocation to this organelle.

Permeabilization of mitochondria during apoptosis is a major control point for the regulation of this important form of programmed cell death (1Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar). Upon induction of apoptosis, several molecules are released from mitochondria to the cytosol, where they carry their pro-apoptotic functions. One such protein is cytochrome c, which upon its release binds to the adaptor protein APAF-1, leading to its oligomerization and the activation of caspases, the apoptotic proteases (1Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar).

Three groups of BCL-2 homologues exist based on their BH domains and functions. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, such as BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1, prevent the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, whereas proapoptotic BAX and BAK, which lack the N-terminal BH4, participate in the formation of pores in mitochondria through which cytochrome c is released (1Danial N.N.

The presence of BAX or BAK is required for cytochrome c to be released and apoptosis to occur (1Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The first one posits the existence of two groups of BH3-only proteins: activators such as BID and BIM that directly activate BAX and BAK and derepressors such as Noxa and BAD that bind to anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues and thereby prevent them from inactivating both activator BH3-only proteins and BAX/BAK (7Letai A.

Nishino M. Wei G. Korsmeyer S. Armstrong S.A. Letai A. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 351-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The second model postulates that the main function of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues is to sequester BAX and BAK and prevent them from permeabilizing mitochondria (6Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J. Fletcher J.I. Hinds M.G. Colman P.M. Day C.L. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar, 9Willis S.N.

Science. 2007; 315: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). In this model, the role of BH3-only proteins is to bind to anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins and prevent them from sequestering BAX and BAK. In this case, the strength of a BH3-only protein is a function of the number of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins it can bind. In support of the second model, it has been proposed that MCL-1 and BCL-XL sequester BAK at mitochondria in healthy cells and that inhibition of both MCL-1 and BCL-XL, but not BCL-2, by BH3-only proteins is required to free BAK and induce cytochrome c release (10Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). This model does not, however, explain the regulation of BAX. In contrast to BAK, which is associated with mitochondria in healthy cells, BAX is monomeric in the cytosol and only translocates to mitochondria following induction of apoptosis. Therefore, BAX is likely to require a specific activation step before it can interact with anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues (3Leber B. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11Lalier L. Cartron P.F. Juin P. Nedelkina S. Manon S. Bechinger B. Vallette F.M. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). MCL-1 is unique among anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues as it binds a different subset of BH3-only proteins from BCL-2 and BCL-XL (6Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J. Fletcher J.I. Hinds M.G.

In addition, it has been shown to play an apical role in the inhibition of apoptosis following UV irradiation (13Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Although inhibition of BAK by MCL-1 at mitochondria has been suggested to play an important role in its anti-apoptotic function (10Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), much less is known about the interaction between MCL-1 and BAX. Here we show that MCL-1 inhibits BAX-induced cytochrome c release downstream of BAX conformational change and translocation to mitochondria. The inhibition of BAX by MCL-1 did not require direct interaction between the two proteins, but was nevertheless required for MCL-1 to fulfill its normal anti-apoptotic function. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Infections with Adenoviral Vectors—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 20 mm l-glutamine. To generate cell lines stably expressing MCL-1, HeLa cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected with G418. Transient transfections were also carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 and analyzed as indicated in the figure legends. Cotransfections with MCL-1 and BAX, BAK, or BAD were performed using a 2-fold excess of MCL-1 to ensure that cells containing the pro-apoptotic protein also contained MCL-1. For UV irradiation, cells were grown to 95% confluency (or 50% confluency for immunofluorescence), the medium was removed, and the cells were irradiated using 200 mJ/cm2 UVB light. Fresh medium (containing 50 μm Z-VAD-fmk in the case of immunofluorescence) was then added, and the cells were further incubated for the indicated time. Infections with adenoviral vectors coding for tBID and Noxa (gift of Dr. Gordon Shore) were carried out as described (14Germain M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32233-32242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Germain M. Mathai J.P. McBride H.M. Shore G.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1546-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) using 50 and 10 plaque-forming units of virus/cell, respectively. All infections were carried in the presence of 50 μm Z-VAD-fmk. Wild-type, BAX knock-out, and MCL-1-/Δ MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 20 mm l-glutamine, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. MEFs were transfected with Metafectene Pro (Biotex) following the manufacturer's directions. Antibodies and Immunoblots—The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-β-actin, mouse anti-FLAG, and mouse anti-HA (Sigma-Aldrich); rabbit anti-MCL-1 and rabbit anti-BAX (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse anti-MCL-1, mouse anti-cytochrome c (78H. 2C12), and mouse anti-calnexin (Pharmingen); rabbit anti-BAK and rabbit anti-p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Upstate); mouse anti-BAK (Ab-1) and mouse anti-BAX (Ab-6, clone 6A7) (Oncogene); and rabbit anti-TOM20 (gift from Dr. Gordon Shore (16Germain M. Mathai J.P. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18053-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA supplemented with either 1% Triton X-100 or 2% CHAPS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates were incubated for 2 h with the antibody and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. For immunoblot analysis, proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with specific antibodies. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Fractionation—Cells were fractionated as described previously (16Germain M. Mathai J.P. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18053-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were harvested and resuspended in HIM buffer (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA). Cells were broken by passing them 24 times through a 25-gauge needle while being kept on ice. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 9000 × g to pellet the HM fraction containing mitochondria. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 50000 × g for 15 min to generate the LM fraction containing the endoplasmic reticulum (pellet) and the cytosolic fraction (supernatant). For alkaline extraction, 30 μg of HM were incubated for 30 min on ice with 0.1 m Na2CO3, followed by centrifugation at 50000 × g to recover the membranes (16Germain M. Mathai J.P. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18053-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on coverslips and treated as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by immunofluorescence. Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used for single-label and double-label immunofluorescence using primary antibodies from different species. Double staining of cells with two mouse primary antibodies (cytochrome c and active BAX (6A7)) was carried out as followed. Cells were first stained with BAX followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594. Cytochrome c antibody was first labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 using a Zenon mouse IgG labeling kit (Molecular Probes) and then incubated with the cells. Coverslips were then visualized using an Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) with a 100× 1.30 oil objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Images were captured and overlaid using Northern Eclipse software. A minimum of four fields were counted per coverslip, for a total of at least 100 cells. Results were expressed as the number of cells positive for the marker (cytochrome c release, active BAX, and active BAK) over the total number of cells counted. All transient transfections were analyzed by costaining for the transiently expressed proteins and the marker of interest to ensure that only transfected cells were scored. siRNA—Cells were transfected with 10 nm siRNA specific for GFP, BAX, or BAK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using SilentFect transfection reagent (Bio-Rad). Cells were collected after 24 h and analyzed for protein expression by Western blotting. Cross-linking—After UV treatment, cells were harvested, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (7 × 106 cells/ml), and treated with 0.5 mm bismaleimidohexane for 30 min at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and cells were collected and analyzed for the presence of BAX by Western blotting. Gel Filtration—Cells were grown to confluency in 2 × 150 mm dishes; treated with 200 mJ/cm2 UV light; collected after 4 h; and resuspended in 500 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2% CHAPS. After centrifugation for 15 min at 50000 × g, the supernatant was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 0.5-ml fractions were collected for analysis. Calibration standards (Amersham Biosciences) were run under identical conditions to determine the elution profile of the column. MCL-1 Inhibits BAX- and BAK-dependent Cytochrome c Release—To gain insight into the potential regulation of BAX and BAK by MCL-1, we generated HeLa cells expressing different amounts of MCL-1. Although high MCL-1 expression levels could be achieved by transient transfection (4.8 ± 0.4-fold, p < 0.01), only low expression levels could be achieved in stable cell lines (1.4 ± 0.1-fold, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). This is possibly a consequence of the inhibitory effect of MCL-1 on proliferation (14Germain M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32233-32242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Fujise K. Zhang D. Liu J. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39458-39465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this low but significant increase in MCL-1 was sufficient to partially inhibit cytochrome c release and caspase activity following induction of apoptosis (see below and Ref. 14Germain M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32233-32242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of MCL-1 to inhibit BAX- and BAK-induced cytochrome c release by transiently transfecting these cells with either HA-BAX or FLAG-BAK and determining by immunofluorescence the number of transfected cells with released cytochrome c. As shown in Fig. 1B, MCL-1 did prevent both BAX- and BAK-induced cytochrome c release in a dose-dependent manner, whereas expression of HA-BAX or FLAG-BAK was similar in the three cell lines (Fig. 1C). Upon induction of apoptosis, both BAX and BAK undergo an N-terminal conformational change that is required for their activation (3Leber B. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11Lalier L. Cartron P.F. Juin P. Nedelkina S. Manon S. Bechinger B. Vallette F.M. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This change can be detected as punctate cytosolic staining by immunofluorescence, using antibodies that specifically recognize the active conformer of BAX (6A7) and BAK (Ab-1). As shown in Fig. 1D, whereas overexpression of FLAG-BAK had little effect on endogenous BAX, transfection with HA-BAX resulted in the appearance of cells with activated (Ab-1-positive) endogenous BAK. Therefore, to test whether the inhibitory effect of MCL-1 on BAX is dependent on BAK, the experiment was repeated in cells in which BAK had been knocked down using siRNA. As expected, BAK siRNA greatly reduced the number of cells with active BAK (Fig. 1D; protein levels are shown in Fig. 6A). Importantly, this had no effect on the protection provided by the expression of MCL-1 (Fig. 1E), indicating that the inhibition of BAX-induced cytochrome c release does not depend on the inhibition of BAK. These results suggest that MCL-1 can inhibit the activity of both BAX and BAK. MCL-1 Does Not Prevent the Exposure of the N-terminal Epitope of BAX—The change in conformation that both BAX and BAK undergo upon induction of apoptosis is dependent on the function of BH3-only proteins, which are induced following an apoptotic stimulus (7Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 18Ruffolo S.C. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25039-25045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of MCL-1 on the activation of endogenous BAX and BAK, as well as on cytochrome c release, was thus tested in a context where apoptosis induction depends on these upstream activators. Expression of MCL-1 decreased in a dose-dependent manner the number of cells with cytochrome c release after either UV treatment (Fig. 2A) or infection with an adenovirus expressing the activated form of the BH3-only protein BID (Ad tBID) (Fig. 2B). Similarly, MCL-1 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of BAK conformational change (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, whereas high expression of MCL-1 did prevent BAX activation (6A7-positive), a lower concentration of MCL-1 had no effect (Fig. 2, A and B). This resulted in the appearance of BAX (6A7-positive) cells in which cytochrome c had not been released (Fig. 2C, arrows), indicating that MCL-1 can block cytochrome c release without affecting BAX initial conformational change. As MCL-1 could nevertheless block BAX-dependent cytochrome c release (Fig. 1), these results suggest that MCL-1 could inhibit BAX downstream of its conformational change. MCL-1 Inhibits BAX Downstream of Its Translocation to Mitochondria—Concomitant with its conformational change, BAX translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria, where it inserts in the outer membrane and becomes resistant to alkaline extraction (3Leber B. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11Lalier L. Cartron P.F. Juin P. Nedelkina S. Manon S. Bechinger B. Vallette F.M. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To test whether MCL-1 affects the translocation of BAX to mitochondria, HeLa cells expressing low amounts of MCL-1 or vector alone were treated with UV light, and the HM containing mitochondria were isolated. As shown in Fig. 3A, the association of BAX with HM (-Alkali) and its insertion into the lipid bilayer (+Alkali) increased in a similar manner in both vector and MCL-1 (low) cells treated with UV light, whereas the amount of BAK in HM did not change. This suggests that MCL-1 blocks BAX downstream of its mitochondrial translocation. Following its translocation to mitochondria, BAX forms large oligomers that have been associated with cytochrome c release (3Leber B. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11Lalier L. Cartron P.F. Juin P. Nedelkina S. Manon S. Bechinger B. Vallette F.M. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 20Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Formation of BAX oligomers was analyzed using the chemical cross-linker bismaleimidohexane. Whereas in untreated cells BAX remained as a 25-kDa monomer following cross-linking with bismaleimidohexane, UV treatment caused the appearance of higher molecular mass bands consistent with the formation of BAX dimers as well as larger oligomers (Fig. 3B). The presence of low amounts of MCL-1 almost completely inhibited the formation of high molecular mass BAX oligomers (Fig. 3B, *), although there was only a small reduction in BAX dimers (**). To further investigate the possibility that MCL-1 could inhibit the formation of high molecular mass BAX complexes, a second approach was used to assess BAX oligomerization. On a gel filtration column, BAX migrated as a 25-kDa monomer in control cells (Fig. 3C). However, upon induction of apoptosis by UV radiation, it could be detected in complexes ranging in size from 50 to >500 kDa, reflecting the oligomerization of BAX (Fig. 3C). Strikingly, UV irradiation in MCL-1 (low) cells induced the formation of only small BAX complexes (60–150 kDa) (Fig. 3C), whereas higher expression of MCL-1 (achieved by treating the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to prevent MCL-1 degradation) completely blocked the formation of BAX-containing complexes. Altogether, these experiments indicate that MCL-1 inhibits the formation of large BAX oligomers. MCL-1 Inhibits BAX in the Absence of Interactions between the Two Proteins—One possible explanation for the results presented in Fig. 3 is that active BAX (6A7-positive) is sequestered in a BAX·MCL-1 complex. To investigate the interactions between BAX, BAK, and MCL-1, we first determined the subcellular localization of the endogenous proteins. Control HeLa cells were fractionated into cytosolic (S100), HM, and LM fractions. HM were enriched in mitochondria, as determined by the presence of the mitochondrial marker TOM20, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum was found in both LM and HM, as determined by the presence of the endoplasmic reticulum protein calnexin (Fig. 4A). Pro-apoptotic BAK was enriched in the HM, whereas BAX was mostly cytosolic (Fig. 4A). MCL-1 cofractionated with BAK in the HM but not with BAX (Fig. 4A). In accordance with their presence in the same organelle and the inhibition of BAK conformational change by MCL-1 (Fig. 2, A and B), interaction between MCL-1 and BAK could be observed in control HeLa cells lysed in Triton X-100-containing buffer. Minimal interaction was observed, however, when the immunoprecipitation was carried out in CHAPS-containing buffer, a detergent that does not alter the native conformation of these proteins (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, no interaction between endogenous BAX and MCL-1 could be detected in either of these conditions (Fig. 4B), consistent with the two proteins being present in different subcellular compartments. The fact that the two proteins did not interact in the presence of Triton X-100, which has been shown to activate BAX (20Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 21Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), also suggests that they might not interact under apoptotic conditions. Subcellular localization of BAX and MCL-1 in apoptotic cells was studied by immunofluorescence. In HeLa cells transiently expressing MCL-1, MCL-1 colocalized with the mitochondrial marker TOM20 (Fig. 4C). Upon induction of apoptosis with Ad tBID, the mitochondrial network became extensively fragmented, as a consequence of DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission (22Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). However, MCL-1 still colocalized with TOM20 (Fig. 4C). Upon induction of apoptosis, BAX has been shown to form clusters that localize to mitochondrial fission sites (23Karbowski M. Lee Y.J. Gaume B. Jeong S.Y. Frank S. Nechushtan A. Santel A. Fuller M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). These clusters were readily observed upon Ad tBID treatment in HeLa cells stably expressing MCL-1, conditions that do not prevent the conformational change in BAX (Fig. 2B). However, whereas BAX clusters were clearly adjacent to MCL-1 staining, the two proteins did not colocalize (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, MCL-1 remained in a 200-kDa complex irrespective of apoptosis induction and only partially cofractionated with BAX in UV light-treated cells (Fig. 5A). Altogether, these results suggest that MCL-1 and BAX do not directly interact in cells. Inhibition of Apoptosis by MCL-1 Is Dependent on BAD-inhibited BCL-2 Homologues—Several proteins have been suggested to regulate BAX activation and function during apoptosis (3Leber B. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Both DRP1 and Bif1 have been proposed to be important for BAX to induce cytochrome c release (23Karbowski M. Lee Y.J. Gaume B. Jeong S.Y. Frank S. Nechushtan A. Santel A. Fuller M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 24Takahashi Y. Karbowski M. Yamaguchi H. Kazi A. Wu J. Sebti S.M. Youle R.J. Wang H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9369-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, both proteins eluted from the gel filtration column in complexes that are distinct from MCL-1, in control as well as in apoptotic cells (Fig. 5A). This is consistent with our inability to immunoprecipitate either of these proteins with MCL-1 (data not shown). In addition, the elution profiles of Bif1 and DRP1 were not affected by the presence of MCL-1 (data not shown). On the other hand, the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologue BCL-XL is known to bind to the active conformer of BAX at the mitochondria and inhibit its function. Indeed, BCL-XL co-eluted with BAX in UV light-treated MCL-1 (low) cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting that BAX might be associated with BCL-XL in these cells. To further test the involvement of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues in the function of MCL-1, we took advantage of the differences in the specificity of BH3-only proteins for anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues (6Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J. Fletcher J.I. Hinds M.G. Colman P.M. Day C.L. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Mol.

Cell. 2005; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). We first validated the approach by inhibiting MCL-1 using Noxa, a BH3-only protein that targets MCL-1, but not BCL-2 or BCL-XL (6Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J. Fletcher J.I. Hinds M.G. Colman P.M. Day C.L. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar, 12Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Chipuk J.E. Bonzon C. Sullivan B.A. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Ad Noxa sensitized HeLa cells to UV light-induced cytochrome c release (14Germain M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32233-32242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and also inhibited the function of low levels of MCL-1 (Fig. 5B). It was, however, less efficient at inhibiting higher levels of MCL-1 (Fig. 5B), presumably because of an excess of MCL-1 over Noxa in this case. These results suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect observed in MCL-1 (low) cells is the direct consequence of the increased MCL-1 expression. The BH3-only protein BAD targets BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W, but not MCL-1 or A1 (6Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J. Fletcher J.I. Hinds M.G. Colman P.M. Day C.L. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar, 12Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Chipuk J.E. Bonzon C. Sullivan B.A. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar), allowing the specific inhibition of BCL-XL-like proteins as opposed to MCL-1. HeLa cells expressing increasing amounts of MCL-1 were transfected with BAD under conditions causing minimal cytochrome c release and treated with UV light. Transfected cells were then analyzed for cytochrome release by immunofluorescence. As with Noxa, the presence of BAD sensitized cells to cytochrome c release (Fig. 5B). Importantly, the presence of BAD inhibited the anti-apoptotic function of low levels of MCL-1, but not high levels (Fig. 5B). As BAD does not interact with MCL-1 (6Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A.

Cell. 2005; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar), these results suggest that inhibition of BAX by MCL-1 depends on the function of other BAD-sensitive, anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologue(s) such as BCL-XL. Inhibition of Apoptosis by MCL-1 Depends on the Presence of BAX—The results presented above suggest that MCL-1 blocks the function of BAX downstream of its initial activation and in the absence of a direct interaction between the two proteins. Several approaches were used to assess the importance of BAX for the anti-apoptotic activity of MCL-1. BAX and BAK were first knocked down using siRNA in HeLa cells stably expressing either MCL-1 (low expression) or vector alone. BAK siRNA reduced BAK levels by 60%, whereas BAX siRNA decreased BAX expression by 90% compared with treatment with GFP siRNA (Fig. 6A). Knocking down either pro-apoptotic protein significantly reduced UV light-induced cytochrome c release (Fig. 6B), indicating that both BAX and BAK are important for UV light-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, whereas MCL-1 still conferred protection when BAK was knocked down, it had no effect on cells lacking BAX (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the presence of BAX is required for MCL-1 to exert its anti-apoptotic activity. Similarly, whereas overexpression of MCL-1 in wild-type MEFs inhibited staurosporine (STS)-induced cytochrome c release, it had no effect on BAX-/- MEFs (Fig. 6C). The lack of effect of MCL-1 in BAX-/- MEFs was not the consequence of reduced MCL-1 expression because MCL-1 was expressed at least as much in BAX-/- MEFs as it was in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 6D). The inhibition of BAX and BAK by MCL-1 was further addressed using MCL-1 knock-out cells (MCL-1-/Δ). Wild-type and MCL-1-/Δ MEFs were treated with STS and analyzed by immunofluorescence for the presence of activated BAX and BAK. STS treatment resulted in the appearance of active BAK in both wild-type and MCL-1-/Δ cells, although in a higher proportion of the latter (Fig. 7A; quantification in B). In contrast, whereas punctate BAX staining, indicative of its activated state, was readily detectable in MCL-1-/Δ cells, few positive wild-type cells could be detected (Fig. 7, A and B). As BAX and BAK activation were similar in MCL-1-/Δ MEFs (Fig. 7B), these results suggest that the presence of MCL-1 has a greater effect on BAX than on BAK. Similarly, whereas transfection of MCL-1-/Δ cells with HA-BAX or FLAG-BAK caused comparable cytochrome c release, the wild-type cells were more resistant to HA-BAX than to FLAG-BAK (Fig. 7C). Expression levels of HA-BAX and FLAG-BAK were similar, however (Fig. 7D). Together, these results suggest that the presence of MCL-1 provides a greater inhibition of BAX than of BAK. BAX activation is dependent on the function of BH3-only proteins, although their mechanism of action is still debated. Contrary to BAK, which could conceivably be constitutively active but kept in check by proteins at the surface of mitochondria (10Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), BAX is a cytosolic monomer in control cells and thus requires a signal for its activation (3Leber B. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 20Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Indeed, tBID or peptides corresponding to its BH3 domain can activate BAX in vitro (3Leber B. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 7Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J.

Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). BAX activation is a multistep process involving several changes in the structure of the protein (11Lalier L. Cartron P.F. Juin P. Nedelkina S. Manon S. Bechinger B. Vallette F.M. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). BAX must first change its conformation (becoming 6A7-positive) and translocate to mitochondria, where it becomes inserted in the outer membrane. The active conformer of BAX can then oligomerize to cause the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues such as BCL-XL can bind to this activated conformer and inhibit further oligomerization (3Leber B. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 18Ruffolo S.C. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25039-25045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that MCL-1 interacts with BAK and inhibits its function (10Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 26Cuconati A. Mukherjee C. Perez D. White E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2922-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Accordingly, MCL-1 inhibited BAK conformational change in a dose-dependent manner in HeLa cells. On the other hand, the relationship between MCL-1 and BAX has been less clear, especially with regards to the potential interactions between the two proteins (discussed in Ref. 3Leber B. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). MCL-1 has been shown previously to inhibit BAX translocation to mitochondria when expressed at high levels through either overexpression or inhibition of MCL-1 degradation using proteasome inhibitors (10Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 13Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), similar to our observation that high levels of MCL-1 could inhibit BAX conformational change. On the other hand, levels of MCL-1 closer to the endogenous amount found in HeLa cells (MCL-1 (low)) did not prevent this initial activation step or BAX translocation to mitochondria. However, low levels of MCL-1 were sufficient to inhibit the formation of the high molecular mass BAX oligomers (>200 kDa) that have been associated with cytochrome c release (20Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), consistent with the ability of MCL-1 to inhibit BAX-dependent cytochrome c release. Of note, the apoptotic resistance of these cells could be reverted using Ad Noxa (Fig. 5B) or siRNA against MCL-1 (data not shown), indicating that it is dependent on MCL-1 expression rather than on other nonspecific effects arising from the selection of the stable cells. The inhibition of BAX-induced cytochrome c release by MCL-1 in the absence of interactions between the two proteins could occur through several possible mechanisms. One explanation would be that MCL-1 acts through BAK because the two proteins readily interact. However, this is unlikely, as the down-regulation of BAK did not prevent MCL-1-dependent inhibition of BAX. In addition, the activation of endogenous BAK by transfected BAX is unlikely to be physiologically relevant, as down-regulation of BAX did not affect the activation of endogenous BAK in UV light-treated HeLa cells (data not shown). Rather, it is likely to be the result of the fact that, whereas BAK is mitochondrial, BAX is cytosolic and, upon its translocation to mitochondria following overexpression, could activate both itself and BAK (3Leber B. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A second possibility stems from the fact that in the MCL-1 (low) cells BAX formed small complexes that did not contain MCL-1. These could represent partially oligomerized BAX that is prevented from further oligomerization because MCL-1 inhibits a BAX activator. However, MCL-1 did not influence Bif1 or DRP1, two proteins that are involved in BAX-dependent cytochrome c release. One other interpretation is that the partial complexes contain BAX associated with an inhibitor, consistent with the idea that, once activated, BAX needs to be kept in check to prevent its oligomerization and subsequent formation of cytochrome c release channels (3Leber B. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 18Ruffolo S.C. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25039-25045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BAX complexes cofractionated with BCL-XL-containing complexes, suggesting that activated BAX might be sequestered by BCL-XL in these cells. This would be consistent with the reported increase in affinity between BAX and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues when BAX is activated (3Leber B. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11Lalier L. Cartron P.F. Juin P. Nedelkina S. Manon S. Bechinger B. Vallette F.M. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This is also supported by the observation that BAD was able to reverse the effect of MCL-1 (low) on cytochrome c release. The indirect effect of MCL-1 on other BCL-2 homologues observed here also provides an explanation for the fact that MCL-1 degradation is required for apoptosis to occur following UV irradiation (13Nijhawan D.

BH3-only proteins would be possible MCL-1 targets in this context. Decreasing levels of MCL-1 would release increasing amounts of activator BH3-only proteins to activate BAX. On the other hand, overexpression of MCL-1, even at low levels, would not leave enough free BH3-only proteins to inactivate BCL-XL (or BCL-2/BCL-W), which would then be free to inhibit the active conformer of BAX, similar to the inhibition of BAK by BCL-2 (18Ruffolo S.C. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25039-25045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Finally, several experimental approaches were used to address the contribution of BAX to the function of MCL-1. Results obtained using MCL-1-/Δ MEFs suggested that MCL-1 regulates BAK to some extent, in accordance with the direct interaction between the two proteins. However, the effects on BAX were much greater and were observed both in the absence of MCL-1 and following its overexpression. This suggests that the presence of BAX is important for the anti-apoptotic activity of MCL-1 and that BAX is a major downstream target of MCL-1. Independent of the actual mechanism through which MCL-1 inhibits BAX-dependent cytochrome c release, this is likely to be of functional importance for the pro-survival effect of MCL-1. We thank Dr. Gordon Shore for providing reagents, Dr. Tullia Lindsten for providing BAX-/- MEFs, and Dr. Joseph Opferman for providing MCL-1-/Δ MEFs."
https://openalex.org/W2083399564,"Dab1 is an intracellular adaptor protein that interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and apoE receptor 2 (apoEr2), increases their levels on the cell surface, and increases their cleavage by alpha-secretases. To investigate the mechanism underlying these alterations in processing and trafficking of APP and apoEr2, we examined the effect of Fyn, an Src family-tyrosine kinase known to interact with and phosphorylate Dab1. Co-immunoprecipitation, co-immunostaining, and fluorescence lifetime imaging demonstrated an association between Fyn and APP. Fyn induced phosphorylation of APP at Tyr-757 of the (757)YENPTY(762) motif and increased cell surface expression of APP. Overexpression of Fyn alone did not alter levels of sAPPalpha or cytoplasmic C-terminal fragments, although it significantly decreased production of Abeta. However, in the presence of Dab1, Fyn significantly increased sAPPalpha and C-terminal fragments. Fyn-induced APP phosphorylation and cell surface levels of APP were potentiated in the presence of Dab1. Fyn also induced phosphorylation of apoEr2 and increased its cell surface levels and, in the presence of Dab1, affected processing of its C-terminal fragment. In vivo studies showed that sAPPalpha was decreased in the Fyn knock-out, supporting a role for Fyn in APP processing. These data demonstrate that Fyn, due in part to its effects on Dab1, regulates the phosphorylation, trafficking, and processing of APP and apoEr2."
https://openalex.org/W2075208317,"Elevated expression and aberrant activation of the src oncogene are strongly associated with cancer initiation and progression, thereby making Src a promising molecular target for anti-cancer therapy. Through drug screening using a temperature-inducible v-Src-transformed epithelial cell line, we found that andrographolide could suppress v-Src-induced transformation and down-regulate v-Src protein expression. In addition, actin cable dissolution and E-cadherin down-regulation, features of transformed phenotype, are perturbed by andrographolide. Moreover, andrographolide promoted v-Src degradation via a ubiquitin-dependent manner. Although andrographolide treatment altered the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern in v-Src-expressing cells, it did not directly affect the kinase activity of v-Src. Both the Erk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways were strongly inhibited in andrographolide-treated v-Src cells. However, only MKK inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) were able to cause a non-transformed morphology similar to that of andrographolide-treated v-Src cells. Moreover, overexpression of constitutively active MKK1 in v-Src cells blocked andrographolide-mediated morphological inhibition. Interestingly, andrographolide treatment could also reduce the protein level of the c-Src truncation mutant (Src531), an Src mutant originally identified from human colon cancer cells. In summary, we demonstrated that andrographolide antagonized v-Src action through promotion of v-Src protein degradation. Furthermore, attenuation of the Erk1/2 signaling pathway is essential for andrographolide-mediated inhibition of v-Src transformation. Our results demonstrate that andrographolide can act as a v-Src inhibitor and reveal a novel action mechanism of andrographolide.

Our results demonstrate that andrographolide can act as a v-Src inhibitor and reveal a novel action mechanism of andrographolide. c-Src, at its resting state, is phosphorylated at Tyr-527 and forms an inactive conformation. Upon activation by extracellular signals, c-Src is dephosphorylated at Tyr-527 and phosphorylated at Tyr-416, and then functions as a tyrosine kinase and a signaling molecule to trigger downstream signal transduction. In contrast, v-Src protein, with a deletion of the C-terminal negative-regulatory region, has lost an autoinhibitory phosphorylation site (Tyr-527) and is constitutively active (1Yeatman T.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). v-Src can promote normal cells to acquire a variety of transformation characteristics, including alteration of morphology, loss of contact inhibition, anchorage dependence and growth factor dependence, and elevation of invasion ability. Oncogenic Src proteins in epithelial cells have been reported to induce a switch between the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype, the so-called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (2Frame M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Oncogenesis induced by v-Src results in aberrant expression or activation of downstream target proteins that are associated with mitogenesis, cell adhesion, motility, and angiogenesis (1Yeatman T.J.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). v-Src has been shown to suppress expression of the cell cycle inhibitors (p21waf1 and p27kip1) and induce activation of the cyclin/cyclindependent kinase complexes (3Riley D.

Expression of v-Src is also required for production of the angiogenesis inducer vascular endothelial growth factor (9Jiang B.H. Agani F. Passaniti A. Semenza G.L.

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In addition, the signaling pathways required for v-Src-mediated transformation are significantly different between fibroblasts and epithelial cells (11Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).An elevated Src protein level and activity have been found in many human tumors, such as colon cancers and breast cancers (15Dehm S. Senger M.A. Bonham K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a truncated mutant of c-Src that is structurally similar to v-Src has been identified in advanced human colon cancer (16Irby R.B. Mao W. Coppola D. Kang J. Loubeau J.M. Trudeau W. Karl R. Fujita D.J. Jove R. Yeatman T.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Src protein has been considered to be a promising chemotherapeutic target, and many Src inhibitors have been identified. Most known Src inhibitors restrain the activity of Src by reducing its protein stability, reducing kinase activity or inhibiting protein-protein interactions (17Ishizawar R. Parsons S.J. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 209-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The benzoquinone ansamycins (geldanamycin and herbimycin A) and the macrocyclic antifungal antibiotic (radicicol) have been shown to bind HSP90 and thus reduce Src protein stability (18Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The pyrazolo-pyrimidines (PP1 and PP2) were found to directly inhibit Src tyrosine kinase activity (19Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). In addition, PP2 increases E-cadherin/catenin levels and reduces cancer metastasis in vivo (20Nam J.S. Ino Y. Sakamoto M. Hirohashi S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 2430-2436PubMed Google Scholar). Another type of Src inhibitor, such as UCS15A, has been shown to disrupt protein-protein interaction, and thus abolish the downstream signal transduction of Src (21Sharma S.V. Oneyama C. Yamashita Y. Nakano H. Sugawara K. Hamada M. Kosaka N. Tamaoki T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2068-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, only limited Src-targeted drugs have been proven to be efficient in vivo. Currently, there are no Src-specific inhibitors that have clinical application.In the present study, we established and applied the temperature-inducible v-Src-transformed cell line to identify compounds that inhibit v-Src-mediated cellular transformation. We found that a natural product, andrographolide, significantly suppressed v-Src-induced transformation. Andrographolide is a lactone diterpenoid isolated from the Chinese herb Andrographis paniculata and has been previously shown to exhibit a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities, such as anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, anti-angiogenesis, and anti-cancer activity (22Chen J.H.

Ethnopharmacol. 2004; 92: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The anti-cancer effect of andrographolide was demonstrated by showing its growth-inhibitory activity on various cancer cell lines in vitro and its tumor-suppressive activity in animal models (27Rajagopal S. Kumar R.A. Deevi D.S. Satyanarayana C. Rajagopalan R. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2003; 3: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Andrographolide can induce cell cycle arrest through increasing expression of p27 and decreasing expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (27Rajagopal S. Kumar R.A. Deevi D.S. Satyanarayana C. Rajagopalan R. J. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2003; 3: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Andrographolide also triggers apoptosis via the caspase-8 dependent pathway in human cancer cells (28Zhou J. Zhang S. Ong C.N. Shen H.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 132-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Through enhancing the cytotoxic T lymphocytes to secret interleukin-2 and interferon-γ, andrographolide inhibits the tumor growth in BALB/c mice (29Sheeja K. Kuttan G. Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol. 2007; 29: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although these studies reveal the potential of andrographolide in cancer therapy, no reports have described the inhibitory effect of andrographolide on v-Src oncogenicity. In this study, we therefore intended to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) by which andrographolide antagonizes the oncogenic properties of v-Src.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Antibodies–Andrographolide, cycloheximide, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet, and lactacystin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

RCAN-v-ts-src encodes a temperature-sensitive v-Src mutant (12Carragher N.O. Westhoff M.A. Riley D. Potter D.A. Dutt P. Elce J.S. Greer P.A. Frame M.C. Mol.

A 1.5-kb XbaI to HindIII fragment from the MKK1-CA plasmid (encoding a HA-tagged-mutated mkk1 sequence) was first cloned into corresponding sites of PBSFI to yield PBSFI-MKK1-CA. RCAS(A)-MKK1-CA was further created by cloning the SfiI fragment of PBSFI-MKK1-CA into RCASFI, a modified version of the replication-competent retroviral vector RCAS(A) (31Aoki M. Batista O.

The DF-1 cells were cultured as described previously (6Fu S.L. Huang Y.J. Liang F.P. Huang Y.F. Chuang C.F. Wang S.W. Yao J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 830-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Creation of a Temperature-inducible v-Src-transformed Cell Line (ts-v-Src Cells)–The preparation of RCAN-ts-v-src viruses and infection of tv-a-expressing RK3E/tv-a cells have been described previously (6Fu S.L.

The infected cells were maintained for 3 weeks and tested in focus formation assays and soft agar assays (at 35 °C and 39.5 °C, respectively) using protocols as described previously (6Fu S.L.

Five of the colonies, formed on soft agar at 35 °C, were picked, expanded, and mixed for subsequent experiments.Creation of RK3E Cell Clones Stably Expressing Src531 (RK3E/Src531 Cell Clones)–RK3E cells were regularly maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. For transfection, RK3E cells (8 × 105) were seeded onto 60-mm plates, and 2 μg of plasmid (either pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-Src531) was introduced into the cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours after transfection, half of the cells were transferred into 100-mm plates and maintained in regular growth medium with G418 (200 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. Three pcDNA3 clones (negative control) and six pcDNA3-Src531 clones were picked and expanded for subsequent Western blot analysis to determine protein level of Src531.Determination of Morphological Change–The ts-v-src cells (105) were seeded into 6-well plates and grown at 39.5 °C. After overnight incubation, the cells were treated with vehicle or drugs, and then immediately shifted to an incubator set at 35 °C. Twenty-four hours later cell morphology was observed and photographed under a phase-contrast microscope at 200× magnification.Soft Agar Assay–Six-well plates were overlaid with 0.6% nutrient agar (Sea Plaque agar in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 3% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 3 μg/ml puromycin) before use. The ts-v-Src cells (104) grown at 39.5 °C were mixed well with 0.3% nutrient agar (Sea Plaque agar in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 3 μg/ml puromycin) consisting of vehicle or different concentrations of andrographolide, seeded into prepared 6-well plates and transferred to 35 °C. Every 3-4 days, the cells were supplied with 0.3% nutrient agar consisting of vehicle or andrographolide. After 2 weeks, colonies were stained with 1% (w/v) p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet solution, photographed, and counted.Immunofluorescence and Actin Cable Staining–The ts-v-src cells were seeded onto coverslips at 39.5 °C. Next day, the cells were incubated with vehicle or andrographolide for 24 h at 35 °C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and subsequently permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with a primary antibody for 1 h and then treated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for additional hour. Then, the cells were stained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 min. The images were detected using a confocal microscope (FV-300, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan).To stain actin filaments, the process of fixation and permeabilization were conducted as mentioned above. After blocking, the cells were stained with 2.5 units/ml Texas Red-X phalloidin and 1 μg/ml DAPI (4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 20 min and 10 min, respectively. The images were detected using a confocal microscope.Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation–The ts-v-src cells (3 × 105) were seeded into a 100-mm plate and grown overnight at 39.5 °C. The cells were subsequently treated with vehicle and drugs for various times at 35 °C. Afterward, the treated cells were collected by scraping and centrifugation. Cell pellets were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0)) in the presence of general protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). In the experiments for detecting tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer in the presence of general protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (sodium fluoride, 1 mm, sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm). Total protein (50 μg) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk/TBS-Tween, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and then reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. After treating the membranes with ECL Western blotting Detection Reagent (Millipore), the signals were detected by exposing the membrane to x-ray film.For immunoprecipitation, treated cells were collected and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing general protease inhibitors. Total protein (300-400 μg) was incubated with anti-v-Src antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose slurry (50 μl) was then added to and reacted with protein/antibody for further 2 h at 4 °C. Afterward the immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation for subsequent study.In Vitro Kinase Assay–To determine kinase activity of v-Src, we used a modified procedure based on the instructions of the Universal Tyrosine Kinase Assay Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). For each reaction, 106 cells were disrupted in extraction buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The immunoprecipitation was then carried out by incubating cell supernatant with anti-v-Src antibody and protein G-Sepharose. After centrifugation, the immunoprecipitates were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, resuspended in ATP-supplemented kinase reaction buffer, and incubated with vehicle or drugs for 30 min. The samples were then transferred to wells precoated with peptide substrate for the kinase reaction (30 min, 37 °C), and anti-phosphotyrosine-horseradish peroxidase and horseradish peroxidase substrate were added to each well and incubated for 30 min. After stopping the reaction with 1 n H2SO4, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured by using a microplate photometer (Multiskan RC, Model 351, Lab Systems, Stockholm, Sweden).Reverse Transcription-PCR–The ts-v-src cells (106 per well) were seeded and grown at 39.5 °C. Next day, the cells were treated with vehicle or drugs, and then incubated for various times at 35 °C. Total RNA isolation and cDNA preparation were conducted as described previously (6Fu S.L.

The PCR conditions were: 94 °C, 45 s; 52 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 45 s; 25 cycles (for v-src) and 94 °C, 45 s; 54 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 45 s; 20 cycles (for gapdh). The PCR products were analyzed using 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.Radiolabeling of Newly Synthesized v-Src Protein–After seeding, the ts-v-src cells were then treated with vehicle and drugs for indicated times at 35 °C. Consequently, the cells were incubated with methionine-free medium with 10% dialyzed FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 3 μg/ml puromycin, in the presence of vehicle or drug, for 30 min at 35 °C. The [35S]methionine-containing medium (methionine-free medium with 10% dialyzed FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 3 μg/ml puromycin, and [35S]methionine (100 μCi per dish)) with vehicle or drug was then supplied to cells for an additional 30-min incubation at 35 °C. After treatment, cells were harvested, lysed, and thus immunoprecipitated with anti-v-Src antibody. Prepared samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The signals were detected by exposing the membranes directly to x-ray films.Pulse-chase Assay–After seeding, the ts-v-src cells were first incubated with methionine-free medium with 10% dialyzed FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 3 μg/ml puromycin for 30 min at 39.5 °C. The cells were then subsequently incubated with [35S]methionine-containing medium for 1 h at 39.5 °C. Then, the [35S]methionine-containing medium was removed, the cells were treated with vehicle and drugs for indicated times at 35 °C. Finally, the amount of 35S-labeled v-Src protein was determined using immunoprecipitation and autoradiography.RESULTSEstablishment of a Temperature-inducible v-Src-transformed Cell Line–To identify compounds that interfere with the process of v-Src-induced transformation, we first established a temperature-inducible v-Src-transformed cell line (ts-v-Src cells) by infecting RK3E/tv-a cells with RCAN-v-src-derived avian retrovirus. The RK3E/tv-a is a tv-a-expressing rat kidney epithelial cell line that allows efficient gene delivery via avian retroviral infection (6Fu S.L. Huang Y.J. Liang F.P. Huang Y.F. Chuang C.F. Wang S.W. Yao J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 830-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The RCAN-v-src construct contains a temperature-sensitive v-src mutant carrying a point mutation (Ala-to-Pro substitution at residue 507). This mutant has been previously shown to exhibit temperature-dependent kinase activity and transforming ability (32Stoker A.W. Kellie S. Wyke J.A. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 876-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first demonstrated that cellular transformation of ts-v-Src RK3E cells could be regulated by the temperature switch. At the permissive temperature (35 °C), ts-v-Src cells showed a transformed morphology, were able to induce focus formation, and had acquired anchorage-independent growth ability. In contrast, ts-v-Src cells grown at the non-permissive temperature (39.5 °C) displayed a typical epithelial morphology and did not induce focus formation or soft-agar colony formation (supplemental Fig. S1).Andrographolide Suppresses v-Src-induced Morphological Transformation and Colony Formation–We thus applied ts-v-Src cells for the screening of anti-transformation compounds (all tested compounds are listed insupplemental Table S1). The ts-v-Src cells grown at 39.5 °C were treated with vehicle or natural products, immediately switched to the 35 °C incubator, and cultured for 24 h to identify the natural products that were able to impede the v-Src-induced transformation process. For each tested compound, multiple concentrations were initially tested, and sublethal dosages were determined for extended studies. Among the natural products examined, only andrographolide exhibited the ability to block the v-Src-induced morphological transformation. As shown in Fig. 1, ts-v-Src-transformed cells grown at 35 °C were more refractile in appearance, had more membrane extensions, showed reduced adhesion, and lost cell-cell contact (Fig. 1B). When different concentrations of andrographolide (1, 3, 5, and 10 μm) were added prior to temperature switch, we found that morphological alteration was inhibited by andrographolide at 5 μm after incubation at 35 °C for 24 h (Fig. 1F). The morphology of the andrographolide-treated cells is flat polygonal with clear cell-cell contacts, which is similar to that of non-transformed ts-v-Src cells grown at 39.5 °C (Fig. 1A). Andrographolide at 3 μm only exhibited a slightly inhibitory effect on the morphological transformation (Fig. 1E), whereas andrographolide at 1 μm did not affect the morphological transformation (data not shown). Radicicol, a known v-Src inhibitor, also blocked the v-Src-mediated morphological transformation (Fig. 1D). In contrast, several well known natural compounds such as naringenin (a natural citrus flavanone), baicalin (the active ingredient form Scutellaria baicalensis), and camptothecin (a plant-derived anti-tumor agent) did not affect the v-Src-mediated morphological transformation (Fig. 1, G-I).We also examined whether andrographolide could affect anchorage-independent growth ability, another feature of v-Src-transformed cells. The ts-v-Src cells treated with vehicle and andrographolide at 1 μm exhibited anchorage-independent growth ability on soft agar. However, andrographolide at 3 μm and 5 μm showed slightly and strongly inhibitory effects on colony formation, respectively. These results indicate that andrographolide can restrain the v-Src-induced transformation in a concentration-dependent manner.Andrographolide Treatment Causes the Disorganization of Actin Filaments and Delays v-Src-mediated E-cadherin Down-regulation in v-Src-transformed Cells–The v-Src activation is kno"
https://openalex.org/W2091312966,"The proinflammatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is expressed in inflammatory and atherosclerotic lesions. GM-CSF is known to enhance monocytic expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which GM-CSF up-regulates the MCP-1 expression remains to be clarified. Thus, in this study, we examined our hypothesis that GM-CSF up-regulates the MCP-1 expression via Jak2-Stat5 signaling pathway. In human monocytic cell line U937, GM-CSF increased MCP-1 expression in protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, analysis of the GM-CSF promoter element revealed that the STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-5) transcription factor binding site, located between –152 and –144 upstream of the transcription start site, as well as Janus kinase-2-mediated Stat5 activation were necessary for the GM-CSF-induced transcriptional up-regulation of the MCP-1 gene. This GM-CSF-induced MCP-1 expression, measured as both protein and mRNA levels, was down-regulated by atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor. However, this decrease in MCP-1 expression was not at the transcriptional level of MCP-1 gene but rather at the level of the stability of MCP-1 mRNA. These results indicate that GM-CSF regulates MCP-1 expression via Janus kinase-2-Stat5 pathway and by a novel regulatory mechanism of statins to reduce inflammatory reactions by down-regulating the expression of monocytic MCP-1, which promotes atherogenesis.

Inflammatory events are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (1Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18955) Google Scholar, 2Tanimoto A. Sasaguri Y. Ohtsu H.

Lipidol. 1997; 8: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Monocytes/macrophages are present in all stages of atherosclerosis, playing a central role in atherogenesis; their multiple functions include migration and production of growth factors, cytokines, and matrix-degrading enzymes as well as uptake of modified lipoproteins (4Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (9910) Google Scholar). Specifically, the adhesion and migration of circulating monocytes to endothelial cells and the subendothelial microenvironment are important for the initiation of atherogenesis (5Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1033-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). An association between matrix turnover and migration of many types of cells may be involved in atherogenesis, and the production of matrix-degrading enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), 2The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseGM-CSFgranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factorMCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1ILinterleukinMevmevalonateAcDactinomycin DAtvatorvastatinUTRuntranslated regionsiRNAsmall interfering RNAEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGGTIGeranylgeranyltransferase inhibitorFTIfarnesyltransferase inhibitor. 2The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseGM-CSFgranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factorMCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1ILinterleukinMevmevalonateAcDactinomycin DAtvatorvastatinUTRuntranslated regionsiRNAsmall interfering RNAEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGGTIGeranylgeranyltransferase inhibitorFTIfarnesyltransferase inhibitor. from monocytes is one of the key events to enhance the migratory action of the monocytes (6Goetzl E.J. Banda M.J. Leppert D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been reported to enhance MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-12 expression as well as stimulate the activation of RhoA and integrin clustering in monocytes (7Wu L. Tanimoto A. Murata Y. Fan J. Sasaguri Y. Watanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Jost M.M. Ninci E. Meder B. Kempf C. van Royen N.

Pathol. Int. 2004; 54: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, GM-CSF is thought to play pivotal roles in various monocyte functions, including migration in atherogenesis (7Wu L. Tanimoto A. Murata Y. Fan J. Sasaguri Y. Watanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Kohno Y. Tanimoto A. Cirathaworn C. Shimajiri S. Tawara A. Sasaguri Y. Pathol. Int. 2004; 54: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, studies of blockage of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) signaling pathway by MCP-1 knock-out and MCP-1 receptor knock-out have provided direct evidence of a critical role for MCP-1 and its receptor in monocyte migration during atherogenesis (10Ni W.

Cell. 1998; 2: 275-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). The atherogenic effect of MCP-1 is mainly explained by its potent chemoattractive effect on monocytes. Since our previous study demonstrated that monocytic MCP-1 expression is up-regulated by GM-CSF, we speculated that there was a synergistic effect of MCP-1 and GM-CSF on monocytic migration (9Kohno Y. Tanimoto A. Cirathaworn C. Shimajiri S. Tawara A. Sasaguri Y. Pathol. Int. 2004; 54: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which GM-CSF enhances MCP-1 expression in monocytes is not clearly understood. matrix metalloproteinase granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 interleukin mevalonate actinomycin D atorvastatin untranslated region small interfering RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay Geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor farnesyltransferase inhibitor. matrix metalloproteinase granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 interleukin mevalonate actinomycin D atorvastatin untranslated region small interfering RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay Geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor farnesyltransferase inhibitor. There is growing evidence that some beneficial effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are independent of their effects on lowering lipid levels. Statins have pleiotropic effects, such as improvement of endothelial dysfunction, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, anti-inflammatory activity, and antioxidant properties (13Calabro P. Yeh E.T. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 2005; 20: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 14Mason R.P. Walter M.F. Day C.A. Jacob R.F. Am. J. Cardiol. 2005; 96: 11F-23FAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In particular, anti-inflammatory effects would be beneficial for prevention of atherosclerosis. In fact, atorvastatin therapy reduces blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and MCP-1 in hypercholesterolemic patients and in those with acute coronary syndrome (15Kinlay S.

The aim of the present study was to investigate how GM-CSF up-regulates the expression of MCP-1 in human monocytic U937 cells. Furthermore, we investigated whether atorvastatin would inhibit GM-CSF-induced MCP-1 expression as a potentially novel anti-inflammatory effect. Chemicals–Mevalonate (Mev) and actinomycin D (AcD) were purchased from Sigma. Geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor (GGTI-286), farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI-276), and Jak2 inhibitor (AG490) were from Merck. GM-CSF was from Peprotech (London, UK). The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin (Atv) was kindly provided by Pfizer. Cell Culture–Human monocytic U937 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1593) and maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 5% fetal calf serum (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). MCP-1 in U937 Conditioned Medium–The U937 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/1 ml of RPMI1640 medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and were then stimulated with 1–10 ng/ml of GM-CSF for 24 h. MCP-1 in the culture supernatant was subsequently measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D, Minneapolis, MN). Northern Blot Analysis–U937 cells were incubated with GM-CSF (1–50 ng/ml) in the RPMI1640 medium with 0.5% fetal calf serum for 16 h. Then total RNAs were extracted by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and fractionated on 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde (10 μg of total RNA/lane). After the RNAs were transferred onto a nylon membrane, the expression of MCP-1 mRNA was detected by hybridization with 32P-labeled MCP-1 probe, as previously described (9Kohno Y. Tanimoto A. Cirathaworn C. Shimajiri S. Tawara A. Sasaguri Y. Pathol. Int. 2004; 54: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Equal loading of RNA was confirmed by detecting β-actin as an internal control. The expression levels were measured by density analysis using the imagel program, free software available at the National Institutes of Health Web site. Plasmid Construction–We cloned the human MCP-1 promoter region from the genomic DNA of U937 cells by PCR using the primer pairs 5′-GCTGGAGGCGAGAGTGCGAG-3′ and 5′-TCTAGATTCTCCTTTAGCTGT-3′, corresponding to nucleotide positions –932 to +60 relative to the transcription start site. The PCR products were cloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and the sequence was confirmed. The 5′-serial and internal deletion mutants were generated by appropriate enzymatic digestion and ligation. The point mutations in the activator protein-1 distal site (AP-1d at –97 to –91) and the AP-1-proximal site (AP-1p at –69 to –63), NF-κB (at –89 to –80), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5p; at –152 to –144; see the map in Fig. 2A) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis as follows: TCACTCA to caACTCA for AP-1d, TGACTCC to caACTCC for AP-1p, GGAAGATCCC to GGAAGATggg for NF-κB, and TTCCTGGAA to TTCCTGGtt for STAT5p. Jak2 (Janus kinase-2)- and Stat5a-expressing vectors were used for co-transfection studies (17Ilaria Jr., R.L. Hawley R.G. van Etten R.A. Blood. 1999; 93: 4154-4166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the MCP-1 gene (+361 to +732) on mRNA stability, the 3′-UTR was cloned into the MCP-1 luciferase construct (–538 construct in Fig. 2A) at the end of the luciferase gene using the XbaI site. In this construct, thus, the luciferase gene is driven by the MCP-1 promoter, and the mRNA stability is regulated by the 3′-UTR. The AUUUA sequence in the 3′-UTR located at +496 to +500 was deleted by SpeI/AflII digestion, followed by fill-in reaction by Klenow and ligation. This clone had the deletion from +477 to +538. Transfection and Luciferase Assay–Luciferase assays were performed as previously described (18Murata Y. Tanimoto A. Wang K.Y. Tsutsui M. Sasaguri Y. Corte F.D. Matsushita H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, U937 cells (1.4 × 107/cuvette) were transfected with 20 μg of reporter constructs along with 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid by electroporation (Gene Pulser II; Bio-Rad). After electroporation, the cells were seeded into a 24-well plate and incubated with or without GM-CSF (1–20 ng/ml) for 8 h. Then the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer. For the co-transfection experiments, cells were electroporated with Jak2- and Stat5a-expressing plasmids (5 μg each per electroporation cuvette). To minimize variations in the transfection efficiency, we transfected cells in a single batch for each reporter plasmid and then divided the desired number of transfected cells to each well. Furthermore, co-transfection of β-galactosidase expression plasmid followed by measurement of β-galactosidase activity was used as internal controls to monitor the transfection efficiency. All luciferase assays were repeated at least three times, each in triplicate wells. Effect of Stat5a Knockdown by siRNA–The effect of Stat5a knockdown on the MCP-1 transcriptional activity was investigated by transfection of siRNA (Custom SMARTpool, Dharmacon, Amersham Biosciences). The siRNA for Stat5a knockdown was a mixture of four different synthetic siRNAs targeting the Stat5a mRNA (J-005169-11, -12, -13, and -14). For a negative control, nontargeting siRNA 5 (D-001210-05-05) was used. The U937 cells were transfected with 20 μg of luciferase reporter constructs along with 0.75 μg of siRNA by electroporation. The knockdown efficiency of the siRNA was monitored by the expression of Stat5a protein by Western blotting described below. Nuclear Run-on Assay–U937 cells were incubated with GM-CSF (10 ng/ml for 2 h) in the presence or absence of Atv (5 μmol/liter) and collected in a Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After a 10-min incubation on ice, the nuclei were isolated by centrifugation (1200 rpm for 5 min). The nuclei (5 × 107) were washed twice with the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of resupspension buffer (40% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The nuclei (5 × 107) were used to carry out run-on transcription in a reaction mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sucrose, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP, and 10 μl of [α-32P]UTP (>3000 μCi/mmol)) at 30 °C for 30 min (200 μl/reaction). The genomic DNAs in the samples were digested by the addition of DNase I (1 unit/ml). The radiolabeled RNAs were isolated and purified and then dissolved in 50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate water. Plasmids (5 μg) harboring cDNA of the MCP-1, β-actin, and the plasmid (pGEM-Easy-T vector) without insert were linearized, denatured, and spotted onto nylon membrane using a dot blot apparatus. The membrane was hybridized with the RNA probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml) at 42 °C for 48 h in QuikHyb Rapid Hybridization Solution (Stratagene). The relative intensity of the MCP-1 signal was measured as the ratio of MCP-1 to β-actin intensity. Western Blot Analysis–U937 cells overexpressing Jak2 and Stat5a were stimulated with GM-CSF (10 ng/ml for 15 min), and the cells were treated with a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4). The supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE (50 μg/lane) and Western blotting using anti-Jak2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), phosphospecific Jak2 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), Stat5a (Chemicon), Stat5b (Chemicon), and phosphospecific Stat5a/b antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology). The lysates from the U937 cells treated with GM-CSF in the presence or absence of Jak2 inhibitor AG490 were also applied to Western blotting. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)–U937 cells were incubated with GM-CSF (20 ng/ml, 15 min), and nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (19Kao C.Y. Tanimoto A. Arima N. Sasaguri Y. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23043-23051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide, including the STAT5p (–152 to –144 bp; 5′-CTTTCCTACTTCCTGGAAATCCACAG-3′) site of the MCP-1 promoter region and the mutant STAT5 (5′-CTTTCCTACTTCCTGGttATCCACAG-3′) were used. The probes were biotin-labeled at their 3′-end by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Pierce). Nuclear extract (5 μg) and labeled probe (20 fmol) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a binding buffer (Lightshift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit; Pierce). The DNA-protein complexes were separated on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel and then electrophoretically transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane. The biotin-labeled DNA was detected by a chemiluminescence method (Lightshift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit; Pierce). For antibody supershift experiments, 2 μg of antibodies specific for Stat5a and Stat5b (Chemicon) were incubated with the nuclear extract at 4 °C for 1 h prior to incubation with the labeled probes. Analysis of MCP-1 mRNA Stability–MCP-1 mRNA stability was analyzed as follows. The U937 cells stimulated with GM-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 16 h were treated with AcD (10 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of Atv (5 μmol/ml). The total RNA was extracted at 0, 2, 3, and 6 h after the addition of AcD and subjected to Northern blotting to evaluate mRNA degradation. Effects of 3′-UTR of MCP-1 Gene on Luciferase mRNA Stability–The MCP-1 luciferase construct including the 3′-UTR was transfected as described above. Afterward, the cells were incubated with GM-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 8 h and then incubated with AcD (10 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of Atv (5 μmol/ml). The cells were harvested at 0 and 6 h after AcD treatment, and then luciferase activity, which would indirectly reflect the stability of luciferase mRNA, was measured. Statistical Analysis–All quantitative data were presented as the mean ± S.D. Student's t test was applied, and differences at p < 0.05 were considered significant. MCP-1 Expression by GM-CSF in the U937 Cells–GM-CSF stimulated the U937 cells to produce and secrete MCP-1 into the culture medium (Fig. 1A). The GM-CSF-induced MCP-1 production was accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in MCP-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). Transcriptional Assay of MCP-1 Gene–The vector constructs used were the human MCP-1 promoter region up to –932 bp, including AP-1, NF-κB, and STAT5 motifs, and its deletion mutants (Fig. 2A). GM-CSF increased the MCP-1 transcriptional activity from the –932 bp construct in a dose-dependent manner (1–20 ng/ml for 8 h) (Fig. 1C). When the –932 bp construct was deleted up to –538 bp, the basal activity was increased, thus indicating the presence of an unknown repressive region at –932 to –538 bp. The deletion constructs up to –415 and –292 showed decreased basal activity but still maintained the GM-CSF response. When the 5′-deletion construct up to –145 was used for transfection, the GM-CSF response was decreased, but the basal activity was still preserved (Fig. 2A). The –314/–292 internal deletion construct showed a similar basal activity and GM-CSF response in comparison with the parental –538 construct. In contrast, the –314/–145 and –292/–145 internal deletion constructs showed a decreased GM-CSF response (Fig. 2B). These results together indicate the presence of a GM-CSF-responsive motif(s) in the region spanning from –292 to –145. Involvement of STAT5, but not AP-1 and NF-κB, in MCP-1 Transcription–Since the –292 to –145 region included a putative STAT5 motif at –152/–144, which is known as one of the GM-CSF-responsive motifs, a point mutation at the STAT5 (STAT5p) motif was introduced in the –538 construct. This point mutation reduced the GM-CSF response, whereas mutations in the AP-1 or NF-κB motifs still resulted in a 2-fold activation by GM-CSF (Fig. 3A). GM-CSF activated the Jak2 and Stat5a of both constitutively expressed and exogenously overexpressed Jak2 and Stat5a which was demonstrated by the detection of phosphorylated Jak2 and Stat5 (since, however, the phosphospecific anti-Stat5 antibody recognizes both Stat5a and Stat5b proteins, the bands include both isoforms) (Fig. 3B). Co-expression of Jak2 and Stat5a with the –538 reporter construct exhibited increased transcriptional activity induced by GM-CSF (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, co-transfection of siRNA, which leads to knockdown of Stat5a but not Stat5b expression (Fig. 3D) resulted in reduced GM-CSF-induced transcriptional activity (Fig. 3E). Together with the results obtained from the luciferase assay using mutations of the STAT5 motif, these results suggest that the STAT5 located at –152/–144 (STAT5p) is a potential GM-CSF-responsive motif for Jak2- and Stat5a-mediated MCP-1 gene transcription in the U937 cells. Effect of Jak2 Inhibitor AG490 on MCP-1 Expression–Since the involvement of the Jak2-Stat5 signaling pathway was indicated by the results of the luciferase assay, AG490, a specific Jak2 inhibitor that inhibits Jak2 activity to phosphorylate Stat5a, was introduced for the studies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Northern and Western blotting, and luciferase assay. AG490 pretreatment (10 μmol/liter for 1 h) decreased GM-CSF-stimulated (10 ng/ml) MCP-1 expression at both protein (Fig. 4A) and mRNA (Fig. 4B) levels. Furthermore, the AG490 treatment decreased the GM-CSF-induced Stat5 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C) and GM-CSF-induced MCP-1 promoter activity (Fig. 4D). EMSA for GM-CSF-induced Stat5 Binding–To confirm that the MCP-1 gene expression was mediated through the Stat5 binding to the STAT5 motif, we subjected the nuclear extracts from GM-CSF-stimulated U937 cells to EMSA (Fig. 5). The nonstimulated control extract showed four DNA-protein complexes (NS) with the wild-type (wt) STAT5p probe (lane 3), whereas the extract from the GM-CSF-stimulated cells showed another slower migrating complex (lane 4, closed arrowhead). When the wild-type cold competitor was used (50-fold excess), most of the complexes were abolished (lane 5). In contrast, mutant (mt) cold competitor did not compete with the slower migrating complex (lane 6), indicating that the slower migrating complex (closed arrowhead) was specific for the STAT5 motif. In support of this interpretation, the mutant probe did not detect the slower migrating complex (lane 7). When the extract was incubated with normal rabbit serum (NRS), the specific complexes were still detected (lane 10). In contrast, the specific complex was supershifted by anti-Stat5a antibody (open arrowhead in lane 8). The incubation with anit-Stat5b antibody showed, however, only a minor shifted band (open arrowhead in lane 9). Therefore, the supershift assay indicated that the specific complex contained, at least, the Stat5a transcriptional factor as a major component. Atorvastatin Effects on MCP-1 Expression in Protein and mRNA Levels–Since Atv suppresses the production of mevalonate, farnesylpyrophosphate, and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, it inhibits farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of cellular proteins, such as RhoA and Ras. Thus, mevalonate rescues from the Atv effects, and geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor (GGTI) or farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) mimics those. Atv (2.5 and 5 μmol/liter) decreased the MCP-1 content in the culture medium, and mevalonate (50 μmol/liter) partially rescued the MCP-1 expression (Fig. 6A). GM-CSF-induced MCP-1 mRNA expression was also reduced by the Atv treatment (2.5–10 μmol/liter; Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the reduced MCP-1 mRNA expression was partially recovered by the addition of mevalonate (50 μmol/liter). GGTI (10 μmol/liter) mimicked the effect of Atv, whereas FTI (10 μmol/liter) showed less of an inhibitory effect (Fig. 6C). Atorvastatin Did Not Affect the MCP-1 Promoter Activity but Did Affect mRNA Stability–Atv treatment, however, did not inhibit the GM-CSF-induced MCP-1 transcription even at 10 μmol/liter concentration when the –538 construct were transfected (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, a nuclear run-on assay showed that Atv (5 μmol/liter) did not reduce the de novo synthesis of MCP-1 mRNA (114 ± 19% of GM-CSF treatment alone; not significant) (Fig. 7B). These results indicated that some post-transcriptional mechanism(s) for the reduction of MCP-1 mRNA expression is present, so we next investigated MCP-1 mRNA stability by using AcD. After a 16-h stimulation with GM-CSF, U937 cells were incubated with AcD to stop mRNA synthesis. Then total RNAs were harvested at 2, 3, and 6 h after AcD treatment to investigate the RNA stability in either the presence or absence of Atv (5 μmol/liter). When the cells were incubated with Atv, the MCP-1 mRNA half-life was significantly decreased compared with that with AcD treatment alone (half-life of 11.5 versus 8.1 h; Fig. 7B), indicating that Atv increased the destabilization of MCP-1 mRNA. Since the AUUUA Sequence in the 3′-UTR of the MCP-1 gene is suggested to regulate the mRNA stability of cytokines and chemokines (20Tebo J. Der S. Frevel M. Khabar K.S.A. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12085-12093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), next we addressed the 3′-UTR effects on the stability of the luciferase gene by measuring the luciferase activity (Fig. 8). When the 3′-UTR was absent, the activity was decreased to ∼60% of initial activity after 6 h of AcD treatment (Fig. 8A). The addition of 3′-UTR at the end of the luciferase gene increased the activity (Fig. 8B), which was significantly decreased by the treatment with Atv. When the AUUUA sequence was deleted from the 3′-UTR, the activity was decreased in comparison with AUUUA(+) constructs (Fig. 8B) and Atv-mediated suppression of the luciferase activity was no longer detected (Fig. 8C). However, in comparison with the 3′-UTR(–) construct (Fig. 8A), the AUUUA-deleted constructs still showed higher activities. These suggested that the 3′-UTR increased the mRNA stability in a AUUUA sequence-dependent manner and that Atv decreased the stability also via a AUUUA-dependent mechanism(s), at least in part. GM-CSF is a hematopoietic growth factor and a proinflammatory cytokine produced by inflammatory cells, including T-lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells (21Gasson J. Blood. 1991; 77: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Plenz G. Koenig C. Severs N.J. Robenek H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that GM-CSF has multiple effects, enhancing monocytic migration via RhoA/integrin activation and via expression of MMPs and MCP-1 (7Wu L. Tanimoto A. Murata Y. Fan J. Sasaguri Y. Watanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Kohno Y. Tanimoto A. Cirathaworn C. Shimajiri S. Tawara A. Sasaguri Y. Pathol. Int. 2004; 54: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show a molecular mechanism by which GM-CSF induced MCP-1 expression in U937 monocytic cells. GM-CSF increased MCP-1 transcription, mRNA expression, and MCP-1 production mediated through the Jak2-Stat5 signaling pathway and STAT5 motif but not via the AP-1 or NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, Atv inhibited GM-CSF-induced MCP-1 expression via destabilization of MCP-1 mRNA. Therefore, the findings presented here provide evidence that GM-CSF is an important regulator of monocytic MCP-1 expression and, moreover, suggest that the inhibitory effects of Atv on MCP-1 expression, which are independent of its lipid-lowering effect, may decrease the inflammatory reaction in atherosclerotic lesions. Among the cells constituting the vascular system, human monocytic cell lines (THP-1 and U937), human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells have been used for investigating the regulation of MCP-1 expression. For example, bacterial lipopolysaccharide has been reported to stimulate THP-1 cells to enhance MCP-1 expression, whereas IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α were shown to increase MCP-1 expression in U937 cells (23Ueda A.

Cota M. Polentarutti N. Mantovani A. Lazzarin A. Sozzani S. Poli G. Blood. 1998; 91: 258-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-1β enhance MCP-1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (25Yamada M. Kim S. Egashira K. Takeya M. Ikeda T. Mimura O. Iwao H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 23: 1996-2001Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Choi E.K. Park H.J. Ma J.S. Lee H.C. Kang H.C. Kim B.G. Kang I.C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and that tumor necrosis factor-α increases MCP-1 in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (27Chen Y.M. Chiang W.C. Lin S.L. Wu K.D. Tsai T.J. Hsieh B.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 309: 978-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Some of these studies have described the molecular mechanisms involved in the MCP-1 expression. Namely, lipopolysaccharide-induced MCP-1 up-regulation is mediated by NF-κB activation in THP-1 cells (23Ueda A. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31092-31099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, vascular endothelial growth factor- and IL-1β-induced expression of MCP-1 is up-regulated by the AP-1 and NF-κB signaling pathways, respectively (25Yamada M. Kim S. Egashira K. Takeya M. Ikeda T. Mimura O. Iwao H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 23: 1996-2001Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Choi E.K. Park H.J. Ma J.S. Lee H.C. Kang H.C. Kim B.G. Kang I.C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, many proinflammatory cytokines are able to up-regulate the MCP-1 expression in the vascular cells, at least in part, via AP-1 or NF-κB signaling pathways. In the present study, we studied the effects of GM-CSF, one of the proinflammatory cytokines, and found that GM-CSF up-regulated MCP-1 expression in human monocytic U937 cells. However, neither AP-1 nor NF-κB played a critical role in the GM-CSF-induced MCP-1 expression. Previous reports, including our own, demonstrated GM-CSF stimulation of MCP-1 expression in monocyte/macrophage (8Jost M.M. Ninci E. Meder B. Kempf C. van Royen N. Hua J. Berger B. Hoefer I. Modolell M. Buschmann I. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2281-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Kohno Y. Tanimoto A. Cirathaworn C. Shimajiri S. Tawara A. Sasaguri Y. Pathol.

Hematol. 1999; 27: 1735-1745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These studies, however, did not address the molecular mechanism(s) by which GM-CSF enhances monocytic MCP-1 expression. In general, GM-CSF binding to its receptor leads to activation of several kinases and transcriptional factors, such as Jak2, Ras, Raf, Erk, Stat5, and c-Fos, which consequently regulate gene expression (29Kwon E.M. Raines M.A. Blenis J. Sakamoto K.M. Blood. 2000; 95: 2552-2558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of monocytes/macrophages, Jak2-Stat5 activation is essential for GM-CSF signaling, and GM-CSF-induced Jak2-Stat5 activation is required for gene expression, monocyte/macrophage differentiation, phagocytosis, and macrophage proliferation (30Feldman G.M. Rosenthal L.A. Liu X. Hayes M.P. Wynshaw-Boris A. Leonard W.L. Hennighausen L. Finbloom D.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1768-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lehtonen A. Matikainen S. Miettinen M. Julkunen I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 511-519PubMed Google Scholar, 32Warby T.J. Crowe S.M. Jaworowski A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12630-12638Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, our current findings clearly demonstrated that GM-CSF stimulation resulted in the activation of the Jak2-Stat5 signaling pathway and that the STAT5 motif was critical for MCP-1 gene transcription in U937 monocytic cells. Therefore, the activation of Jak2-Stat5 signaling induced by GM-CSF might be associated with the critical functions of monocytes/macrophages. The knockdown experiments by siRNA targeting Stat5a (Fig. 3, D and E), however, did not show a complete suppression of the MCP-1 transcriptional activity, indicating the presence of further unknown mechanism(s). Since the phosphospecific anti-Stat5 antibody used in this study recognizes both Stat5a and Stat5b proteins, GM-CSF-mediated activation of Stat5 includes both isoforms (Figs. 3B and 4C). Thus, together with the results obtained from EMSA (Fig. 5), the Stat5b protein might be involved in the GM-CSF-induced MCP-1 expression. The adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium and consequent inflammatory response are an initial process in the early stage of atherogenesis, and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines by vascular cells modifies the vascular microenvironment (5Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1033-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar, 33Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6355) Google Scholar, 34Eierman D.F. Johonson C.E. Haskill J.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1970-1976PubMed Google Scholar). For example, it has been reported that monocyteendothelial cell interaction induces GM-CSF and MCP-1 synthesis in both cells (35Takahashi M. Kitagawa S. Masuyama J. Ikeda U. Kasahara T. Takahashi Y. Furukawa Y. Kano S. Shimada K. Circulation. 1996; 93: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 36Takahashi M. Masuyama J. Ikeda U. Kasahara T. Kitagawa S. Takahashi Y. Shimada K. Kano S. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 750-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since both GM-CSF and MCP-1 activate lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 and very late antigen-4 on U937 monocytes via RhoA activation (9Kohno Y. Tanimoto A. Cirathaworn C. Shimajiri S. Tawara A. Sasaguri Y. Pathol. Int. 2004; 54: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), monocyte-endothelial interaction might be enhanced by GM-CSF and further induce the cytokine expression. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the adhesive interaction enhancing GM-CSF and MCP-1 expression are currently unknown, expression of GM-CSF and MCP-1 might be closely related to the initiation of inflammatory reactions. Therefore, GM-CSF-induced transcriptional up-regulation of the MCP-1 gene by monocytes in the vascular microenvironment is quite possible for the initiation of atherosclerosis. Interestingly, it has been reported that cervastatin and atorvastatin reduce U937 monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells via down-regulation of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 and very late antigen-4 expression and via RhoA inactivation (37Yoshida M. Sawada T. Ishii H. Gerszten R.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Yasukochi Y. Numano F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 38Kawakami A. Tanaka A. Nakajima K. Shimokado K. Yoshida M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies reported that GM-CSF-induced RhoA activation is inhibited by statins (cervastatin and simvastatin) (39Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Yano M. Taguchi T. Matsuo T. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Imoto K. Nishikawa T. Kim-Mitsuya S. Takuwa Y. Araki E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6627-6633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, statins could inhibit both GM-CSF-induced monocytic MCP-1 expression and integrin/RhoA activation, which action would consequently result in down-regulation of monocytic recruitment in the subendothelial microenvironment. Just as simvastatin reduces tumor necrosis factor-α-induced MCP-1 expression in human macrophages (40Veillard N.R. Braunersreuther V. Arnaud C. Burger F. Pelli G. Steffens S. Mach F. Atherosclerosis. 2006; 188: 51-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that Atv treatment decreased GM-CSF-induced MCP-1 mRNA expression in U937 monocytes. The luciferase assay using 3′-UTR-including constructs suggests a possibility that the 3′-UTR increases mRNA stability and that AUUUA sequence is responsive to Atv. In rat vascular smooth muscle cell, platelet-derived growth factor increases MCP-1 mRNA expression via both increased transcription and mRNA stability (41Taubman M.B. Rollins B.J. Poon M. Marmur J. Green R.S. Berk B.C. Nadal-Ginard B. Cir. Res. 1992; 70: 314-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Bogdanov V.Y. Poon M. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24932-24938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and dexamethasone decreases the mRNA stability via the AUUUA-independent pathway (43Poon M. Liu B. Taubman M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since the Atv effects were partially reversed by mevalonate and mimicked by GGTI or FTI, Atv may regulate the MCP-1 mRNA half-life by inhibiting geranylgeranylation or farnesylation of proteins. In agreement with the present study, Atv has also been reported to decrease mRNA stability of angiotensin AT1 receptor (half-life of 6 versus 2.5 h) in vascular smooth muscle cells via inhibition of geranylgeranylation (44Wassmann S. Laufs U. Baumer A.T. Muller K. Konkol C. Sauer H. Bohm M. Nickenig G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In contrast, statins up-regulate endothelial nitric-oxide synthase expression by causing an increase in mRNA stability (half-life of 14 versus 27 h) via blocking of the geranylgeranylation of RhoA (45Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism(s) of Atv-mediated mRNA stabilization and destabilization is still unknown. In conclusion, our results indicate that GM-CSF enhanced monocytic MCP-1 expression at the transcription level via activation of the Jak2-Stat5 signaling pathway and that Atv decreased the stability of MCP-1 mRNA, potentially via an isoprenoid pathway. Thus, these results provide further evidence that statins have anti-inflammatory effects independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects. In addition to the inhibitory effects of statins on RhoA and integrins (36Takahashi M. Masuyama J. Ikeda U. Kasahara T. Kitagawa S. Takahashi Y. Shimada K. Kano S. Circ.

Using a fluorescence-based intracellular O2 sensing technique, we investigated the respiration of differentiated PC12 cells upon depolarization with 100 mm K+. Single cell confocal analysis identified a significant depolarization of the plasma membrane potential and a relatively minor depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential following K+ exposure. We observed a two-phase respiratory response: a first intense spike lasting ∼10 min, during which average intracellular O2 was reduced from 85–90% of air saturation to 55–65%, followed by a second wave of smaller amplitude and longer duration. The fast rise in O2 consumption coincided with a transient increase in cellular ATP by ∼60%, which was provided largely by oxidative phosphorylation and by glycolysis. The increase of respiration was orchestrated mainly by Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the influx of extracellular Ca2+ contributed ∼20%. Depletion of Ca2+ stores by ryanodine, thapsigargin, and 4-chloro-m-cresol reduced the amplitude of respiratory spike by 45, 63, and 71%, respectively, whereas chelation of intracellular Ca2+ abolished the response. Uncoupling of the mitochondria with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone amplified the responses to K+; elevated respiration induced a profound deoxygenation without increasing the cellular ATP levels reduced by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Cleavage of synaptobrevin 2 by tetanus toxin, known to reduce neurotransmission, did not affect the respiratory response to K+, whereas the general excitability of dPC12 cells increased.

Membrane fusion, a key event of exocytosis, is not energy-demanding, because the formation of the trans-SNARE complex is thermodynamically favorable (3Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B.

Conversely, vesicle filling, transport, and recycling events consume 10–20% of energy resources, whereas re-establishment of resting membrane potential and maintenance of iCa2+ equilibrium by ion pumps consume 60–80% of ATP in neuronal cells (5Ames A. II I Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 34: 42-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Despite being only 2% of body weight, the central nervous system consumes about 20% of O2 inspired at rest (6Silver I. Erecinska M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 454: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to fuel sustained neuronal activity with ATP supply through oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). When overproduced, ATP down-regulates the respiration by allosteric inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase (7Arnold S. Kadenbach B. Eur. J.

However, the detailed dynamics and regulation of metabolism in neuronal cells upon activation with different stimuli are not very well studied. Ca2+ oscillations in the mitochondrial matrix are known to regulate mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), electron transport chain (ETC) activity, and ATP production. Transient Ca2+ influxes activate tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes and modulate the activity of ETC complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and complex V (F0F1 ATP synthase) (8Territo P.R. French S.A.

Because of the low efficiency of Na+/Ca2+ and H+/Ca2+ exchangers and high buffering capacity, the mitochondria can transiently retain Ca2+ released from ER during excitation, thus contributing to the regulation of neurotransmission and modulating synaptic plasticity (14Billups B.

On the other hand, overload of the mitochondria with Ca2+ can trigger permeability transition pore formation and apoptosis (16Ichas F. Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.P.

Elevation of iCa2+ induces fast NT release via activation of the vesicular Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin 1 (19Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Generally, evoked NT exocytosis is triggered by eCa2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) controlled by the plasma membrane potential (for review see Ref. 2Sudhof T.C. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). In turn, eCa2+ influx stimulates Ca2+ release from the ER, which modulates Ca2+-signaling pathways. However, recent studies demonstrate that even in the absence of eCa2+, neuronal cells can perform evoked neurotransmission driven by the ER (20Billups D. Billups B. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9983-9995Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Ryglewski S. Pflueger H.J. Duch C.

Action potential-driven activation of VGCC and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores can be mimicked by depolarizing plasma membrane with high extracellular K+ (eK+). It has been shown that upon prolonged exposure to high eK+, PC12 cells undergo sustained membrane depolarization (23Nishi R. Berg D.K. Dev. Biol. 1981; 87: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and can execute frequent NT exocytosis for several minutes (24Westerink R.H. de Groot A. Vijverberg H.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Derived from rat adrenal pheochromocytoma, PC12 cells have rather heterogeneous pool of Ca2+ stores and express L, N, T, and P/Q types of VGCC (25Liu H. Felix R. Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Campbell K.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7557-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shafer T.J. Atchison W.D. Neurotoxicology. 1991; 12: 473-492PubMed Google Scholar). Such architecture provides diverse mechanisms of regulation of iCa2+, neurotransmission, and mitochondrial activity. Differentiated PC12 (dPC12) cells demonstrate gene expression profiles, evoked NT release, and many other features typical for neuronal cells (25Liu H. Felix R. Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Campbell K.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7557-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shafer T.J. Atchison W.D. Neurotoxicology. 1991; 12: 473-492PubMed Google Scholar) and rely on both OxPhos and glycolysis as energy sources (27Reynolds E.E. Melega W.P. Howard B.D. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4795-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Oxygen supply and consumption within the cell are informative markers of OxPhos, cell energetics, and signaling. Thus far these parameters were not amenable to routine analysis. The well established O2 respirometry technique (28Buerk D.G. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 381: 665-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) has limited applicability to suspension cell lines, low resolution power, and information content (end-point measurement), whereas the iO2 imaging technique (29O'Riordan T.C. Fitzgerald K. Ponomarev G.V. Mackrill J. Hynes J. Taylor C. Papkovsky D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: R1613-R1620Google Scholar), although allowing detailed single-cell analyses, has a high level of complexity and low sample throughput. The new fluorescence-based methodology of sensing intracellular O2 (30O'Riordan T.C. Zhdanov A.V. Ponomarev G.V. Papkovsky D.B. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 9414-9419Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) addresses these limitations and provides simple, high throughput analysis of iO2 gradients in cell populations and effects of various metabolic effectors and stimuli. In this study, we applied this technique to examine the respiratory responses of dPC12 cells to sustained membrane depolarization by high eK+ and to metabolic and Ca2+ effectors. Some other cell lines and parameters relevant to mitochondrial and neurosecretory functions were also analyzed to elaborate fine mechanisms of responses in dPC12 cells. We demonstrate that a marked increase in O2 consumption induced by high eK+ proceeds in two distinct phases and that this response requires fast Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive stores. During the first phase of response, the cells transiently elevate ATP by 60% over the resting level. Uncoupling of the ETC with FCCP enhances the respiratory response without elevating ATP. Finally, hampered NT exocytosis was shown not to alter significantly the respiratory response of dPC12 cells to membrane depolarization. Materials—Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12), human neuroblastoma (SH SY5Y), human cervix epitheloid carcinoma (HeLa), human lung carcinoma (A549), and mouse muscle myoblast (C2C12) cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. Phosphorescent oxygen-sensing probe MitoXpress® was from Luxcel Biosciences (Cork, Ireland), and Endo-Porter was from Gene Tools, LLC (Philomath, OR). The antibodies were: mouse anti-synaptobrevin 2 (SYSY; Göttingen, Germany), mouse anti-β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; Santa Cruz, CA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse (DAKO; Glostrup, Denmark). ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents were from GE Healthcare (Waukesha, WI), and protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche Applied Sciences. Ca2+ fluorescent indicator Fluo-4 AM, MitoTracker® Red, DAPI, DiSBAC2(3), and TMRM were obtained from Invitrogen. Cellular ATP assay kit CellTiter-Glo® was from Promega (Madison, WI), and BCA™ protein assay was from Pierce. Collagen IV was from Fluka, and 4-chloro-m-cresol (CmC) was from Merck. Black body, clear-bottomed 96-well plates for fluorescent measurement, and white 96-well plate for luminescence analysis were from Greiner Bio One (Frickenhausen, Germany); WillCo dishes were from WillCo Wells BV (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Cell culture plasticware was from Sarstedt (Wexford, Ireland), and all other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture and Treatments—PC12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2. For oxygen sensing experiments, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 3 min at 37 °C with 0.25% trypsin/2 mm EDTA solution, resuspended in RPMI medium, passed 6–8 times through the 23-gauge needle to separate individual cells, and seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates precoated with collagen IV (31Tomaselli K.J. Damsky C.H. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2347-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The cells were grown for 8 h and then differentiated for 6–8 days in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor. Transfection was performed by incubating dPC12 with 1.2 μm MitoXpress®/6 μm Endo-Porter for 28 h in differentiating conditions. The cells were washed twice with serum-rich RPMI; washed once with RPMI without serum, phenol red, and l-glutamine; and then analyzed on a fluorescent reader in 100 μl of RPMI without serum and phenol red. The viability of cells loaded with probe was tested (after trypsinization) on a PCA-96 flow cytometer using ViaCount™ kit and Cytosoft 2.5.5 software (all Guava Technologies), as per the manufacturer's instructions. To assess the contribution of glycolysis to ATP production, dPC12 cells were preincubated for 3 h in serum-free RPMI containing 10 mm galactose and 1 mm pyruvate (32Marroquin L.D. Hynes J. Dykens J.A. Jamieson J.D. Will Y. Toxicol. Sci. 2007; 97: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To reduce neurotransmission through cleavage of synaptobrevin 2, dPC12 were treated with 20 nm tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) for 6 h after transfection. Chelation of iCa2+ was achieved by incubation of cells with 50 μm BAPTA-AM for 30 min; eCa2+ was removed with 2.5 mm EGTA; iCa2+ stores were depleted by the addition of 50–500 μm CmC, 2 μm ryanodine, or 10 μm thapsigargin. SH-SY5Y, HeLa, A549, and C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For oxygen sensing experiments SH-SY5Y and C2C12 were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized for 5 min at 37 °C, resuspended in the same medium, and seeded on 96-well plate at 2 × 104 and 1 × 104 cells/well, respectively. The cells were grown for 1 day, differentiated for 3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% horse serum and then loaded with MitoXpress probe in differentiating conditions, as described for PC12 cells. HeLa and A549 cells having low transfection efficiency were loaded at 75–85% confluence in 75-cm2 flasks, incubating with 1.2 μm MitoXpress®/6 μm Endo-Porter for 28 h. The cells were then washed, trypsinized, seeded on 96-well plate at 3–5 × 105 cells/well, and allowed to adhere for 3 h prior to fluorescence measurements. Oxygen Sensing Assay—Typically, up to 24 samples, including loaded cells and appropriate controls, were analyzed in parallel on a time-resolved fluorescent (TR-F) plate reader Victor 2 (PerkinElmer Life Science) as described in Ref. 30O'Riordan T.C. Zhdanov A.V. Ponomarev G.V. Papkovsky D.B. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 9414-9419Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar. Briefly, TR-F measurements were carried out in air-saturated medium at 37 °C with standard 340-nm excitation and 642-nm emission filters. Each sample well was measured periodically, by taking two intensity readings at delay times of 30 and 70 μs and a gate time of 100 μs. The plate was monitored for 10–20 min to reach O2 and temperature equilibrium and obtain basal signals. The plate was then quickly withdrawn from the reader, compounds were added to the wells in 10-μl aliquots, and monitoring was resumed for the next 20–60 min. Measured TR-F intensity profiles were converted into lifetime (τ) profiles using equation (33Valeur, B. (2002) Molecular Fluorescence: Principles and Applications, pp. 351-377, Wiley-VCH, New YorkGoogle Scholar): τ = (t2 - t1)/ln (F1 - F2), where t1 = 30 μs and t2 = 70 μs are the two delay times and F1 and F2 are the corresponding fluorescent signals at gate time 100 μs. The lifetime relates to iO2 as follows (34Hogan M.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 1999; 86: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar): [iO2] = (t0/t - 1)/Kq, where the lifetime of unquenched probe (i.e. at zero O2), τ0, and quenching constant, Kq, are parameters determined from two-point calibration experiments (see “Results”). Fluorescence Microscopy—For probe localization studies, PC12 cells were differentiated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips, loaded with the probe as above, washed, incubated with 25 nm MitoTracker® Red for 45 min, washed again with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, counter-stained with DAPI, mounted with Mowiol, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Microscopy was performed on Olympus FV1000 confocal laser scanning biological microscope. The MitoXpress® was imaged using an oil immersion 60× objective with excitation by a 405-nm argon laser and measurement of emission using a 630–660-nm filter. The DAPI nuclear stain and MitoTracker® Red were imaged according to the manufacturer's protocols; for MitoTracker® Red, the emission filter was adjusted to 600–630 nm. The images were analyzed using FV1000 Viewer software (Olympus) and Adobe Photoshop. Western Blot Analysis—5 × 105 of PC12 cells were differentiated for 7 days on the collagen IV-coated 6-well plates, treated with 20 nm TeNT for 6 h, harvested with lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture, snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Untreated dPC12 were used as a control. Total protein concentration in dPC12 cell lysates was determined with a BCA protein assay kit, normalized, and applied on the gel. The proteins were separated by 10% or 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a 0.2-μm Protran nitrocellulose membrane, stained with anti-β-tubulin or anti-synaptobrevin antibodies, and then stained with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The signals were developed with ECL Plus reagents and visualized on LAS-3000 Imager (Fujifilm) using Image Reader LAS-3000 2.2 software. Densitometry analysis was performed with Multi Gauge program using β-tubulin signals to normalize protein samples. ATP Measurement—Cellular total ATP was quantified using CellTiter-Glo® assay following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, before and at certain time intervals after compound treatment, the cells were lysed with CellTiterGlo® reagent. After intensive shaking for 2 min, the samples were dispensed in the wells of white 96-well plates, incubated for 10 min, and then read on the Victor2 reader under standard luminescence settings. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+—dPC12 cells were incubated with 5 μm Fluo-4 (AM) for 1 h, washed, and incubated for further 30 min in phenol red free RPMI medium to complete de-esterification. The fluorescence of samples treated with different compounds (see results) in 0.1 ml of medium in clear 96-well plates was monitored in kinetic mode on the GENios Pro reader (TECAN), using a 485 ± 20-nm excitation filter and a 535 ± 20-nm emission filter. NAD(P)H Measurement—NAD(P)H auto-fluorescence was monitored according to a modified method (35Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were incubated in suspension for 3 h in serum-free RPMI containing 10 mm glucose and pipetted into the wells of clear 96-well plate (4 × 105 cells in 0.1 ml). The fluorescence of samples was monitored in kinetic mode on the Victor 2 reader at 37 °C with 355-nm excitation and 460-nm emission filters, with and without effector addition. Antimycin A (4 μm) was used as positive control (maximal fluorescent signal), and FCCP (4 μm) was used as negative control (minimal signal). Monitoring of Mitochondrial and Plasma Membrane Potentials—PC12 cells were differentiated on WillCo dishes precoated with collagen IV and loaded with 20 nm TMRM or 1 μm DiSBAC2(3) (36Ward M.W. Huber H.J. Weisova P. Dussmann H. Nicholls D.G. Prehn J.H. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8238-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 37 °C (in the dark) in experimental buffer (120 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm Na2SO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 15 mm glucose, pH 7.4). The Willco dishes with cells were washed in fresh medium after loading before being mounted in a nonperfusion (37 °C) holder and placed on the stage of a LSM 510 Meta Zeiss (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) confocal microscope. TMRM and DiSBAC2(3) were excited at 543 nm with a helium-neon laser (3%), and the emission was collected through a 560-nm-long pass filter. Fluorescence and differential interference contrast images were collected at 30-s intervals throughout and every 15 s following KCl (100 mm) excitation. The resulting fluorescence images were processed using Metamorph Software version 7.1 release 3 (Molecular Devices, Berkshire, UK). ΔΨm and ΔΨp were calculated using the models provided by Ward et al. (36Ward M.W. Huber H.J. Weisova P. Dussmann H. Nicholls D.G. Prehn J.H. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8238-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Nicholls (37Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14864-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Fitting parameters for cerebellar granule neurons were adapted. Both models provided similar results (see Fig. 6 and supplemental figure, respectively) for changes in ΔΨm and ΔΨp following stimulation with K+ (100 mm). Assessment of iO2 in Resting PC12 Cells—Activation of mitochondrial machinery and OxPhos is linked to elevated respiration leading to reduced iO2. Using a new iO2 sensing technique (30O'Riordan T.C. Zhdanov A.V. Ponomarev G.V. Papkovsky D.B. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 9414-9419Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we examined respiratory responses of neurosecretory dPC12 cells to excitatory stimuli, known to induce NT release. Optimization of the procedure for the passive loading of dense populations of dPC12 cells (Fig. 1A) with the phosphorescent oxygen-sensing probe MitoXpress® resulted in high and reproducible signals from the cells when assessed by TR-F. Phosphorescence intensity signals measured on a standard TR-F plate reader Victor 2 were in the region of 40,000–100,000 cps, with a signal-to-blank ratio of >150. Cell viability remained unaffected (93–95%). When monitoring resting cells in air-saturated medium at 37 °C, phosphorescence intensity signal was seen to decrease significantly (by 25–40% after 1 h of monitoring), because of probe photobleaching. In contrast, the phosphorescence lifetime signals calculated from pairs of intensity readings (at delay times 30 and 70 μs) remained stable and reproducible (33–35 μs). This measurement mode provided the basis for reliable and accurate real time monitoring of average O2 levels in dPC12 and other cells and their responses to various stimuli and metabolic effectors. Confocal fluorescent images of transfected and co-stained cells demonstrate that the probe is distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm and surrounds the mitochondria visualized with MitoTracker® Red (Fig. 1B). Detailed calibrations performed with PC12 cells loaded with MitoXpress™ probe revealed good linearity of Stern-Volmer plots (30O'Riordan T.C. Zhdanov A.V. Ponomarev G.V. Papkovsky D.B. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 9414-9419Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Assuming that the minimal phosphorescence lifetime of the probe in integral but nonrespiring cells corresponds to iO2 in the extracellular medium (i.e. 100% of air saturation, or 230 μm) and the maximal lifetime corresponds to deoxygenated medium, we performed a simple two-point calibration. For dPC12 cells treated with antimycin A (i.e. nonrespiring), the measured lifetime was 30.5 μs, and upon the addition of glucose/glucose oxidase (deoxygenated cells) it was 66.3 μs, which gives (see “Experimental Procedures”) a quenching constant Kq of 0.0117%-1 and an average iO2 of 85–90% of air saturation for resting dPC12 cells. Rapid Spike in Oxygen Consumption by PC12 Cells in Response to Membrane Depolarization by eK+—Excitable cells respond to certain stimuli in a fast energetic manner, with the excretion of bioactive molecules or cell contraction. Thus, membrane depolarization by eK+ at concentrations exceeding the threshold of 56 mm induces Ca2+-dependent evoked NT release in dPC12 cells (38Martin P.T. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7388-7392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine how sustained membrane depolarization affects O2 consumption, dPC12 cells loaded with the probe were stimulated with different concentrations of KCl while monitoring them on the Victor 2 reader at 37 °C (Fig. 2A). At 25 mm eK+ had no measurable effect, and subdepolarizing 50 mm eK+ caused a short minor spike in lifetime, reflecting a decrease in iO2 by ∼6%, whereas 100 mm eK+ caused a marked rise in respiration reducing iO2 by 20–30%. The response of dPC12 to high eK+ showed two distinct phases: a short intense spike lasting ∼10 min, followed by a second wave of lower amplitude reaching a maximum ∼30 min after stimulation. At eK+ below the membrane depolarization threshold, only the first phase of reduced duration and amplitude was observed. Cell pretreatment with 10 mm ouabain, which inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase and perturbs plasma membrane potential, decreased the response to high eK+ by 20 ± 5% (Fig. 2A). Measurements performed with the probe added to the extracellular medium revealed that there are no global O2 gradients in samples containing the cells, and the levels of bulk O2 remain at ∼100% of air saturation. Transient Increase in Oxygen Consumption in dPC12 Cells upon Membrane Depolarization Is Specific to Neurosecretory Cells—To examine whether the respiratory response to eK+ is specific to excitable cells, we exposed to 100 mm K+ nondifferentiated PC12 (nPC12), cervical epithelial He"
https://openalex.org/W2006993298,"Human group IIA phospholipase A2 (IIA PLA2) is an acute phase protein first identified at high concentrations in synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Its physiological role has since been debated; the enzyme has a very high affinity for anionic phospholipid interfaces but expresses almost zero activity with zwitterionic phospholipid substrates, because of a lack of interfacial binding. We have prepared the cysteine-containing mutant (S74C) to allow the covalent attachment of fluorescent reporter groups. We show that fluorescently labeled IIA was taken up by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-activated THP-1 cells in an energy-dependent process involving cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Uptake concurrently involved significant cell swelling, characteristic of macropinocytosis and the fluorescent enzyme localized to the nucleus.

The enzyme produced supramolecular aggregates with anionic phospholipid vesicles as a result of bridging between particles, a property that is unique to this globally cationic IIA PLA2. Uptake of such aggregates labeled with fluorescent anionic phospholipid was dramatically enhanced by the IIA protein, and uptake involved binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on activated THP-1 cells. A physiological role for this protein is proposed that involves the removal of anionic extracellular cell debris, including anionic microparticles generated as a result of trauma, infection, and the inflammatory response, and under such conditions serum levels of IIA PLA2 can increase ∼1000-fold.

Serum levels of the secreted enzyme can rise 1000-fold during severe sepsis, and the enzyme has been recognized as an acute phase protein under the transcriptional control of pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling (2Crowl R.M. Stoller T.J. Conroy R.R. Stoner C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2647-2651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibacterial properties of this highly cationic extracellular protein is part of the innate immune response and can be readily explained by its ability to both bind and hydrolyze the anionic cell membranes of bacteria (3Wright G.W. Ooi C.E. Weiss J. Elsbach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6675-6681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Immunol. 2005; 116: 1000-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the precise roles of the enzyme remain enigmatic, particularly in terms of effects of this protein on host cell function. This is because in contrast to the very high affinity of this extracellular enzyme for anionic phospholipid interfaces, the enzyme has a very low affinity for the plasma membrane of normal host cells because of the zwitterionic nature of their outer phospholipid monolayers. As a result negligible rates of membrane hydrolysis are observed, although immunoactivated cells and cells that have initiated apoptosis are hydrolyzed (11Atsumi G. Murakami M. Tajima M. Shimbara S. Hara N. Kudo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and a role for this enzyme in the clearance of apoptotic and damaged cells has been proposed (12Hack C.E. Wolbink G.J. Schalkwijk C. Speijer H. Hermens W.T. vandenBosch H. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 111-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).There is no detailed understanding of how interactions between the extracellular enzyme and the cell surface might affect cell function as part of the inflammatory response. The binding of extracellular human IIA to cell surface HSPGs has been noted but not investigated in detail (8Kudo I. Murakami M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediators. 2002; 68: 3-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 13Murakami M. Koduri R.S. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Seki M. Yoshihara K. Singer A. Valentin E.

In addition, human high affinity cell surface receptors for the human group IIA enzyme have not been detected (14Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 15Rouault M. Le Calvez C. Boilard E. Surrel F. Singer A. Ghomashchi F. Bezzine S. Scarzello S. Bollinger J. Gelb M.H. Lambeau G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1647-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of considerable interest to investigate the interaction of labeled human IIA with human cells to clarify the role of this clinically important enzyme.As the group IIA protein targets cells from an extracellular location, chemical labeling of the protein with fluorescent reporters and investigation of its interaction with cells in culture is feasible. The human monocyte-derived cell line THP-1 was chosen as a target, as these cells can be differentiated into a cell with an adherent, macrophage-like phenotype and by a number of procedures, including PMA treatment.Our data demonstrate the ability of these activated cells to take up the IIA protein rapidly, by a mechanism that does not require enzyme catalysis, and subsequent trafficking of IIA to the cell nucleus was observed. Uptake was HSPG- and energy-dependent, and the highly significant cell swelling observed was characteristic of macropinocytosis. Most importantly the globally cationic protein aggregated anionic phospholipid vesicles and dramatically promoted their uptake into cells. We propose that a fundamental physiological role of the group IIA PLA2 is in the clearance of anionic pathological cell debris, including microparticles resulting from the inflammatory response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSpecialized Reagents–DOPG, DOPC, and DOPS were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). 11-(Dansylamino)-undecanoic acid, Alexa Fluor-568 maleimide dye, annexin V-Alexa Fluor-488 conjugate, concanavalin A-Alexa Fluor-488 conjugate, and Texas Red 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphoethanolamine, calcein were from Molecular Probes. Texas Red-2-sulfonamidoethyl-methanethiosulfonate, 2-[(5-fluorosceinyl)aminocarbonyl]ethyl-methanethiosulfonate, and dansylamidoethyl-methanethiosulfonate were from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada).Cell Culture–THP-1 cell line (ECACC, Porton Down, UK) was cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with low endotoxin fetal calf serum (10% v/v), 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Differentiation was induced by treatment (1 × 106 cells/ml) with PMA (20 ng/ml) for 24 h, and after adherent cells were washed and maintained in complete media lacking phenol red.Preparation and Purification of Human IIA PLA2 Mutants–The preparation of mutations at Val-3 and His-48 have been described previously (16Baker S.F. Othman R. Wilton D.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13203-13211Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Edwards S.H. Thompson D. Baker S.F. Wood S.P. Wilton D.C.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7326-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Synthetic complementary oligo-nucleotide primers containing the desired mutation used for the construction of S74C were as follows: S74C forward, 5′-C TCT AAC TCT GGT TGC CGA ATC ACC TGC G-3′; and S74C reverse, 3′-G AGA TTG AGA CCA ACG GCT TAG TGG ACG C-5′. Bacterial protein expression and purification were as described previously (19Othman R. Baker S. Li Y. Worrall A.F. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Secondary structures were confirmed by CD analysis (18Beers S.A. Buckland A.G. Giles N. Gelb M.H. Wilton D.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7326-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry–Mass spectrometry was performed on mutant and fluorescently labeled proteins using a Fisons VG QUATTRO II quadrupole mass spectrometer in electrospray mode, and a Micromass LCT™ orthogonal acceleration time of flight mass spectrometer fitted with a nano-electrospray source.Fluorescent Labeling of Cysteine Mutants–Cysteine mutants were prepared for labeling with thiol-reactive fluorescent dyes by transfer of 0.5 mg of enzyme into 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4. The enzyme was treated with a 10 m excess of dithiothreitol on ice for 30 min to remove the extra cysteine molecule disulfide bound to the mutant (20Lin Y. Nielsen R. Murray D. Hubbell W.L. Mailer C. Robinson B.H. Gelb M.H. Science. 1998; 279: 1925-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol was removed after the 30 min of incubation by washing with fresh 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, using a concentrator. The sample was analyzed using ESI-MS (described previously) to ensure removal of extra cysteine. The reduced enzyme was treated for 2 h at room temperature in the presence of a 10 m excess of Alexa Fluor-568 maleimide (AF-568) dye in Me2SO, or 50 min on ice in the presence of a 10 m excess of Texas Red-2-sulfonamidoethyl-methanethiosulfonate, 2-[(5-fluorosceinyl)aminocarbonyl]ethyl-methanethiosulfonate, or dansylamidoethyl-methanethiosulfonate dyes. All excess dye was removed through a PD-10 desalting column.Enzyme Assays–PLA2 measurements were performed using a 11-(dansylamino)undecanoic acid displacement assay (21Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Calcein Release–Calcein release was measured using a Hitachi F2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation, 490 nm; emission, 420 nm). Data were normalized to 100% release by treatment with 1% Triton X-100 (v/v).Flow Cytometry–Cells were harvested using Accutase (PAA Laboratories Ltd.) and suspended to 1 × 106 cells/ml. 0.75-ml assays were set up in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and incubated at 37 °C end over end under desired conditions. After the appropriate time, cells were transferred to FACS tubes and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to pellet cells. The pellet was washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and maintained for flow cytometry (FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer, BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using Cellquest.Trypan blue fluorescence quenching was achieved by adding the dye in a 1:1 ratio (by volume) to the sample being analyzed. The difference in fluorescence between samples with and without trypan blue shows the proportion of IIA PLA2 that has been internalized.Confocal Microscopy–Cells were treated under the desired conditions before being washed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and the plasma membranes were stained with concanavalin A-Alexa Fluor-488 for 10 min. Cells were then visualized using a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM 510 META).Epifluorescence Microscopy–Cells were cultured at 4 × 104 cells/ml on 13-mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates and treated as above. Coverslips were analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope.RESULTSChemical Labeling of Human Group IIA PLA2 at Position 74 after Cysteine Substitution Mutagenesis Produces Fully Active Proteins–There have been no qualitative or quantitative studies of labeled protein to monitor the binding, potential uptake, and distribution of the human group IIA PLA2 into human cells. To investigate these processes, we used a combination of FACS and fluorescence microscopy. Therefore, it was necessary to produce fluorescent enzyme derivatives and to ensure that attachment per se and position of the fluorescent probe did not affect protein function. Two surface features of the IIA PLA2 protein are important for its potential functions as follows: first, an interfacial (membrane) binding surface surrounding the channel leading to the active site (22Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and second, clusters of cationic residues globally distributed over the protein surface capable of binding to HSPGs (22Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Inspection of the IIA PLA2 molecule indicated that amino acid residue Ser-74, on the opposing face from the interfacial binding surface of the protein, was a suitable location for the cysteine substitution (see supplemental Fig. S1). The site-directed mutant, S74C, was produced to provide a chemically reactive thiol group to allow specific labeling. This thiol group was reacted with the methanethiosulfonate derivatives of Texas Red, fluorescein, or dansyl fluorophores or with Alexa Fluor-568 maleimide. The fluorescent derivatives of the catalytically inactive mutant, H48N, were also prepared (H48N,S74C), and the parent active site mutant had <0.5% of the catalytic activity of the wild type enzyme (17Edwards S.H. Thompson D. Baker S.F. Wood S.P. Wilton D.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15468-15476Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, another mutant, V3C, on the interfacial binding surface was prepared, and both V3C and S74C were labeled with the polarity sensitive dansyl fluorophore (see supplemental Fig. S1). These derivatives will detect binding to phospholipid vesicles that involves both the front and back surface of the protein.After purification, the identity of each labeled protein was confirmed by ESI-MS (Table 1). To ensure that the labeled enzymes retained functionalities of the parent enzyme, catalytic activities were assayed and were found to be not significantly different. An exception was the dansylated V3C mutant where the interfacial binding surface of the enzyme has been modified. This derivative showed 50% of the parent enzyme activity against DOPG and significantly greater activity against DOPC (Table 2). The enhanced activity with DOPC vesicles as the result of attachment of an aromatic dansyl group at position 3 was not unexpected because tryptophan insertion (V3W) produced increased activity (16Baker S.F. Othman R. Wilton D.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13203-13211Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) because of enhanced interfacial binding (18Beers S.A. Buckland A.G. Giles N. Gelb M.H. Wilton D.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7326-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HSPG binding activity, assayed as binding affinity for heparin-Sepharose, was unaffected by all modifications (data not shown). Thus we were confident that when these fluorescent enzymes were added to cultured cells and monitored by FACS and fluorescence microscopy they would mimic the significant properties of the wild type IIA enzyme. Moreover, using a catalytically inactive mutant (Table 2) would clearly define functions of the enzyme that were independent of phospholipid hydrolysis.TABLE 1ESI-MS analysis of IIA PLA2, mutants, and conjugatesIIA PLA2Mutant conjugatePredicted massMeasured massDaDaWild type13,860.913,862.4S74CaThe cysteine-containing mutant is initially isolated as a disulfide with cysteine that was present in the refolding buffer; the additional cysteine is removed by selective reduction prior to addition of the fluorescent probe.13,996.013,996.2S74C reduced13,876.913,877.0S74C-dansyl14,186.914,185.1S74C-Texas Red14,541.614,541.4S74C-AF56814,735.814,735.8S74C-fluorescein14,309.414,310.1H48NS74CaThe cysteine-containing mutant is initially isolated as a disulfide with cysteine that was present in the refolding buffer; the additional cysteine is removed by selective reduction prior to addition of the fluorescent probe.13,973.013,973.0S74C reduced13,853.813,854.7S74C-dansyl14,162.814,163.0S74C-fluorescein14,268.314,268.0S74C-AF56814,711.714,712.3V3CV3CaThe cysteine-containing mutant is initially isolated as a disulfide with cysteine that was present in the refolding buffer; the additional cysteine is removed by selective reduction prior to addition of the fluorescent probe.13,984.013,985.0V3C-reduced13,864.913,865.8V3C-dansyl14,173.914,174.0a The cysteine-containing mutant is initially isolated as a disulfide with cysteine that was present in the refolding buffer; the additional cysteine is removed by selective reduction prior to addition of the fluorescent probe.

Biol. 1995; 15: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and these cells have been widely used to investigate a variety of cellular events (24Abe A. Poucher H.K. Hiraoka M. Shayman J.A. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 667-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), particularly phagocytosis and other uptake phenomena (25Berges C. Naujokat C. Tinapp S. Wieczorek H.

Acta. 2004; 1686: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our first objective was to determine whether, and under what conditions, the labeled IIA PLA2 (S74C-Fl) could bind to THP-1 cells. FACS showed that binding to PMA-untreated cells was negligible, but binding was greatly enhanced by prior treatment of cells with PMA for 24 h (Fig. 1A), conditions that produced morphological differentiation and adherence to tissue culture plastic. PMA treatment at 50 ng/ml produced a 14-fold increase in enzyme binding to cells (Fig. 1A) in line with the >10-fold reported increase in HSPG expression (23Edwards I.J. Xu H.Z. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. Wagner W.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Following stimulation by PMA, the binding of the fluorescent enzyme to the cells reached saturation within 60 min (Fig. 1B). The catalytically inactive IIA PLA2 mutant (H48N) showed no significant difference in binding to THP-1 cells compared with the labeled IIA PLA2 (S74C-Fl) protein (Fig. 1C), thus clearly establishing that phospholipid hydrolysis is not a requirement for this additional IIA function.Binding of IIA PLA2 to Cell Surface PS or HSPGs?–The molecular basis of PMA differentiation leading to binding of IIA PLA2 to THP-1 cells was investigated. Cell differentiation is often associated with increased PS exposure on the cell surface, also a characteristic of cell apoptosis. An increased concentration of this anionic phospholipid in the outer monolayer of the plasma membrane could increase the interfacial binding affinity of cationic IIA PLA2 and enhance membrane hydrolysis (18Beers S.A. Buckland A.G. Giles N. Gelb M.H. Wilton D.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7326-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). PS exposure can be detected using the probe annexin V-AF488 that will bind with high affinity to cell surface PS. Enhanced binding was observed with PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells compared with control cells, although binding was 2-3-fold greater than differentiated cells when apoptosis was induced using etoposide (Fig. 2A). Although annexin V could self-compete, no competition was observed between annexin V and IIA PLA2 (Fig. 2B) suggesting that different cell surface receptors may be involved for the two binding phenomena. Moreover, treatment of cells with 7-ketocholesterol, known to increase surface expression of PS in THP-1 cells, in a dose-dependent manner (27Berthier A. Lemaire-Ewing S. Prunet C. Montange T. Vejux A. Pais De Barros J.P. Monier S. Gambert P. Lizard G. Néel D. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), failed to achieve significant binding of the IIA PLA2 until at high doses (100 μg/ml) that also brought about a concomitant reduction in cell viability (Fig. 2C). Thus our conclusion from these experiments is that PS exposure, at the levels detected following cell differentiation, does not play a major role in the binding of IIA PLA2 to PMA-activated THP-1 cells.FIGURE 2PS exposure in the outer membrane leaflet of PMA-activated THP-1 cells does not contribute significantly to IIA PLA2 binding. A, cells were untreated or activated with 20 ng/ml PMA for 24 h. Apoptosis was subsequently induced in activated cells by treatment with 100 μm etoposide for 3 h. PS exposure was measured using annexin V-AF488, as described by the manufacturer. B, binding of annexin V-AF488 to activated cell was also measured in the presence of nonfluorescent annexin V or wild type IIA PLA2 at concentrations indicated. Cell-associated fluorescence was determined by FACS analysis. C, THP-1 cells were preincubated with the indicated concentration of 7-ketocholesterol for 24 h. Harvested cells were treated with annexin V-AF488 (○) or 0.25 μg/ml S74C-Fl (•) for 45 min. Cell-associated fluorescence was determined by FACS analysis.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10083-10096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The role of HSPGs in the binding of IIA PLA2 to THP-1 cells was established by pretreatment of cells for 48 h with chlorate (a competitive inhibitor for the formation of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, the high energy donor of sulfation reactions). Chlorate treatment resulted in an 80% suppression of the binding of the IIA enzyme. To demonstrate specificity of the chlorate response, cells were given a 24-h recovery period to repopulate HSPGs, and this correlated with a return to IIA binding levels of chlorate-untreated but PMA-differentiated cells (Fig. 3A). Cells remained viable at the concentration of chlorate used. The multivalent electrostatic interaction of proteins with HSPGs is well established, and a similar mode for IIA PLA2 binding was suggested by the dose-dependent inhibition of binding by NaCl, 80% inhibition of binding at 100 mm NaCl. However this did not affect the background fluorescence observed in nondifferentiated cells (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Sodium chlorate and sodium chloride inhibit the binding of IIA PLA2 to PMA-activated THP-1 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2033665221,"An inverse correlation between the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 and the anti-atherogenic adipokine adiponectin has been reported in the chronic pathological conditions obesity, insulin resistance, coronary artery disease, and metabolic syndrome. We investigated whether this relationship is coincidental or has a causal basis. Here we show that interleukin-18 (IL-18) suppresses adiponectin transcription, mRNA expression, and secretion by 3T3-L1 adipocytes. IL-18 suppresses adiponectin promoter-reporter activity, an effect reversed by deletion or mutation of the NFATc4 core DNA-binding site. IL-18 induces NFATc4 phosphorylation (Ser676), nuclear translocation, and in vivo DNA binding. IL-18 induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation and enzyme activity, and pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126, ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, or small interference RNA targeted to ERK1/2 attenuates ERK1/2 activation and NFATc4 phosphorylation. Finally, inhibition of ERK1/2 or NFATc4 knockdown reverses IL-18-mediated adiponectin suppression. In contrast to its inhibitory effects on adiponectin expression, IL-18 potently stimulates PAI-1 secretion. These data demonstrate for the first time that IL-18 selectively suppresses adiponectin expression via ERK1/2-dependent NFATc4 activation and suggest that the inverse relationship observed between IL-18 and adiponectin in various chronic pathological conditions is causally related. Thus, targeting IL-18 expression may enhance adiponectin expression and mitigate disease progression. An inverse correlation between the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 and the anti-atherogenic adipokine adiponectin has been reported in the chronic pathological conditions obesity, insulin resistance, coronary artery disease, and metabolic syndrome. We investigated whether this relationship is coincidental or has a causal basis. Here we show that interleukin-18 (IL-18) suppresses adiponectin transcription, mRNA expression, and secretion by 3T3-L1 adipocytes. IL-18 suppresses adiponectin promoter-reporter activity, an effect reversed by deletion or mutation of the NFATc4 core DNA-binding site. IL-18 induces NFATc4 phosphorylation (Ser676), nuclear translocation, and in vivo DNA binding. IL-18 induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation and enzyme activity, and pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126, ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, or small interference RNA targeted to ERK1/2 attenuates ERK1/2 activation and NFATc4 phosphorylation. Finally, inhibition of ERK1/2 or NFATc4 knockdown reverses IL-18-mediated adiponectin suppression. In contrast to its inhibitory effects on adiponectin expression, IL-18 potently stimulates PAI-1 secretion. These data demonstrate for the first time that IL-18 selectively suppresses adiponectin expression via ERK1/2-dependent NFATc4 activation and suggest that the inverse relationship observed between IL-18 and adiponectin in various chronic pathological conditions is causally related. Thus, targeting IL-18 expression may enhance adiponectin expression and mitigate disease progression. Adiponectin is an anti-inflammatory cytokine secreted primarily by adipocytes (1Maeda K. Okubo K.

A wide variety of cells express adiponectin receptors, including vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and tissue macrophages. Thus, the cells that are known to play key roles in the pathobiology of vascular disease are all targets of adiponectin. Adiponectin inhibits endothelial cell activation by suppressing cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule expression, and can inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation (8Tan K.C. Xu A. Chow W.S.

Here we demonstrate for the first time that IL-18 suppresses adiponectin expression by adipocytes via a pathway featuring ERK1/2-dependent NFATc4 phosphorylation and activation. These data suggest that the relationship between IL-18 and adiponectin plasma levels has a direct causal component, and that targeting IL-18 is a potentially effective strategy for enhancing adiponectin expression and attenuating disease progression.

Antibodies to total (#9102) and phospho ERK1/2 (#9101S) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). MEK Inhibitor U0126 (Promega), ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059; 10 μm in Me2SO for 1 h) and Me2SO were from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Insulin, IBMX, dexamethasone, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture–3T3-L1 preadipocytes (#CL-173) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose and supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 mm minimal essential medium sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal calf serum. All tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. When confluent (day 0), cells were differentiated into adipocytes by supplementing the medium with 5 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). After 48 h, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin. Forty-eight hours later, medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Five days later, the fully differentiated adipocytes were used in the experiments. In addition to pharmacological inhibitors, ERK1/2 expression was targeted by ERK1 and ERK2 siRNA duplexes. Treatment with pharmacological inhibitors, transfections, knockdown, or adenoviral infection did not affect cell viability (trypan blue dye exclusion). IL-18 Receptor Expression-RT-PCR and Flow Cytometry–IL-18 receptor expression was analyzed by RT-PCR using DNA-free total RNA isolated from adipocytes and receptor-specific primers: IL-18Rα (GenBank™ accession NM_008365, 195 nt): sense, 5′-GTG CAC AGG AAT GAA ACA GC-3′ (bases 519-537) and antisense, 5′-ATT TAA GGT CCA ATT GCG ACG A-3′ (bases 692-713); IL-18Rβ (GenBank™ NM_010553, 241 nt): sense, 5′-GGA GTG GGA AAT GTC AGT AT-3′ (bases 1321-1340), and antisense, 5′-CCG TGC CGA GAA GGA TGT AT-3′ (bases 1561-1535). Surface expression of IL-18Rα and -β were measured by flow cytometry. In brief, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were gently trypsinized, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing antibodies to IL-18Rα, IL-18Rβ, or normal goat IgG at 1:100 dilution for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 °C with donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:100). The cell suspension was then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

PAI-1 levels in culture supernatants were quantified by ELISA (Mouse PAI-1 ELISA kit, Molecular Innovations, Inc., Southfield, MI). Specificity of IL-18 was verified by treating cells with neutralizing IL-18 antibodies or IL-18BP/Fc chimera (10 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to IL-18 treatment. Normal rat IgG1 and Fc served as controls. Adiponectin Expression–Adiponectin mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR. DNA-free total RNA was prepared using the RNAqueous®-4PCR kit (Ambion). RNA quality was assessed by capillary electrophoresis using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). All RNA samples used for quantitative PCR had RNA integrity numbers of >9.1 (scale = 1-10), as assigned by default parameters of the Expert 2100 Bioanalyzer software package (v2.02).

Non-targeting siRNA (5′-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG Utt-3′; no. 1022076, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) served as a negative control. Cells were transfected with 100 nm (GKLF, C/EBPβ, NFATc2, or NFATc4) or 25 nm (ERK1 and ERK2) siRNA using Oligofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen). 48 h later, knockdown of corresponding proteins was confirmed by Western blotting using whole cell homogenates. Cell Death Detection ELISA–Adipocytes were treated with IL-18 at the indicated concentration for up to 3 days. Cells were harvested and analyzed for mono- and oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysates by ELISA (Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) (30Chandrasekar B.

Statistical Analysis–Results are expressed as means ± S.E. For statistical analysis we used ANOVA followed by an appropriate post hoc multiple comparison test (Tukey method). Each experiment was performed at least three times, and data were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. IL-18 Does Not Induce Cell Death in Adipocytes–Treatment with insulin, IBMX, and dexamethasone induces the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into fully differentiated adipocytes as characterized by the intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets (Fig. 1A, arrows). In all subsequent experiments, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes will be termed adipocytes. We investigated whether adipocytes express subunits α and β of the IL-18 receptor. RT-PCR of DNA-free total RNA and receptor-specific primers show that, under basal conditions, adipocytes express both the ligand-binding α and the signal-transducing β subunits of IL-18 receptor (Fig. 1B). Flow cytometry confirmed membrane expression of IL-18 receptors α and β (Fig. 1C). Because IL-18 can exert pro-apoptotic effects in some cell types, we next investigated whether IL-18 affects adipocyte survival. Adipocytes were treated with IL-18 at the indicated concentrations for 72 h. Cell death was analyzed by quantifying mono- and oligonucleosomal fragmented DNA in the cytoplasmic extracts. Even at the maximum concentration of 100 ng/ml, IL-18 had no detectable effect on adipocyte viability (Fig. 1D). However, esculetin, a known inducer of adipocyte apoptotic cell death (31Yang J.Y.

These results indicate that (i) adipocytes express the ligand binding α and the signal transducing β subunits of IL-18 receptor and (ii) IL-18 does not induce adipocyte death under the conditions used in our experiments (Fig. 1).

Many aspects of this process have been well described; at least 15 nuclearly encoded proteins have been identified that control the metabolism of COB mRNA. As depicted in Fig. 1, the initial COB precursor is transcribed from position –1566, with the A of the AUG codon of COB defined as +1, and contains both tRNAglu and COB mRNA (1Bonitz S.G. Homison G.

The best candidate for the mitochondrial nuclease that processes the COB precursor at –954/–955 is a mitochondrial membrane-bound protein, Pet127 (11Wiesenberger G. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2816-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is a member of a large protein family that is well conserved in fungi and protists but is not present in plants or mammals (12Wiesenberger G. Speer F. Haller G. Bonnefoy N. Schleiffer A.

These defects in processing only inhibit respiratory growth when the temperature is raised to 37 °C (11Wiesenberger G. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2816-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Pet127 could itself be the RNase that trims these 5′-ends, but the protein has no RNase signature sequences or domains. Alternatively, Pet127 could modulate the activity of one or more distinct catalytic proteins that have either exonucleolytic or endonucleolytic activity. In addition to its role in 5′-maturation of RNAs, Pet127 is implicated in the destruction of RNAs in the absence of 5′-protection. pet127 mutations were recovered as spontaneous suppressors of mutations in the 5′-UTR of COX3 (11Wiesenberger G. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2816-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and COB (14Chen W. Islas-Osuna M.A. Dieckmann C.L. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1315-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mRNA that make the mRNA unstable. COX3 precursor RNA is not trimmed at the 5′-end in a Pet127-dependent manner, so Pet127 only has a role in the turnover of COX3 mRNA, not in maturation. Genetic studies suggest that Cbp1 binds directly to a sequence within the AU-rich COB mRNA 5′-UTR that contains a unique CCG trinucleotide (15Chen W. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6203-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The proximity of the CCG trinucleotide (–944 to –942) to the 5′-end of the mature COB mRNA prompted the hypothesis that Cbp1 binding protects the mRNA from degradation by blocking a nuclease. Single-base changes in the CCG trinucleotide eliminate COB mRNA accumulation and reduce the level of precursor RNA 5-fold, a phenotype equivalent to that of cbp1 mutants, either conditionally (ACG and CCU mutations) or at all temperatures (CAG mutation). Similar to the Δcbp1 single mutant, the Δcbp1 Δpet127 strain has no mature COB mRNA, but, unlike the single mutant strain, it accumulates substantial levels of COB precursor RNA (10Islas-Osuna M.A. Ellis T.P. Marnell L.L. Mittelmeier T.M. Dieckmann C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37987-37990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cbp1 binding to the CCG-containing segment near the 5′-end of the mRNA may act as a roadblock to a Pet127-dependent 5′ → 3′-exonuclease (Fig. 1). Alternatively, Cbp1 binding may cover an endonuclease site that is required for Pet127-dependent mRNA turnover. In the present study we used tandem Cbp1 recognition sites to investigate whether the Pet127-dependent nuclease that trims the 5′-end of COB precursor RNA is an endo- or exonuclease. Our data strongly suggest that Pet127 stimulates trimming of the COB 5′-UTR in a 5′ → 3′-directed exonuclease reaction until it is obstructed by Cbp1. When the interaction between Cbp1 and COB mRNA is abolished by replacing the CCG trinucleotide element with ACG, COB mRNA is degraded from the 5′-end (15Chen W. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6203-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Absence of Pet127 leads to the almost complete disappearance of mature COB mRNA and to the enrichment of the precursor form, demonstrating the key role of Pet127 in mitochondrial mRNA maturation. Strains and Media–The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Yeast strains were grown in either YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or YEPG medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol). When selection was necessary, WO medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids or ammonium sulfate), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose) was used and amino acid supplements were added to suggested final concentrations (16Adams A.

The templates for CCG and ACG PCR products were mitochondrial DNA samples from the single-site CCG and ACG strains, respectively. The fragments were digested with EcoRI and BsaHI, ligated together, and then ligated into the EcoRI site of p707H at the –1096/–707 deletion junction. p707H was made from p707A (5Mittelmeier T.M.

Selection of Leu+ nuclear transformants (YEp351) and screening for mitochondrial transformants were accomplished as previously described (5Mittelmeier T.M. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4203-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The transformants, which are termed mpACG-ACG, mpACG-CCG, mpCCG-ACG, and mpCCG-CCG, are synthetic rho-strains. To recombine the mutations in the mpCOB plasmids onto the grande mitochondrial genome, the transformants were crossed to the karyogamy-deficient strain JC3/M9410, which also has a deletion from –971 to –64 in the COB gene. The recombinant cytoductants were identified by the formation of respiration-competent diploids when mated to tester strain MY7/mp232L+53R, which carries a plasmid with mitochondrial sequence from –232 to +53 of the COB gene. The presence of the tandem constructions in the mitochondrial genome (Fig. 2) was verified by PCR amplification and sequencing. Generation of Δpet127 Strains–The pet127::KanMX4 fragment was amplified by PCR from the BY4741 Δpet127 strain (EUROSCARF, Frankfurt, Germany) with primers Pet127 5′-UTR and Pet127 3′-UTR and ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). This construct was digested with NotI, and the fragment was transformed into the yeast mitochondrial mutant strains. The transformants were selected on YEPD + Geneticin plates, and the disruptions were verified by PCR. Growth of Strains on Glycerol Plates–The strains were cultured in liquid YEPD medium at 30 °C to logarithmic phase. Cells were counted in a hemacytometer and serially diluted with distilled water to concentrations of 104, 103, 102, and 10 cells/6 μl. 6-μl drops of the serial dilutions were spotted onto glycerol plates and incubated at 30 °C for 4 days. The plates were photographed at days 2 and 4 of incubation. Primer Extension Analysis of mRNA 5′-Ends–Primers COB6B and cox4242 were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP as recommended by the supplier of the enzyme (Fermentas), and primer extensions were done as previously described (15Chen W. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6203-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from yeast strains after they grew to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.4 to 0.5 (18Caponigro G. Muhlrad D. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5141-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). 8 μg of total cellular RNA and 10 pmol 5′-end-labeled primers were mixed and brought to a final volume of 10 μl in annealing buffer (200 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at 42 °C). The mixture was heated at 85 °C for 5 min and then annealed at 45 °C for 90 min. 15 μl of reaction mix (1 mm dGTP, 1 mm dCTP, 3 mm dATP, 3 mm dTTP, 2× reaction buffer, 7 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase; the reaction buffer and enzyme were supplied by Promega) was added to the annealed primer-RNA mixture, the reaction mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 45 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 12 μl of stop mix (95% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol). 8 μl of each reaction mixture was loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide-7 m urea sequencing gel. Tandem Cbp1 Recognition Sites Are Functional–To determine whether the maturation of the 5′-end of COB mRNA requires endo- or exonuclease cleavage, microprojectile bombardment was used to construct a strain with CCG-containing wild-type Cbp1 recognition sites in tandem in the mitochondrial COB gene (Fig. 2). If an endonuclease is operative in the maturation of the 5′-end of COB mRNA, then at steady state the majority of the mRNA in the CCG-CCG strain will have 5′-ends that map to the downstream site. If an exonuclease is operative, we expect that only the upstream site of the CCG-CCG strain will be used for the maturation of COB mRNA (Fig. 3). To determine whether the CCG element could function upstream or downstream of inserted sequences, strains were constructed in which the wild-type CCG element was arranged in tandem with the mutant ACG element (Fig. 2). If the CCG recognition site is operative in both the upstream and downstream position of the tandem arrangement, both ACG-CCG and CCG-ACG strains will be respiratory-competent. If either tandem arrangement disallows use of the CCG site, COB mRNA will be unstable and the strains will not respire. To compare the respiratory phenotype of the ACG-CCG and CCG-ACG strains with that of the wild-type CCG and CCG-CCG strains, the strains were grown overnight in rich glucose liquid medium (YEPD), serially diluted, and spotted on both rich glucose (YEPD) and glycerol plates (YEPG) and incubated at 30 °C (Fig. 4). Growth on medium containing non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol is a simple and sensitive method for measuring respiratory capability. Both the CCG-CCG and CCG-ACG strains grew very similarly to the wild-type CCG strain on YEPG, and they grew slightly better than the ACG-CCG strain. The ability of the ACG-CCG and CCG-ACG strains to grow on glycerol demonstrates that these strains have sufficient COB mRNA to support respiration. This observation verifies that the CCG site is active in tandem, although the strain with the upstream CCG site grows slightly better on glycerol than the strain with the downstream site. As expected, the ACG and ACG-ACG strains did not grow on glycerol at 30 °C after 4 days, although spontaneous revertants arose in both samples as observed previously for the ACG strain (15Chen W. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6203-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). COB Pre-mRNA 5′-UTR is Processed by an Exonuclease in a Pet127-dependent Manner–The 5′-end of COB mRNA was mapped by primer extension analysis in strains containing various combinations of 64-nucleotide elements containing either the active CCG or the mutant ACG trinucleotide. When strains were grown on the rich fermentable medium YEPD, there was no detectable precursor or mature COB mRNA in the ACG, ACG-ACG, and ACG-CCG strains (Fig. 5A). Because the ACG-CCG strain is respiratory-competent, it is unlikely that it has no COB mRNA but rather that the concentration is below the level of detection by this assay. To analyze mRNA abundance and 5′-ends of the respiratory-competent strains, total RNA was isolated from the CCG, CCG-ACG, ACG-CCG, and CCG-CCG strains grown in rich non-fermentable YEPG medium. Both precursor and mature COB mRNAs were detected in all respiratory-competent strains, although total COB RNA abundance was lower in the ACG-CCG strain. The reason for reduced levels in this strain is not known, but the interpretation of 5′-end position is not affected by the reduction. The 5′-ends of both the mature and precursor COB mRNA in the CCG-CCG strain were identical to those in the CCG-ACG strain (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that only the upstream site defines the position of the 5′-ends of the mRNA. To verify whether the position of the 5′-end is truly defined by the most 5′-CCG element, the position of the 5′-end of COB mRNA in the ACG-CCG strain was determined. As we expected, in the ACG-CCG strain the 5′-end of the precursor COB mRNA was identical to those in the CCG-CCG and CCG-ACG strains, whereas that of the mature COB mRNA was identical to that in the CCG strain, indicating that the position of the 5′-end is indeed determined by the 5′-most CCG. These data support the hypothesis that the maturation of COB pre-mRNA is due to the action of an exonuclease that degrades the COB mRNA in the 5′-to3′-direction until it is blocked by Cbp1. To address the role of Pet127 in the maturation of mitochondrial COB mRNA, the nuclear gene PET127 was deleted in all six strains with single and tandem 64-nucleotide elements in the 5′-UTR of the COB gene and the 5′-ends of COB mRNAs were determined by primer extension analysis (Fig. 5C). In all Δpet127 strains, although the total amount of precursor and mature COB mRNAs did not change much, the precursor/mature ratio was inverted relative to the corresponding PET127 strains; there was a dramatic increase in precursor RNA and a reciprocal decrease in mature mRNA. This demonstrates that 5′-processing of COB precursor mRNA by an exonuclease largely depends on the presence of Pet127. As noted previously (13Ellis T.P. Schonauer M.S. Dieckmann C.L. Genetics. 2005; 171: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the small amount of mature mRNA in Δpet127 strains has 5′-ends that are one or two nucleotides shorter than in wild type (Fig. 5C, asterisks). Either an alternative nuclease or modified activity of the Pet127-directed nuclease must be weakly operative in the absence of Pet127. The view that gene expression is controlled mainly at the level of transcription has been challenged by many findings over the last decade. Processing, modification, transport, and turnover as well as translation of mRNAs are subject to elaborate control. Among the processes that can be regulated, degradation of mRNA is of particular importance. We are beginning to gain a better understanding of mRNA degradation and its complex regulation in eukaryotic cells. Several excellent articles and reviews have been recently published describing pathways of mRNA decay and the factors and enzymes that are important in this process (19Garneau N.L. Wilusz J. Wilusz C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 20Gagliardi D. Stepien P.P. Temperley R.J. Lightowlers R.N. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Parker R. Sheth U. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The two exonucleolytic mRNA decay pathways that have been described in the eukaryotic cytosol are the 5′ → 3′-Xrn1 pathway and the exosome-mediated 3′ → 5′-pathway. The relative contribution of each mechanism to overall mRNA turnover remains a subject of debate. In the 5′ → 3′-pathway, the first step is the removal of the mRNA 5′-cap structure, followed by 5′ → 3′-directed degradation of the mRNA body by the Xrn1 exoribonuclease. Xrn1 is a member of the 5PX exoribonuclease family along with another protein Rat1 (22Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). These two proteins are homologs and functionally interchangeable, but Rat1 is localized to the nucleus and is required for nuclear 5′ → 3′-directed decay (23Heyer W.D. Johnson A.W. Reinhart U. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2728-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Poole T.L. Stevens A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Series. 1995; 33: 79-81PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, degradation of mRNA can follow several pathways, but these are very different from those in eukaryotic cells and they are mediated by the combined action of endo- and exoribonucleases. In prokaryotes, degradation of mRNA often exhibits a net 5′ → 3′-directionality. Most bacterial transcripts are degraded in a pathway initiated by RNase E. RNase E is a 5′-end-dependent endonuclease (25Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), the major component of the degradosome. In addition to RNase E, the bacterial degradosome includes the degradative PNPase and the RNA unwinding DEAD box RNA helicase B, RhlB. The complex also contains enolase as an integral component, which has an unknown function in the degradation process (26Miczak A. Kaberdin V.R. Wei C.L. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3865-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 27Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). RNase E-dependent degradation begins with an endonucleolytic cleavage, often near the 5′-end of the mRNA, followed by successive endonucleolytic cleavages along the body of the mRNA. Each fragment is then degraded by the action of PNPase and other exonucleases in the 3′ → 5′-direction (28Carpousis A.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In addition to the RNase E-dependent pathway, a 5′ → 3′-exonuclease was identified recently (29Mathy N. Benard L. Pellegrini O. Daou R. Wen T. Condon C. Cell. 2007; 129: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). How is mRNA turnover regulated in mitochondria? Despite the monophyletic, α-proteobacterial origin of mitochondria and the conservation of most of their biological roles, recent data have revealed that mitochondrial genome organization and gene expression are extraordinarily divergent among eukaryotes (30Burger G. Gray M.W. Lang B.F. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 709-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Similarly, the regulation of mitochondrial mRNA turnover in diverse species is surprisingly different (20Gagliardi D. Stepien P.P. Temperley R.J. Lightowlers R.N. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). One enzymatic activity that affects turnover in all systems is 3′ → 5′-exoribonuclease activity. The mitochondrial degradosome (mtEXO) is the main 3′ → 5′-exoribonuclease in yeast mitochondria. The degradosome is composed of two large subunits: an RNase and an RNA helicase encoded by nuclear genes DSS1 and SUV3, respectively (31Dziembowski A. Piwowarski J. Hoser R. Minczuk M. Dmochowska A. Siep M. van der S.H. Grivell L. Stepien P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1603-1611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Lack of Suv3 or Dss1 causes an increase in excised intron stability, a resulting inhibition of splicing, strong inhibition of mitochondrial translation, respiratory incompetence, and finally, loss of mitochondrial genomes (32Margossian S.P. Li H. Zassenhaus H.P. Butow R.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 199-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition to the effect on turnover, suv3 or dss1 mutations affect 5′- and 3′-processing of mitochondrial RNAs (33Dziembowski A. Stepien P.P. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This suggests that turnover and processing of mitochondrial transcripts may be linked. To date, there is only one protein that is known to be involved ina5′-end-dependent degradation pathway in mitochondria, Pet127. Nuclear mutations in PET127 suppress mutations and deletions in the 5′-UTR of COX3 mRNA (11Wiesenberger G. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2816-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as well as in COB mRNA (14Chen W. Islas-Osuna M.A. Dieckmann C.L. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1315-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that make the mRNA unstable. Pet127 is necessary for the efficient 5′-end processing of several precursor transcripts in a 5′-end-dependent manner, including COB mRNA (11Wiesenberger G. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2816-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Ellis T.P. Schonauer M.S. Dieckmann C.L. Genetics. 2005; 171: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The 5′-ends trimmed in a Pet127-dependent manner have no similar common sequence or structure. Our model for the turnover of COB pre-mRNA is that the 5′-UTR of COB mRNA is trimmed in a Pet127-dependent manner until it is obstructed by Cbp1, a protein that exclusively stabilizes COB mRNA. When the interaction between the mRNA and Cbp1 is attenuated (e.g. by mutation in the mRNA or in the protein), the mRNA continues to be degraded in the 5′ → 3′-direction. Our results clearly support the hypothesis that the maturation and decay of COB pre-mRNA are due to the action of a 5′ → 3′-exonuclease. Although this type of mechanism is similar to the mechanism of mRNA decay observed in the cytosol and nucleus of eukaryotic cells, it is the first 5′ → 3′-exonucleolytic activity observed to date in mitochondria. Knocking out components of either the 3′ → 5′ or the 5′ → 3′-cytosolic degradation pathway in yeast has minimal effect on the transcriptome, which implies redundancy (34He F. Li X. Spatrick P. Casillo R. Dong S. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1439-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 35Houalla R. Devaux F. Fatica A. Kufel J. Barrass D. Torchet C. Tollervey D. Yeast. 2006; 23: 439-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the deletion of either Suv3 or Dss1 can be suppressed by overexpression of Pet127 (36Wegierski T. Dmochowska A. Jablonowska A. Dziembowski A. Bartnik E. Stepien P.P. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1998; 45: 935-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that mRNA degradation in the mitochondrial compartment of yeast also proceeds by redundant pathways. Although proteins homologous to Pet127 are very well conserved within lower eukaryotes, no orthologous proteins are detectable in higher eukaryotes. This raises the possibility that the mechanisms responsible for mitochondrial mRNA turnover in yeast differ from those of higher eukaryotes.

Myosin-1B localizes to actin-rich structures at the leading edge of migrating cells where it has been implicated in the formation and retraction of membrane projections, the recycling of plasma membrane components, and intracellular particle transport. Here, we have used a combination of molecular engineering approaches to describe the kinetic and motile properties of the myosin-1B motor and its regulation by TEDS site phosphorylation. Our results show that myosin-1B is a low duty ratio motor and displays the fastest nucleotide binding kinetics of any of the Dictyostelium class-1 myosins studied so far. Different from Dictyostelium myosin-1D and myosin-1E, dephosphorylated myosin-1B is not inactivated but moves actin filaments efficiently, albeit at an up to 8-fold slower velocity in the in vitro motility assay. A further difference is that myosin-1B lacks the ability to switch between rapid movement and bearing tension upon physiological changes of free Mg2+ ions. In this respect, its motor properties appear to be more closely related to Dictyostelium myosin-2 and rabbit skeletal muscle myosin.

In this respect, its motor properties appear to be more closely related to Dictyostelium myosin-2 and rabbit skeletal muscle myosin. The monomeric, non-filamentous class-1 myosins are among the most prevalent and most widely expressed myosins. The conserved N-terminal motor domain of class-1 myosins, which contains the ATP- and actin-binding sites, is followed by 1–6 light chain binding IQ motifs and more diverse C-terminal tail regions. Because of their diversity, the class-1 myosins can be further divided into at least four subclasses (1Gillespie P.G. Albanesi J.P. Bähler M. Bement W.M. Berg J.S. Burgess D.R. Burnside B.

The eukaryotic model system Dictyostelium discoideum has been used extensively to study the cellular functions of class-1 myosins (2Jung G. Wu X. Hammer J.A. II I J.

Cytoskeleton. 1996; 33: 64-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Seven class-1 myosins, Myosin-1A-F and Myosin-1K, are produced in D. discoideum. Myosin-1K completely lacks a tail region and has a large insert in the motor domain (7Schwarz E.C. Geissler H. Soldati T. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 413-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Yazu M. Adachi H. Sutoh K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The myoA, myoE, and myoF gene products encode subfamily members with “short” tails that consist solely of a tail homology 1 (TH1) domain that interacts with anionic phospholipids and thereby binds to membranes. The myoB, myoC, and myoD gene products have “longer” tails that consist of a TH1 domain, a TH2 domain that is typically rich in the amino acids glycine, proline, alanine, or glutamine(GPA/Q) and binds actin in a ATP-insensitive manner, and an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which is known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Myosin-1 SH3 domains are usually referred to as TH3, to distinguish them from SH3-like domains found at the N terminus of other myosins.Distinct, yet overlapping, roles for the D. discoideum class-1 myosins in actin-based cellular processes like endocytosis and cell movement were revealed by the defects of knock-out cells lacking single or multiple myosin-1 genes and cellular localization studies (9Jung G.

Its interaction with the adapter protein CARMIL appears to play a crucial role in recruiting components of the Arp 2/3 actin polymerization machinery to the plasma membrane (18Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer J.A. II I J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Detailed characterization of myosin-1B null cells has shown that the protein plays a role in cellular translocation, the suppression of lateral pseudopod formation, and rapid intracellular particle motility (19Wessels D. Murray J. Jung G. Hammer J.A. II I Soll D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A unique feature of myosin-1B is that its neck region is decorated by a compact, single-domain protein with two EF-hand motifs that has a molecular mass of 8 kDa and binds Ca2+ with submicromolar affinity. The myosin-1B light chain is thus >2-fold smaller than most of the common four-EF-hand myosin light chains (20Crawley S.W. de la Roche M.A. Lee S.F. Li Z. Chitayat S. Smith S.P. Cote G.P. J. Biol.

To facilitate the characterization of myosin-1B motor properties, the motor domain fragment was fused to an artificial lever arm consisting of two α-actinin repeats (21Anson M. Geeves M.A. Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Kliche W. Fujita-Becker S. Kollmar M. Manstein D.J. Kull F.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A motor domain construct without lever arm was used to determine steady-state and transient kinetic parameters. The terminology used (B698, B698-2R) refers to the site of motor domain truncation and 2R serves as abbreviation for the attachment of two α-actinin repeats to the motor domain. Titus and coworkers (23Novak K.D. Titus M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have shown that regulation by TEDS site phosphorylation does not play a role in the localization of myosin-1B but is absolutely required for in vivo function. Following stimulation of a cell with chemoattractant, TEDS site phosphorylation-induced increases in myosin-1B motor activity were found to contribute to the global extension of pseudopodia that occurs prior to polarization and directed motility (24Gliksman N.R. Santoyo G. Novak K.D. Titus M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5235-5239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To study the effects of TEDS site phosphorylation on the motor properties of the protein, we generated the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of B698-2R by treatment with λ-phosphatase and Acanthamoeba castellanii myosin-I heavy chain kinase (25Brzeska H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16983-16986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Additionally, we generated mutant versions of B698-2R, which facilitated the combined characterization of motor and kinetic properties. The serine at the TEDS site of these constructs was replaced by either an alanine residue, to mimic the unphosphorylated state, or a glutamate residue, to mimic the phosphorylated state (15Dürrwang U.

In these schemes a notation is used that distinguishes between the constants in the presence and absence of actin by using bold (k–1, K1) versus italic type (k–1, K1); subscript A and D refer to actin (KA) and ADP (KD), respectively. The transient kinetics data were interpreted as described previously (28Fujita-Becker S. Dürrwang U. Erent M. Clark R.J. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. J. Biol.

NADH oxidation was followed using the change in absorption at 340 nm in a Beckman DU-800 spectrophotometer.SCHEME 2Coupling between nucleotide and actin binding sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSActin Activation of Myosin-1B ATPase Activity–To determine the maximum values of the ATPase activity and the efficiency of coupling between actin and nucleotide binding, we measured the ATPase rates with actin concentrations in the range of 0 to 60 μm F-actin (Fig. 1). At concentrations of actin much lower than Kapp, the dependence of the apparent ATPase rate on actin concentration can be fitted to a straight line and the apparent second order rate constant (kcat/Kapp) of the reaction can be determined from the slope of this line. Estimates of Kapp and kcat were obtained from double reciprocal plots (Table 1), but as the maximum actin concentrations accessible are below the estimated value of Kapp the values must be treated with some caution. Myosin-1B resembles in this respect Dictyostelium myosin-2 and myosin-1D, whereas chicken myosin-5a displays a much higher affinity for F-actin in the presence of ATP. The steady-state parameters are summarized in Table 1, together with the published values for Dictyostelium myosin-1D, myosin-1E, and myosin 2. The ATPase activity of the S332A mutant of B698 is only slightly activated by the addition of 20 μm F-actin. The ATPase activity of the S332E mutant showed a hyperbolic dependence on actin concentration. Additionally, the coupling efficiency between actin and nucleotide binding is 16-fold tighter for the B698 Ser-to-Glu mutant than for the Ser-to-Ala mutant. A similar 20-fold change in kcat/Kapp was observed for the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of Acanthamoeba myosin-1C (45Ostap E.M. Lin T. Rosenfeld S.S. Tang N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12450-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas the observed changes in kcat/Kapp are larger for Dictyostelium myosin-1D and myosin-1E with 77- and 170-fold increases for the phosphorylated forms.FIGURE 1Actin-activated ATPase activity. Shown are the ATP turnover rates of B698(S332E) (▪) and B698(S332A) (□) at increasing concentrations of F-actin.

Open table in a new tab Binding of Nucleotide to Myosin-1B–The rate constants measured for nucleotide binding to the wild-type forms of B698 and both TEDS site mutants were identical. Therefore, the data shown in Table 2 refer only to B698, although all measurements were performed with wild-type and both mutant constructs. The rate of ATP binding (K1k+2) could be monitored from the increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence following the addition of excess ATP. The increase in fluorescence for ATP binding is 4% for myosin-1B. In contrast, the increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence following the addition of excess ADP was too small to measure the rate of ADP binding (k–6/K7) reliably. Myosin-1B has seven Trp residues in the motor domain, including the conserved Trp in the relay loop that reports the open to closed transition of switch-2 that accompanies ATP hydrolysis (46Batra R. Manstein D.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As most of them do not contribute to the signal change, this explains the small amplitude of the fluorescence change. As an alternative, the binding of the nucleotide analogues mantATP and mantADP was measured following the fluorescence enhancement after mixing with the myosin constructs. The results of these measurements were analyzed as described previously (32Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 47Woodward S.K. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16056-16064Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and are summarized in Table 2. The apparent second order association rate constants (K1k+2 or k–6/K7) are similar for ATP and the mantADP and ATP analogues. The intrinsic fluorescence amplitude was too small to allow the maximum to be estimated, but kobs displayed a linear dependence on ATP concentration up to observed rates of 100 s–1. For most myosins the maximum rate constant has been attributed to the rate constant for the ATP hydrolysis step (k+3 + k–3), which is signaled by the fluorescence change of the Trp located at the tip of the relay loop (47Woodward S.K. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16056-16064Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These values are very high compared with most myosins and are comparable with those of myosin-5 (48De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). As ATP binding to B698 produced a larger fluorescence increase than the binding of ADP, the displacement of ADP by ATP could be followed from the net increase in fluorescence upon addition of a large excess of ATP to ADP-saturated B698. The rate of ADP release (k+6) from B698 was 0.70 s–1.TABLE 2Rate and equilibrium constants of the myosin and actomyosin ATPase cycleNucleotideRate constantB698D692aRef. 28.E698bRef. 15.M765cRef. 36.Nucleotide binding to MATPK1k+2 (μm-1 s-1)1.97 ± 0.010.66 ± 0.010.96 ± 0.030.70 ± 0.03kmax (s-1)>1000640 ± 10900 ± 3028 ± 4MantATPK1k+2 (μm-1 s-1)1.30 ± 0.020.53 ± 0.020.91 ± 0.010.81 ± 0.02ADPk-6/K7 (μm-1 s-1)n.a.0.98 ± 0.020.34 ± 0.02n.a.k+6 (s-1)0.70 ± 0.0030.60 ± 0.0023.13 ± 0.03n.a.KD (μm)0.40 ± 0.101.8 ± 0.37.1 ± 0.47.0 ± 1MantADPk-6/K7 (μm-1 s-1)1.48 ± 0.010.87 ± 0.010.79 ± 0.010.36 ± 0.004Nucleotide binding to A·MATPK1k+2 (μm-1 s-1)1.11 ± 0.030.49 ± 0.010.40 ± 0.0020.57 ± 0.04k+2 (s-1)>700 ± 100960 ± 20750 ± 20490 ± 20ADPk+AD (μm-1 s-1)dCalculated from k+AD = k-AD/KAD.4.95 ± 0.5ND2.5 ± 0.5>0.5k-AD (s-1)233 ± 20ND28 ± 4>100KAD (μm)eValues refer to the Ser-to-Glu mutants of the myosin-1 motor domain constructs.47 ± 575 ± 412 ± 2182 ± 28KAD/KDeValues refer to the Ser-to-Glu mutants of the myosin-1 motor domain constructs.118 ± 2042 ± 81.7 ± 0.526 ± 3KAD (μm)fValues refer to the Ser-to-Ala mutants.118 ± 30140 ± 10NDn.a.KAD/KDfValues refer to the Ser-to-Ala mutants.295 ± 3078 ± 14NDn.a.a Ref. 28Fujita-Becker S.

Open table in a new tab TEDS Site Phosphorylation of Myosin-1B Stabilizes the Actomyosin Complex–The rate of actin binding was measured following the exponential decrease in pyrene fluorescence observed on binding of an excess of pyrene-actin to the myosin-1B constructs. The observed rate constants were plotted against pyrene-actin concentration, and kobs values were linearly dependent upon actin concentration over the range studied. The second order rate constants of pyrene-actin binding (k+A) were obtained from the slope of the plot, and the resulting values are summarized in Table 2. The k+A values were unaffected by the TEDS site mutations S332A and S332E. In addition, the rate constant for actin dissociation (k–A) was determined directly by chasing pyrene-actin with a 20-fold excess of unlabeled actin (Fig. 2). The observed process could be fit to a single exponential where kobs corresponds directly to k–A. In contrast to similar rates of actin binding, actin dissociates 12 times faster from the Ser–to-Ala mutant than from the Ser-to-Glu mutant (Fig. 2, inset). The dissociation equilibrium constant (KA) for actin binding is calculated from the ratio of k–A and k+A. The slower dissociation rate of the actomyosin complex results in a 12-fold higher actin affinity for the pseudo-phosphorylated S332E mutant.FIGURE 2Rates of pyrene-actin dissociation from B698(S332E) and B698(S332A) (inset). The dissociation rate constant of actin (k–A) was determined from the rate of fluorescence enhancement that follows the addition of an excess of unlabeled F-actin to a sample of pyrene-labeled F-actin equilibrated with an equimolar amount of the myosin-1B constructs. B698(S332A) displays a 34-fold faster actin dissociation reaction than the B698(S332E) mutant. The concentrations shown in the mixing scheme refer to the concentrations of the reactants after mixing in the stopped-flow observation cell. The observed changes in fluorescence intensity are best fit by double exponentials.

https://openalex.org/W2042774709,"R67 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate using NADPH as a cofactor. This enzyme is a homotetramer possessing 222 symmetry, and a single active site pore traverses the length of the protein. A promiscuous binding surface can accommodate either DHF or NADPH, thus two nonproductive complexes can form (2NADPH or 2DHF) as well as a productive complex (NADPH·DHF). The role of water in binding was monitored using a number of different osmolytes. From isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies, binding of NADPH is accompanied by the net release of 38 water molecules. In contrast, from both steady state kinetics and ITC studies, binding of DHF is accompanied by the net uptake of water. Although different osmolytes have similar effects on NADPH binding, variable results are observed when DHF binding is probed. Sensitivity to water activity can also be probed by an in vivo selection using the antibacterial drug, trimethoprim, where the water content of the media is decreased by increasing concentrations of sorbitol. The ability of wild type and mutant clones of R67 DHFR to allow host Escherichia coli to grow in the presence of trimethoprim plus added sorbitol parallels the catalytic efficiency of the DHFR clones, indicating water content strongly correlates with the in vivo function of R67 DHFR.

The gene for this enzyme is carried by an R-plasmid, and its presence confers resistance to the antibiotic drug, trimethoprim (TMP). Trimethoprim is a competitive inhibitor of chromosomal DHFR with a picomolar Ki (1Stone S.R. Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although R67 DHFR is not a good catalyst, it is not inhibited by TMP very well, and thus it allows cell growth in the presence of this antibacterial drug (2Amyes S.G. Smith J.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 61: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Taylor I. Slowiaczek P. Francis P. Tattersall M. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 5159-5164PubMed Google Scholar). R67 DHFR shares no homology in sequence or structure with chromosomal DHFR and has been proposed to be a good model of a primitive enzyme (4Howell E.E. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).R67 DHFR is a homotetramer with a single active site pore; the overall structure possesses 222 symmetry as seen in Fig. 1 (5Narayana N. Matthews D.A. Howell E.E. Nguyen-Huu X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The symmetry of the active site results in overlapping binding sites for substrate, DHF, and cofactor, NADPH. This can be observed as R67 DHFR binds a total of two ligands as follows: either two NADPH molecules or two folate/DHF molecules or one NADPH plus one folate/DHF molecule (6Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The first two complexes are dead-end (binary) complexes, whereas the third is the productive ternary complex. Because of the 222 symmetry, binding to either ligand is unlikely to be optimal.The active site pore of R67 DHFR is unusual in its hourglass shape as well as its large size (2938 Å3 for apoR67 DHFR with hydrogens added, calculated by CASTp (4Howell E.E. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Dundas J. Ouyang Z. Tseng J. Binkowski A. Turpaz Y. Liang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W116-W118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar)). Because of this large volume, DHF and NADPH cannot occupy all the space in the pore and must use water to mediate some contacts with the protein.How do substrate and cofactor bind to R67 DHFR? From NMR, crystallography, and docking studies, the pteridine ring of DHF/folate binds at the center of the pore, but the para-aminobenzoylglutamate tail of dihydrofolate/folate is disordered (5Narayana N. Matthews D.A. Howell E.E. Nguyen-Huu X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Krahn J. Jackson M. DeRose E.F. Howell E.E. London R.E.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4242-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interactions have been predicted between symmetry-related Lys-32 residues (at either edge of the pore) and the glutamate tail of substrate. Also, increasing concentrations of sucrose or trehalose (10Chopra S. Lynch R. Kim S.H. Jackson M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6596-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) increase Km (DHF) as well as Kd (DHF). As polyols can have a variety of effects, including perturbation of solvent structure, a possibility is that these compounds affect the water structure and, in turn, DHF binding.If water is involved in an interaction, perturbation of water content should affect binding. Thus we probed the role of water in DHF/folate binding to R67 DHFR, using osmolytes with different properties to determine whether the primary effect was because of water or some other variable.To provide a complete picture, the effects of osmolytes on the interaction of NADPH with R67 DHFR were also monitored.

Briefly, ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion-exchange column chromatography were used to purify the protein to homogeneity. Purified samples were dialyzed against distilled, deionized H2O and then lyophilized. Protein concentrations were determined with a biuret assay (18Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol.

MTA (MTA buffer: 100 mm Tris, 50 mm MES, 50 mm acetic acid polybuffer plus 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) polybuffer was used.

The steady state kinetic rates were measured at 30 °C by the addition of substrate and cofactor, followed by the addition of enzyme to initiate the reaction. To obtain kcat and Km values, the concentration of NADPH was held constant at a subsaturating level, whereas the concentration of DHF was varied. This process was repeated using four additional subsaturating concentrations of NADPH. The data were fit globally to the nonlinear bisubstrate Michaelis-Menten equation utilizing SAS (statistical analysis software (21Smiley R.D. Stinnett L.G. Saxton A.M. Howell E.E.

For those conditions where Km (NADPH) did not change, saturating concentrations of NADPH were used, and DHF concentrations varied to obtain kcat and Km (DHF) values.Water Activity Measurements–A Westcor 5500 vapor pressure osmometer was used to obtain the osmolality of the solutions. This value was converted into water activity using Equation 1,aH2O=e-0.018·osmolality(Eq. 1) where aH2O is the water activity (23Sweeney T.E. Beuchat C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: R469-R480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The binding of DHF to R67 DHFR·NADPH in a buffer containing neutral osmolytes (S) can be described by Equation 2, DHF+R67DHFR·NADPH⇄R67DHFR·NADPH·DHF+vH2OH2O+vSS(Eq. 2) where νH2O and νS are the stoichiometric coefficients of water and osmolyte, respectively. From Wyman (24Wyman Jr., J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 223-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar), it can be calculated that ln Ka (or ln kcat/Km (DHF)) is related to ln as according to the following: νH2O and νS, the stoichiometric coefficients of water and osmolyte, as shown in Equation 3,∂lnKa∂lnaH2O=vH2O+vS∂lnas∂lnaH2O(Eq. 3) Various groups have found that low molecular weight osmolytes are preferentially excluded from the surface of proteins (25Arakawa T.

This scenario can be tested by use of osmolytes from different classes, which differentially associate with proteins (and presumably ligands as well (25Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 26Timasheff S.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 67-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar)).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry–Affinities, stoichiometries, as well as ΔH values associated with binding were determined using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) as described previously (6Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed on a VP-ITC microcalorimeter from MicroCal interfaced to a Gateway personal computer for data acquisition and analysis. Origin version 5 scientific software was used to analyze the data. This instrument has been described previously (28Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). R67 DHFR concentrations typically ranged from 60 to 150 μm in MTA buffer (pH 7). For titrations with osmolyte present, MTA buffer plus osmolyte was used in the reference cell. The “c value” (=[Ptotal]/Kd) for binding was from 3 to 127, within the suggested range of 1–1000 (28Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar).The heat capacity (ΔCp) or the change in ΔH as a function of temperature is described by Equation 4, ΔCp=∂ΔH∂T(Eq. 4) Heat capacity changes were obtained for NADPH binding to R67 DHFR and also DHF binding to R67 DHFR·NADP+ using the temperature range 278–303 K.Escherichia coli Growth Conditions–The ability of the E. coli strain DH5α to grow on M9 minimal media (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Another layer of screening added increasing concentrations of sorbitol to the media. The water activity of the plates was measured using an Aqualab meter (Decagon Devices) and converted into osmolality using Equation 1.RESULTSRole of Water in kcat/Km(DHF)–To garner more information concerning how DHF is bound to R67 DHFR, the perturbation associated with addition of varying osmolytes was studied. This approach monitors any change in the number of water and/or solute molecules associated with two different states, free DHF and the enzyme·NADPH binary complex versus the enzyme·NADPH·DHF transition state structure (23Sweeney T.E.

However, alterations in solvent viscosity, solution dielectric constant, or volume exclusion could also affect binding upon osmolyte addition. To determine whether the previously observed effect of sucrose on DHF binding (10Chopra S. Lynch R. Kim S.H. Jackson M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6596-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) arises solely from perturbations on water activity, osmolytes with different characteristics were used. For example, addition of glycine betaine or sucrose can both affect water activity, yet these molecules either increase or decrease the dielectric constant of the solution, respectively (30Fried M.G.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16988-16997Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). If both compounds show similar results, then effects on the dielectric constant are not involved. To test the role of volume exclusion on binding, PEGs of increasing size are typically used. The osmotically active volume is the volume accessible to water but inaccessible to osmolyte. Here, the osmotically active volume depends on the size of the osmolyte, with larger osmolytes detecting changes in larger volumes. Osmotic stress occurs as the solution must compensate for this exclusion (30Fried M.G. Stickle D.F. Smirnakis K.V. Adams C. MacDonald D. Lu P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50676-50682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). A last possibility is the direct interaction of the osmolyte with either the ligand or protein (37Timasheff S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9721-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 38Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). If similar results are observed with chemically different osmolytes, this option appears unlikely (25Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 26Timasheff S.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 67-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar).With this background in mind, the steady state kinetic behavior of R67 DHFR was monitored in the presence of the neutral osmolytes glycerol, ethylene glycol, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), glycine betaine, and sucrose. Little to no effect (<1.5-fold) is observed on the catalytic rate constant, kcat, whereas the Km for DHF increases in the presence of all these osmolytes. A possible decrease in Km for NADPH is also observed. If a linear relationship is observed in plots of either osmolality or ln water activity versus ln kcat/Km (DHF), then effects on water are involved (30Fried M.G. Stickle D.F. Smirnakis K.V. Adams C.

As a precaution, we also plotted effects on solution viscosity or solution dielectric and overlapping data were not observed. These figures are available as supplemental Figs. 1 and 2. Another control experiment monitored the effect of osmolytes on the pH-dependent dissociation of tetramer to two protonated dimers. Addition of 10% ethylene glycol, 12.5% Me2SO, or 20% PEG400 did not greatly alter the pH titration data (experimental design in supplemental material as well as supplemental Fig. 3), indicating that osmolyte addition minimally perturbs the oligomeric state of R67 DHFR.FIGURE 2A plot of osmolality versus ln kcat/Km(DHF). Steady state kinetic data were obtained at saturating [NADPH] in the presence of various osmolytes. Michaelis-Menten plots were then used to calculate kcat and Km (DHF) values. The units of kcat/Km (DHF) are s–1 m–1. Data for buffer (gray circle), glycerol (solid circle), ethylene glycol (open star), TMAO (inverted open triangle), sucrose (open square), Me2SO (open circle), glycine betaine (open triangle), and PEG400 (checkerboard) are shown. Lines through the various data sets are also included. The slopes of these plots were converted to ΔnW using the relationship: d ln kcat/Km (DHF)/d[osmolal] =–ΔnW/55.6. These values are reported in Table 1. These values can also be obtained from a plot of ln kcat/Km (DHF) versus ln water activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)From Equation 3, the slope of a plot of ln water activity versus ln kcat/Km (DHF) describes the change in the number of water molecules, ΔnW, involved in DHF binding to the enzyme·NADPH complex and going to the transition state. The slopes associated with the individual osmolytes for this type of plot are given in Table 1. The slopes associated with TMAO, glycerol and ethylene glycol are low, around 16–25, and the data overlap reasonably well. A fit to these three combined data sets yields a slope of 17 ± 2. However, the slopes for the glycine betaine, Me2SO, and sucrose data are higher, ranging from 40 to 60. Variable slopes are common in osmolality studies, but their origin is not clear (37Timasheff S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab Ka Determination–Because Km values can contain information on binding as well as additional rate constants, we also inquired whether the Ka for DHF was altered by osmolyte addition. Initial isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments monitored binding of DHF to enzyme·NADP+, which results in a reasonable mimic of the catalytic ternary complex. Increasing concentrations of betaine and sucrose weaken binding of DHF as can be seen in Fig. 3A, which plots ln Ka versus osmolality. Using the relationship ln Ka/d[osmolal] =–ΔnW/55.6, the slope of the combined betaine and sucrose data were converted to a ΔnW of 29 ± 3. This value is lower than the effect of sucrose and betaine on kcat/Km (DHF) and suggests that Km may contain kinetic terms. We also present the data as a plot of total heat (Qtotal) versus [DHF] at increasing concentrations of betaine (see Fig. 4A).FIGURE 3A plot of ln Ka values versus osmolality. Ka values were obtained by ITC. A contains data for DHF binding to R67 DHFR·NADP+, whereas B contains data for NADPH binding to free enzyme. Only the first Ka values (units of m–1) for the latter data set are shown. Total heats for some of the data sets are shown in Fig. 4. Data for buffer (gray circle), ethylene glycol (open circle), sucrose (open square), Me2SO (open circle), glycine betaine (open triangle), and PEG400 (checkerboard) are shown. It is clear that the DHF and NADPH binding data possess opposite slopes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Plots of total heat (Qtotal) versus ligand concentration.

We also performed titrations with Me2SO, glycerol, and ethylene glycol, and at low cosolvent concentrations, decreases in Ka were observed. However, at higher osmolyte concentrations, good fits were not obtained; thus these data are not presented.From Fig. 4A, as the osmolyte concentration increases, the observed enthalpy value becomes smaller. Less negative ΔH values associated with water release have been observed previously as well as more negative ΔH values associated with water uptake (55Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R.

Large effects are observed, particularly on the enthalpy change, making fitting difficult. Thus the data are presented in Fig. 4B as a plot of Qtotal versus [folate].To determine whether osmolytes affect NADPH binding, several ITC titrations were performed in varying concentrations of betaine (0–20%). Fig. 4C shows a plot of Qtotal versus [NADPH]. An opposite trend compared with DHF/folate binding is noted in these plots, with increasing osmolyte concentrations tightening binding. Similar trends are noted when ethylene glycol, Me2SO, or PEG400 are used. The data were fit to a sequential sites model, and a plot of ln Ka1 versus osmolality is shown in Fig. 3B. All the data overlay reasonably well. Converting the slope of this plot to ΔnW yields a value of –38 ± 6. This result indicates that release of water accompanies bind"

The LPA1 receptor is the most widely expressed and is a major regulator of cell migration. In this study, we show that phorbol ester (PMA)-induced internalization of the LPA1 receptor requires clathrin AP-2 complexes, protein kinase C, and a distal dileucine motif (amino acids 352 and 353) in the cytoplasmic tail but not β-arrestin.

In contrast, the dileucine motif (IL) is required for both basal and PMA-induced internalization.

Depending on the characteristics of agonist-dependent arrestin association, two classes of GPCRs have been proposed, class A and class B, which differ in their affinities for β-arrestin1 and -2 and in their spatiotemporal association (13Oakley R.H.

Other adaptor proteins like clathrin AP-2 can directly mediate the internalization of some GPCRs (PAR-1 and thromboxane A2) (14Paing M.M. Stutts A.B. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Trejo J. J. Biol.

Several studies have shown that discrete amino acid motifs such as dileucine-based (LL/IL) and tyrosine-based (YXXϕ) motifs, which are present in the cytoplasmic tails of GPCRs, mediate the direct interaction with clathrin and AP-2 to promote endocytosis (15Paing M.M.

We have been studying the trafficking of the most widely expressed GPCR for the serum phospholipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), termed LPA1 (7Urs N.M. Jones K.T. Salo P.D. Severin J.E. Trejo J.

LPA has growth factor-like properties and is involved in a variety of processes such as wound healing, cell proliferation and survival, neurite retraction, and cell migration (20van Leeuwen F.N. Giepmans B.N. van Meeteren L.A. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1209-1212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPA stimulates these processes mainly through the activation of five distinct GPCRs, LPA1–5 (21Anliker B. Chun J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Lee C.W. Rivera R. Gardell S. Dubin A.E. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the LPA1 receptor utilizes a clathrin- and β-arrestin-dependent pathway for agonist-induced internalization (7Urs N.M. Jones K.T. Salo P.D. Severin J.E. Trejo J. Radhakrishna H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5291-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Murph M.M. Scaccia L.A. Volpicelli L.A. Radhakrishna H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the amino acid sequences in the cytoplasmic tail of the LPA1 receptor that are involved in receptor internalization. Two distinct motifs are required for agonist-dependent versus agonist-independent internalization of the LPA1 receptor. A serine cluster (341SDRSASS347) in the C-terminal tail is required for β-arrestin association, signal attenuation, and subsequent endocytosis after LPA stimulation. A more distal dileucine motif (352IL353) is required for agonist-independent and phorbol ester-induced internalization of the LPA1 receptor. This type of internalization is independent of β-arrestin but requires the clathrin adaptor AP-2. This suggests that two distinct mechanisms regulate agonist-dependent and PMA-dependent internalization of the LPA1 receptor. Antibodies and Reagents—Lysophosphatidic acid (1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate; LPA) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Sigma. Wild-type and mutant HA-tagged LPA1 receptors were detected with mouse anti-HA antibodies (Covance, Berkeley, CA). myo-[3H]Inositol was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO); Gö 6976 and Gö 6983 were purchased from Calbiochem. Cy3 donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. The rabbit anti-AP-2 (μ2 subunit) antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Juan Bonifacino (NICHD, National Institutes of Health). Plasmids—HA-LPA1 plasmid was generated by PCR, using a previously described FLAG-LPA1 plasmid as template (19Murph M.M. Scaccia L.A. Volpicelli L.A. Radhakrishna H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HA-tagged truncation mutant receptors, as described in the figure legends, were generated using the Gene-Tailor site-directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's instructions, with the HA-LPA1 wild-type plasmid as template. All plasmids were subjected to DNA sequencing to confirm their sequences. β-Arrestin GFP plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Stefano Marullo. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—HeLa cells stably expressing HA-tagged LPA1 receptor (termed LPA1/HeLa cells), native HeLa cells, wild-type (WT) MEF, and β-arrestin1/2 KO MEF cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Media Tech, Herndon, VA), and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (BIOSOURCE) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were grown on glass coverslips (for immunofluorescence) and transfected in 6-well dishes or were grown in 24-well dishes (for myo-[3H]inositol labeling) and transfected using Exgen 500 (Fermentas) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Internalization Assay—LPA1/HeLa cells or HeLa cells were plated on coverslips. For internalization assays involving different mutant LPA1 receptors, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmid DNA as described in the figure legends. For experiments with siRNA-mediated reduction of AP-2, LPA1/HeLa cells were transfected with siAP-2 as described in the figure legends. The day before experimentation, the cells were serum-starved overnight. Cells were incubated with or without inhibitors as described in figure legends and were then transferred onto ice and incubated with mouse anti-HA primary antibodies (Covance) for 1 h to label cell surface HA-tagged LPA1 (wild-type and mutant) receptors. Cells were then either left at 4 °C (total surface) or transferred to 37 °C and treated as described in the figure legends. After incubation at 37 °C, antibodies bound to the cell surface were removed by rinsing the cells with 100 mm glycine, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm KCl, pH 2.2 (acid wash) (24Naslavsky N. Weigert R. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3542-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), for 90 s. For experiments with co-transfected HA-LPA1 receptors and β-arrestin2 GFP, the surface antibodies were not removed by acid wash. Cells were rinsed and processed for immunofluorescence as described below. Immunofluorescence—HA-LPA1 receptors were detected using mouse anti-HA antibody (Covance). Immunofluorescence detection of AP-2 was done using a mouse anti-AP-2 antibody (AP-6) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For internalization assays, following anti-HA antibody incubations at 4 °C and treatments at 37 °C, the cells were then fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min and rinsed with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 0.02% azide in PBS (PBS serum). For indirect immunofluorescence and AP-2 detection, following overnight serum starvation and subsequent treatments, cells were fixed and rinsed with PBS serum and were incubated with mouse anti-HA or anti-AP-2 antibodies diluted in PBS serum containing 0.2% saponin for 45 min. Following fixation and incubation with primary antibodies, the cells were washed three times with PBS serum and then incubated with fluorescently labeled donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in PBS serum containing 0.2% saponin for 45 min, washed three times with PBS serum, washed once with PBS, and mounted on glass slides as described previously (19Murph M.M. Scaccia L.A. Volpicelli L.A. Radhakrishna H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Images were captured using a Hamamatsu digital camera mounted on a Leica Inverted microscope with a 100× oil immersion objective. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software. Quantification of Internalization—For internalization assays, images were taken using a Hamamatsu digital camera mounted on a Leica inverted microscope with a 100× oil immersion objective. The images were analyzed by Simple PCI software (Compix, Cranberry Township, PA), and total fluorescence for both internalized (vesicles/cell) and surface antibody levels were measured as described previously (25Xiao K.

Internalization (cell-associated fluorescence after acid wash) is expressed as a percentage of total fluorescence of initial surface-bound antibodies (4 °C) for both wild-type and mutant LPA1 receptors. Confocal Microscopy for β-Arrestin2-GFP Translocation Assay—To observe β-arrestin2 GFP translocation to the plasma membrane in response to LPA or PMA stimulation, HeLa cells were plated onto 35-mm glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). The cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged LPA1R and β-arrestin2-GFP and, after 24 h post-transfection, were treated with either 10 μm LPA or 1 μm PMA as described in the figure legends. The cells were then processed for immunofluorescence as described earlier. Images were taken using a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM-510). siRNA-mediated Reduction of AP-2—siRNA oligonucleotides to the μ-subunit of adaptin were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and have been described previously (26Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). LPA1/HeLa cells were transiently transfected with 175 pmol (12-well plate) or 300 pmol (6-well plate) of siRNA to AP-2 (siAP-2) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The transfection medium was replaced with complete medium (without penicillin/streptomycin) 5 h later, and the cells were trypsinized after an additional 2 h and plated in a 6-well plate with (immunofluorescence) or without (immunoblotting) coverslips and then incubated for 16 h. The cells were transfected a second time as above, and the medium was then replaced with serum-free medium and incubated for an additional 16 h before experimentation. Immunoblotting—Following serum starvation overnight, cells were solubilized by addition of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 m sodium orthovanadate, 0.02% azide, 100 mg/ml leupeptin and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 60 min. The samples were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with mouse anti-HA (detection of HA-LPA1 receptor) (Covance) or rabbit anti-AP-2 (detection of AP-2 μ2 subunit) (Dr. Juan Bonifacino) antibodies. The binding of primary antibodies was detected by using the West Pico enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis—HeLa cells were plated at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well into 24-well plates and transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant HA-LPA1 using Exgen500 (Fermentas). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were labeled overnight with myo-[3H]inositol in inositol- and serum-free medium, treated as described in the figure legends, and then processed for analysis of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by anion exchange chromatography as described (7Urs N.M. Jones K.T. Salo P.D. Severin J.E. Trejo J. Radhakrishna H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5291-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. from the indicated number of independent experiments. Differences were analyzed by two-factor analysis of variance followed by a Tukey's statistical significance test. Differential Sensitivity of LPA- Versus PMA-induced Internalization of the LPA1 Receptor (LPA1R) to PKC Inhibitors—We were interested in defining the molecular determinants of the LPA1R that mediate its endocytic trafficking. In addition to LPA, a previous study indicated that the phorbol ester, PMA, induced PKC-dependent phosphorylation, signal desensitization, and internalization of the LPA1R in C9 rat hepatoma cells (27Avendano-Vazquez S.E. Garcia-Caballero A. Garcia-Sainz J.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine whether PMA also induced LPA1R endocytosis in HeLa cells, we compared the effects of LPA and PMA on the distribution of LPA1R by using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy after fixation (Fig. 1A). To label endosomes, these cells were incubated with Alexa-labeled transferrin (Tfn) prior to fixation. In untreated cells, LPA1Rs were localized predominantly to the plasma membrane and Alexa-Tfn-labeled punctate endosomal compartments. Following either LPA or PMA treatment, LPA1Rs co-localized with Alexa-Tfn in endosomal compartments, which indicated that both of these stimuli induced LPA1R endocytosis. Interestingly, these LPA1R+ and Alexa-Tfn+ endosomes had a more clustered appearance following PMA treatment. To quantify LPA1R endocytosis, we took advantage of the N-terminal HA epitope tag on LPA1R, which is exposed to the medium at the cell surface, and used an HA antibody co-internalization assay (Fig. 1B). Mouse anti-HA antibodies were first bound to cells expressing HA-tagged LPA1Rs at 4 °C, and the cells were either left at 4 °C (total surface) or treated with vehicle, LPA, or PMA at 37 °C. During incubation at 37 °C, the HA antibody was co-internalized along with the LPA1R. The remaining surface-bound antibodies were removed with a mild acid wash, whereas the co-internalized antibody bound to the LPA1 receptor was retained. At 4 °C, the anti-HA antibodies bound to LPA1Rs, localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B, left panel). When these cells were warmed to 37 °C in the absence of any stimuli and then rinsed with a mild acid wash, very little anti-HA antibody was internalized (Fig. 1B, untreated, 2nd panel from the left). However, incubation with either LPA or PMA markedly increased internalization of the anti-HA antibody, which localized to endosomal-like structures. To confirm the endosomal localization of the internalized anti-HA-bound LPA1Rs, we repeated these experiments and included Alexa-Tfn during the incubations at 37 °C (Fig. 1C). In these experiments, the internalized anti-HA-bound LPA1Rs extensively co-localized with Alexa-Tfn-labeled endosomes. The results of these anti-HA antibody internalization experiments gave the same results as those obtained by indirect immunofluorescence after treatment and fixation. The bound anti-HA antibody did not alter the pattern of internalization or the endosomal localization of LPA1Rs, thus validating this antibody internalization assay to monitor LPA1R internalization. We quantified the amount of anti-HA antibody that was internalized relative to what was initially bound at 4 °C by using Simple PCI image analysis software as published previously (7Urs N.M. Jones K.T. Salo P.D. Severin J.E. Trejo J. Radhakrishna H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5291-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Cells incubated in the absence of LPA and PMA only internalized about 9% of the initial bound anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1D, untreated, white bar). This represents the basal internalization of LPA1Rs. Incubation with LPA for 30 min induced ∼38% internalization of anti-HA antibody-bound LPA1Rs (Fig. 1D, LPA, white bars) and PMA induced ∼28% internalization of anti-HA-bound LPA1Rs (PMA, white bars). To test the role of PKC in LPA1R internalization, we examined the effects of the PKC inhibitors Gö 6976, which inhibits both conventional PKCs and PKD/PKCμ (28Wang Q.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 317-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and Gö 6983, which inhibits conventional and novel PKC isoforms but not PKD/PKCμ (28Wang Q.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 317-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 29Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Mueller H.J. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Preincubation with 5 mm Gö 6976 (Fig. 1D, PMA, black bar), but not Gö 6983 (Fig. 1D, PMA, gray bar), inhibited PMA-induced internalization of LPA1Rs by ∼70%. Neither inhibitor inhibited LPA-induced internalization (Fig. 1D, LPA). These results indicated that PKC, and perhaps PKD/PKCμ, was required for PMA-induced but not LPA-induced internalization. This also raised the possibility that different mechanisms regulated LPA1R internalization in response to these two stimuli. The Cytoplasmic Tail of LPA1Rs Is a Critical Determinant of LPA Signal Strength—The cytoplasmic tails of many GPCRs are critical for the regulation of receptor signaling and/or trafficking (30Oakley R.H.

Whiteheart S.W. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Inspection of the amino acid sequence of the LPA1R cytoplasmic tail reveals several discrete amino acid motifs, including a di-cysteine palmitoylation motif (aa 328 and 329), a serine-rich domain (aa 341–347), a di-leucine motif (aa 352 and 353), and a PDZ binding domain (aa 362–364) (Fig. 2A). We investigated the importance of these motifs to LPA1R signaling and intracellular trafficking by creating several truncated HA-tagged receptor mutants (Fig. 2A). Truncation of the cytoplasmic tail to eliminate the putative palmitoylation site, as well as the other motifs, resulted in a misfolded LPA1R, which was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (data not shown). Therefore, we focused on four mutants indicated in Fig. 2A to investigate the role of the serine-rich domain, di-leucine motif, and the PDZ binding domain. The effects of these truncated mutants on LPA signaling was investigated in transiently transfected HeLa cells by using a phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis assay, which measures Gαq activation in response to LPA stimulation (7Urs N.M. Jones K.T. Salo P.D. Severin J.E. Trejo J. Radhakrishna H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5291-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Paing M.M. Stutts A.B. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Trejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1292-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cells expressing wild-type (WT) LPA1 displayed a 5-fold increase in PI hydrolysis upon LPA stimulation (Fig. 2B). A mutant LPA1R that lacked the PDZ binding domain (Δ361) displayed a slight decrease in LPA-stimulated PI hydrolysis but was indistinguishable from WT LPA1Rs in basal activation. However, successive truncation of the cytoplasmic tail led to a progressive increase in LPA-induced PI hydrolysis (Fig. 2B, see Δ353, Δ347, and Δ340). These results indicated that the region between residues 340 and 361 dampen LPA signaling and suggest that they are important for signal attenuation. The Serine-rich Region Is Critical for β-Arrestin Association—Because the region between residues 340 and 361 dampened LPA1R signaling, we hypothesized that this region was critical for signal desensitization and therefore β-arrestin interaction. We next sought to determine whether the serine-rich region is required for β-arrestin interaction. We have previously showed that LPA1Rs transiently (i.e. following 2 min of LPA stimulation) associate with β-arrestins at the plasma membrane and that this association is required for signal attenuation (7Urs N.M. Jones K.T. Salo P.D. Severin J.E. Trejo J. Radhakrishna H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5291-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In cells expressing LPA1Rs and β-arrestin2-GFP, the latter protein translocates to the plasma membrane and co-localizes with LPA1Rs and clathrin AP-2 complexes following a 2-min LPA stimulation (7Urs N.M. Jones K.T. Salo P.D. Severin J.E. Trejo J. Radhakrishna H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5291-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the cytoplasmic tail in LPA1R/β-arrestin interactions, HeLa cells were co-transfected with different HA-tagged LPA1Rs and β-arrestin2-GFP, stimulated with LPA for 2 min, and then analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3A). In cells expressing WT, Δ347, Δ353, or Δ361 LPA1Rs, β-arrestin2-GFP translocated to the plasma membrane and co-localized with LPA1Rs (Fig. 3A, see arrows), after brief LPA stimulation (Fig. 3A, WT). In contrast, β-arrestin2-GFP failed to translocate to the plasma membrane in cells expressing Δ340 LPA1Rs (Fig. 3A, Δ340). This suggested that the serine-rich region between aa 340 and 347 was critical for interaction of LPA1Rs and β-arrestin2, but that neither the dileucine motif nor the PDZ binding domain was required for β-arrestin recruitment. We next quantified the percentage of cells where β-arrestin2-GFP co-localized with LPA1Rs following brief LPA stimulation (Fig. 3B). In the cells expressing WT, Δ353, and Δ361 LPA1Rs, β-arrestin2-GFP co-localized with LPA1Rs in ∼90% of the cells. In contrast, β-arrestin2 GFP marginally co-localized with LPA1Rs in only ∼10% of the cells expressing the Δ340 LPA1R. β-Arrestin2-GFP co-localized with the Δ347 LPA1Rin 70% of the cells. These results suggest that the serine-rich region between aa 340 and 347 is required for β-arrestin interaction with the LPA1Rs. Different Motifs in the Cytoplasmic Tail"

Although yeast antizyme (yAz) stimulates the degradation of yeast ODC (yODC), we show here that it has only a minor effect on polyamine uptake by yeast cells. A segment of yODC that parallels the Az binding segment of mammalian ODC (mODC) is required for its binding to yAz. Although demonstrating minimal homology to mAz, our results suggest that yAz stimulates yODC degradation via a similar mechanism of action. We demonstrate that interaction with yAz provokes degradation of yODC by yeast but not by mammalian proteasomes. This differential recognition may serve as a tool for investigating proteasome functions.

ODC is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of polyamines.

Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Polyamines are small aliphatic charged molecules that play an important role in various cellular functions and are essential for the process of cellular proliferation (10Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V.

Polyamine depletion results in growth cessation (14Schwartz B. Hittelman A. Daneshvar L. Basu H.S. Marton L.J. Feuerstein B.G. Biochem.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1279-1285PubMed Google Scholar), calling for strict regulation of the intracellular polyamines pools. An efficient autoregulatory circuit affecting both synthesis and uptake controls cellular levels of polyamines. The central element of this circuit is a polyamine-induced protein termed antizyme (Az). Az serves as a cellular polyamine sensor, because it is synthesized from two open reading frames via a polyamine-stimulated ribosomal frameshifting (19Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 20Rom E. Kahana C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3959-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interaction between ODC and Az results in inhibition of ODC activity due to trapping of transient ODC subunits into inactive ODC/Az heterodimers, and in presenting these ODC monomers to ubiquitin independent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (8Murakami Y.

It was suggested that interaction with Az exposes the C-terminal degradation signal of mODC (24Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which serves as the proteasome recognition element (25Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating ODC activity and degradation, mAz also regulates polyamine transport via a yet unresolved mechanism (26He Y. Suzuki T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Mitchell J.L. Judd G.G. Bareyal-Leyser A. Ling S.Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Similar to its mammalian counterpart, yODC is degraded in a ubiquitination-independent manner in yeast cells (28Gandre S. Kahana C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Early studies demonstrated that, like in mammalian cells, in yeast cells polyamines induced rapid ODC degradation, suggesting the yeast cells contain a functional Az orthologue (29Gupta R. Hamasaki-Katagiri N. White Tabor C. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10620-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Toth C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25921-25926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Indeed, after a lengthy time of unfruitful searching for Az in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using standard methods, yAz was recently identified and cloned using a bioinformatic approach (31Palanimurugan R. Scheel H. Hofmann K. Dohmen R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4857-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The yeast Az orthologue resembles mAz in its mode of synthesis and in its ability to promote ODC degradation. In the present study we demonstrate that, in contrast to efficiently regulating yODC activity and degradation, yAz exerts only a mild effect on the process of polyamine uptake. Therefore, the growth of yeast cells is inhibited by overexpressed yAz, predominantly via inhibiting ODC activity and mediating its degradation, leading to reduction of the intracellular polyamine pools. We show that the stability of yODC in mammalian cells is not a result of the absence of a compatible Az or lack of a C-terminal-destabilizing signal found on the mammalian enzyme, but is rather a result of the inability of the mammalian proteasome to degrade yODC. Yeast Strains and Media–The S. cerevisiae strains used in the present work are BY4741 (MATa, leu2, ura3, his3, lys2) serving as the WT strain and oaz1Δ (BY4741, YPL0052W:: KanMX4), obtained from EUROSCARF. These strains were routinely maintained in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% d-glucose). Transformed yeast cells were grown in synthetic medium (32Maruyama T. Masuda N. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) lacking selective amino acid (usually leucine). Transformation of yeast cells was performed by the lithium acetate method (33Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of Mammalian Cells–HEK293 cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate method (34Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis–Standard molecular biology methods were used for construction of plasmids. The sequences of the PCR primers are available upon request. For expression in yeast cells, the relevant DNA fragments were cloned between the SalI/SacI sites of the high copy number yeast expression vector pAD54 (35Pillai R. Kytle K. Reyes A. Colicelli J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11970-11974Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), placing them in-frame downstream to a HA tag. All the mutants used in the present study were prepared using the overlap extension method (36Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 37Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). To enable efficient polyamine-independent expression of yAz, a frameshifted version was prepared by deleting nucleotide 208. The yODC mutant lacking the first 47 amino acids (ΔN47yODC) was generated by PCR. The yeast ODC chimeras containing the C terminus of mODC at its C terminus (yODC/CmODC and ΔN47yODC/CmODC) and the chimera in which the C terminus of the mouse enzyme replaced the 47 amino acids segment of yODC (CmODC/ΔN47yODC) was created using the overlap extension method (36Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 37Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The yODC mutant lacking the putative binding site for yAz (yODCΔAzBS) was generated by deleting amino acids 164–187. The relevant DNAs were cloned into pGEM1 (Promega, Madison, WI) for expression in vitro using the TnT system (Promega), and into the bicistronic mammalian expression vector pEFIRES (38Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), for expression in transfected mammalian cells. When required, FLAG tag was added during the PCR cloning process. ODC Activity Assay–For measurement of ODC activity in yeast cells, cells from a 2-ml overnight culture were pelleted and washed with double distilled water, and cellular extracts were prepared using glass beads in 200 μl of ODC activity buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA 0.2 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate). Aliquots containing 200 μgof protein were used for each assay. For measuring ODC activity of in vitro translated proteins, their amount was equalized by normalizing radioactivity to the number of methionine residues. The tested proteins were mixed with 100 μl of ODC activity buffer containing 0.33 mm l-ornithine and 0.5 μCi of l-[14C]ornithine and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The liberated [14C]CO2 was trapped in 3MM paper impregnated in saturated BaOH solution that was placed on top of the microtiter plate. At the end of the incubation period (at 37 °C) the 3MM paper was washed with acetone and dried, and the trapped radioactivity was determined using a Fuji Bas2500 phosphorimaging device. Polyamine Uptake Assay–The assay was performed essentially as described (39Porat Z. Wender N. Erez O. Kahana C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 3106-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to the mid-logarithmic phase, washed three times in glucose-citrate buffer (50 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5), 2% d-glucose), and resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 108 cells/ml. Transport was initiated by adding 0.2 volume of [14C]spermine (10 Ci/mol at 100 mm, from Amersham Biosciences), and the cells were incubated at 30 °C with mild shaking. Uptake was terminated by transferring 100-μl aliquots into 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (glucose-citrate buffer containing 2 mm unlabeled spermine). The cells were then layered onto cellulose-acetate filters (0.45-nm pore size) that were washed three times with stop buffer, and the retained radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Growth Assays–Growth curves were generated by diluting yeast overnight cultures to A600 = 0.05, and grown in microplate optical reader (GENios, Tecan) in 30 °C with continues shaking. Growth curves were generated by automatic measurement of A600 performed every 10 min. Polyamine Analysis–The assay was performed according to Madhubala et al. (40Madhubala R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 79: 131-136PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown overnight, and 15 optical density units were collected from each sample. The samples were centrifuged for 30 s at 10,000 × g, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and re-centrifuged. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 4.5 μl of 70% perchloric acid was added, and the samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g. Markers were prepared using equal amounts of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Then, 200 μl of Dansyl chloride (3 mg/ml in acetone) and 10 mg of Na2CO3 were added to 100 μl of each sample. The samples were incubated overnight in the dark. Next, 10 mg of proline was added, and after 1 h of incubation, 250 μl of toluene were added, and the samples were centrifuged for 30 s at 13,000 × g. Five microliters of markers and 100 μl of each sample were spotted onto a TLC plate (ALOGRAM SIL G/UV, from Macherey-Nagel, Germany), and resolved by chromatography in ethyl acetate:cyclohexane (2:3, v/v). Polyamines were visualized using a gel imager with a UV filter. In Vivo Degradation Assay–293HEK cells were transiently transfected with yODC, mODC or the chimerical proteins together with either yAz or mAz. Chase was initiated by the addition of cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) to the growth medium, and the cells were harvested at the indicated times thereafter. Cells were lysed, and aliquots containing equal amounts of protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and examined by Western blot analysis. In Vitro Translation and Degradation Assay–The relevant proteins were translated in vitro for 1 h at 30 °C using TnT reaction mix (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. When required, the amount of the tested proteins was normalized by dividing the radioactivity in the relevant band to the number of their methionine residues. When it was important that ubiquitin be completely absent from the degradation reaction, the in vitro translated proteins were fractionated on ion exchange column. The tested proteins were incubated in a reticulocyte lysate-based degradation mixture (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma), 1.6 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase (Roche Applied Science), 6 μl of reticulocyte lysate (Promega)), and when indicated supplemented with 1.5 μg of purified yeast or rat 26 S proteasome at a total volume of 15 μl and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. To test for ATP requirement, ATP, phosphocreatine, and creatine phosphokinase were omitted and 2-deoxyglucose (20 mm) and hexokinase (10 μg/ml) were added. At the end of the incubation period the proteins were resolved by fractionation in a 12.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel, and the radioactivity of the individual proteins determined using the Fuji Bas2500 phosphorimaging device. Isolation of Yeast and Mammalian Proteasome–Yeast proteasome was purified according to the conventional protocol as described by Leggett et al. (41Leggett D.S. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 301: 57-70PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian proteasome was kindly provided by Dr. Ami Navon (Weizman Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). It was purifies using a procedure described in (42Qiu X.B. Ouyang S.Y. Li C.J. Miao S. Wang L. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5742-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Assay–In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled WT yODC and the yODC mutant lacking the putative yAz binding site (yODCΔAzBS) were incubated in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) for 12 h either alone or together with HA-tagged yAz and with α-HA beads. The beads were collected by centrifugations and washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, and the bound material was eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and fractionated by polyacrylamide-SDS gel electrophoresis. Radioactive bands were visualized using a Fuji Bas2500 phosphorimaging device. Western Blot Analysis–Mammalian Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate). Yeast cells were lysed using the Cellytic reagent (Sigma). Samples containing 40–50 μg of protein were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The primary antibodies used were anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:2000, BabCO), anti-yeast ODC polyclonal antibody (1:300, produced in our laboratory), anti-mouse ODC polyclonal antibody (1:300, produced in our laboratory), anti-rat antizyme (1:500, produced in our laboratory). Goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:10,000, Jackson) were used as a secondary antibody. Signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Overexpression of yAz Results in Polyamine Depletion and Growth Inhibition of Yeast Cells Mainly through Inhibiting ODC–Although the role of mAz in inhibiting ODC activity and mediating ODC degradation is well documented, its involvement in mediating polyamine uptake is less characterized (26He Y. Suzuki T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Mitchell J.L. Judd G.G. Bareyal-Leyser A. Ling S.Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 43Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Recently an antizyme orthologue was identified in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (31Palanimurugan R. Scheel H. Hofmann K. Dohmen R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4857-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similar to its mammalian counterpart, yAz efficiently stimulated yeast yODC degradation, but its involvement in regulating polyamine uptake was not tested. To further characterize yAz, we cloned a frame-shifted version of yAz into the high copy number yeast expression vector pAD54. Although overexpressed yAz reduced ODC activity in WT and in oaz1Δ cells (in which ODC activity is ∼50-fold elevated) by 3- and 50-fold, respectively, yAz elicited only a minor effect on polyamine uptake both when overexpressed (uptake increased by up to 20%) or when deleted (uptake reduced by up to 20%). We therefore concluded that, in contrast to mAz, which significantly reduces polyamine uptake in mammalian cells (26He Y. Suzuki T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Mitchell J.L. Judd G.G. Bareyal-Leyser A. Ling S.Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), yAz has only minor effect on polyamine uptake in yeast cells (data not shown). Overexpression of mAz in mammalian cells leads to growth arrest due to polyamine depletion, being an outcome of reduced ODC activity and polyamine uptake (43Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To determine whether yAz exerts a similar effect on growth of yeast cells, we compared the growth rate of yeast cells overexpressing yAz and of oaz1Δ cells lacking yAz. Interestingly, despite their slightly increased uptake activity, cells overexpressing yAz show slower growth rate, whereas deletion of the yAz gene did not affect growth (Fig. 1). To determine whether the reduced growth rate of yAz-overproducing cells is a result of decreased cellular polyamine concentration, we determined the polyamine content of these cells. As shown in the insert of Fig. 1, reduced intracellular polyamine levels accompanied the slower growth rate of yAz-overexpressing cells. Deletion of yAz resulted in a ∼20-fold increase in putrescine content, as expected from the large increase of ODC activity in these cells. This increase in putrescine and a lesser increase in spermidine did not affect growth rate or viability of these cells (Fig. 1). To determine whether the slower growth of yAz-overproducing cells was a result of reduced polyamine content, we tested whether exogenous addition of polyamines will restore their growth. As addition of 0.1 mm spermidine to their growth medium restored their growth rate (Fig. 1), we concluded that polyamine depletion was the cause of the observed growth inhibition. yAz Does Not Promote yODC Degradation by the Mammalian Proteolytic Machinery–Yeast ODC (yODC) is degraded rapidly in yeast cells but is a stable protein when expressed in mammalian cells (28Gandre S. Kahana C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is possible that the stability of yODC in mammalian cells is a result of its incompatibility with mammalian Az (mAz). We therefore set out to determine whether yAz will promote yODC degradation in mammalian cells. For this purpose, 293HEK cells were co-transfected with yODC together with yAz, and the stability of yODC was determined. As expected, co-transfected mAz stimulated the degradation of mODC, however, yODC remained stable even when transfected together with yAz (Fig. 2A). Similarly, yODC remained stable when subjected to degradation in vitro in a reticulocyte lysate based degradation mix either when incubated alone or together with yAz (Fig. 2B). Because mAz stimulated the degradation of mODC, we concluded that there is incompatibility between yODC and yAz with the mammalian degradation system. The C-terminal Destabilizing Segment of mODC Does Not Target yODC to Degradation in Mammalian Cells–Two segments of mODC were demonstrated important for its rapid degradation. The first, containing amino acids 117–140 is required for Az binding, which stimulates degradation (21Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 22Mamroud-Kidron E. Omer-Itsicovich M. Bercovich Z. Tobias K.E. Rom E. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The second, encompassing the 37 most C-terminal amino acids, which constitutes the proteasome recognition signal is essential for ODC degradation (25Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 44Ghoda L. Phillips M.A. Bass K.E. Wang C.C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11823-11826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ghoda L. van Daalen Wetters T. Macrae M. Ascherman D. Coffino P. Science. 1989; 243: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 46Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Bercovich Z. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). yODC lacks a C-terminal segment that parallels the C-terminal degradation signal of mODC. Trypanosome (Trypanosome brucei) ODC, which also lacks a C-terminal degradation signal, is stable when expressed in mammalian cells but is converted into a rapidly degraded protein when the C terminus of mODC was appended to it (44Ghoda L. Phillips M.A. Bass K.E. Wang C.C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11823-11826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C-terminal segment of mODC targeted heterologous proteins to proteasomal degradation (47Li X. Zhao X. Fang Y. Jiang X. Duong T. Fan C. Huang C.C. Kain S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34970-34975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 48Loetscher P. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11213-11220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Takeuchi J. Chen H. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In these cases the degradation of the chimerical proteins did not require interaction with Az. We therefore next tested whether the stability of yODC in mammalian cells is a result of the absence of an appropriate destabilizing signal. To this end, two chimerical proteins were constructed in which the segment encompassing the 37 most C-terminal amino acids of mODC was appended either to the C terminus of yeast ODC, or replacing its N-terminal degradation signal encompassing amino acids 1–47 (28Gandre S. Kahana C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The stability of the resulting proteins was tested in transfected 293 cells (Fig. 2C) and in vitro in the reticulocyte lysate-based degradation system (Fig. 2D). Both proteins remained stable when incubated alone or together with yAz (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that yeast ODC is incompatible with the mammalian degradation machinery even when containing the mammalian degradation signal. Yeast ODC Is Recognized and Degraded by Yeast but Not by the Mammalian Proteasome–It is possible that degradation of yODC in the mammalian system requires other unknown yeast factors, or that the mammalian proteasome is incapable of processing the yeast Az·ODC complex. To test the latter possibility, we examined yODC degradation in the presence of highly purified yeast 26 S proteasome. Addition of yeast proteasome to the degradation mix induced efficient degradation of yODC (Fig. 3A). Equal amounts of mammalian proteasome (normalized by activity against a fluorogenic peptide) failed to provoke yODC degradation, suggesting that yAz mediates recognition of yODC by yeast but not by mammalian proteasome. This degradation of yODC by the yeast proteasome is Az-dependent (Fig. 3B) and requires metabolic energy in the form of ATP (Fig. 3C). Next we have tested whether under these conditions the C terminus of mODC can function as a yODC-targeting signal, because mouse ODC is rapidly degraded in yeast cells in a C terminus-dependent manner (28Gandre S. Kahana C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 50Mamroud-Kidron E. Kahana C.

For this purpose the C-terminal segment of mODC was appended at the N or C terminus of the stable yODC mutant lacking its N-terminal destabilizing segment and the stability of the resulting proteins tested in a reaction containing yeast proteasome and yAz. Although the chimera containing the C terminus of mODC at the C terminus of the yeast enzyme remained stable, the one containing the mouse C-terminal segment at the N terminus was rapidly degraded (Fig. 3D). As previously demonstrated (49Takeuchi J. Chen H. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 52Miyazaki Y. Matsufuji S. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), converting cysteine 441 of the mouse degradation signal to alanine interfered with the ability of this segment to confer lability on yODC (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that yODC is recognized for degradation by the yeast but not by the mammalian proteasome and could suggest that yAz may act similarly to mammalian Az in exposing the degradation signal. Identification of the Az Binding Site of yODC–The mammalian ODC segment encompassing amino acids 117–140 was suggested to function as the putative Az binding site (21Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Best fit alignment between yeast and mouse ODC revealed that the region encompassing amino acids 164–187 of the yeast enzyme corresponds to the putative Az binding segment of mODC (Fig. 4A). To determine whether this segment of yODC is required for Az binding, it was deleted from an N-terminally FLAG-tagged yODC (FyODCΔAzBS), and the mutant protein was tested for Az binding by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Although yAz was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with WT yODC, the mutant failed to bind yAz (Fig. 4B). In line with this result, the mutant protein was stable even in the presence of yAz (Fig. 4C), suggesting that this region constitutes or is at least part of the Az binding segment of yODC. Characterization of yAz Sequences That Are Important for Inhibiting ODC Activity and Promoting ODC Degradation–Previous studies have demonstrated that large C-terminal segment of mAz is required for ODC binding and inactivation, whereas a smaller more N-terminal segment, which does not affect binding or ODC inactivation, is required for targeting ODC to degradation (22Mamroud-Kidron E. Omer-Itsicovich M. Bercovich Z. Tobias K.E. Rom E. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 53Chen H. MacDonald A. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45957-45961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 54Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize functional domains of yAz, 14 in-frame deletions were introduced into yAz, and the ability of the resulting mutants to inhibit yODC activity and to promote yODC degradation was examined. As shown in Fig. 5, the vast majority of the mutants lost the ability to inhibit ODC activity and to promote ODC degradation, probably reflecting their inability to bind to yODC. There were no mutants that significantly inactivated yODC but failed to promote its degradation. The mechanism by which Az controls cellular polyamine levels appears to be conserved among mammalian species. This includes inhibition of ODC activity and induction of ODC degradation, along with an inhibitory effect on the mechanistically yet unresolved process of polyamine uptake. Some of these features are also shared by the long sought Az orthologue of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (31Palanimurugan R. Scheel H. Hofmann K. Dohmen R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4857-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although yAz displays minimal homology to mAz, it retains the ability to efficiently stimulate ODC degradation. However, its ability to affect polyamine uptake was not tested. We demonstrate here that the effect yAz exerts on polyamine uptake in yeast cells is minor compared with that exerted by mammalian Az in mammalian cells. Despite the minor increase of polyamine uptake in yAz-overproducing yeast cells their polyamines content was actually reduced, suggesting that the dominant effect of yAz is on ODC activity and degradation. Indeed, although its effect on uptake was in the range of 20%, yAz deletion led to ∼50-fold increase in ODC activity. It is possible that the effect yAz exerts on polyamines uptake is rather indirect, reflecting attempts mediated by other regulatory mechanisms to compensate for the dramatic reduction in polyamines production. As in mammalian cells, the large increase in ODC activity leads to dramatic increase in the intracellular putrescine concentration. However, in contrast to the toxic effect the accumulated putrescine caused in mammalian cells (18Tobias K.E. Kahana C. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1279-1285PubMed Google Scholar), no such effect was observed in yeast cells. A segment of mODC encompassing amino acids 117–140 seems to function as the potential Az binding site (21Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Best-fit alignment between yeast and mouse ODC revealed that amino acids 164–187 of yODC correspond to this putative Az binding site. Despite displaying only 50% homology to the parallel mouse segment, deletion of this segment of yODC yielded a mutant that displays poor Az binding and is therefore stabilized. Although our analysis implicates the segment containing amino acids 164–187 as the putative yAz binding site, further analysis will be required to determine whether this segment constitutes the entire yAz binding site and which individual amino acids contribute to binding. Two types of domains were observed in mammalian Az. The C-terminal half of the molecule is required for binding to and inactivating ODC, whereas a smaller N-terminal segment that does not affect binding is required for promoting ODC degradation (22Mamroud-Kidron E.

As we demonstrate here most of the yAz sequences are important for binding to yODC, because their deletion interfered with inhibition of ODC activity and with promoting yODC degradation. Our analysis did not reveal yAz segments that are not required for yODC binding and inactivation but are required for mediating yODC degradation. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed effect is a result of misfolding caused by the deletions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the C-terminal segment of mammalian ODC encompassing the 37 most C-terminal amino acids is essential for its degradation (45Ghoda L. van Daalen Wetters T. Macrae M. Ascherman D. Coffino P. Science. 1989; 243: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 46Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Bercovich Z. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and that it constitutes a dominant degradation signal as it can be transferred to ODC related and unrelated stable proteins (44Ghoda L.

It was suggested that interaction with Az exposes the C-terminal degradation signal of mODC (24Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, while being degraded in mammalian cells in an Az- and C terminus-dependent manner, in yeast cells mODC is degraded in a C terminus-dependent but Az-independent manner (28Gandre S. Kahana C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 50Mamroud-Kidron E. Kahana C.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, yODC is rapidly degraded in yeast cells (28Gandre S. Kahana C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 50Mamroud-Kidron E. Kahana C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 51Mamroud-Kidron E. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Rom E. Kahana C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but is a stable protein when expressed in mammalian cells (28Gandre S. Kahana C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). yODC lacks a C-terminal segment that corresponds to the C-terminal degradation signal of the mammalian enzyme. As we show here, yODC remained stable when incubated in a reticulocyte lysate-based in vitro degradation reaction together with yAz, or when co-expressed in transfected cells together with yAz, even when the C-terminal degradation signal of mODC was appended to it. Addition of purified yeast 26 S proteasomes but not of mammalian 26 S proteasome to the in vitro degradation reaction promoted yAz-dependent yODC degradation. This result suggests that, although the yeast proteasome efficiently recognizes both yeast and mouse ODC (as reflected by the rapid degradation of mODC in yeast cells (50Mamroud-Kidron E. Kahana C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 51Mamroud-Kidron E. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Rom E. Kahana C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)), yODC is recognized efficiently by the yeast proteasome, but is either poorly or not recognized by the mammalian proteasome. This difference in the recognition ability of the two proteasomes may be useful for the identification of the specific proteasomal subunit that recognizes ODC and perhaps also the one recognizing polyubiquitin chains. In light of the high homology between yeast and mammalian ODCs, it is rather remarkable that mammalian and S. cerevisiae Azs are so divergent. Although this difference may underlie the poor recognition of the yAz·yODC complex by the mammalian proteasome, it is quite striking that its mechanism of action yAz resembles mAz. It was suggested that interaction with mAz imposes a conformational change on mODC, resulting in the exposure of its C-terminal proteasome recognition signal (24Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). yODC lacks a C-terminal segment that corresponds to the C-terminal destabilizing segment of the mouse enzyme, and its degradation is mediated by an N-terminal segment (28Gandre S. Kahana C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As we demonstrate here, the C-terminal destabilizing segment of mODC can replace the destabilizing segment of yODC only when appended to the N terminus, but not when appended to the C terminus of a stable yODC N-terminal deletion mutant. This suggests that, like mAz, also yAz may impose a conformational change on yODC, however, in this case the conformational alteration exposes the N terminus.

However, little is known about the structural basis of these remarkable activities of Nanog. We have previously identified an unusually strong transactivator named CD2 at its C terminus. Here we demonstrate that CD2 is required for Nanog to mediate ES cell self-renewal. Furthermore, deletion and point mutation analysis revealed that CD2 relies on at least seven aromatic amino acid residues to generate its potent transactivating activity. A mutant Nanog bearing alanine substitutions for these seven residues fails to confer LIF-independent self-renewal in mouse ES cells. Substitution of CD2 by the viral transactivator VP16 gave rise to Nanog-VP16, which is 10 times more active than wild-type Nanog in ES cells. Surprisingly, the expression of Nanog-VP16 in mouse ES cells induces differentiation and is thus unable to sustain LIF-independent self-renewal for mouse ES cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the CD2 domain of Nanog is a unique transactivator that utilizes aromatic residues to confer specific activity absolutely required for ES self-renewal.

To this end, we have focused on the transcription mechanism specified by Nanog, a gene known to sustain mouse ES cell self-renewal in the absence of LIF in culture conditions. We have defined two potent transactivators at its C terminus (2Pan G. Thomson J.A. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 10Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol.

Transfections, Western Blotting, and Reporter Assay–HEK293T cells were transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation methods. F9, P19, and CGR8 ES cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For Western blotting analysis, HEK293T cells cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates were transfected by a calcium phosphate co-precipitation method with expression plasmids (0.8 μg each) as described (11Pan G.J. Pei D.Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After transfection (24 h), the cells were washed by phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice by radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min and cleared of debris by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. After boiling with an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer for 5 min, the cell lysates were electrophoresed with 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were then blotted with 5% nonfat milk and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (1:5000), followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse (1:5000) second antibodies. The membranes were then washed extensively and developed by incubating in a solution containing nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. For reporter assays, the cells seeded in 24-well plates were transiently transfected with p5G-e1b-luciferase (0.2 μg/well) and effector plasmids (0.4 μg/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. pCMV-Renilla plasmids (0.002μg/transfection; Promega, WI) were co-transfected in each well as internal references, and the DNA concentrations for all transfections were normalized to equal amounts with the parental pCR3.1 vector. 36 h later, the cells were washed by phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by 50 μl of 1× PLB buffer (Promega, WI). Luciferase activity was measured using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a TD2020 Luminometer (Turner Design). Each transfection was carried out in duplicate and repeated at least five times. Real Time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis–2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcripted in a final volume of 20 μl as previously described (3Pan G. Li J. Zhou Y. Zheng H. Pei D.

PCRs were undertaken using the real time PCR Master Mix (SYBR GREEN) reagent kit (Toyobo), according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed in 15 μl of total volume for 45 cycles.

Puromycin (2 μg/ml; Invitrogen) was added to the medium for selection. After selection for 10 days, single clone was picked up and expanded in 12-well tissue culture plate for further Western and real time RT-PCR analysis. The CD2 of Nanog Is Required for Nanog-mediated LIF-independent ES Cell Self-renewal–Nanog was discovered based on its ability to sustain LIF-independent ES cell self-renewal, presumably by repressing the expression of genes involved in specifying the primitive endoderm lineage (5Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar, 6Chambers I.

Although the repressor function of Nanog remains to be demonstrated, we have demonstrated that Nanog encodes two potent transactivators, WR and CD2 (10Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Pan G.J. Pei D.Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because CD2 is more potent than WR in mediating transcription using the Gal4 system (10Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we wished to assess the role of CD2 in mediating LIF-independent ES cell self-renewal. We have previously generated a CD2-truncated Nanog and demonstrated that it remains active in mediating the transactivation of reporters bearing Nanog-binding sites (10Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To begin to assess the role CD2 in ES cell self-renewal, this mutant was cloned into the expression vector pPyCAGIP (a gift from Chambers (6Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar)) and stably transfected into mouse ES cells. As shown in Fig. 1A (panel 1), mouse ES cells transfected with control vector (panels a and d) underwent spontaneous differentiation in the absence of LIF (panel d versus panel a) morphologically, forming disorganized clumps of flat cells. As expected, ES cells overexpressing wild type Nanog showed pluripotent morphology in the absence of LIF (Fig. 1A, panels e versus panels b) with clones of small and compact cells (6Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ES cells expressing CD2-truncated Nanog became differentiated in the absence of LIF as the control (Fig. 1A, panels f versus panels d), suggesting that the CD2 domain is required for Nanog-mediated LIF-independent ES cell self-renewal. Representative clones from similar experiments in Fig. 1A (panel 1) were shown with higher magnification in Fig. 1A (panel 2). To further confirm the pluripotent states of the cells in Fig. 1A, we analyzed the expression levels of pluripotent markers Nanog, Oct4, and Rex1 by quantitative RT-PCR as presented in Fig. 1B. In the absence of LIF, ES cells expressing the CD2 truncation mutant did not sustain the expression of both Rex1 and Oct4, whereas ES cells expressing the wild type Nanog did (Fig. 1B). Because the primers we used for Nanog detection were designed for both endogenous and the transfected Nanog constructs in Fig. 1B (left column), we estimate that the contribution of exogenous Nanog or NanogCD2 to the overall Nanog expression levels to be ∼ 1× or 2×, respectively, in agreement with the results from Western blots shown in Fig. 1C. Together, these results demonstrate that CD2 is critical for Nanog-mediated LIF-independent ES cell self-renewal. Aromatic Amino Acids Are Critical for the Transactivaiton Function of CD2–We then wished to determine the structural requirement for CD2 transactivation activity. To discern the critical subdomain or residues, we made serial deletions of CD2 to generate CD2(Δ7), CD2(Δ10), CD2(Δ13), and CD2(Δ20) in fusion forms to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4, respectively (Fig. 2A). These constructs were then evaluated with a reporter construct, p5G-elb-luciferase as described (10Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Pan G.J. Pei D.Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (“Methods and Materials”), into HEK293T, mouse ES cells, F9 germ tumor cells, and P19 germ tumor cells, respectively, and their activities were quantified as described (11Pan G.J. Pei D.Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and presented in Fig. 2B. These results suggest that the sequence 50LFL may play a critical role in CD2 activity (CD2(Δ13) versus CD2(Δ10)), whereas the deletion of 53NYS also reduces its activity significantly. We then performed alanine substitution individually or in combination for the 50LFLNYS region as illustrated in Fig. 2A (lower panel). Their corresponding activities were measured as in Fig. 2B and presented in Fig. 2C. Consistent with the deletion data in Fig. 2B, substitutions at LFL resulted in almost complete loss of transactivation activity, whereas substitutions at NYS had about 40% reduction (Fig. 2C). Individual substitution at Leu50, Leu52, or Phe51 led to progressive reduction of activity (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, F9 cells appeared to be more sensitive toward these substitutions (Fig. 2C). All of these constructs were well expressed at the protein level as demonstrated in Fig. 2 (D and E). Together, these results defined the critical role of 50LFL, particularly Phe51 in CD2 activity. We then focused on Phe51 and performed a systematic substitution to determine which amino acid residue is preferred at this position. We mutated Phe51 into the rest of the amino acid family, including aromatic, hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and charged amino acids as shown in Fig. 3A. The activity of each substitution was determined in HEK293T, mES, F9, and P19 cells as described in Fig. 2 and presented in Fig. 3 (C–F), and summarized in Fig. 3B. Interestingly, tryptophan, an aromatic residue, was able to replace Phe51 completely, generating equal or more robust activity in all four cell lines tested. Substitution of Phe51 with Leu, Ile, or Tyr resulted in CD2 with activities ranging from 50 to 100% of the wild type transactivator (Fig. 3B). Other substitutions led to more severe reduction of activity such as Phe → Glu or Phe → Lys (Fig. 3, B–F). Western blot analysis revealed similar levels of expression of these constructs (Fig. 3G). Based on these results, we conclude that the amino acid at Phe51 should be an aromatic residue. To define additional structural feature for CD2, we performed N-terminal deletions and alanine substitutions as illustrated in Fig. 4A. Transactivation activity data presented in Fig. 4B revealed a progressive loss of activity between Δ 6 to Δ20. The deletion mutant (Δ20)CD2 lost almost all of its activity (Fig. 4B). Within the 20-amino acid segment deleted, there are two Phe residues and one Tyr residue that may contribute to the transactivating activity of CD2. To test this idea, we mutated all three of these residues to Ala as illustrated in Fig. 4A and measured the activity as presented in Fig. 4C. All three individual substitutions resulted in significant reduction of CD2 activity, whereas the combined mutation CD2-F8F12Y16Mu lost its activity entirely (Fig. 4C), suggesting that these three aromatic residues play a critical role in maintaining CD2 activity. Requirement of Aromatic Residues in CD2 for LIF-independent ES Cell Self-renewal–Aromatic residues have been demonstrated to play a critical role in mediating the transactivation function of the potent transactivator VP16 (12Regier J.L. Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Our mutagenesis studies presented above also indicate that the aromatic residues within CD2 are of critical importance in mediating its transactivation function. As shown in Fig. 1, CD2 is required for Nanog to mediate ES cell self-renewal. So, we tested the role of these aromatic residues in Nanog-mediated ES cell self-renewal. First, we designed three CD2 mutants carrying multiple substitutions as shown in Fig. 5A, CD2-mu1 with alanine substitutions at positions Phe8-Phe12-Tyr16, Phe23-Phe42, and Leu50-Phe51-Leu52; CD2-mu2 with alanine substitutions of the seven aromatic amino acids at positions Phe8, Phe12, Tyr16, Phe23, Phe42, Phe51, and Tyr54; and CD2-F/Y-W with tryptophan substitutions of the seven aromatic amino acids at the same positions as CD2-mu2. Both alanine substitution mutants, CD2-mu1 and CD2-mu2, are inactive in the Gal4 reporter assay system as shown in Fig. 5B in all four different cell types. However, the tryptophan substitution mutant CD2-F/Y-W remains almost equal activity as wild type CD2 in all three pluoripotent cell types (F9, P19, and mES), but with less activity in HEK293T as shown in Fig. 5D. We then engineered all three mutants back into the full-length Nanog and then inserted these fragments into both PCR3.1-FLAG and pPyCAGIP expression vectors as shown in Fig. 5F. Employing p5N, which harbors five copies of the Nanog-binding site, as a reporter (described in Fig. 5F) (10Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we assayed the transactivation activity of these mutants in mES cells. Consistent with the results in Gal4 reporter system, N3, a Nanog mutant with CD2 truncated, is ∼50%, Nanog-CD2-mu1 and Nanog-CD2-mu2 ∼70%, and Nanog-CD2-F/Y-W ∼100% as wild type Nanog (Fig. 5G). These constructs generated stable protein products as revealed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5H). We then generated stable clones in ES cells. Representative clones from ES cell carrying control vector, Nanog, Nanog-CD2-mu1, Nanog-CD2-mu2, and Nanog-CD2-F/Y-W were grown in the absence or presence of LIF (Fig. 5I, panels 1 and 2) and then analyzed for Nanog expression by Western blotting (Fig. 5K). As shown in Fig. 5K, the transgenes were expressed in the ES cell clones, especially in the absence of LIF (lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10) as expected. We then tested whether Nanog-CD2-mu1, -mu2, and -F/Y-W are able to sustain ES cell self-renewal in the absence of LIF. As shown in Fig. 5I, ES cells carrying the Nanog and Nanog-CD2-F/Y-W transgene remain pluripotent morphologically, whereas those carrying Nannog-CD2-mu1 and -mu2 failed to maintain their pluripotent morphology. The morphological phenotypes observed in Fig. 5I were corroborated by the expression of pluripotent markers such as Nanog, Oct4, and Rex-1 as measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5J). Based on these observations, we conclude that Nanog relies on the aromatic residues in the CD2 transactivation domain to maintain ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency.FIGURE 5Substitution of aromatic residues in CD2 by Ala, but not Trp, abolished the transactivation activity of CD2 and its self-renewal activity of Nanog. A, schematic illustration of CD2 and its aromatic residue substitution mutants. B and D, transcription activity of CD2 and those mutants in A assayed in the Gal4-reporter system in four cell lines as indicated.

K, cell lysates of cells described in I were isolated with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and then analyzed by Western blot (WB) with anti-Nanog antibody and anti-actin antibody (as internal reference), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Self-renewing Activity of CD2 Cannot Be Substituted by VP16–We have shown previously, based on the Gal4 reporter system, that CD2 is almost as active as VP16 (10Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Pan G.J. Pei D.Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To see whether VP16 is capable of substituting the activity of CD2 in both transactivation activity and pluripotency, we engineered Nanog-VP16 as shown in Fig. 6A. Employing the p5N reporter system, this mutant reveals a ∼12-fold activity compared with wild type Nanog in mouse ES cells (shown in Fig. 6C). However, when we introduced the pPyCAGIP-Nanog-VP16 into mES cells as described in Fig. 1, it fails to sustain ES cell self-renewal and but induces ES cells differentiation morphologically (shown in Fig. 6B). Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 6D revealed that the transgene of Nanog-VP16 is well expressed (upper band), whereas the endogenous Nanog declined in expression even in the presence of LIF. Accordingly, the expression of differentiation markers were induced by Nanog-VP16 based on both RT-PCR (Fig. 6E) and quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 6F) analyses. Surprisingly, Nanog-VP16 appears to have induced the ES cells differentiating into primitive endoderm, mesoderm, and even trophectoderm based on these markers. These results suggest that CD2 plays an critical role in mediating Nanog-dependent ES cells self-renewal, which may not be substituted by other transactivation domain. Here we demonstrate that 1) the CD2, a strong transactivator at the C terminus of Nanog, is required for Nanog-mediated ES cell self-renewal; 2) the transactivation activity of CD2 is dependent on aromatic residues; and 3) the self-renewing activity of CD2 cannot be substituted by VP16. These findings are significant for the following reasons: 1) Although Nanog is recognized as a key regulator of ES cell pluripotency and its overexpression alone can sustain ES cell self-renewal independent of LIF, the mechanism of action for Nanog remains undefined. We first reported the transactivation function of Nanog but did not establish the role of transactivation function of Nanog in stem cell self-renewal. In this report, we presented evidence that CD2 activity is required for Nanog mediated self-renewal of ES cells. Our results from Nanog-VP16 appear to suggest that CD2 function in ES cell self-renewal is unique and cannot be replaced by other transactivation domains (Fig. 6). Thus, further delineation of downstream genes regulated by CD2 would greatly enhance our understanding of Nanog-mediated ES cell self-renewal. 2) We were surprised that the most critical residues within CD2 are aromatic residues. As pointed out in our previous reports, CD2 does not have any known structural features found in other transactivation domains and thus may regulate transcription through a distinct mechanism. Our approaches involving N- and C-terminal deletion analysis coupled with point mutagenesis revealed that aromatic residues play a critical role in sustaining CD2 activities. Interestingly, VP16, the most potent transactivator reported so far, utilizes aromatic residues to mediate strong transcription activity (12Regier J.L. Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although CD2 and VP16 share little sequence homology, the similar requirement for aromatic residues suggests that they may share a common organizing principle based on aromatic residues. Structural determination of CD2 and VP16 may help to confirm this prediction. 3) By mutating the aromatic residues in CD2, we have generated a Nanog mutant that cannot sustain LIF-independent self-renewal yet does not interfere with the activity of endogenous Nanog. One would have expected that Nanog-CD2-mu1 or -mu2 behave as dominant negative mutants as we demonstrated for Oct4 and Sox2. ES cells expressing both mutants remain pluripotent in the presence of LIF, suggesting that endogenous Nanog functions well in the presence of these two mutants. Our experimental approach exploits the unique property of Nanog in its ability to sustain ES cell self-renewal in the absence of LIF upon overexpression. By quantitative RT-PCR, we estimated that the wild type Nanog transgene is expressed at ∼1× the endogenous level, whereas the mutants at ∼2–3× the endogenous genes (Fig. 1B). Apparently, the level of expression contributed from the wild type Nanog transgene is sufficient to maintain the pluripotency of ES cells in the absence of LIF for the duration of our assay. Interestingly, these ES cells can be induced to undergo differentiation in the presence of RA (data not shown), suggesting that the amount of Nanog contributed by the transgene in our experimental system is insufficient to prevent ES cell differentiation. This observation is in contrast to those originally reported by Chambers et al. (6Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar) and Matsui et al. (5Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may reflect the expression levels of the transgene delivered by the different expression systems (episomal versus integrated). The episome strategy employed by Chambers et al. and Matsui et al. in general can deliver much stronger expression than the integrated approach we adopted. Nevertheless, our results suggest that Nanog function can be analyzed in wild type ES cells upon overexpression at ∼1× that of endogenous level."
https://openalex.org/W1988749650,"Attempts to promote neuronal survival and repair with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) have met with limited success. The variability of results obtained with CNTF may, in part, reflect the fact that some of the biological actions of the cytokine are mediated by a complex formed between CNTF and its specific receptor, CNTFRα, which exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. In this study, we compared the actions of CNTF alone and CNTF complexed with soluble CNTFRα (hereafter termed “Complex”) on neuronal survival and growth. Although CNTF alone produced limited effects, Complex protected against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity via gap junction-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Further examination revealed that only Complex promoted neurite outgrowth. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that, compared with CNTF alone, Complex differentially regulates several neuroprotective and neurotrophic genes. Collectively, these findings indicate that CNTF exerts more robust effects on neuronal survival and growth when applied in combination with its soluble receptor.

Landa K.B. Manthorpe M. Varon S. Science. 1979; 204: 1434-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). CNTF has been termed a “brain injury” cytokine based on several observations. First, humans and mice lacking CNTF appear normal, indicating that the cytokine is not essential for normal development or maintenance (2Masu Y. Wolf E. Holtmann B. Sendtner M. Brem G. Thoenen H. Nature. 1993; 365: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Second, the level of CNTF in astrocytes increases dramatically in response to injury (3Ip N.Y. Wiegand S.J. Morse J. Rudge J.S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 4Lee M.Y. Deller T. Kirsch M. Frotscher M. Hofmann H.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, CNTF is normally produced as a nonsecreted cytokine and is only released when the membrane integrity of astrocytes or Schwann cells becomes compromised, e.g. in response to injury (5Nieto-Sampedro M. Lewis E.R. Cotman C.W. Manthorpe M. Skaper S.D. Barbin G. Longo F.M. Varon S. Science. 1982; 217: 860-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 6Rudge J.S. Alderson R.F. Pasnikowski E.

Thoenen H. Nature. 1989; 342: 920-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Fourth, although the expression of the specific receptor for CNTF, termed CNTFRα, is normally restricted to the plasma membrane of neurons (8Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Valenzuela D.M. Wong V.V. Furth M.E. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1991; 253: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), surviving astrocytes in the penumbra of an injury also begin to express CNTFRα (9Park C.K. Ju W.K.

Although the above considerations have prompted interest in CNTF as a therapeutic agent against neuronal injury and neurodegenerative diseases, it has become apparent that the administration of exogenous CNTF elicits variable and, in any case, only weak neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects in experimental animals and humans (11Bloch J. Bachoud-Levi A.C. Deglon N. Lefaucheur J.P. Winkel L. Palfi S. Nguyen J.P. Bourdet C. Gaura V. Remy P. Brugieres P. Boisse M.F. Baudic S. Cesaro P. Hantraye P. Aebischer P. Peschanski M. Hum.

Imhof H.G. Yonekawa Y. Acta Neurochir. 1996; 138: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The limited therapeutic efficacy of CNTF as a neuroprotective and neuroregenerative agent may be consequent upon the administration of the cytokine without the soluble form of its specific receptor. Although CNTFRα is normally localized to the neuronal plasma membrane, it is anchored there by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage that is sensitive to proteolysis and phospholipase-C-mediated cleavage, and following injury, it is released into the extracellular space as a soluble component (14Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Ip N.Y. Stahl N. Scherer S. Farruggella T. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Panayotatos N. Gascan H. Science. 1993; 259: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 15Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 139-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Indeed, soluble CNTFRα has been identified in proximity to injured tissue and in the urine of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (4Lee M.Y. Deller T. Kirsch M. Frotscher M. Hofmann H.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rudge J.S. Li Y. Pasnikowski E.M. Mattsson K. Pan L. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Lindsay R.M. Ip N.Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Following injury-induced release, CNTF and soluble CNTFRα together form a heterodimer (hereafter referred to as “Complex”) that can interact with the ubiquitously expressed β-receptor subunits, glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor β (LIFRβ) (14Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Ip N.Y. Stahl N. Scherer S. Farruggella T. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Panayotatos N. Gascan H. Science. 1993; 259: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 17Ozog M.A. Bechberger J.F. Naus C.C. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3544-3548PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ozog M.A. Bernier S.M. Bates D.C. Chatterjee B. Lo C.W. Naus C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4761-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The subsequent heterodimerization of gp130 and LIFRβ activates several signaling cascades, including the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway (19Alonzi T. Middleton G. Wyatt S. Buchman V. Betz U.A. Muller W. Musiani P. Poli V. Davies A.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently found that Complex increases both the expression of the gap junctional constituent connexin43 and intercellular coupling in glia via trans-signaling (17Ozog M.A. Bechberger J.F. Naus C.C. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3544-3548PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ozog M.A. Bernier S.M. Bates D.C. Chatterjee B. Lo C.W. Naus C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4761-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the term used to describe the ability of a ligand to bind a soluble receptor (α subunit), which subsequently associates with the β subunits of the receptor on cells that do not normally express the α-receptor of the ligand (20Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In light of the limited efficacy of CNTF alone as a neuroprotective and neurotrophic agent, and increasing evidence that connexins and gap junctions elicit neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects (21Blanc E.M. Bruce-Keller A.J. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 958-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 22Lin J.H. Yang J. Liu S. Takano T. Wang X. Gao Q. Willecke K. Nedergaard M. J.

Messing A. Heinemann U. Willecke K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 766-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in this study we examined the effects of exogenous CNTF, applied alone or in combination with its soluble receptor CNTFRα, on excitotoxic cell death, neuronal survival, and neuronal development. Primary co-cultures of murine cortical astrocytes and neurons were prepared as described previously (25Ozog M.A. Siushansian R. Naus C.C. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, astrocyte cultures were established from the cortices of 1-day-old CD-1 mouse pups and plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated (50 μg/ml) 6-well plates. Culture medium was replaced every 3 days. Because reactive and newly plated (reactive-like) astrocytes express CNTFRα, we matured our astrocytes in vitro for 6 weeks to obtain quiescent cultures (18Ozog M.A. Bernier S.M. Bates D.C. Chatterjee B. Lo C.W. Naus C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4761-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Neurons, obtained from the neocortices of embryonic CD-1 mice aged 16 days gestation, were then seeded on top of the astrocytes and allowed to settle for 2 h before replacing the medium with Medium I (54 ml of Neurobasal Medium, 36 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, 1 ml of B-27 supplements; Invitrogen). On day 4, 2 μm cytosine arabinoside was added during a fresh medium change for 24 h. Thereafter, two-thirds of the conditioned medium was replaced every 3 days with fresh Medium I. Co-cultures were maintained for 2 weeks prior to experiments to ensure expression of functional glutamate receptors by the neurons (27Dugan L.L. Bruno V.M. Amagasu S.M. Giffard R.G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4545-4555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a manner similar to that described above, neurons were seeded directly onto either PDL (50 μg/ml)/laminin-coated (100 μg/ml) transwells (neurite outgrowth quantification assay kit; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or PDL/laminin-coated 2-well chamber slides (BD Biosciences/Fisher) at 2.5 × 105 cells per chamber. Two h after cell plating, the medium was replaced with serum-free Medium I. Cultures maintained for 13 days in vitro (DIV) were treated with cytosine arabinoside as described above. Astroglial contamination of the cultures was <5%, as assessed by direct morphological analysis and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity. Rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Differentiation of the PC12 cells was induced by exposure to serum-reduced medium (1% horse serum, 1% fetal bovine serum) supplemented with NGF (50 ng/ml; Sigma) for 72 h. Prior to the application of glutamate, neuron-astrocyte co-cultures were pretreated with vehicle (PBS), CNTF (20 ng/ml; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), soluble CNTFRα (200 ng/ml; R & D Systems), or Complex (20 ng/ml CNTF + 200 ng/ml CNTFRα, an ∼1:5 molar ratio to favor the association of CNTF with soluble CNTFRα) (18Ozog M.A. Bernier S.M. Bates D.C. Chatterjee B. Lo C.W. Naus C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4761-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with a fresh medium change every 24 h for 72 h. In some experiments, 24 h following the final pretreatment, the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (CBX; 25 μm; Sigma), its inactive analogue glycyrrhizic acid (GZA; 25 μm; Sigma), or solvent (H2O) was added to the co-cultures for 1 h as described previously (25Ozog M.A. Siushansian R. Naus C.C. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The co-cultures were then bathed in Earle's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing glutamate (1 mm) for 3 h. For a comparative control, selected sister cultures were treated similarly but with the omission of glutamate. Cells were then maintained in fresh Medium I for 24 h and subsequently assessed for cell viability (see below). Neuron-enriched cultures were exposed to vehicle, CNTF, CNTFRα, or Complex for 3 days starting at either 2 h (hereafter termed “3 DIV” cultures) or 10 days (“10 + 3 DIV” cultures) after initial plating. A fresh medium change was performed every 24 h during treatments. The JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades were inhibited with 50 μm AG490 (Calbiochem), 10 μm U0126 (Promega, Madison, WI), and 20 μm LY294002 (Calbiochem), respectively. The inhibitors were applied 45 min prior to and throughout the treatment of neurons with vehicle or Complex. The inhibitors were applied at concentrations commonly used by others on neuronal cells in vitro and adequately blocked the signaling pathways as assessed by substrate phosphorylation detection on control immunoblots (data not shown). To examine if CNTF, CNTFRα, or Complex induced or enhanced neuronal differentiation, undifferentiated PC12 cells were exposed to the test agent in place of NGF for 3 days or were co-treated with NGF and the test agent for 24 h, respectively. Cell survival was determined by measuring LDH content (Sigma) within the conditioned medium, the ability of the cells to exclude propidium idodide (PI), as well as the absence of cleaved caspase3 (see below) and/or TUNEL (DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System; Promega). RNA Isolation—Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at -80 °C until used for microarray hybridization, real time PCR, or reverse transcription (RT)-PCR experiments. Microarray Hybridization—RNA samples were processed for microarray hybridization as described previously by Treister et al. (28Treister N.S. Richards S.M. Lombardi M.J. Rowley P. Jensen R.V. Sullivan D.A. J. Dent. Res. 2005; 84: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA with the aid of CodeLink expression assay reagent kits (Amersham Biosciences). Target cRNA product was subsequently acquired using RNeasy kits (Qiagen), fragmented, and applied to a Codelink Mouse Uniset I microarrays (Amersham Biosciences) containing ∼10,000 mouse oligonucleotide gene probes. Positive signals on the arrays were detected with streptavidin-Alexa 647 and scanned using ScanArray Express software and a ScanArray Express HT scanner. Microarray images were analyzed using CodeLink image and data analysis software. Experiments were carried out in duplicate, with consistent results. Values presented consist of the mean ratio of normalized intensities of the different treatment regimens as described, and experiments were carried out in duplicate. The Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base (Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood City, CA) was used to assess gene expression in the context of regulatory clusters. Real Time PCR—Real time PCR was used to verify the differential expression of selected genes in a manner similar to that described by James et al. (29James C.G. Appleton C.T. Ulici V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5316-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, specific target primers and probe sets (Taqman Assays-on-Demand, Applied Biosystems), their corresponding probes, and template RNA were combined with TaqMan (Universal PCR Mastermix, No AmpErase UNG, Applied Biosystems). Amplified target sequences were detected with the ABI Prism 7500 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression values were corrected using 18 S RNA as the endogenous control. RT-PCR—Isolated RNA was subjected to RT-PCR as described previously (18Ozog M.A. Bernier S.M. Bates D.C. Chatterjee B. Lo C.W. Naus C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4761-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The RT product was amplified in the presence of primers for CNTF (30Malgrange B. Rogister B. Lefebvre P.P. Mazy-Servais C. Welcher A.A. Bonnet C. Hsu R.Y. Rigo J.M. De Water Van T.R. Moonen G. Neurochem. Res. 1998; 23: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), CNTFRα (30Malgrange B. Rogister B. Lefebvre P.P.

Uc E.Y. Moser D.R. Lim R. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and LIFRβ (32Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Taga T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed in parallel in the absence of the reverse transcriptase enzyme and did not produce any products. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, processed as described previously (18Ozog M.A. Bernier S.M. Bates D.C. Chatterjee B. Lo C.W. Naus C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4761-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and labeled with antibodies against MAP2 and neurofilament 200 (Sigma), pSTAT3 (Tyr-705; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), or cleaved caspase3 (Cell Signaling), with subsequent Alexa- and fluorescein-conjugated secondary IgG antibody application (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Immunolabeled cells were mounted in ProLong Gold containing DAPI (Molecular Probes Inc.), viewed on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope, and analyzed using AxioVision 4.2 software. Specificity of antibody labeling was assessed by omitting the primary antibody from the labeling protocol. PC12 cells were stained with fluorescently tagged wheat germ agglutinin (Molecular Probes) to define cell limits, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and processed as described above. Neuron-enriched cultures were seeded in 6-well PDL/laminin-coated culture plates (BD Biosciences) and were maintained in culture for 24 h prior to a 15-min exposure to vehicle or Complex. Protein was harvested and processed as described previously (18Ozog M.A. Bernier S.M. Bates D.C. Chatterjee B. Lo C.W. Naus C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4761-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted against pSTAT3 (Tyr-705; Cell Signaling). To normalize protein loading, bound antibodies were stripped, and the blot was probed for total STAT3 (Cell Signaling). Densitometric analyses of immunoblot signals on Kodak X-Omat x-ray film were performed using Scion Image software (Scion, Frederick, MD). Neurite outgrowth was analyzed in two ways. Indirect measurements were performed on neurons treated with agents for 3 days using the neurite outgrowth quantification assay kit (Chemicon) (33Smit M. Leng J. Klemke R.L. BioTechniques. 2003; 35: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Direct morphometric analyses were conducted on individual MAP2-immunolabeled neurons. Because MAP2 immunoreactivity can be observed in both dendrites and axons in developing neurons (34Dehmelt L. Halpain S. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), no attempt was made to differentiate dendrites from axons; neurofilament 200 immunolabeling was employed only to confirm that axons of the neurons used for analyses were not in contact with neighboring cells. The total number of neurites was estimated by counting the tip ends of all MAP2-positive neurites elaborated by a single neuron. The cumulative length of primary neurites was the sum of the lengths of all neurites ≥8 μm long that extended directly from the soma. A branching point was defined as a point at which a neurite ≥8 μm in length extended from another neurite; the ratio of the sum of the number of branching points on a single neuron to the sum of the number of primary neurites on that neuron defined the branching ratio. Each experiment was performed on at least four different batches of PC12 cells or four different culture preparations obtained from different litters of mice. Neurite outgrowth measurements were performed on at least 16 neurons per treatment group from each culture preparation, for a total of at least 64 neurons per treatment group. For assessment of PI, TUNEL, and cleaved caspase3 labeling, at least eight randomly selected areas from each culture per treatment group were used. Data are presented as means ± S.E., and the results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Complex Induces Neuroprotection in Vitro—We have reported previously that gap junctions exert a neuroprotective effect against glutamate excitotoxicity and that Complex, but not CNTF alone, up-regulates functional gap junctional coupling (18Ozog M.A. Bernier S.M. Bates D.C. Chatterjee B. Lo C.W. Naus C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4761-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Ozog M.A. Siushansian R. Naus C.C. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Initially, therefore, we sought to determine whether pretreating neuron-astrocyte co-cultures with Complex can reduce glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and whether this effect is dependent on gap junctional communication. As glutamate-mediated cell death can proceed by both necrosis and apoptosis (35Dirnagl U. Iadecola C. Moskowitz M.A. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 391-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3185) Google Scholar), the effects of Complex on neuronal viability were assessed by measuring the release of LDH into the extracellular space, the ability of cells to exclude the cationic dye PI, the presence of cleaved caspase3, and TUNEL. Under control conditions, pretreatment of neuron-astrocyte co-cultures with CNTFRα, CNTF, or Complex did not significantly alter LDH release (Fig. 1), PI staining (Fig. 2), or TUNEL (Fig. 2), compared with vehicle pretreatment alone. As expected, application of 1 mm glutamate to the co-cultures for 3 h resulted in substantial increases in LDH release (p < 0.001; Fig. 1) as well as PI staining and TUNEL (p < 0.01 in both cases; Fig. 2) at 24 h post-insult. Whereas pretreatment of co-cultures with CNTFRα alone failed to significantly alter glutamate-induced cell death (Figs. 1 and 2), pretreatment with CNTF alone significantly reduced TUNEL (p < 0.001; Fig. 2) but not LDH release (p > 0.05; Fig. 1) or PI staining (p > 0.05; Fig. 2). In contrast, Complex pretreatment significantly reduced glutamate-induced cell death as measured in all three cell viability assays (p < 0.01 or less in all cases; Figs. 1 and 2). Together, these results indicate that Complex affords greater protection against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity than either CNTF or CNTFRα alone.FIGURE 2Complex reduces both propidium iodide staining and TUNEL in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures treated with 1 mm glutamate for 3 h.

Several cells can be identified as being labeled for both markers (overlaid in yellow). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Bars = 100 μm. A reduction in glutamate-induced TUNEL can be seen in CNTF pretreated cultures compared with vehicle or CNTFRα pretreatments in both the absence and presence of CBX. Complex further reduced PI staining and TUNEL under each condition. B, when quantified, CNTF significantly reduced TUNEL but not PI staining in glutamate-treated cultures in both the absence and presence of CBX, as compared with vehicle and CNTFRα pretreatments. Pretreatment with Complex in the absence of CBX significantly reduced glutamate-mediated PI staining compared with vehicle, CNTFRα, and CNTF pretreatments and significantly reduced TUNEL compared with vehicle and CNTFRα pretreatments. In the presence of CBX, Complex significantly reduced both PI staining and TUNEL compared with all other agents. The number of PI-stained and TUNEL-labeled cells is expressed as a percentage of total cells within the same field examined. #, p < 0.05; ^, p < 0.01; and *, p < 0.001 compared with other treatments as indicated.

These enzymes catalyze the non-oxidative decarboxylation of α-keto acids to aldehydes. The elementary steps of the catalytic cycle of these enzymes are identical. Initially, the cofactor is activated by deprotonation of its C2 atom. Subsequently, the generated cofactor ylide attacks the α-carbonyl atom of the substrate, yielding a tetrahedral pre-decarboxylation intermediate. This intermediate is decarboxylated, resulting in the second resonance-stabilized carbanion/enamine intermediate. Finally, the enamine intermediate is protonated, and the reaction product (aldehyde) is released (1Schellenberger A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). thiamine diphosphate ThDP-dependent α-keto acid decarboxylase from M. tuberculosis pyruvate decarboxylase indole PDC (EC 4.1.1.74) IPDC from Enter-obacter cloacae PDC from S. cerevisiae (EC 4.1.1.1) PDC from K. lactis ThDP-dependent α-keto acid decarboxylase from S. cerevisiae 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Based on their substrate specificity, non-oxidative ThDP-dependent α-keto acid decarboxylases yielding aldehydes can be subdivided into various groups. As a rule, substrate specificity reflects the biological function of the enzyme. Pyruvate decarboxylases (PDCs) function in the alcoholic fermentation and convert pyruvate to acetaldehyde (2Neuberg C. Karczag L. Biochem. Z. 1911; 36: 68-75Google Scholar). Benzoylformate decarboxylases are found in many microorganisms and catalyze the decarboxylation of benzoylformate to benzaldehyde, the third reaction in the mandelate pathway (3Hegeman G.D. J.

Indolepyruvate decarboxylases (IPDCs) and phenylpyruvate decarboxylases are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of the plant hormones indoleacetic acid and phenylacetic acid, which are derived from the aromatic amino acids tryptophan and phenylalanine, respectively (5Koga J.

In addition to α-keto acids derived from branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), aromatic α-keto acids are used as substrates, too (7Yep A. Kenyon G.L. McLeish M.J. Bioorg.

The first step of the Ehrlich pathway is the transamination of amino acids to their corresponding α-keto acids. Subsequently, the α-keto acids are decarboxylated to aldehydes. This quasi-irreversible reaction is catalyzed by a ThDP-dependent α-keto acid decarboxylase, which converts a broad spectrum of substrates (8Smit B.A. van Hylckama Vlieg J.E.T. Engels W.J. Meijer L.

Depending on the redox state of the cell, aldehydes are either oxidized to fusel acids or reduced to fusel alcohols (Fig. 1). The Ehrlich pathway, also denoted as amino acid fermentation, is best investigated in yeast (9Vuralhan Z. Luttik M.A. Tai S.L. Boer V.M. Morais M.A. Schipper D. Almering M.J. Kotter P. Dickinson J.R.

However, a poor correlation between the transcription level and enzyme activity in cell free extracts indicated that the ARO10 activity is not solely regulated by the amount of enzyme, and an additional posttranscriptional regulation of the decarboxylase activity was proposed (9Vuralhan Z.

Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation mechanisms are also described for some pyruvate decarboxylases, which are key enzymes in the anaerobic fermentation of glucose, yielding ethanol and carbon dioxide. It was shown that expression of PDC from Kluyveromyces lactis (KlPDC) is induced by glucose and low oxygen concentrations at the transcriptional level (12Breunig K.D. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Bianchi M.M.

Whereas transcriptional regulation requires time and a high energy input, allosteric regulation is a short-term and quick response to fluctuating conditions in the cell. The molecular basis of substrate activation has long been studied for PDCs from yeast. One of the basic kinetic models of substrate activation of PDCs consists of two steps and describes the rapid binding of an activator molecule to the regulatory site, which triggers the slow isomerization of an inactive enzyme to a catalytically active enzyme (15Hübner G. Weidhase R. Schellenberger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Alvarez F.J. Ermer J. Hübner G. Schellenberger A. Schowen R.L. J. Am. Chem.

A series of kinetic investigations on ScPDC variants were conducted to establish a signal transfer pathway from the substrate bound at the regulatory site to the cofactor ThDP at the active site (27Baburina I.

Another kinetic model, based on extensive studies on the pH dependence of activation, favors the existence of various activated enzyme states (32Sergienko E.A. Jordan F.

For an excellent review on PDC activation, see Schowen (34Schowen R.L. Isotopes Environ. Health Stud. 2007; 43: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In this study we provide kinetic evidence that a ThDP-dependent α-keto acid decarboxylase, which participates in amino acid degradation via the Ehrlich pathway, is subject to allosteric activation. We demonstrate that α-keto acids and, most importantly, also the corresponding amino acids are allosteric activators of enzyme activity. Binding of amino acids at the regulatory site and binding of substrates at the active site show positive cooperativity. To determine which elementary steps in MtKDC catalysis are affected by amino acids, the cofactor activation and distribution of reaction intermediates was analyzed. Eventually, implications for other non-oxidative ThDP-dependent α-keto acid decarboxylases are discussed. Reagents—All substrates (except α-ketovalerate and α-ketocaproate), ThDP, d-amino acids, and alcohol dehydrogenase from yeast and horse liver were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and Fluka (Seelze, Germany). l-Amino acids and NADH were obtained from AppliChem (Darmstadt). Synthesis of α-ketovalerate and α-ketocaproate were performed according to Fischer (35Fischer G. Investigations on Structure and Reactivity of Alpha-keto Acids and Alpha-keto Amides. Doctoral dissertation, Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. 1971; Google Scholar). Cloning—Genomic DNA from M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv was used as the PCR template. The following gene-specific primers containing 5′-NdeI and 3′-HindIII restriction sites (underlined in the primer sequence) were designed. An additional GCT codon was introduced in the forward primer 5′-AAAACATATGGCTGTGACACCCCAGAAGAGCGATGCCTGCAG-3′ to increase the expression efficiency. The reverse primer 5′-AAAAAAGCTTTTATCACTGCGGCGCCATGGATCCCACGAGTTGG-3′ contains one extra stop codon to suppress the production of the C-terminal His6 tag included in the cloning vector. The amplified rv0853c gene was cloned into the pCR-BluntII TOPO vector and transformed into One Shot TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was isolated, and the identity of the cloned fragment was confirmed by sequencing. MtKDC coding plasmid DNA was finally digested and ligated into the NdeI/HindIII restriction sites of expression vector pET22b(+) (Novagen, Darmstadt). Protein Expression and Inclusion Body Isolation—For gene expression, Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Novagen) transformants were grown at 30 °C in 2× YT medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Gene expression was induced at an A600 of 0.8–1.0 by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after 8 h, flash-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Although various growth conditions have been tested (varying temperature and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside concentration using various E. coli expression strains), formation of inclusion bodies could not be prevented. Inclusion bodies were isolated as described by Rudolph et al. (36Rudolph R. Böhm G. Lilie H. Jaenicke R. Folding proteins.in: Creighton T.E. Protein Function, a Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 55-99Google Scholar). Inclusion Body Solubilization, Refolding, and Purification—Inclusion bodies were suspended in 8 m urea, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm dithioerythritol, and 1 mm EDTA and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The remaining insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (25 min, 70,000 × g). Denatured protein was dialyzed twice against 6 m urea, 100 mm Tris/HCl pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. Insoluble material was again separated by centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted to 2 mg/ml with 6 m urea, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA and refolded while dialyzing against 50 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithioerythritol. After refolding, 200 mm ammonium sulfate was added, and the solution was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The precipitated protein was separated by centrifugation, and the supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithioerythritol. The refolded protein was then applied to an ion exchange column (Fractogel TMAE, column 26 × 200 mm). Elution was performed using a linear gradient of 180 ml of 0–50% 500 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The MtKDC-containing fractions, eluting at 100–200 mm NaCl, were pooled and concentrated. MtKDC was further purified to >95% homogeneity by gel filtration on Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare, column 16 × 600 mm), equilibrated with 50 mm Mes/NaOH, pH 6.5, and 150 mm ammonium sulfate. The identity of the protein was confirmed by combination of tryptic digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Characterization of Substrate Derivatives—Keto-enol tautomerism of α-ketoisocaproate and α-ketoisovalerate, dissolved in 100 mm acetate, pH 6.0, and 10% (v/v) deuterium oxide, was investigated by 1H NMR (H,H COSY) and 13C NMR (13C,1H HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum correlation), Attached Proton Test). The amount of keto form, enol form, and hydrate form was deduced from the peak areas of the 1H NMR spectra. All experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance ARX 400 NMR spectrometer (supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). Protein Concentration—Samples containing ThDP were determined with Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Otherwise, the protein concentration was calculated from UV spectra using the calculated molar extinction coefficient of 55,350 m–1·cm–1 at 280 nm for the MtKDC monomer (see ExPASy). Kinetic Measurements—Measurements including 1H NMR experiments were performed at 30 °C in 100 mm Mes/NaOH, pH 6.5. The decarboxylation of pyruvate, α-ketobutyrate, α-ketovalerate, and α-ketocaproate was monitored using a coupled enzymatic assay with alcohol dehydrogenase from yeast as the auxiliary enzyme (4Weiss P.M. Garcia G.A. Kenyon G.L. Cleland W.W. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2197-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39Holzer H. Schultz G. Villar-Palasi C. Jüntgen-Sell J. Biochem. Z. 1956; 327: 331-344PubMed Google Scholar). For the aromatic α-keto acids indolepyruvate, phenylpyruvate, and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, alcohol dehydrogenase from horse liver was used as auxiliary enzyme (40Schütz A. Golbik R. Tittmann K. Svergun D.I. Koch M.H.J. Hübner G. König S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2322-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The conversion of NADH was followed at 340 and 366 nm. The decarboxylation of the branched-chain α-keto acids (α-ketovalerate, α-keto-β-methylvalerate, and α-ketoisocaproate) was measured by using a direct assay, monitoring the n→π* transition of the substrate carbonyl group. For the calculation of specific activities, the following molar extinction coefficients were determined under standard measurement conditions: α-ketoisovalerate 32.5 m–1·cm–1 at 314 nm, α-keto-β-methylvalerate 33.0 m–1·cm–1 at 316 nm, α-ketoisocaproate 25.4 m –1·cm–1 at 317 nm. Catalytic constants of indolepyruvate conversion were calculated, taking the slow keto-enol equilibrium into account. The effective fraction of the reactive keto form under measurement conditions was 85% for indolepyruvate (40Schütz A. Golbik R. Tittmann K. Svergun D.I. Koch M.H.J. Hübner G. König S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2322-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate, 87.5 and 98% keto form are found in equilibrium. However, because the equilibria establish very rapidly for these two substrates, the nominal molar concentrations have been used for data analysis. For branched-chain α-keto acids, most of the substrate exists in the keto form (α-ketoisovalerate, 95–96% keto form and 4–5% hydrated form; α-ketoisocaproate, 98% keto form and 2% hydrated form; see supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). One unit of catalytic activity is defined as the amount of enzyme converting 1 μmol of α-keto acid/min at 30 °C. kcat values were determined per monomer using a molecular mass of 59,783 Da (calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence). Stopped-Flow Measurements—Substrate activation and amino acid activation were analyzed using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (SX18MV, Applied Photophysics, Surrey) and the standard buffers described above. A solution containing substrate (for substrate activation analysis) or substrate and amino acid (for amino acid activation studies) was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a solution containing the auxiliary enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (0.5–0.9 units/ml), NADH (0.7–1.9 mm), and MtKDC (0.27–4.9 μm). Progress curves were fitted according to Equation 1 (A is absorbance at time t, and A0 is initial absorbance), thereby obtaining the observed first order rate constant for the substrate activation process (kobs), the initial velocity (v0), and the steady state velocity (vSS). A=A0-vss·t+vss-v0kobs·(1-e-kobs·t)(Eq. 1) 1H NMR Experiments—To investigate the influence of activators on the deprotonation rate constant at the C2 atom of enzyme-bound ThDP, H/D exchange kinetics were monitored in presence and absence of an amino acid at 10 mg of MtKDC/l, 30 °C, and pH 6.5 (41Kern D. Kern G. Neef H. Tittmann K. Killenberg-Jabs M. Wikner C. Schneider G. Hübner G. Science. 1997; 275: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Additionally, distributions of enzyme-bound covalent ThDP intermediates were determined in the absence and presence of an amino acid according to the method described in Tittmann et al. (42Tittmann K. Golbik R. Uhlemann K. Khailova L. Schneider G. Patel M. Jordan F. Chipman D.M. Duggleby R.G. Hübner G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7885-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) at 15 mg of enzyme/ml. In both experiments l-leucine was chosen as the amino acid, because it acts as a strong activator in conventional kinetic experiments. For each reaction run, the enzyme was preincubated with 5 mm l-leucine. For reaction intermediate analyses, measurements were started by the addition of 60 mm pyruvate and stopped by acid quench after 5 s. In the absence of l-leucine, the reaction does not reach the (final) steady state within this reaction time. Because the enzyme converts the substrate very rapidly at the required high protein concentration, the reaction time cannot be significantly expanded beyond 5 s. This restriction prevented the calculation of microscopic rate constants for the catalytic cycle. However, semiquantitative analyses have been carried out. The Kinetic Model—A two-site model has been developed to fit the kinetic data (Fig. 2). Formally it is composed of two sections. In the absence of the effector X (amino acids in our study) only the species of the upper branch (ElS, El, SEl, SEa, SEaS) are populated. Substrate molecules may either bind to the active site (formation of ElS) or to the regulatory site (formation of SEl) of the initial enzyme state. Binding at the regulatory site triggers a conformational switch to more active enzyme forms (SEa, SEaS). This isomerization step is rate-limiting for the activation in absence of additional effectors. Hence, progress curves display lag phases whose time constants report on the isomerization step. Thus, the model proposed closely conforms to the model of Schellenberger, Hübner, and Schowen (15Hübner G. Weidhase R. Schellenberger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Alvarez F.J. Ermer J. Hübner G. Schellenberger A. Schowen R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 8402-8409Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, a certain activity is already inherent to the initial enzyme state El. The steady state for the low activity species is rapidly established. Therefore, the observed lag phases reflect the transition from one (initial) steady state to another (final) steady state of product formation. As shown in detail in the supplemental information, the following equations apply in the absence of further effectors. v=v0+(vss-v0)·(1-e-kobs·t)(Eq. 2) kobs=k-iso·KMS+KM+kiso(1+KA/K1)·SKA·K1K1+KA+S=k-iso·KMS+KM+kiso'·SKa+S(Eq. 3) with k′iso = kiso/(1 + KA/K1) and Ka = KA·K1/(K1 + Ka) v0=kcat0·KAK1+KAK1·KAK1+KA+S=kcat0'·SKM0+S(Eq. 4) vss=Vmax(C·S+S2)A+B·S+S2(Eq. 5) with A = KA·Kiso·KM, B = KM·(1 + Kiso·(1 + KA/K1)), C=kcat0·A/kcat·K1, and Vmax = kcat·E0. Obviously it holds kcat0'/KM0=kcat0/K1. The complex dependence of kobs on S after Equation 3 can run through minima or maxima but may also account for quasihyperbolic kobs/S-plots (14Krieger F. Spinka M. Golbik R. Hübner G. König S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3256-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the presence of the effector X the entire scheme of Fig. 2 theoretically becomes relevant. In this case, S and X compete for the regulatory site, whereas X is not supposed to bind to the active site. Because X actuates conformation changes (steps k4 and k6) leading to the activated species XEa and XEaS, it acts as a heterotropic activator. Because of the two independent activation pathways (substrate driven and amino acid driven activation), progress curves should display two lag phases. Empirically, this is not the case. This leads to the assumption that in the presence of amino acids and moderate substrate concentrations, the amino acid-driven pathway dominates, and hence, the sequence SEl ⇄ SEa ⇄ SEaS might be neglected. The intrinsic mathematical properties of the model are outlined in the section below. The following assumptions are made. (i) The substrate binding steps are fast compared with the isomerization steps SEl/SEa, XEl/XEa, and XEtS /XEaS. (ii) In the presence of amino acid the transition of SEl to SEa is suppressed. All relevant differential equations can be added to give dSEldt+dEldt+dElSdt+dXEldt+dXElSdt=-k4·XEl-k6·XElS+k-4·XEa+k-6·XEaS(Eq. 6) The mass balance equation of all enzyme species reads as E0 = SEl + El + ElS + XEl + XElS + XEa + XEaS E0=El·1+SKA+SK1+XKα+X·SKα·K2+XEa·1+SK3(Eq. 7) Insertion of Equation 7 into Equation 6 yields dEldt=-kobs·El+v·E0α·η(Eq. 8) with kobs=k4+k6·SK2·XKα1+SKA+SK1+XKα+S·XK2·Kα+k-4·K3+k-6·SK3+S(Eq. 9) v = k–4 + k–6·S/K3, η = 1 + S/K3, and α = 1 + S/KA + S/K1 + X/Kα + S·X/K2·Kα. As a solution to Equation 8 one obtains El=(Ela-Eeq)·e-kobs·t+Eeq(Eq. 10) with Ela = E0/α and Eeq = v·E0/α·η·kobs. Ela is the concentration of the enzyme species El immediately after the rapid equilibration between the species El, ElS, XEl, and XElS, which occurs after mixing the enzyme with S and X. Because the isomerization steps (k4, k-4, k6, k-6) are considered to be slow, virtually no XEa or XEaS has been formed at this stage. The index “eq” relates to the final equilibrium of all enzyme species. Equation 10 can be rearranged to give XEaS=XEaSeq·(1-e-kobs·t) which in turn can easily be converted to v=v0+(vss-v0)·(1-e-kobs·t)(Eq. 12) with vss=Vmaxapp·SKMapp+S Vmaxapp=kcat0·E01+XKβ+kcatXkcat0XKβ·K61+K1KA+X·1Kβ+1Kβ·K6 and KMapp=K11+XKα·1+1K41+K1KA+X·1Kβ+1Kβ·K6 Notably, the analytical expressions for v0 and vSS in Equation 12 differ from those in Equation 2. Most importantly, the amino acid driven mechanism predicts Michaelis-Menten behavior as only one substrate molecule is bound at the working enzyme. Integration of Equation 12 reproduces Equation 1. Equation 9 defines a surface function, which is spanned over the XS plane. As seen from the slightly rearranged formulation in Equation 16, kobs depends always hyperbolically on X. kobs=kb+kmaxf·XKXobs+X(Eq. 16) with kb=k-4·K3+k-6·SK3+S(Eq. 17) kmaxf=k4·K2+k6·SK2+S(Eq. 18) and KXobs=Kα·K2·1+S/K1K2+S(Eq. 19) kmaxf is the rate constant for the activation in forward direction at a given substrate concentration under amino acid saturation. kb relates to the reverse reaction. KXobs represents an apparent dissociation constant of the effector X for the initial enzyme state, again relevant for a defined substrate concentration. Technically, KXobs is the half-saturation constant of the kobs-X dependence at a given substrate concentration. The dependence of kobs on S is potentially more complex. Depending on the individual values of the microscopic constants, kobs may display upward or downward curvatures over the substrate domain. In theory, Equations 16, 17, 18, 19 offer a straightforward method for data evaluation. A comprehensive kinetic analysis would require the determination of kb, kmaxf, and KXobs for several sufficiently varying substrate concentrations. Subsequently, the three apparent constants kb, kmaxf, and KXobs should be replotted as functions of S. Ideally, k4, k6, and K2 could be extracted from a plot of kmaxf versus S, whereas analysis of KXobs would allow the estimation of Kα and K2/K1. Plotting of kb versus S would finally yield k–4, k–6, and K3. In the current study this approach remained restricted to the S/X couple benzoylformate/l-leucine. In all other cases we merely report the net rate constants kb, kmaxf, and KXobs at a constant substrate concentration of 5 mm instead. For the comparison of the activation potential of α-keto acids and amino acids, it is expedient to introduce specificity constants for activation, defined in analogy to catalytic efficiencies (kcat/S0.5). At low concentrations the act"

Here we combined mutational and biophysical approaches to define the structural basis of CaM binding to mGluR 7A. Ca2+/CaM was found to interact with mGluR 7A primarily via its C-lobe at a 1:1 CaM:C-tail stoichiometry. Pulldown experiments with mutant CaM and mGluR 7A C-tail constructs and high resolution NMR with peptides corresponding to the CaM binding region of mGluR 7A allowed us to define hydrophobic and ionic interactions required for Ca2+/CaM binding and identified a 1-8-14 CaM-binding motif. The Ca2+/CaM.mGluR 7A peptide complex displays a classical wraparound structure that closely resembles that formed by Ca2+/CaM upon binding to smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase. Our data provide insight into how Ca2+/CaM regulates group III mGluR signaling via competition with intracellular proteins for receptor-binding sites.

The cleavage occurs only between two RSSs with different spacer lengths of 12 and 23 bp. Here we report that in the synaptic complex, recombination-activating gene (RAG) proteins interact with the 7-mer and unstack the adjacent base in the coding region. We generated a RAG1 mutant that exhibits reduced RAG-7-mer interaction, unstacking of the coding base, and hairpin formation. Mutation of the 23-RSS at the first position of the 7-mer, which has been reported to impair the cleavage of the partner 12-RSS, demonstrated phenotypes similar to those of the RAG1 mutant; the RAG interaction and base unstacking in the partner 12-RSS are reduced. We propose that the RAG-7-mer interaction is a critical step for coding DNA distortion and hairpin formation in the context of the 12/23 rule.

Although the physiological roles and biochemical properties are yet to be studied for the SpRag1/2L proteins, they may represent the evolutionary intermediates of the vertebrate RAG1 and RAG2.

A nick is first introduced at the coding/7-mer border on the top strand, and the resulting 3′-hydroxyl group (3′-OH) attacks the bottom strand to generate a hairpin structure at the coding end.

It was found that the 7-mer was protected on the bottom strand and that the adjacent coding base was unstacked in the synaptic complex of the 12/23 pair but not the 12/12 pair. We also analyzed both RAG1 and RSS mutants that have defects in the distortion and cleavage of the 7-mer sequence. Our results indicate that the RAG-7-mer interaction is a crucial checkpoint in V(D)J recombination to ensure the 12/23 rule. Preparation of Proteins–The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged truncated RAG1 protein (amino acids 384–1040) was coexpressed with the GST-tagged truncated RAG2 protein (amino acids 1–383) in HEK-293T cells (42Tsai C.L.

The nicked RSS was prepared by annealing three oligonucleotides: an RSS bottom strand, a 5′-phosphorylated top strand of the signal end DNA, and a coding top strand (with a 3′-dideoxy or 3′-OH end). Annealed DNA was purified by electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide gel, as described (43Nagawa F. Hirose S. Nishizumi H. Nishihara T. Sakano H. J. Biol.

RSS Cleavage Reactions–The 32P-labeled 12-RSS DNA (400 cpm/μl) and the partner RSS DNA (8 nm) were incubated with RAG1 (12 μg/ml), RAG2 (12 μg/ml), and HMG1 (8 μg/ml) proteins at 37 °C for 45 min in cleavage buffer (25 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.0), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.4 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm potassium acetate, 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2% glycerol) containing 10 mm MgCl2. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalchohol (25:24:1), precipitated with ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, dissolved in formamide dye mix, and electrophoresed in a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Isolation of RAG-RSS Complexes–To isolate single RSS complex and synaptic complex in parallel, the 32P-labeled nicked RSS DNA (3000 cpm/μl) was incubated with RAG1 D600A (30 μg/ml), RAG2 (30 μg/ml), and HMG1 (8 μg/ml) proteins at 37 °C for 10 min in cleavage buffer containing 0.3 μm competitor DNA and 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction mixture was further incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with or without the nicked partner RSS (16 nm). For the bead separation of the complex, glutathione-Sepharose beads in GST wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% glycerol) with 10 mm MgCl2 was added to the reaction mixture. The sample was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged to separate the Sepharose beads. The beads were washed three times with 30 μl of GST wash buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 and resuspended in 30 μl of binding buffer (25 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.0), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.4 mm dithiothreitol, 90 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2% glycerol) with 10 mm MgCl2. To isolate the synaptic complex, 32P-labeled nicked RSS DNA (3000 cpm/μl) was incubated with RAG1 (16 μg/ml), RAG2 (16 μg/ml), and HMG1 (8 μg/ml) proteins at 37 °C for 10 min in the cleavage buffer containing 0.3 μm competitor DNA and 10 mm CaCl2. The biotinylated partner RSS (8 nm) was then added and further incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. To isolate the complex, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280; 10 μg/μl) in binding buffer were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. After incubation, magnetic beads and supernatant were separated using a magnet stand. The beads were washed three times at room temperature with 15 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2 and then resuspended in 30 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2. Footprinting–For DMS footprinting, 1.5 μl of 10% DMS (in ethanol) was added to the isolated complex (preheated at 25 °C for 2 min) and incubated at 25 °C for 6 min. Methylation was stopped by adding β-mercaptoethanol (0.2 m) and sodium acetate (0.3 mm). DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalchohol (25:24:1), precipitated twice with ethanol, dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) and 1 mm EDTA, and heated at 90 °C for 15 min. Sodium hydroxide (0.1 n) was then added, and heated at 90 °C for 30 min. DNA was precipitated with ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, dissolved in formamide dye mix, and electrophoresed in a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. For KMnO4 footprinting, 32P-labeled RSS DNA (400 cpm/μl) and partner RSS DNA (8 nm) were incubated with RAG1 (12 μg/ml), RAG2 (12 μg/ml), and HMG1 (8 μg/ml) proteins at 37 °C for 45 min in cleavage buffer containing either 10 mm MgCl2 or 10 mm CaCl2. Samples were preheated at 25 °C for 5 min. KMnO4 (10 mm) was then added and further incubated at 25 °C for 6 min. Oxidation was stopped by adding β-mercaptoethanol (1.2 m). SDS (0.556%) and proteinase K (0.556 mg/ml) were added to the sample and incubated at 50 °C for 60 min. DNA was precipitated twice with ethanol, dissolved in 10% piperidine, heated at 90 °C for 30 min, and freeze-dried three times. Samples were dissolved in formamide dye mix and electrophoresed in a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. RAG1 Mutants for Synapsis-dependent RSS Cleavage–To analyze the synapsis-dependent RSS cleavage, we tried to isolate the RAG1 mutants defective in partner-dependent hairpin formation. Mutants were generated by swapping short stretches of the murine RAG1 sequence with the corresponding regions from sea urchin proteins deduced from the RAG1-like genes (22Kapitonov V.V. Jurka J.

Among the mutants analyzed, three showed up-regulated RSS cleavage in vitro. These hyperactive (HA) mutants, HA1, HA2, and HA3 (Fig. 1A), underwent hairpin formation on the 12-RSS substrate even in the absence of the partner 23-RSS under the Mg2+ condition. It should be noted that hairpin formation usually requires both 12- and 23-RSSs in the synaptic complex (Fig. 1B). With the HA3 mutant, where residues 978–984 were replaced, more than 75% of total 12-RSS was converted to the hairpin form, and the addition of the partner 23-RSS did not enhance the reaction (Fig. 1B). The HA3 phenotype is similar to that for the previously reported RAG1 mutant (E649A) that cleaves RSS DNA independent of the synapse formation (46Kriatchko A.N. Anderson D.K. Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4712-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Two other mutants, HA1 and HA2, demonstrated elevated levels of hairpin formation by severalfold in the absence of the partner RSS, which could be further enhanced with the addition of partner RSS (Fig. 1B). Another group of RAG1 mutants identified in the present study demonstrated defective hairpin formation (DH) even in the presence of partner RSS. With one of the mutants, DH3u, hairpin formation was not enhanced by the addition of the partner RSS, although the partner-independent basal hairpin formation activity was comparable with wild type (Fig. 1B). Under the relaxed condition using Mn2+ (27McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M.

RAG-7-Mer Interaction Is Enhanced by the Synapsis Formation–We then studied the RAG-RSS interaction at different stages of synaptic complex formation. Using the nicked RSS as an intermediary substrate, both the single RSS complex and the synaptic complex were analyzed in parallel by DMS footprinting (Figs. 2 and S2). Hairpin formation, which usually hampers the footprinting, was blocked by two different methods. First we utilized a catalytic mutant of RAG1 (D600A) that can form the RAG-RSS complex but not the hairpin structure (Fig. 2) (48Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W. Oettinger M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 49Fugmann S.D. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L.M. Schatz D.G. Mol.

In the other method, the 3′-OH at the nick was reduced to the 3′-dideoxy form, and the reaction was performed under the Ca2+ condition (Fig. S2) (43Nagawa F. Hirose S. Nishizumi H. Nishihara T.

In each experiment, either the 12- or 23-RSS was labeled with 32Patthe 5′-end of the bottom strand and incubated with HMG1 and GST-fused RAG1/2 proteins with or without the partner RSS. The resulting complex was isolated with glutathione-Sepharose (Figs. 2A and S2). The addition of the partner RSS satisfying the 12/23 rule increased the yield of the complex, indicat"
https://openalex.org/W2056740863,"The mRNAs encoding the vaccinia virus F17 protein and the cowpox A-type inclusion protein are known to possess sequence-homogeneous 3′ ends, generated by a post-transcriptional cleavage event. By using partially purified extracts, we have previously shown that the same factor probably cleaves both the F17 and A-type inclusion protein transcripts and that the cleavage factor is either virus-coded or virus-induced during the post-replicative phase of virus replication. In this study, we have purified the cleavage factor from vaccinia-infected HeLa cells using column chromatography and gel filtration. The factor eluted from the gel filtration column with an apparent molecular mass of ∼440 kDa. Mass spectrometric analyses of the proteins present in the peak active fractions revealed the presence of at least one vaccinia protein with a high degree of certainty, the H5R gene product. To extend this finding, extracts were prepared from HeLa cells infected with vaccinia virus overexpressing His-tagged H5, chromatographed on a nickel affinity column, and eluted using an imidazole gradient. Cleavage activity eluted with the peak of His-tagged H5. Gel filtration of the affinity-purified material further demonstrated that cleavage activity and His-tagged H5 co-chromatographed with an apparent molecular mass of 463 kDa. We therefore conclude that H5 is specifically associated with post-transcriptional cleavage of F17R transcripts. In addition, we show that dephosphorylation of a cleavage competent extract with a nonspecific phosphatase abolishes cleavage activity implying a role for phosphorylation in cleavage activity.

Poxviruses are unique among the DNA viruses because they carry out their entire replication cycle in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Poxviruses therefore encode most of the machinery required for viral replication and transcription (1Moss B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott/Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 2849-2884Google Scholar). Vaccinia virus is the prototypical and therefore best studied member of the Poxviridae family. Vaccinia transcription is temporally regulated by several viral and possibly some host factors. Vaccinia encodes a multisubunit RNA polymerase that bears similarity to eukaryotic RNA polymerases but, importantly, lacks a C-terminal domain. Early virus gene transcription precedes viral DNA replication. Intermediate and late (collectively termed post-replicative) gene transcription is coupled to and therefore occurs concomitantly with DNA replication. Vaccinia virus employs different mechanisms to mediate 3′ end formation of early and post-replicative viral mRNAs (2Condit R.C. Niles E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Early transcripts are homogeneous in sequence at their 3′ ends. This homogeneity results from a transcription termination event mediated by a specific cis-acting sequence in the nascent RNA (5′UUUUUNU3′) and several virus-coded trans-acting early gene-specific termination factors (3Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G.

By contrast, post-replicative mRNAs are extremely heterogeneous in sequence at their 3′ ends such that each post-replicative gene produces a family of transcripts ∼1–4 kb in length (10Mahr A. Roberts B.E. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 510-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These transcripts are polyadenylated by a relatively promiscuous virus-coded poly(A) polymerase. To date, no cis-acting sequence has been identified that signals late transcription termination. The cis-acting signal that is operative at early times is not active at late times even when present in late transcripts. If a post-replicative cis-acting transcription termination sequence exists, it must be both abundant and inefficient to account for the observed RNA 3′ end heterogeneity. Nevertheless, genetic and biochemical experiments have identified several trans-acting factors that influence post-replicative mRNA 3′ end formation by modulating transcription elongation and/or termination. These factors include the products of vaccinia genes A18R, G2R, and J3R (11Black E.P. Condit R.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lackner C.A. Condit R.C. J. Biol.

Existing evidence suggests that A18 is a transcription termination factor; A18 catalyzes release of nascent RNA from transcription elongation complexes in vitro, and mutants in the A18R gene produce longer than normal post-replicative mRNAs in vivo (12Lackner C.A. Condit R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1485-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutants in G2R and J3R produce 3′-truncated post-replicative RNAs in vivo, suggesting that they are positive transcription elongation factors (11Black E.P. Condit R.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Latner D.R. Xiang Y. Lewis J.I. Condit J. Condit R.C. Virology. 2000; 269: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Xiang Y.

H5 has been shown to stimulate late transcription in vitro (18Kovacs G.R. Moss B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6796-6802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, H5 interacts with the late transcription elongation factor G2 (19Black E.P. Moussatche N. Condit R.C. Virology. 1998; 245: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and with the late transcription initiation factors A2 and G8 (20Dellis S. Strickland K.C. McCarry W.J. Patel A. Stocum E. Wright C.F. Virology. 2004; 329: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally and most importantly, an IBTr mutant has recently been isolated in the H5R gene (21Cresawn S.G. Condit R.C. Virology. 2007; 363: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).

Several IBT-dependent and -resistant mutants have been identified previously in other vaccinia proteins that influence late transcription elongation, including two of the largest vaccinia RNA polymerase subunits (J6 and A24) and the positive transcription elongation factors (G2 and J3), thus establishing a strong association between IBT resistance and control of transcription elongation (15Xiang Y.

Post-transcriptional site-specific cleavage is linked with 3′ end formation of at least some vaccinia late transcripts. At least four late orthopoxvirus transcripts possess sequence-homogeneous 3′ ends, including the ATI, F17R, A24R gene transcripts and transcripts arising from telomere junctions (25Parsons B.L. Pickup D.J. Virology. 1990; 175: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Patel D.D. Ray C.A. Drucker R.P. Pickup D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virology. 2004; 319: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Of these, the 3′ ends of the ATI and F17R gene transcripts result from a post-transcriptional site-specific endoribonucleolytic reaction (28Antczak J.B. Patel D.D. Ray C.A. Ink B.S. Pickup D.J. Proc.

Virology. 2004; 319: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The mechanism of 3′ end formation of the telomeric transcripts and the A24 transcripts has not been determined. The cis-acting sequence required for processing of the ATI transcript includes 43 nucleotides spanning the cleavage site, and the sequence responsible for cleavage in both the F17R and ATI gene transcripts is orientation-specific. The F17R gene cleavage site has not been fine-mapped; however, no obvious sequence or structural homology is evident between the sequences flanking the F17R and ATI gene cleavage sites. Partially purified extracts cleave both the ATI and F17 transcripts in vitro, suggesting the involvement of the same cleavage factor for both transcripts (29D'Costa S.M. Antczak J.B. Pickup D.J. Condit R.C. Virology. 2004; 319: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The cleavage factor is either virus-coded or -induced at late times post-infection; “early” extracts prepared in the presence of DNA replication inhibitors and virion-soluble extracts do not possess cleavage activity. To identify the factor required for post-transcriptional site-specific cleavage of late nascent mRNA transcripts, we have purified the cleavage factor from vaccinia-infected HeLa S3 cells. This study elucidates this purification and confirms unequivocally that the product of the H5R gene is specifically associated with cleavage activity. The results carry implications concerning the mechanism of vaccinia virus post-replicative mRNA 3′ end formation in general, and the role of H5 in vaccinia replication in particular. BSC40 cells, wild type vaccinia strain WR, recombinant vaccinia virus, VVTMA18, VVT7, and the conditions for their growth and infection have been described previously (30Condit R.C. Motyczka A.

HeLa S3 cells (gift from Dr. J. B. Flanegan, University of Florida) were grown in suspension culture in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Joklik's modification) containing 5% calf serum and 2% fetal calf serum. Vaccinia virus VVT7 (vTF7.5) was obtained from Dr. Bernard Moss and described previously (33Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) harboring the plasmid pET14b and containing the H5 open reading frame was a gift from Dr. Paula Traktman. VVTMhisH5 (vvhisH5) is a recombinant vaccinia virus that contains a polyhistidine-H5R fusion within the thymidine kinase gene, driven by a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and an encephalomyocarditis internal ribosome entry site element. For the construction of VVTMHisH5, wild type vaccinia-virus infected cells were transfected with the plasmid pTMHisH5 (see below). Thymidine kinase-negative recombinants were selected, and their structure was confirmed by PCR analysis using appropriate primers. pTMHisH5 was constructed by cloning the H5 coding sequence as an NdeI-BamHI fragment from pGADN-H5 into pTM1his cleaved with NdeI and BamHI (19Black E.P.

Preparation of Nuclear Extracts from Infected Cell Lysates—Six-liter batches of HeLa S3 cells (5 × 105 cells/ml; 48 liters total) were sedimented by centrifugation, resuspended in 1/10th the original volume (600 ml; fresh medium), and infected with wild type (strain WR) vaccinia virus at 5 plaqueforming units/cell for ½-h at 37 °C. After adsorption, infected cells were diluted into their original volume with spent media, and the infection was allowed to proceed for 18 h at 37 °C. Infected cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, re-centrifuged, and pellets were frozen at –80 °C. Preliminary experiments established that most of the cleavage activity was associated with the nuclear fraction. To prepare nuclear extracts, cell pellets were thawed on ice, resuspended in two packed cell volumes of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)) containing 10 mm NaCl, and allowed to swell for 10 min. Cells were then Dounce-homogenized, and the nuclei were separated from the cytoplasmic fraction by centrifugation at 3200 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were resuspended in 1 packed cell volume of Buffer A, 10 mm NaCl, and subjected to a second round of homogenization and centrifugation. The nuclear pellet was then resuspended in ½ packed nuclear volume of Buffer A, 10 mm NaCl. Buffer A, 20% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl was then added dropwise with stirring, and the homogenate (now in Buffer A containing 10% glycerol and 250 mm NaCl) was kept stirring on ice for 30 min. This homogenate was then sonicated four times for 15 s with a Sonics & Materials sonicator, model VC-250, and clarified at 100,000 × g for 2 h in a swinging bucket rotor to generate nuclear extract (NE). Total protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Overexpression of H5 and A18 was achieved by co-infecting HeLa cells with vTF7.5 and either VVTMHisH5 or VVTMHisA18 (multiplicity of infection = 5). Nuclear extracts for purified his-H5 and his-A18 were prepared similar to wild type infections with the exception that nuclear pellets were resuspended in Buffer A such that the final concentration of NaCl in these homogenates was 400 mm. Expression of His-tagged H5 from bacterial cultures was done as described elsewhere (34Bayliss C.D. Condit R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1550-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Purification Scheme—We carried out in vitro cleavage assays (as described below) to monitor the chromatographic behavior of the cleavage factor. All purification steps with the exception of DEAE-cellulose chromatography were performed on a BioRad BioLogic DuoFlow at 4 °C. DEAE-cellulose chromatography was carried out at 4 °C using a Bio-Rad Econo Pump run at maximum flow rate (1.6 ml/min). Buffer A indicated here is the same as that used for the preparation of extracts except that it contains 10% glycerol unless otherwise indicated. NE (175 ml; 800 mg) was applied to a 60-ml DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman) column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 250 mm NaCl. The flow-through (FT) was collected and the column was washed with 100 ml of starting buffer. The wash fraction was collected and pooled with the FT (DEAE pool). The DEAE pool (270 ml; 600 mg) was then applied to an 80-ml SP-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 250 mm NaCl. After a wash with 400 ml of the starting buffer, the column was eluted in a stepwise fashion with 800 mm NaCl in Buffer A (800 ml). Ten-ml fractions were collected and assayed for cleavage using the in vitro cleavage assay described below. Fractions containing cleavage activity were pooled (SP-active; 20 ml; 55 mg) and dialyzed into Buffer B (20 mm KPO4, pH 7.2; 200 mm NaCl; 5% glycerol). The dialyzed SP-active fraction (24 ml; 49 mg) was then applied to a 10-ml ceramic hydroxyapatite type II (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with Buffer B. After a wash with 50 ml of starting buffer, the column was developed with a 50-ml linear gradient from 20 to 350 mm KPO4, pH 7.2, in Buffer C (200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol). One-ml fractions containing cleavage activity eluting between 190 and 240 mm potassium phosphate were pooled and dialyzed (HAP-active; 11 ml; 4 mg) into Buffer A containing 5% glycerol and 400 mm NaCl. HAP-active was then concentrated using an Amicon concentrator (Ultracel 100K; Millipore) to 175 μl (2.5 mg) and applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (10 × 30 cm; GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A containing 5% glycerol and 400 mm NaCl. Molecular weight standards (high and low molecular weight standards; Amersham Biosciences) were used to calibrate the gel filtration column. The purification scheme for vaccinia His-tagged proteins (hisH5 and hisA18) was as follows: HeLa NE (200 mg, 12 liters) was applied to a 5-ml DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 400 mm NaCl. The flow-through was collected; the column washed with 10 ml of the starting buffer, and the two fractions were pooled (DEAE pool). The salt concentration in the DEAE pool fraction was adjusted to 1 m and applied to a 5-ml nickel affinity column (His-trap; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 1 m NaCl. After a 25-ml wash with the starting buffer, the column was washed with 100 ml of Buffer A containing 1 m NaCl and 150 mm imidazole. The His-trap column was then developed with a 50-ml linear gradient from 150 to 300 mm imidazole in Buffer A. (A 50-ml step of 300 mm imidazole in Buffer A was used to elute hisA18.) The H5 protein eluted from the His-trap column was pooled, concentrated using an Amicon concentrator (Ultracel 5K; Millipore) to 2.5 ml (2.5 mg), and applied to a Superose 300 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A containing 5% glycerol and 400 mm NaCl. Molecular weight standards (high and low molecular weight standards; Amersham Biosciences) were used to calibrate the gel filtration column. Alternatively, HeLa NE from 3 liters of vvhisH5- or vvhisA18-infected cells was applied to a 5-ml DEAE-cellulose column under the same conditions described above. DEAE pool from these fractionations was then applied to a 1-ml His-trap column in 400 mm NaCl. The column was successively washed with 20 ml of starting buffer (or buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl), 20 ml of buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl (or 0.5 m NaCl) and 150 mm imidazole, and finally developed with 20 ml of elution buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl (or 0.5 m NaCl) and 500 mm imidazole. Plasmid pGF17stp, which contains the 3′ end of the F17R transcript was used as template for synthesizing the 32P-labeled RNA substrate used for the in vitro cleavage assay as described previously (29D'Costa S.M. Antczak J.B. Pickup D.J. Condit R.C. Virology. 2004; 319: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cleavage assays were done as described previously with the following modifications. Briefly, 10 fmol of the substrate was denatured at 90–95 °C for 10 min and incubated with either infected cell extracts or fractions obtained during purification. Assays were typically carried out at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 μg of bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 25 μl. Samples were then treated with 2 μl of“PK mix” (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12.4 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 50 μg of proteinase K) at 37 °C for at least 15 min. An equal volume (27 μl) of formamide-loading buffer was then added to the PK-treated samples. Samples were denatured at 90–95 °C for 5 min and loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea (Sequagel, National Diagnostics). Gels were fixed, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. For the phosphatase experiments, the cleavage assay was carried out as described above but in the presence of 2 or 4 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP; Promega) and 1× SAP buffer. For the heat-inactivated control, 20 units of SAP was heated at 90 °C for 15 min, and 4 units of this heat-inactivated SAP was added to the cleavage reaction containing all of the above-mentioned reagents and 1× SAP buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose filters in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol). Filters were incubated either with polyclonal antisera directed against H5 (1:20,000) (36Demasi J. Traktman P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or monoclonal antisera directed against the histidine tag (1:2000, Novagen). The bound primary antibody was then detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse; 1:5000) and chemiluminescent reagents (GE Healthcare). Mass spectrometric analyses were carried out at Custom Biologics (Toronto, Canada). Protein band(s) of interest were carefully excised and prepared for in-gel digest with trypsin followed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis as described. Briefly, gel slices were de-stained in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 30 mm potassium ferricyanide and 100 mm sodium thiosulfate and then washed several times with de-ionized water. Acetonitrile was added to shrink and dehydrate the gel pieces which were then reduced by replacing the acetonitrile with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. After 1 h at 56 °C the dithiothreitol solution was replaced with acetonitrile to once again shrink and dehydrate the gel slices. Dehydrated gel slices were re-swollen by the addition of the alkylating agent, 55 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and incubated in the dark for 45 min at room temperature. Excess iodoacetamide was removed by washing repeatedly with alternating aliquots of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile. Dehydrated gel pieces were air-dried at room temperature and then swelled on ice by the addition of digestion buffer containing 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 12.5 ng/μl of trypsin (Roche Applied Science, sequencing grade). After the gel pieces had completely swelled they were transferred to 37 °C and incubated overnight. Digestion buffer was transferred to a clean tube and 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to the gel slices to extract the peptides by shaking at high speed for 45 min. Resulting proteolytic fragments were recovered by reverse phase purification. Eluted peptides were detected by a LCQ DECA XP mass spectrometer (Thermo, MA), equipped with an electrospray ionization source, a low flow metal needle assembly operating in data-dependent mode. The method consisted of two scan events, a full scan and a second data-dependent MS/MS scan. The dynamic mass range of the full scan was set at 300-3000 m/z. The resulting MS/MS data-dependent scan rejected known “contaminant” masses of 371.0, 391.0, 445.0, 462.0, 1221.89, 1321.9, 1421.9, 1521.8, 1521.9, 1621.9, 1721.9, and 1821.9 m/z. All other method parameters were default values set by the Xcaliber software version 1.2 (Thermo, MA). Purification of the Cleavage Factor—Our preliminary analyses indicated that the bulk of cleavage activity is present at late times during vaccinia infection and fractionates with the nuclei of infected cells. We suspect that the cleavage factor is localized in virosomes and therefore partitions with nuclei during differential centrifugation of infected cell extracts. As detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” we used an in vitro cleavage assay to test for fractions obtained during the various steps of purification, which could specifically cleave a radiolabeled RNA substrate. For reasons that we do not fully understand, we were unable to reproducibly achieve linearity in either a substrate or an enzyme titration in the cleavage assay. Therefore, we were unable to devise a quantitative assay or a unit definition for cleavage activity and have adopted the qualitative approach presented in this study. The purification scheme outlined in Fig. 1 was established after numerous trial purifications using diverse chromatographic resins. Nuclear extracts were prepared from ∼48 liters of HeLa cells infected with vaccinia virus, strain WR. These extracts were applied to a DEAE-cellulose column, and the flow-through (FT) from this column was collected. DEAE-cellulose chromatography served to remove any contaminating nucleic acids present in the crude extract and also clarify the extract before applying it to subsequent columns on the Bio-Rad Duoflow FPLC system. Further fractionation on SP-Sepharose and hydroxyapatite was carried out as outlined in Fig. 1 and detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity that eluted off the hydroxyapatite column was applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column as a final purification step. The gel filtration column also served to determine the molecular mass of the cleavage factor. The peak of cleavage factor activity (fraction 20) eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 440 kDa from the gel filtration column (Fig. 1, B and C). SDS-PAGE analysis of the gel filtration fractions indicated that at least four prominent protein bands were enriched in intensity in the cleavage-active fractions as compared with flanking fractions from the gel filtration column or peak fractions from earlier purification steps (Fig. 1D). Gel slices marked A–E excised from fraction 20 and analyzed by mass spectrometry revealed the presence of only one viral protein with a high degree of certainty, vaccinia H5 (Gel Slice D and E, ∼35 kDa). In addition, as expected, a number of host proteins were identified in this fraction, including all three subunits of the translational initiation factor eIF2, and several host nuclear and nucleolar proteins (WW domain protein, nucleolar RNA helicase II Gu, IgE autoantigen). We have determined that eIF2 is not required for cleavage activity (data not shown). However, we are uncertain what role, if any, the host nuclear and nucleolar proteins may play in vaccinia late mRNA processing. Purification of Overexpressed His-tagged H5 from Vaccinia-infected HeLa Cells—To confirm the role of H5 in late mRNA processing, we purified H5 from HeLa cells infected with a vaccinia virus overexpressing a His-tagged version of H5. We prepared nuclear extracts at late times postinfection from HeLa cells co-infected with VVT7 and vvhisH5. Fig. 2A describes the scheme for this purification. Using nickel-affinity chromatography, we purified His-tagged H5 (bulk of protein eluted in the 500 mm imidazole step) and observed that cleavage activity co-eluted with the"

These modular units can act as binding sites, areas of post-translational modification, and sites of complex multimerization. The human cytomegalovirus US2 gene product is organized into discrete domains that together catalyze the proteasome-dependent degradation of class I major histocompatibility complex heavy chains. US2 co-opts the endogenous ER quality control pathway in order to dispose of class I. The US2 endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-lumenal region is the class I binding domain, whereas the carboxyl terminus can be referred to as the degradation domain. In the present study, we examined the role of the US2 transmembrane domain in virus-mediated class I degradation. Replacement of the US2 transmembrane domain with that of the CD4 glycoprotein completely blocked the ability of US2 to induce class I destruction. A more precise mutagenesis revealed that subregions of the US2 transmembrane domain differ in their ability to trigger class I degradation. Collectively, the data support a model in which US2-mediated class I degradation occurs as a highly regulated process where the US2 transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail work in concert to eliminate class I molecules. Host factors, including a signal peptidase complex, probably associate with the US2 molecule in a coordinated fashion to create a predislocation complex to promote the extraction of class I out of the ER. The results imply that the ER quality control machinery may recognize and eliminate misfolded proteins using a similar multistep regulated process.

Viruses deliver their genetic material into the host cell to initiate infection and begin the process of replication. Entry into the host cell can be accompanied by the activation and initiation of an immune response.

Indeed, the class I MHC antigen presentation pathway plays a major role in alerting the immune system to the presence of intracellular pathogens. Virus-specific CD8+ CTLs monitor class I MHC molecules at the cell surface for foreign peptides and aid in the elimination of infected cells (2Townsend A. Bodmer H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 601-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar).

The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the largest member of the Herpesviridae family, contains a double-stranded DNA genome of ∼230 kb encoding for over 200 open reading frames (3Mocarski E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology, 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 2447-2492Google Scholar). HCMV requires roughly 1–2 days in order to completely duplicate its genome, with replication occurring in a temporal fashion of immediate early, early, and late gene products, respectively (3Mocarski E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology, 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 2447-2492Google Scholar). This abundance of genes encoded by HCMV could, theoretically, provide an arsenal of antigenic peptides for presentation by class I molecules to CTLs, thereby removing the infected cell and ending the viral life cycle prematurely. Clinically, CD8+ CTLs responding to peptides from several HCMV immediate early gene products have been isolated, whereas CTLs specific for more abundant early and late proteins remain to be found (4Boppana S.B. Britt W.J. Virology. 1996; 222: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Reddehase M.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). HCMV has evolved several ingenious strategies by which it disarms this particular component of the immune response during the early phase of infection. The US (unique short) region of the HCMV genome encodes at least five ER-resident glycoproteins that modulate the cell surface expression of class I MHC molecules. The immediate early gene product US3 binds and limits the egress of peptide-loaded class I molecules from the ER, their site of synthesis (6Ahn K. Angulo A. Ghazal P. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. Fruh K.

Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). US2 and US11 have co-opted the cellular process known as ER quality control, which controls the proper assembly of nascent secretory proteins, in an effort to inhibit the cell surface presentation of class I MHC molecules (13Sayeed A. Ng D.T. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). The HCMV US2 gene encodes for a 199-amino acid polypeptide that localizes to the ER as a type I membrane glycoprotein (15Gewurz B.E. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11306-11313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Early studies of HCMV infection demonstrated that US2 was one of two loci within the viral genome that functioned to increase the turnover of class I MHC molecules (16Jones T.R. Sun L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2970-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of this gene product alone in human cells caused the rapid destabilization and dislocation of class I heavy chains out of the ER and into the cytosol for subsequent degradation by the proteasome (12Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of US2 in mammalian cells has been used as an invaluable tool to study the cellular processes of dislocation and degradation. Crystallographic studies of HCMV US2 established that the ER-lumenal domain of this protein contains an immunoglobulin-like fold that facilitates its association with class I MHC molecules and is required for subsequent dislocation of heavy chains (17Gewurz B.E. Gaudet R. Tortorella D. Wang E.W. Ploegh H.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6794-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Gewurz B.E. Wang E.W. Tortorella D. Schust D.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5197-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). US2 targets a population of class I molecules within a specific conformational state; US2 exhibits reactivity with only properly folded class I molecules (19Blom D. Hirsch C. Stern P. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, for the US2-mediated dislocation of class I heavy chains, US2 directs the modification of class I with anywhere from one to three molecules of ubiquitin prior to complete extraction from the ER (20Furman M.H. Loureiro J. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34804-34811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Signal peptide peptidase (SPP), an ER-resident protease involved in cleavage of signal peptides and processing of antigens for HLA-E molecules, binds to the US2 cytoplasmic tail and is important to catalyze US2-mediated class I degradation (21Loureiro J. Lilley B.N. Spooner E. Noriega V. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2006; 441: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ER-resident chaperone BiP has also been implicated in US2- and US11-mediated degradation of class I (22Hegde N.R. Chevalier M.S. Wisner T.W. Denton M.C. Shire K. Frappier L. Johnson D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20910-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although a complete model remains to be fleshed out, much of the data summarized here suggest a structured series of events beginning once US2 binds to a lumenal epitope on properly folded class I molecules. This US2-class I complex is then recruited to the dislocation channel by interaction with specific cellular proteins, thus allowing the dislocation substrate to be ubiquitinated as it is extracted from the ER membrane. Class I heavy chains are then directed to the proteasome for destruction. Structural analysis of US2 predicts that this viral polypeptide is a multidomain protein with its class I binding domain at the NH2 terminus and its degradation domain at the COOH terminus. A US2 truncation mutant in which the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail has been deleted no longer directs the degradation of class I MHC heavy chains (23Furman M.H. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3258-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Chevalier M.S. Daniels G.M. Johnson D.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8265-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A more precise mutagenesis study showed that every third residue of the cytoplasmic tail was critical for US2-mediated class I degradation, offering up more insight into how US2 contacts the dislocation machinery (25Oresic K. Noriega V. Andrews L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19395-19406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to discern the function of the US2 transmembrane domain and its role in class I degradation. By generating chimeric US2 constructs in which the transmembrane domain alone or both cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain were replaced with that of the human CD4 protein, we found that neither construct was competent to degrade class I heavy chains. In addition, a panel of substitution mutants in which increasingly smaller sections of the US2 transmembrane domain were swapped out for CD4 sequences demonstrated that specific regions of the transmembrane domain were more important in mediating heavy chain dislocation. We hypothesize that the US2 transmembrane domain, in conjunction with the cytoplasmic tail, recruits cellular factors to sites of dislocation in order to extract class I heavy chains from the ER membrane. It would be intriguing to attribute this ordered activation of cellular proteins, or “trigger effect,” to the cellular quality control machinery as a means to regulate the dislocation of misfolded proteins from the ER. Cells and Antibodies–Human U373-MG astrocytoma cells and U373 transfectants that stably express US2 mutant constructs (see below) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C (95% air, 5% CO2). Gp2–293 cells (BD Biosciences) were utilized to generate retroviruses (see below) and were cultured in medium similar to U373 cells. Rabbit polyclonal anti-US2 antibody and anti-class I heavy chain antibody were raised against the bacterially expressed lumenal domain of US2 (aa 15–140) and class I heavy chain (HLA-A2 allele, aa 25–366), respectively. The monoclonal antibody W6/32 recognizes properly folded class I molecules (26Parham P. Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 342-349PubMed Google Scholar) and was purified from hybridoma-cultured supernatant. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to signal peptide peptidase was purchased from Abcam. Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibody to BiP was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. cDNA Constructs–The US2-CD4 chimeric cDNA constructs (US2CD4 and US2CD4US2) were generated from the ligation of two PCR fragments, with one fragment containing sequences corresponding to either the CD4 transmembrane domain alone or the CD4 transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail. The US2 transmembrane domain amino acid cDNA constructs (US2/CD426/US2, US2/CD427/US2, US2/CD424/US2, and US2/CD423/US2) were amplified with a primer corresponding to the 5′ end of the US2 cDNA and a 3′ primer containing the appropriate CD4 sequences plus the amino acid isoleucine. A similar PCR/ligation approach was used to construct US2 transmembrane domain mutants 2–7 (US2CD4US2-2 through -7), in which differing fragments of the CD4 transmembrane domain were introduced into a backbone of the US2 lumenal domain and cytoplasmic tail. All of the constructs were initially cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) and then subsequently subcloned into the retrovirus vector pLgPW (25Oresic K. Noriega V. Andrews L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19395-19406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Retrovirus Transduction–Retrovirus vectors containing the respective US2 mutant cDNA constructs and the vesicular stomatitis virus-G envelope were transiently transfected simultaneously into gp2–293 cells (BD Biosciences) by a lipid-based protocol to produce a pseudotyped Moloney murine leukemia virus amphotropic retrovirus. In brief, pLgPW:US2 constructs and pVSV-G envelope protein (BD Biosciences) were transfected into gp2-293 cells on day 1, with the transfection media being changed every 24 h for 2 days. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, medium containing retrovirus particles was added to U373 cells with a final concentration of 8 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma). Enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing cells were sorted using a MoFlo high speed cell sorter (Cytomation) (Mount Sinai Flow Cytometry Facility). Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation–Cells (1.0 × 106) were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis mix (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, supplemented with 1.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by the removal of nuclei and insoluble material using centrifugation (2 min, 16,100 × g at 4 °C). The lysates were incubated with the respective antibody followed by the addition of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) for 40 min on a nutator at 4 °C. The Pansorbin cells were pelleted and washed twice with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). The polypeptides were released from the Pansorbin cells with 1× SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 50 mm dithiothreitol), resolved using SDS-PAGE (12.5% or 15%), and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Flow Cytometry Analysis–Quantitative flow cytometry analysis of surface-expressed class I MHC molecules was assessed using W6/32 or HLA-A2 (1.5 μg of antibody/1 × 106 cells), followed by incubation with Alexa 647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). The fluorescence signal was measured from 10,000 cells using a Cytomics FC 500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). The data were analyzed using Flow Jo software (Tree Star, Inc.). The levels of surface class I molecules are represented by plots of normalized cell number versus fluorescence signal. Normalized cell number was calculated by setting the maximum cell number at the respective peak fluorescence value to 100. Immunofluorescence–U373 cells and US2 transfectants were plated onto 13-mm coverslips in a 24-well plate at a concentration of 0.5 × 105 cells/well. Approximately 12 h later, cells were washed twice in PBS at room temperature, fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1) for 10 min at 4 °C, washed twice with PBS, and then blocked for 30 min at room temperature in PBG (phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% (v/v) fish gelatin) supplemented with 0.075% saponin and 4% normal goat serum. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with both anti-US2 and anti-BiP antibody (1:500 each in PBG plus 0.075% saponin). Cells were washed four times with PBG and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature, in the dark, with both fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted in PBG/saponin. Cells were washed four times with PBG, once with PBS, and once with distilled H2O. The samples were then mounted on a glass side using ProLong Antifade solution (Invitrogen). Images were captured using an Olympus 1X70 fluorescence microscope and analyzed using Q Capture Pro software (Media Cybernetics). Images were generated using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc.). HCMV US2 Transmembrane Domain Chimeras Are ER-localized Species–US2 is one of two HCMV-encoded ER-resident proteins, the other being US11, that exploit the process known as ER quality control to target class I MHC molecules for degradation (16Jones T.R. Sun L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2970-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HCMV US2 is a 199-amino acid type I membrane glycoprotein composed of an ER-lumenal portion (aa 1–160), transmembrane domain (aa 161–185), and a short cytoplasmic tail (aa 186–199). The ER-lumenal domain of HCMV US2 binds class I MHC molecules (17Gewurz B.E. Gaudet R. Tortorella D. Wang E.W. Ploegh H.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6794-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Gewurz B.E. Wang E.W. Tortorella D. Schust D.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5197-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas the cytoplasmic tail is necessary to promote proteasomal degradation of heavy chain molecules (23Furman M.H. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3258-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Chevalier M.S. Daniels G.M. Johnson D.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8265-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Oresic K. Noriega V. Andrews L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19395-19406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). US2 and the homologous HCMV glycoprotein US11 have nonclassical transmembrane domains containing several polar or charged residues that are not usually found in transmembrane regions. These polar amino acids within the lipid bilayer have the capacity to facilitate the formation of protein complexes and mediate cellular processes (27Popot J.L. Engelman D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 881-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In fact, a glutamine residue at position 192 within the transmembrane domain of HCMV US11 is crucial for catalyzing degradation of class I heavy chains (28Lilley B.N. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3690-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, to ascertain the role of the US2 transmembrane domain (residues 161–185) in class I degradation, US2 chimeric mutants were generated in which either the US2 transmembrane domain alone was exchanged for CD4 sequences (US2CD4US2) or both the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of US2 were replaced with CD4 sequences (US2CD4) (Fig. 1A). The human CD4 is a type I membrane protein with a classical transmembrane domain containing only nonpolar residues. These chimeric US2 molecules were stably transduced into U373 cells, and expression of these US2 mutants was examined by an immunoprecipitation/immunoblot experiment (Fig. 1B). Total cell lysates and anti-US2 precipitates from equal numbers of U373 cells and US2 chimera-expressing cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by an anti-US2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–8) or anti-GAPDH immunoblot (Fig. 1B, lanes 9–16). The anti-GAPDH immunoblot confirmed an equal loading of samples. US2 polypeptides were detected from the anti-US2 precipitates as well as from the total cell lysates (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4 and 6–8). The US2CD4 protein migrated more slowly than wild type US2199, as predicted by its molecular mass of ∼24.8 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 2 versus lane 3). Interestingly, US2CD4US2 also migrated more slowly than US2199, despite the fact that both molecules have an equal number of residues (Fig. 1B, lane 2 versus lane 4). In addition, two distinct polypeptides of US2CD4US2 were recovered with anti-US2 sera (Fig. 1B, lane 4), perhaps corresponding to a post-translational modification, such as the attachment of a single N-linked glycan. In total, these results demonstrate that the US2 transmembrane domain chimeric constructs were expressed in U373 cells. To investigate whether the US2 chimeric mutants were processed as wild type US2 with regard to the acquisition of an N-linked glycan, we examined the sensitivity of each mutant to endoglycosidase H, an enzyme that removes high mannose N-linked glycans. US2 polypeptides recovered from the respective US2 chimeric cell line with anti-US2 sera were subjected to endoglycosidase H treatment. The precipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by an anti-US2 immunoblot (Fig. 1C). As expected, wild type US2 (US2199) and US2CD4 were susceptible to endoglycosidase H cleavage (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 7 and 8), as demonstrated by the faster migrating US2 species (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 8). The two polypeptides of US2CD4US2 (Fig. 1C, lane 5) were converted to one species upon treatment with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 1C, lane 6). These results demonstrated that the faster migrating US2CD4US2 polypeptide was indeed a nonglycosylated form of US2CD4US2. This result intriguingly implies the involvement of the US2 transmembrane domain in processing of the molecule. In total, the glycosylation patterns for each US2 transmembrane domain chimera mimic those of wild type US2199. To further verify that the US2 chimeras reside within the ER, the cellular localization of the US2 proteins was examined using immunofluorescence microscopy. U373, US2199, US2CD4, and US2CD4US2 cells were plated onto coverslips and probed with both anti-US2 antibody and anti-BiP antibody, followed by incubation with a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells expressing each US2 chimera displayed a subcellular staining pattern similar to wild type US2199 (Fig. 1D). Consistent with published data, each cell line demonstrated a diffuse cytoplasmic staining for US2 and BiP, typical of endoplasmic reticulum localization (29Fiebiger E. Story C. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1041-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Collectively, the data demonstrates that the US2-CD4 chimeras retained the localization and post-translational modifications observed in wild type US2199 cells. US2-CD4 Chimeras Are Deficient in US2-mediated Dislocation of Class I Molecules–To determine if the US2-CD4 chimeras target class I molecules for proteasome-dependent degradation, levels of class I heavy chains were analyzed in the absence and presence of proteasome inhibitor. The inclusion of proteasome inhibitor causes the accumulation of the glycosylated and deglycosylated, dislocated forms of heavy chains. Total cell lysates from equal numbers of U373, US2199, US2CD4, and US2CD4US2 cells, untreated or treated with the proteasome inhibitor ZL3VS (2.5 μm, 16 h), were subjected to an anti-heavy chain immunoblot (Fig. 2). U373 (control) cells were included to demonstrate the migration pattern of stable class I heavy chains (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). As expected, almost no class I heavy chains were observed in US2199 cells, because class I is degraded rapidly and efficiently (12Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, lane 3). Consistent with published data (12Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 20Furman M.H. Loureiro J. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34804-34811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), inhibition of proteasome function caused the accumulation of both glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of heavy chains (Fig. 2, lane 4). In US2CD4 and US2CD4US2 cells, class I heavy chains were observed in the absence of inhibitor (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 8). More importantly, the lack of deglycosylated class I heavy chains in either proteasome inhibitor-treated US2CD4 or US2CD4US2 cells signifies that neither of these mutants was capable of directing class I for proteasome-dependent degradation. This result was also observed in a pulse-chase experiment (21Loureiro J. Lilley B.N. Spooner E. Noriega V. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2006; 441: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Indeed, more class I heavy chains were observed in US2CD4 and US2CD4US2 cells than in U373 cells (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 5 and 8). This may be due to the ability of the chimeric mutants to bind to class I molecules and delay the normal turnover of class I molecules (see Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that US2CD4 and US2CD4US2 do not induce the proteasome-dependent destruction of class I molecules.FIGURE 4US2 transmembrane domain chimeras continue to associate with class I MHC molecules. Top, properly folded class I molecules were recovered from U373, US2199, US2CD4, and US2CD4US2 cells with W6/32 (lanes 1–4). Bottom, US2 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the same samples with anti-US2 serum (lanes 5–8) to demonstrate equivalent amounts of US2 proteins.
