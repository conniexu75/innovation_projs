https://openalex.org/W2060413844,"A spiroplasma recovered from allantoic fluids of chick embryos infected with the tick-derived suckling mouse cataract agent was grown in continuous passage on a new artificial culture medium. The cultured organisms induced typical ocular and other disease symptoms in susceptible animals, and were reisolated from involved host tissues. Although spiroplasmas have been previously recognized as plant and insect pathogens, this is the first spiroplasma shown to multiply at 37 degrees C and to be pathogenic for vertebrates."

At very low Ca2+ concentations, light emission is independent of calcium ion concentration. The maximum slope of the log-log plot of light as a function of calcium ion concentration is about 2.5. The complete relation is well described by a two-state model involving three calcium-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2051279722,Female cowbirds raised in auditory isolation from males responded to the songs of male cowbirds with copulatory postures. The songs of males reared in isolation were more effective in eliciting the posture than the songs of normally reared males. The females did not respond to the songs of other species. These results indicate one mechanism of species identification for this parasitic species.

Withdrawal reactions precipitated by the narcotic antagonist naloxone in methadone-dependent volunteers were the unconditioned response. These data support clinical anecdotes of withdrawal symptoms occurring in former addicts when they return to their drug-related environment.

The mechanism of position sense must in this case be operating on the basis of extrapolation. Ambiguity of sensed position can occur in this situation. Some subjects, when opposing the vibration-induced contraction of biceps, report experiencing multiple forearms."
https://openalex.org/W1969501963,"An acute systemic acidosis in vitamin D depleted rats that was induced by ammonium chlroide feeding resulted in defective biological hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Impaired enzymatic hydroxylation occurred despite the presence of either hypophosphatemia or hypocalcemia. The data suggest that acidosis interfers with the adaptive enzymatic control of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol metabolism in the vitamin D depleted state."
https://openalex.org/W107747064,"Two forms of proacrosin have been purified from ejacualted boar spermatozoa. The isolation method utilized benzamidine to inhibit the premeture activation of the zymogen and included pH precipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and sodium chloride precipitation. Further purification was achieved by Sephadex G-200 FILTRATION OF THE PREPARATION AFTER IT WAS TREATED WITH 8 M urea. The overall proacrosin yield was 58% with a specific acitivity of 253 units/mg of protein. The molecular weights of the proacrosins determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis were 55,000 and 53,000. Proacrosin autoactivation followed the classical S-shaped activation curve and calcium was not required to obtain full activation. Time course activation studies in 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.4, at 0 degrees were monitored with sodium dodecyl sulfate-disc gel eletrophoresis and anlytical gel electrophoresis with staining techniques for protein and enzymatic activity. Under the conditions used, the zymogens were sequentially degraded to three different active specise of acrosin (alpha, beta, and gamma). The approximate molecualr weights of the acrosins were 49,000, 39,000, and 25,000 for the alpha, beta, and gamma forms, respectively. The autoactivation is concentration-dependent and can be proteolytically stimulated with either alpha- or beta-acrosin and trypsin, indicating the activation of proacrosin can via a bimolecular process."
https://openalex.org/W2023978266,"Like horizontal cells in vertebrate retinas, horizontal amacrine cells beneath the insect eye intervene between receptors and interneurons at the first level of synapses. Synaptic arrangements between amacrines and interneurons that give rise to regular networks of axon collaterals may explain recent electrophysiological observations of lateral inhibition beneath the insect retina. Neural adaptation mechanisms acting on single retinotopic channels or assemblies of channels can also be referred to reciprocal relationships between receptors and first-order interneurons as well as to centrifugal cells from levels of so-called photopic receptor endings."
https://openalex.org/W1975196670,"Intravenous infusions of manose or B-hydroxybutyrate, metabolic fuels which can be oxidized by brain, abolished adrenal discharge of epinephrine in rats during insulin-induced hypoglycemia, whereas infusion of fructose, a sugar which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, did not. In contrast, increased feeding behavior during hypoglycemia was prevented both by the sugars and by B-hydroxybutyrate. Thus, while the sympathetic response during marked hypoglycemia may have been initiated by alterations in cerebal metabolism, the feeding response evidently was not, and a decrease in the utilization of glucose per se does not appear to be the critical stimulus in either case."
https://openalex.org/W2056334228,"20% of the acetylcholine receptors in cultured chick skeletal muscle remain unbound following long-term growth of muscle in medium containing a potent, essentially irreversible receptor-blocking agent, α-bungarotoxin. About half the receptors which are unavailable for interaction with extracellular α-bungarotoxin are newly synthesized molecules which presumably are being processed and transported to the plasma membrane. When the muscle cultures are switched to a medium containing 2H, 13C, 15N-amino acids, these receptors are rapidly labeled, the fraction of labeled molecules beginning to plateau at 3 hr. Few labeled receptors appear in the plasma membrane during the first 3 hr of labeling with 2H, 13C, 15N-amino acids. After 3.5 hr of labeling, virtually all the receptors being incorporated into the plasma membrane are labeled receptors. The kinetics of labeling of the “pool” and “surface” receptors with 2H, 13C, 15N-amino acids confirm the “precursor-product” type relationship of pool and surface acetylcholine receptors. In this study, receptors synthesized in medium containing 2H, 13C, 15N-amino acids were resolved from 1H, 12C, 14N-receptors by velocity sedimentation in sucrose-deuterium oxide and sucrose-H2O gradients, and their densities were estimated from sedimentation rates in shallow gradients of various average density. Estimated densities were 1.32 g/cm3 for 1H, 12C, 14N-receptors and 1.41 g/cm3 for 2H, 13C, 15N-receptors. This density difference corresponds to 80% substitution of normal aminoacyl residues by 2H, 13C, 15N-residues in the denser receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1983311890,"In the male mouse, regression of the mammary gland anlagen is induced by testosterone during embryonic life. In the androgen-insensitive Tfm mouse, the gland anlagen are resistant to the testosterone action. To analyze cellular interactions in this process, we isolated the mammary gland anlagen from Tfm- and wild-type embryos. The epithelial buds were separated from the mesencyme by trypsin-pacreatin treatment. From the epithelial and mesenchymal components, reciprocal recombinations were prepared and cultivated on millipore filter in the presence of testosterone. In combination with androgen-insensitive Tfm- mesenchyme, the wild-type buds survived the action of testosterone. On the other hand, in combination with wild-type mesenchyme, the androgen-insensitive Tfm epithelial buds were destroyed. The results show that testosterone induces detachment and degeneration of the buds via the mesenchyme."
https://openalex.org/W2109377365,"The synthesis and turnover kinetics of polysomal mRNA have been measured in sea urchin embryos. Polysomes were isolated from stages ranging between mesenchyme blastula and late gastrula Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryos which had been exposed to exogenous 3H-guanosine. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into messenger and ribosomal RNAs was determined separately as a function of time, and the precursor pool specific activity was measured in the same embryos. Synthesis and decay rate constants were extracted from the data by a least-squares procedure. Per embryo, the rate of mRNA synthesis was calculated to be about 0.13 pg min-1, while the rate of rRNA synthesis is about 0.022 pg min-1. The newly synthesized mRNA turns over with a half-time of 5.7 hr. The data support only a single decay rate for the mRNA, but small fractions of mRNA decaying at different rates cannot be excluded. Previous studies have shown that a minor fraction of the mRNA includes the least abundant, most highly diverse set of messages (""complex class"" mRNAs). To determine whether mRNAs of the complex class are synthesized and degraded at similar rates, labeled mRNA was measured in hybrids formed in mRNA excess reactions with single copy DNA. These experiments showed that complex class mRNAs represent an approximately proportional amount of the new mRNA symthesis, and turn over at the same average rate as does the bulk of the mRNA. Most of the mRNAs in the embryo polysomes are newly synthesized, rather than maternal. This statement refers both to complex class mRNAs and to prevalent mRNAs. Considering the sequence homology between embryo and oocyte mRNAs shown earlier, these results indicate that many of the same structural genes active during oogenesis are being transcribed in embryos at these stages."
https://openalex.org/W2087366839,"Protamine messenger RNA was isolated in a very pure form from trout testes and used as a template for the synthesis of labeled complementary DNA (cDNA) of high specific activity. The cDNA was found to be a full-length transcript of protamine messenger RNA and was used as a probe for hybridization reactions with RNA preparations isolated from three subcellular compartments of differentiating trout testis cells. The RNA populations from the nuclei, polysomes, and postribosomal supernatant of these cells were fractionated into poly(A)-containing [poly(A)+] and poly(A)-free [poly(A)−] RNA to determine the distribution of these two forms of protamine mRNA in these cell compartments. At the early protamine stage of testis development, polysomal and postribosomal supernatant fractions contain almost equal quantities of poly(A)− protamine mRNA, but poly(A)−protamine mRNA was found almost entirely in the polysomes."
https://openalex.org/W2092767772,"It is widely believed that human rods cannot detect rapid flicker. With rod-isolation techniques, however, light-adapted rods detect flicker frequencies as high as 28 hertz, and the function relating rod critical flicker frequency to stimulus intensity contains two distinct branches. Human rod vision may, therefore, depend on two independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1964023510,"Cytosomes filled with intensely fluorescent material in the form of curvilinear bodies were isolated by density gradient centrifugation followed by pronase digestion from the cerebral cortex of a child who had died at age 7 from the late infantile form of Batten disease. Forty-three percent of the dry weight of the storage material was extracted by a mixture of chloroform and methanol, leaving a waterinsoluble amorphous fluorescent residue. Infrared spectroscopy, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry of this residue strongly suggested the presence of retinoyl polyenes linked to a small peptide. Base hydrolysis and methanolysis yielded retinoic acid and methyl retinoate, respectively. Ozonolysis yielded a product derived from the substituted cyclohexenyl ring of vitamin A. The results indicate that the fluorescent component of the neuronal storage material is a retinoyl complex and is not derived from peroxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids as previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W1486049818,"Glucagon and L-epinephrine stimulate gluconeogenesis from 20 mM L-lactate, the effect being about 3 times greater in liver cells from fed rats than in those from fasted rats. The rate of pyruvate kinase flux was estimated to be less than 10% of the rate of gluconeogenesis from lactate in hepatocytes from fasted rats, and neither glucagon nor epinephrine lowered the absolute rate significantly. In hepatocytes from fed rats, however, the rate of pyruvate kinase was nearly one-half that of gluconeogenesis. Glucagon caused a marked depression of pyruvate kinase flux, with 1 muM glucagon lowering the rate to nearly the level found in cells from fasted rats Epinephrine at concentrations from 10(-8) to 10(-6) M actually increased pyruvate kinase flux during gluconeogenesis from lactate in cells from fed rats. These results are in accord with the view that the effects of glucagon and epinephrine on gluconeogenesis are not identical."
https://openalex.org/W1638491265,"epsilon-(gamma-Glutamyl)lysine has been found in human stratum corneum in the fraction containing the alpha helical fibrous proteins (keratins) and other high molecular weight proteins. The S-carboxymethylated fractions were enzymatically digested with pronase, carboxypeptidase A and B, leucine aminopeptidase and prolidase, and epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine isolated from digests by gel filtration and cation ion exchange chromatography. Acid hydrolysis of the purified epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine yielded equimolar amounts of lysine and glutamic acid, and end group analysis of the peptide by dansylation (application of 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) confirmed the isomer assignment to be epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine. About 9 nmol of the peptide per mg of protein were found in the fraction by isotope dilution after the enzymatic digestion. These results suggest that proteins in stratum corneum may be covalently cross-linked through epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds."

https://openalex.org/W1580997290,"The ATP sulfurylase of cultured tobacco cells is repressed during growth on readily assimiliated sulfur sources, such as sulfate, L-cysteine, or L-methionine, but it is derepressed during growth on slowly assimiliated sulfur sources, such as L-djenkolate or glutathione, or during sulfur starvation. The enzyme is not induced by sulfate. The enzyme level in the cells begins to rise 12 to 24 h after the derepression conditions are initiated and continues to rise for 3 to 4 days, up to as much as 25 times above the initial specific activity. Addition of a repressing sulfur source to derepressed cells causes the enzyme to decay. Derepression by sulfur limitation does not occur in cells starved for nitrogen, a circumstance in which turnover synthesis of protein is known to continue. Upon addition of a nitrogen source to such cells, the development of the enzyme begins within 12 h, along with the resumption of growth and net protein synthesis. Derepression occurs in cells growing on the slowly assimilated nitrogen in urea, reaching specific activities very similar to those which develop in cells grown on nitrate, in spite of the lower protein accumulation rate on urea. Thus the ATP sulfurylase of tobacco cells appears to be regulated by both a negative feedback mechanism in which an end product of the sulfate assimilation pathway is the effector, and by a positive mechanism which serves to couple the regulation of the sulfate assimilation pathway to the cells' potential for nitrogen assimilation, i.e. net protein synthesis. The sulfur compounds which affect the development of ATP sulfurylase in vivo have no effect on the enzyme activity in vitro. Furthermore, extracts with high activity contain no activator and extracts with low activity contain no inhibitor of ATP sulfurylase. Cycloheximide, at a concentration which strongly inhibits amino acid incorporation into protein, inhibits derepression. ATP sulfurylase does not decay in cells inhibited by cycloheximide. Therefore, the changes in ATP sulfurylase of tobacco cells appear to involve changes in the rate of formation or degradation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1997505029,"The purified p12 phosphoprotein of Rauscher murine leukemia virus was fractionated by ion exchange chromatography into subpopulations of molecules containing different amounts of covalently linked phosphate. Of the various phosphorylated forms of p12 protein purified from virions, only a species containing relatively little phosphate can bind in vitro to purified homologous 70S viral RNA. Using ultraviolet irradiation to stabilize ribonucleoprotein complexes in intact virions, the same molecular species of p12 phosphoprotein can be isolated in close association with the 70S viral genome. The results show that phosphorylation of type C viral p12 proteins influences the extent, but not the specificity, of their interaction with homologous viral RNA."

When enemy ants and other intruders are encountered on the territory, the Oecophylla assemble nestmates into small resting clusters by dispensing an attractant-arrestant pheromone from the sternal gland, a second newly discovered organ located on the last abdominal sternite. Under prolonged stress, additional forces are recruited to the combat area with the aid of the rectal-gland trail substance."
https://openalex.org/W2003422134,"Society seems content to strike a more moderate or uncertain balance with other technologies than with nuclear power. This attitude is traced to the social history of nuclear power, the genuine uncertainty and complexity of safety issues, underestimation of the regulatory task, and the rancorous nature of the debate. Nuclear power is not just another problem of technology, of environment, or of health. It is unique in our time. To be more demanding of nuclear safety may be to apply a double standard, but not necessarily an irrational one. Our best course appears to be to keep the nuclear option open, work toward the rapid resolution of problems such as waste disposal, but postpone recycling and the breeder reactor. Time is needed to resolve immediate problems such as transport and disposal of nuclear wastes; to come to terms with trans-scientific issues such as plutonium toxicity, sabotage, and weapons proliferation; and to evaluate long-term energy alternatives."

https://openalex.org/W2046006082,"Mouse plasmacytoma (MOPC) 460 cells contain two chromatographic forms of RNA polymerase III (IIIA and IIIB) in addition to the major class I and II RNA polymerases. Nuclei isolated from these cells actively synthesize RNA. Among the discrete transcription products observed are the 5S and 4.5S RNAs and additional low molecular weight RNA species (approximately 5.8S, 6.3S, and 6.6S in size). The 4.5S RNAs appear to be tRNA precursors since they can be converted in vitro to 4S RNAs. Studies with α-amanitin have shown that the synthesis of these discrete RNA species, and other uncharacterized transcripts somewhat larger in size, is mediated by an endogenous RNA polymerase III activity(ies). Nuclear RNA synthesis is stimulated by exogenous purified RNA polymerases. Exogenous MOPC class III RNA polymerases stimulate the synthesis of each of the distinct low molecular weight species (including 5S and 4.5S RNAs) about 3–6 fold. The hybridization of nuclear transcripts to purified 5S genes (5S DNA) confirms that exogenous class III RNA polymerases stimulate (approximately 4 fold) the synthesis of ribosomal 5S RNA. The 5S RNA genes in nuclei are transcribed asymmetrically by both the endogenous and the exogenous class III enzymes. Exogenous RNA polymerase III from Xenopus laevis ovaries stimulates 4.5S and 5S RNA synthesis in MOPC nuclei as effectively as do the MOPC class III RNA polymerases. However, exogenous MOPC class I and II RNA polymerases do not stimulate 4.5S and 5S RNA synthesis, suggesting that this effect is specific for the structurally similar class III RNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W176673319,"This communication deals with the investigation of the binding site of purified human corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) by the method of affinity labeling. The design of the studies necessitated the rapid removal of unbound ligands, followed by assay of the binding capacity of CBG. We were able to accomplish this by demonstrating that CBG absorbed on DEAE-filter discs bound cortisol as if both molecules were in solution. Using this principle, 6beta-bromoprogesterone was shown to react with CBG in a time-dependent and irreversible fashion with a t1/2 = 15 min at 2 degrees. One mol of 6beta-bromo[3H]progesterone reacted with 1 mol of CBG. After completion of the reaction, one of the two sulfhydrul groups in CBG was no longer titratable with Ellman's reagent. The product of the reaction of 6beta-bromoprogesterone with cysteine is progesterone-6-S-L-cysteine. After acid hydrolysis of CBG, which had been incubated with 6beta-bromoprogesterone, a compound which migrated with the same mobility on thin layer chromatography as the model compound was observed. We conclude that 6beta-bromoprogesterone is an affinity label for CBG and that a cysteinyl residue is present in the binding site."

https://openalex.org/W43390558,"The two major DNA-binding proteins (designated DNA-binding protein 1 and DNA-binding protein 2) in human serum have been purified and physically characterized. The two proteins co-purify through an ion exchange chromatographic step and DNA-cellulose affinity chromatography. Subsequently, DNA-binding protein 1 can be precipitated by 40% saturated ammonium sulfate; DNA-binding protein 2 precipitates in the 55% to saturation fraction. From these fractions, the two proteins are isolated by different protocols. Both purified proteins are homogeneous by the criteria of sodium dodecyl sulfate slab gel electrophoresis after reduction and denaturation and by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. DNA-binding protein 1 has a minimum molecular weight of 126,000; DNA-binding protein 2, 86,000. Amino acid analyses of the two proteins indicate that both are relatively rich in proline and cysteine and contain little methionine. Both proteins contain carbohydrate. Gel electrofocusing confirms the acidic nature of these proteins. DNA-binding protein 1 exhibits a single band upon isoelectric focusing, but DNA-binding protein 2 appears to be polymorphic, exhibiting three bands. NH2-terminal end group analysis of DNA-binding protein 2 yields two major amino acids.

https://openalex.org/W1509316499,"The oxygenerated form of cytochrome o can be readily observed in whole cell suspensions of Vitreoscilla because it is the predominant steady state form of the cytochrome in respiring cells. When oxygen is introduced to an anaerobic suspension of cells, the steady state is established immediately and absorption maxima are observed at 578, 545, and 425 nm in difference spectra using ammonium persulfate-oxidized cells as reference. The oxygenerated form of cytochrome o is identified as the predominant steady state species during turnover of the cytochrome in vivo from the close coincidence of these spectra with those obtained using purified cytochrome. When the dissolved oxygen is consumed, the spectrum of the oxygenated form is replaced by the spectrum of the reduced form. Glutamate increased the respiration of these cells and decreased the duration of the steady state. Spectra of the oxygenated form of cytochrome o could also be obtained by using starved cells as reference, i.e. (untreated cells) - (starved cells) difference spectra. These results implicate the oxygenated form of cytochrome o as an active intermediate in terminal electron transport of these cells. In the presence of 1 mM cyanide, which inhibits the respiration of Vitreoscilla, the duration of the steady state was increased and the steady state spectrum was altered, showing that turnover of the cytochrome was inhibitied and formation of the oxygenated form wsa decreased. All these results suggest that the cyclic changes of cytochrome o in terminal respiration involve the oxidized, reduced, and oxygenated forms."
https://openalex.org/W1520544265,"Anti-hapten antibodies from the ascitic fluid of inbred mice were purified by immunoadsorption and characterized immunochemically for in vivo studies of their plasma clearance rates and organ distributions after chemical modification. Following sodium borohydride-promoted reductive methylation and carbodiimide-promoted amide linkage of glycine and several other simple aliphatic compounds, the antibody populations were recharacterized, radiolabeled, and introduced intravenously into syngeneic animals. Using double radioiodine labels, it was possible to show that stoichiometric combinations of additive and chemical reactant did not alter antibody survival time in the circulation or antigen-binding capabilities. However, modifications involving excess reagent (carbodiimide or sodium borohydride) resulted in significant decreases in both circulatory longevity and ligand binding capacities. Excess carbodiimide treatments resulted in immunoglobulin cross-linkage which could be detected by molecular sieve chromatography. Increased kidney localization found with carbodiimide-treated antibodies was apparently due to trapping of the cross-linked aggregates. Elevated clearance of highly methylated antibodies could not be attributed to a single organ. However, sodium borohydride-catalyzed reductive methylation resulted in antibody populations which were localized primarily in the liver and spleen.

Proteases and most glycosidases had no effect on spleen colony formation, whereas treatment with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase reduced colonies by one-half. Intact sialic acid (residues appear to play an important role in colony formation."

https://openalex.org/W2055018555,Indias official advocacy of compulsory sterilization has caused dismay among those who think voluntary birth control services were never provided on a mass scale and that compulsory measures will cause resistance to family planning in general but it has also brought relief to those who felt Indias stand at the World Population Conference in 1972 was not nearly antinatalist enough. The new policy is in effect an admission that education and economic development will not bring about a drop in fertility soon enough. The timing of the policy shift can be explained by the state of emergency declared in June 1975. Prior to that it would have been politically impossible for Mrs. Gandhi to make any strong statements in favor of birth control. Since the family planning programs inception in 1952 sterilization has been an important part and incidence increased significantly every year until 1974 when budget cuts did not allow for program expansion. There are various possible explanations for the governments rethinking of its priorities but what was clear was that there was no clamor from the people to reinstate the services. The motivation to have small families seemed to be lacking perhaps because it is connected to a certain socioeconomic threshhold which had not been reached by the populace when the focus shifted from sterilization to economic development as the best contraceptive. The 5 states that appear to have had a significant decline in fertility have also done well in economic development while the family planning performance of the poorest states Bihar and Uttar Pradesh has been dismal. The problem of motivation is further complicated by a tradition and culture that require large families. The current population contains a huge growth potential for the future; all projections of the population show substantial increases. The Chinese example in family planning cannot be followed without fundamentally changing the structure of the entire economic and political system. Only the most economically prosperous states have the personnel and facilities to enforce a compulsory sterilization law. 1 of those Maharashtra is on the point of passing such a law. The experience of the state will be important for future consideration of compulsory sterilization nationwide.
