https://openalex.org/W2160648230,"Bonds between adhesion molecules are often mechanically stressed. A striking example is the tensile force applied to selectin-ligand bonds, which mediate the tethering and rolling of flowing leukocytes on vascular surfaces. It has been suggested that force could either shorten bond lifetimes, because work done by the force could lower the energy barrier between the bound and free states ('slip'), or prolong bond lifetimes by deforming the molecules such that they lock more tightly ('catch'). Whereas slip bonds have been widely observed, catch bonds have not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, using atomic force microscopy and flow-chamber experiments, we show that increasing force first prolonged and then shortened the lifetimes of P-selectin complexes with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, revealing both catch and slip bond behaviour. Transitions between catch and slip bonds might explain why leukocyte rolling on selectins first increases and then decreases as wall shear stress increases. This dual response to force provides a mechanism for regulating cell adhesion under conditions of variable mechanical stress."

https://openalex.org/W2090147784,"The ability of collapsing (cavitating) bubbles to focus and concentrate energy, forces and stresses is at the root of phenomena such as cavitation damage, sonochemistry or sonoluminescence1,2. In a biomedical context, ultrasound-driven microbubbles have been used to enhance contrast in ultrasonic images3. The observation of bubble-enhanced sonoporation4,5,6—acoustically induced rupture of membranes—has also opened up intriguing possibilities for the therapeutic application of sonoporation as an alternative to cell-wall permeation techniques such as electroporation7 and particle guns8. However, these pioneering experiments have not been able to pinpoint the mechanism by which the violently collapsing bubble opens pores or larger holes in membranes. Here we present an experiment in which gentle (linear) bubble oscillations are sufficient to achieve rupture of lipid membranes. In this regime, the bubble dynamics and the ensuing sonoporation can be accurately controlled. The use of microbubbles as focusing agents makes acoustics on the micrometre scale (microacoustics) a viable tool, with possible applications in cell manipulation and cell-wall permeation as well as in microfluidic devices."

https://openalex.org/W2006806054,"Calorie restriction extends lifespan in a broad range of organisms, from yeasts to mammals. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including decreased oxidative damage and altered energy metabolism. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lifespan extension by calorie restriction requires the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase, Sir2 (ref. 1). We have recently shown that Sir2 and its closest human homologue SIRT1, a p53 deacetylase, are strongly inhibited by the vitamin B3 precursor nicotinamide. Here we show that increased expression of PNC1 (pyrazinamidase/nicotinamidase 1), which encodes an enzyme that deaminates nicotinamide, is both necessary and sufficient for lifespan extension by calorie restriction and low-intensity stress. We also identify PNC1 as a longevity gene that is responsive to all stimuli that extend lifespan. We provide evidence that nicotinamide depletion is sufficient to activate Sir2 and that this is the mechanism by which PNC1 regulates longevity. We conclude that yeast lifespan extension by calorie restriction is the consequence of an active cellular response to a low-intensity stress and speculate that nicotinamide might regulate critical cellular processes in higher organisms."

Here we realize the fabrication of such a display on a bendable active-matrix-array sheet. The display is less than 0.3 mm thick, has high pixel density (160 pixels × 240 pixels) and resolution (96 pixels per inch), and can be bent to a radius of curvature of 1.5 cm without any degradation in contrast. This use of electronic ink technology on such an ultrathin, flexible substrate should greatly extend the range of display applications."
https://openalex.org/W2131141877,"Confocal fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) have been employed to investigate the lipid spatial and dynamic organization in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) prepared from ternary mixtures of dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin/cholesterol. For a certain range of cholesterol concentration, formation of domains with raft-like properties was observed. Strikingly, the lipophilic probe 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI-C18) was excluded from sphingomyelin-enriched regions, where the raft marker ganglioside GM1 was localized. Cholesterol was shown to promote lipid segregation in dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine-enriched, liquid-disordered, and sphingomyelin-enriched, liquid-ordered phases. Most importantly, the lipid mobility in sphingomyelin-enriched regions significantly increased by increasing the cholesterol concentration. These results pinpoint the key role, played by cholesterol in tuning lipid dynamics in membranes. At cholesterol concentrations >50 mol%, domains vanished and the lipid diffusion slowed down upon further addition of cholesterol. By taking the molecular diffusion coefficients as a fingerprint of membrane phase compositions, FCS is proven to evaluate domain lipid compositions.

Moreover, FCS data from ternary and binary mixtures have been used to build a ternary phase diagram, which shows areas of phase coexistence, transition points, and, importantly, how lipid dynamics varies between and within phase regions. More than 10 years ago, the hypothesis was formulated that cellular membranes are organized in discrete dynamic entities, called lipid rafts (1Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 2Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10670-10675Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Studies on epithelial cell polarity revealed that lipids, in particular sphingolipids and cholesterol, were laterally organized in the exoplasmic leaflet of the apical plasma membrane according to a variable short and long range order. Furthermore, distinct proteins were shown to selectively partition into lipid rafts, indicating that rafts could serve as specific sites for molecular sorting and polarized transport. They also function as platforms for intra- and intercellular signaling (3Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar, 4Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev.

In addition, rafts may be important in cell surface proteolysis (17Sevinsky J.R. Rao L.V.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and virus infection (18Stang E. Kartenbeck J. Parton R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).Commonly, lipid rafts are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol (1Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 2Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10670-10675Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 3Simons K.

The presence of long and saturated acyl chains in sphingolipids allows cholesterol to become tightly intercalated with such lipids, resulting in the organization of liquid-ordered (lo) phases. By contrast, unsaturated phospholipids are loosely packed and form a disordered state (usually indicated as liquid crystalline lc or liquid-disordered ld) (19Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar, 20Schmidt C.F. Barenholz Y. Huang C. Thompson T.E. Nature. 1978; 271: 775-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The difference in packing ability leads to phase separation (21Fridriksson E.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8056-8063Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 22Brown R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Model membrane studies carried out on ternary mixtures of cholesterol with phospholipids and sphingolipids show that lo phases, enriched in sphingolipids, separate from ld phases, enriched in phospholipids (19Brown D.A.

Several observations indicate that these “artificial rafts” are a reasonable, though crude, model of raft-containing cell membranes (24Brown D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10517-10518Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).More recently, along with a number of techniques employed to address questions on rafts (11Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), important contributions have also come from optical microscopy (28Kenworthy A.K. Petranova N. Edidin M. Mol. Biol.

Direct visualization of raft-like domains in model bilayer membranes has provided a tangible proof for the coexistence of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases (30Bagatolli L.A. Gratton E.

If it is true that their main function consists of forming platforms to concentrate certain proteins, then a detailed characterization of lipid and protein dynamics in the different phases is essential to understand mobility-dependent protein organization (34Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar). Single particle tracking (SPT) has been applied to follow raft-associated proteins in vivo (29Schütz G.J. Kada G. Pastushenko V.P. Schindler H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 892-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and lipid mobility in cell membranes and in vitro (31Dietrich C. Bagatolli L.A. Volovyk Z.N. Thompson N.L. Levi M. Jacobson K.

Petranova N. Edidin M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, a detailed characterization of cholesterol-containing membranes from a dynamic point of view is still lacking.Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) 1The abbreviations used are: FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; GUVs, giant unilamellar vesicles; LUVs, large unilamellar vesicles; DOPC, l-α-dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine; SM, N-stearoyl-d-erythrosphingosylphosphorylcholine; DiI-C18, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; ITO, indium tin oxide.1The abbreviations used are: FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; GUVs, giant unilamellar vesicles; LUVs, large unilamellar vesicles; DOPC, l-α-dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine; SM, N-stearoyl-d-erythrosphingosylphosphorylcholine; DiI-C18, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; ITO, indium tin oxide. is based on the time-correlation of temporal fluorescence fluctuations detected in the focal volume, which are governed by dynamic parameters of the system at equilibrium (36Eigen M. Rigler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5740-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 37Schwille P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 34: 383-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The power of FCS relies on the single molecule sensitivity and the capability of exploring a wide range of dynamic events with high temporal resolution and good statistical accuracy (38Koppel D.E. Phys. Rev. A. 1974; 10: 1938-1945Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In the past, this technique has been proven to be a powerful tool to follow lipid dynamics in domain-forming giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) (39Korlach J. Schwille P. Webb W.W. Feigenson G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), which serve as excellent model membranes for single molecule optical microscopy (40Angelova M.I. Dimitrov D.S. Faraday Discuss. Chem. Soc. 1986; 81: 303-308Crossref Google Scholar).In this study, we present a detailed characterization of lipid dynamics in raft-forming GUVs prepared from a ternary mixture of cholesterol, dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin. By combining confocal optical microscopy and FCS, insight is gained in the static and dynamic organization of lipids, partitioning in different phases. It is evident that cholesterol plays a key role in promoting raft formation and, most importantly, in tuning membrane lipid mobility. Finally, we show that FCS provides information on lipid raft composition, allowing for a mapping of the lipid phase diagram, entirely based on dynamic parameters.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine; DOPC), N-stearoyl-d-erythrosphingosylphosphorylcholine (stearoyl sphingomyelin, SM), cholesterol, porcine brain ganglioside GM1 (GM1) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. 1,1′-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiIC18) and the Alexa-Fluor 488 conjugate of cholera toxin B subunit (AF-CTB) were from Molecular Probes. The cholesterol-sequestering agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) was from Sigma. All other chemicals were of reagent grade.Preparation of GUVs—GUVs were prepared by electroformation (40Angelova M.I. Dimitrov D.S. Faraday Discuss. Chem. Soc. 1986; 81: 303-308Crossref Google Scholar, 41Dimitrov D.S. Angelova M.I. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1988; 19: 323-333Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). With this approach, truly unilamellar vesicles are produced with sizes varying from 10 up to 100 μm (42Menger F.M. Angelova M.I. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 789-797Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 43Mathivet L. Cribier S. Devaux P.F. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1112-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The flow chamber (closed-bath perfusion chamber, RC-21, Warner Instruments Co.) used for vesicle preparation was equipped with two microscope slides, each coated with optically transparent and electrically conductive indium tin oxide (ITO). Lipids in chloroform/methanol 9:1 (5 mm, prepared freshly and kept under a nitrogen atmosphere) were deposited on preheated ITO coverslips and the solvent was evaporated at 20 or 60 °C; both procedures yielded the same results in terms of domain formation and lipid mobility. After adding water into the chamber (∼300 μl), a voltage of 1.1 V at 10 Hz was applied for 1 h. After lipid swelling, the chamber was put either directly at room temperature or cooled down slowly by using a heat block. Both cooling procedures led to the same type of vesicles and domain pattern. Also the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (2 mm, final concentration), to prevent possible lipid oxidation, did not affect domain formation and lipid mobility under our conditions of GUV formation. Whatever procedure was used, the GUVs were always prepared from fresh lipid mixtures and kept under a nitrogen atmosphere as much as possible. Lipids were checked for oxidation by UV/VIS spectroscopy and thin layer chromatography. Under the conditions of GUV preparation, it was found that less than 0.1% of lipids were oxidized.DiI-C18 was added in the amount of 0.1 mol% for confocal imaging and 0.001 mol% for FCS. Since GM1 is known to change the lipid spatial distribution above 2 mol% (44Magde D. Elson E. Webb W.W. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1972; 29: 705-708Crossref Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 45Spink C.H. Yeager M.D. Feigenson G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the compound was used here in minimal amounts, for confocal imaging (0.1 mol%) and FCS (0.05 mol%).Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy and FCS—Confocal fluorescence microscopy and FCS were performed on a commercial ConfoCor2 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Confocal images were taken with the laser scanning microscopy (LSM) module. The excitation light of an Ar ion laser at 488 nm and of a HeNe laser at 543 nm was reflected by a dichroic mirror (HFT 488/543) and focused through a Zeiss C-Apochromat 40×, NA = 1.2 water immersion objective onto the sample. The fluorescence emission was recollected by the same objective and split by another dichroic mirror (NFT 545) into two channels. Detection of the fluorescence emission, after passing a 505–530-nm bandpass filter in the first channel and a 560-nm longpass filter in the second channel, was obtained with two photomultipliers (PMTs). The confocal geometry was ensured by pinholes (60 μm) in front of the PMTs. FCS measurements were performed by epi-illuminating the sample with the 543 nm HeNe laser (I ex ≈ 1.2 kW/cm2). The excitation light was reflected by a dichroic mirror (HTF 543) and focused onto the sample by the same objective as for the LSM. The fluorescence emission was recollected back and sent to an avalanche photodiode via a 560–615-nm bandpass filter. Out-of-plane fluorescence was reduced by a pinhole (90 μm) in front of the detector. The laser focus was positioned on the topside/bottomside of GUVs, by performing an axial (z-) scan through the membrane prior to the FCS recording. The fluorescence temporal signal was recorded and the autocorrelation function G(τ) was calculated, according to Magde et al. (44Magde D. Elson E. Webb W.W. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1972; 29: 705-708Crossref Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). The apparatus was calibrated by measuring the known three-dimensional diffusion coefficient of rhodamine in solution. The detection area on the focal plane was approximated to a Gaussian profile and had a radius of ≈0.18 μm at 1/e2 relative intensity. Data fitting was performed with the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least-squares fit algorithm (ORIGIN, OriginLab, Northampton, MA). The fitting equation made use of a two-dimensional Brownian diffusion model, assuming a Gaussian beam profile as shown in Equation 1, G(τ)=∑i〈Ci〉11+τ/τd,iAeff∑i〈Cl〉2,(Eq. 1) where 〈Ci〉 is the two-dimensional time average concentration of the species i in the detection area A eff and τd,i is the average residence time of the species i. The diffusion coefficient D i for the species i is proportional to τd,i. For FCS measurements, three independent GUVs preparations were analyzed and, for each of them, data from at least 20 different GUVs were recorded with 100 s acquisition time per FCS measurement. When membrane phase separation was visualized with the LSM, the laser focus was always positioned onto one phase only for the FCS experiment.RESULTSLipid Domain Visualization by Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Confocal fluorescence microscopy was employed to visualize phase separation in GUVs prepared from SM/DOPC/cholesterol and imaged at room temperature. We exploited the ability of a fluorescent marker, DiI-C18, to partition differently in such type of domains. DiI-C18 has been used in mixtures of saturated phospholipids and shown to partition preferentially with saturated, long-tailed phospholipids, e.g. dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine-phases over coexisting fluid phases by a factor of ∼3 (45Spink C.H. Yeager M.D. Feigenson G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We show here that DiI-C18 is excluded from the sphingolipid-rich phase and rather favors the DOPC-rich phase. The unambigous phase assignment was carried out by determining the partitioning of GM1, a ganglioside frequently used to identify sphingolipid-enriched rafts (46Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of GUVs with the AlexaFluor conjugate of cholera toxin B subunit (AF-CTB), for which GM1 is the natural receptor, the complex GM1-CTB was detected only in areas from which DiI-C18 was strongly excluded (SM-enriched). Fig. 1 shows a series of confocal images of GUVs with different lipid compositions and well illustrates the lipid organization and domain morphology when the fraction of cholesterol is varied. GUVs made of pure DOPC exhibited uniform DiI-C18 fluorescence (Fig. 1A). Here, the lipids were in the fluid phase at room temperature, as following photobleaching of a spot, a quick recovery of fluorescence was observed. GUVs prepared from pure SM were, within the optical resolution, also uniformly fluorescent, but in this case the membrane was in the solid state, at room temperature. Consistently, following photobleaching, no significant recovery of fluorescence was observed within hours (see Fig. 1B). Uniform fluorescence was also observed in bilayers formed from DOPC/SM (0.5/0.5 molar ratio) (not shown). However, inclusion of as little as 10 mol% of cholesterol in the SM/DOPC (0.5/0.5) bilayer, sufficed to induce lipid segregation, as evidenced by the preferential partitioning of DiI-C18 in one phase (red areas in Fig. 1C). Strikingly, the marker partitioned in the fluid-disordered phase by a factor of ∼50, assuming the quantum efficiency of DiI-C18 was the same in both lipid phases. Alexa-Fluor-labeled cholera toxin AF-CTB bound to areas in the GUVs, from which DiI-C18 was excluded and formed fluorescent regions exactly complementary to the ones covered by DiI-C18 (green areas in Fig. 1C). The size of SM-enriched domains could vary from a few microns up to a size covering almost half of a 20 μm-sized GUV. Unilamellarity of the vesicles allowed us to look for phase interlayer coupling and it was found that, in all of the GUVs, the phase domains comprised both apposing membrane leaflets. Phase separation was also visualized at higher amounts of cholesterol (SM/DOPC = 0.5/0.5), as shown in Fig. 1D for 20 mol% and in Fig. 1E for 33 mol% of cholesterol. The domain morphology was the same as described for 10 mol% cholesterol, except that the total surface area of the SM-enriched phase increased with the amount of cholesterol. At 50 mol% cholesterol, rafts were no longer observed within the optical resolution (Fig. 1F). Similarly, uniform fluorescence from DiI-C18 and GM1-bound AF-CTB was detected in GUVs with 65 mol% cholesterol (not shown).Membrane Lipid Mobility Is Controlled by Cholesterol—We assessed the membrane lipid mobility of GUVs made from ternary mixtures of DOPC/SM/cholesterol by measuring the diffusion coefficient of DiI-C18 by FCS. In Fig. 2A, correlation curves are shown for the liquid-disordered, DOPC-enriched domain, where DiI-C18 preferentially partitioned, and in Fig. 2B those for the liquid-ordered, SM-enriched domain, from which DiI-C18 was largely excluded. Note that the sensitivity of FCS allows one to measure lipid diffusion with the fluorescent marker at very low concentrations in both phases. As soon as phase separation occurred, in the presence of 10 mol% of cholesterol (Fig. 2A, dash (d)), the lipid mobility in liquid-disordered domains (D = 4.9 ± 0.3 × 10–8 cm2/s) almost matched the one of pure DOPC membranes (D = 6.3 ± 0.2 × 10–8 cm2/s, Fig. 2A, dot (a)). This mobility was significantly higher than that measured in DOPC/SM (0.5/0.5) GUVs in the absence of cholesterol (D = 2.6 ± 0.2 × 10–8 cm2/s, Fig. 2A, solid (e)). An increase in the cholesterol concentration hardly affected the mobility value of DiI-C18 relative to values measured for pure DOPC. On the other hand, cholesterol greatly varied the lipid mobility in the SM-enriched phase (Fig. 2B), where lipid diffusion was significantly slower than in the fluid-disordered phase and in the SM/DOPC (0.5/0.5) mixture without cholesterol (Fig. 2B, solid (a)). However, by increasing the amount of cholesterol, the membrane lipid mobility in SM-enriched domains greatly increased, from D = 0.105 ± 0.031 × 10–8 cm2/s (10 mol% cholesterol, Fig. 2B, dash (f)) up to D = 0.795 ± 0.108 × 10–8 cm2/s (33 mol% cholesterol, Fig. 2B, dash dot dot (d)) approaching that of SM/DOPC (0.5/0.5) mixtures. By further increasing the amount of cholesterol, the domains disappeared but the lipid mobility remained higher than that of the SM-rich domains (50 mol% cholesterol, Fig. 2B, short dash (b)), though lower than in SM/DOPC = 0.5/0.5 GUVs. Any further increase in cholesterol concentration made the whole membrane stiffer (e.g. 65 mol% cholesterol in Fig. 2B, short dash dot (c)). Taking different SM/PC molar ratios ≥ 1 (e.g. 0.53/0.13), the domain morphology and the lipid diffusion were unchanged (see Table I). On the other hand, in the case of SM/PC molar ratios < 1, no domains were visualized by confocal microscopy and the lipid dynamics measured was rather high and very close to that in pure DOPC (e.g. SM/DOPC 0.13/0.53, see Table I). For all of the FCS curves, excellent fits were produced with a one-component normal Brownian diffusion model (37Schwille P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 34: 383-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The diffusion coefficients, calculated from the fitting of FCS curves shown in Fig. 2, are reported as a function of mol% of cholesterol in Fig. 3 (see also Table I).Fig. 2Ternary lipid mixtures of SM/DOPC/cholesterol exhibit phase separation. A, FCS curves were recorded for the fluid-disordered, DOPC-enriched phase at increasing cholesterol concentration (dash (d) indicates 10 mol%, dash dot (c) indicates 20 mol%, and dash dot dot (b) indicates 33 mol%). The correlation decays almost matched the one from GUVs of pure DOPC (dot, a) and were much faster than those from GUVs of SM/DOPC = 0.5/0.5 (solid, e), of SM/DOPC = 0.5/0.5 with 50 mol% (short dash, f) or 65 mol% of cholesterol (short dash dot, g). B, FCS curves were recorded for the fluid-ordered, SM-enriched phase at increasing cholesterol concentration (dash (f) indicates 10 mol%, dash dot (e) indicates 20 mol%, and dash dot dot (d) indicates 33 mol%).

For all of these binary compositions, GUVs showed no phase separation by confocal microscopy. The FCS measurements of DiI-C18 mobility could be well fitted with a one diffusion-component. In Fig. 4A, FCS curves recorded for DOPC/cholesterol membranes are shown. The diffusion coefficients obtained from the fitting are plotted as a function of cholesterol concentration in Fig. 4B: a gradual shift of lipid mobility toward lower values is observed upon increase of the amount of cholesterol. Compared with DOPC/cholesterol mixtures, the opposite effect of the cholesterol was observed in SM/cholesterol mixtures, where the lipid mobility increased upon increase of mol% of cholesterol (see FCS curves in Fig. 4C and the corresponding diffusion coefficients reported as a function of mol% of cholesterol in Fig. 4D).

The key enzyme of the cytoplasmic mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway is 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR). Treatment of Tobacco Bright Yellow-2 (TBY-2) cells by the HMGR-specific inhibitor mevinolin led to growth reduction and induction of apparent HMGR activity, in parallel to an increase in protein representing two HMGR isozymes. Maximum induction was observed at 24 h. 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose (DX), the dephosphorylated first precursor of the plastidial 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, complemented growth inhibition by mevinolin in the low millimolar concentration range. Furthermore, DX partially re-established feedback repression of mevinolin-induced HMGR activity. Incorporation studies with [1,1,1,4-2H4]DX showed that sterols, normally derived from MVA, in the presence of mevinolin are synthesized via the MEP pathway. Fosmidomycin, an inhibitor of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, the second enzyme of the MEP pathway, was utilized to study the reverse complementation. Growth inhibition by fosmidomycin of TBY-2 cells could be partially overcome by MVA. Chemical complementation was further substantiated by incorporation of [2-13C]MVA into plastoquinone, representative of plastidial isoprenoids. Best rates of incorporation of exogenous stably labeled precursors were observed in the presence of both inhibitors, thereby avoiding internal isotope dilution."

The proteasome is the major cellular proteolytic machinery, the function of which is impaired during replicative senescence. However, the exact causes of its malfunction in these conditions are unknown. Using WI38 fibroblasts as a model for cellular senescence we have observed reduced levels of proteasomal peptidase activities coupled with increased levels of both oxidized and ubiquitinated proteins in senescent cells. We have found the catalytic subunits of the 20 S complex and subunits of the 19 S regulatory complex to be down-regulated in senescent cells. This is accompanied by a decrease in the level of both 20 S and 26 S complexes. Partial inhibition of proteasomes in young cells caused by treatment with specific inhibitors induced a senescence-like phenotype, thus demonstrating the fundamental importance of the proteasome for retaining cellular maintenance and homeostasis. Stable overexpression of β1 and β5 subunits in WI38 established cell lines was shown to induce elevated expression levels of β1 subunit in β5 transfectants and vice versa. Transfectants possess increased proteasome activities and most importantly, increased capacity to cope better with various stresses.

Normal human fibroblasts undergo a limited number of divisions in culture and progressively they reach a state of irreversible growth arrest, a process termed as replicative senescence. Senescent fibroblasts are viable and fully functional, however, they exhibit several morphological and biochemical changes as compared with their young/proliferating counterparts (reviewed in Ref. 1Campisi J. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). They have an irregular shape, do not line up in parallel arrays, have larger nuclei, shorter telomeres, altered gene expression, and accumulate damaged proteins. Based on the observed differences between young and senescent cells several theories have been developed to explain the aging process. It has been proposed that there is an intrinsic genetic program that regulates the phenomenon; in contrast it has been also suggested that senescence (and aging) results from the accumulation of deleterious changes over time. There is experimental evidence partially supporting each statement. For example, the telomere shortening hypothesis along with the observation that some senescence-related genes can induce senescence when overexpressed in primary proliferating cells (e.g. p21 and p16) or delay it (e.g. telomerase), indicates that senescence lies on a genetic background. However, it is also established that exposure to various cytotoxic environmental factors (such as oxidants) leads to accumulation of damage, failure of homeostasis, and senescence (reviewed in Refs. 2Finkel T.

Therefore more detailed and comprehensive studies are needed to unravel fully the exact cause(s) of this intriguing and inevitable biological phenomenon. Although often neglected, protein degradation is a major intracellular function, which is not only responsible for housekeeping but also for the regulation of important cellular functions, such as homeostasis and survival. The proteasome is a non-lysosomal threonine protease. It is responsible for the degradation of many intracellular proteins, including abnormal, misfolded, denatured, or otherwise damaged proteins (reviewed in Ref. 4Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) as well as perfectly healthy proteins, which have to be removed for normal cellular functioning (reviewed in Ref. 5Gaczynska M.

The 20 S proteasome is a 700-kDa protease composed of 28 subunits arranged as a barrel-shaped structure of four heptameric rings. The two outside rings contain one copy each of seven different but related α-type subunits. Likewise, both inside rings contain one copy each of seven different but related β-subunits where the catalytic sites are localized.

In mammalian cells, the 20 S core complex can be flanked at both ends by 19 S regulatory complexes or by 11 S (PA28) complexes, giving rise to the 26 S proteasome and the PA28 –20 S proteasome complexes, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 9DeMartino G.N.

Using oligonucleotide array techniques, the expression of several proteasome subunits has been found to decline with age in: human dermal fibroblasts (24Ly D.H. Lockhart D.J. Lerner R.A. Schultz P.G. Science. 2000; 287: 2486-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), the skeletal muscle of the C57BL/6 mouse (25Lee C.K. Klopp R.G. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A.

Grune T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) as well as in skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes derived from aged donors (14Bulteau A.L. Petropoulos I.

Med. 2000; 28: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, in all these preliminary studies only one or two representative subunits of the 20 S complex were analyzed. These fragmented data suggest that aging has profound effects on the proteasome, which in turn may influence its proteolytic activities. In this study, we have taken a detailed molecular approach regarding the role of the proteasome in replicative senescence and survival of human fibroblasts. We first demonstrate that senescent cells exhibit reduced levels of all examined proteasomal activities that are accompanied by lower proteasome content and protein expression levels of some but not all proteasome subunits. We demonstrate that when the proteasome is inhibited partially a senescence-like phenotype is triggered. Finally, we investigate the effects of stable overexpression of β1 or β5 subunits in cellular survival to proteasome inhibitors and oxidative stress. This is the first report of enhanced cellular survival that is attributed to a better function of the proteasome because of the overexpression of one of its subunits. Accordingly, these results strongly suggest a central role of the proteasome during cellular senescence and survival in response to stress in human fibroblasts.

Primary antibodies against ubiquitinated proteins (sc8017), ApoJ (sc6419), p16 (sc467), p21 (sc817), and β-actin (sc1616) as well as secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Oxidized proteins were detected with anti-2,4-dinitrophenol antibody from the OxyBlot™ protein oxidation detection kit (Intergen). Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Human embryonic fibroblasts WI38, WI38/T, IMR90, and MRC5 were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 1% non-essential amino acids (complete medium). WI38 fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/75-cm2 flask (unless otherwise noted), were subcultured at a split ratio 1:2 when cells reached confluence, until they entered senescence at about 40 cumulative population doublings. In all experimental procedures described below early passage (young; cumulative population doublings <25) and late passage (senescent; cumulative population doublings >39) WI38 cultures were used. Cells were fed ∼16 h prior to the assay and cell number was determined in duplicates using a Coulter Z2 counter (Coulter Corp.). β-Galactosidase Staining—Staining for β-galactosidase activity was performed as previously described (29Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubel I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 × 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde for 5 min, washed again with PBS, and finally stained for 24 h at 37 °C in the absence of CO2, in staining solution (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 40 mm citric acid, and 12 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0) containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. Immunofluorescence Antigen Staining and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope Analysis—For immunofluorescence labeling, cells grown on coverslips were washed with cold PBS and were subsequently fixed with 4% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by cell permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS; fixation with –20 °C cold MetOH yielded similar results. Immunolabeling of proteasomes was carried out using antibodies against α6 and α7 subunits. The antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer); the secondary anti-mouse IgG/fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody was diluted 1:300 in blocking buffer. Images of the mounted coverslips were taken using a Leica TCS SP-1 confocal laser scanning microscope. Routine procedures, applied as controls to demonstrate the specificity of the antibody used, were: (a) the usage of normal serum instead of the reactive antibody and (b) omission of the first antibody. All controls appeared free of any immunofluorescence background. Stable Transfections—Expression vectors encoding for the full-length β1 subunit and β5 subunit cDNAs (plasmids pREP7-hygro.β1 and pBJ1-neo.β5, respectively) were the generous gifts of Drs. K. Tanaka and K. Rock (30Akiyama K. Yokota K. Kagawa S. Shimbara N. Tamura T. Akioka H. Nothwang H.G. Noda C. Tanaka K. Ichihara A.

The WI38/T cells were transfected with either plasmids or empty vectors by using the electroporation method. Briefly, 107 cells were mixed with 50 μg of DNA and were electroporated at 260 V, 960 microfarads (Gene Pulser™, Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were split 48 h later and were maintained in complete medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (for pBJ1-neo and pBJ1-neo.β5 plasmids) or 100 μg/ml hygromycin-B (for pREP7-hygro and pREP7-hygro.β1 plasmids). Colonies of stable transfectants were isolated after 3–4 weeks of selection and propagated into cell lines. In all cases, transfectants were tested for the appropriate protein expression levels by immunoblot analysis. Clonogenic Assays—104 cells (WI38/T cell lines stably transfected with empty vectors, β1 and β5) were seeded in 6-well plates in duplicates. After 24 h, cells were treated with 100 nm epoxomicin, 10 μm MG132, or 300 μm H2O2 for 2.5 h in fresh medium. Cultures were then washed thoroughly and maintained in complete medium until they formed colonies (about 10 days), which were scored by Crystal Violet staining. In parallel, the number of treated cells after the same recovery period was estimated in duplicate experiments. Empty vectors (pREP7-hygro and pBJ1-neo) gave similar results in all assays (shown as mean values in Figures and Table I). Each experiment was performed at least 4 times. For immunoblot detection of carbonyl groups into proteins, 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates in normal medium and 24 h later they were treated with 300 μm H2O2 for 30 min. Proteins were extracted 24 h after H2O2 treatment.Table IClonogenic assays of stable β1, β5, and vector transfectants after treatment with epoxomicin, MG132, or H2O2MG132EpoxomicinH2O2Vectors11.14 ± 2.5315.50 ± 1.759.28 ± 0.74β1.824.80 ± 4.2325.43 ± 2.3018.00 ± 1.00β1.1319.75 ± 2.3919.50 ± 1.1920.00 ± 2.74β5.824.50 ± 1.5028.50 ± 2.5029.17 ± 1.40β5.1926.75 ± 2.4931.00 ± 1.0832.00 ± 1.08 Open table in a new tab Proteasome Inhibitors (Epoxomicin and MG132) Treatment—2 × 105 cells were seeded in normal medium and 24 h later they were treated in triplicates with epoxomicin or MG132 (dissolved in Me2SO), or an equal volume of the solvent (control cultures) in the presence of normal medium. Constant treatment with epoxomicin, a more potent and specific inhibitor of the proteasome, was performed as follows: fresh medium containing 20 nm epoxomicin was added in cell cultures every 24 h continuously for 4 days (epoxomicin was replaced every day to exclude the possibility of its inactivation at 37 °C). Repetitive treatment with MG132 was performed as follows: 10 μm MG132 was added in cell cultures for 2 h. Cells were washed with PBS, left to recover for 22 h, and treatment was repeated 3 additional times. Cultures at this stage were named as 4 + 0 days (i.e. 4 days of treatment, constantly with epoxomicin or repetitively with MG132). These cultures were re-seeded, washed thoroughly with PBS, and then maintained in normal medium for an additional period of 1 or 2 weeks. Assays were performed immediately after treatment (4 + 0 days) as well as 1 (referred to as 4 + 7 days) and 2 weeks (referred to as 4 + 14 days) later. Quantitative Analysis of Cellular Apoptosis—For the quantitative analysis and determination of the cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments, that are indicative of on-going apoptosis, the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS photometric enzyme immunoassay method (Roche Diagnostics) was used. Briefly, 105 cells were seeded in triplicates in 6-well plates for 24 h and were then treated with 100 nm epoxomicin, 10 μm MG132, or 300 μm H2O2 for 2.5 h, followed by a recovery period in complete medium for an additional 24 h. The extent of the induced apoptosis was then quantitatively measured by the ELISAPLUS death assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the determination of the induced apoptosis in WI38 cells continuously treated with epoxomicin, 105 cells were seeded in triplicates in 6-well plates for 24 h and were then treated with 20 nm epoxomicin or the solvent (Me2SO, control cultures) for 4 days as described in the previous section. Triplicate sets of samples were analyzed right after treatment (4 + 0 days), 1 (4 + 7 days), and 2 weeks (4 + 14 days) after treatment. Cellular Proliferation-DNA Synthesis Analysis—For the determination of DNA synthesis the Cell Proliferation ELISA 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine colorimetric immunoassay method (Roche Diagnostics) was used. Briefly, 2 × 103 cells were seeded in 96-well plates for 24 h and were then treated with 20 nm epoxomicin or the solvent (Me2SO, control cultures) for 4 days as described previously. Sextuplicate sets of samples were labeled for 3 h with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine and DNA synthesis was analyzed right after treatment (4 + 0 days), 1 (4 + 7 days), and 2 weeks (4 + 14 days) after treatment, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteasome Peptidase Assays and Protein Determination—CT-L, PGPH, and T-L activities of the proteasome in crude extracts were assayed with the hydrolysis of fluorogenic peptides, LLVY-AMC, LLE-NA, and LSTR-MCA, respectively, for 30 min at 37 °C, as described previously (16Chondrogianni N. Petropoulos I. Franceschi C. Friguet B. Gonos E.S. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Proteasome activity was determined as the difference between the total activity of crude extracts or fractions and the remaining activity in the presence of 20 μm MG132. Assays of 26 S proteasomes were carried out in 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm ATP and assays of 20 S proteasomes were performed in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.02% SDS as described previously (32Rivett A.J. Savory P.J. Djaballah H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 331-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were harvested at the indicated time points, lysed in non-reducing Laemmli buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE (12% separating gel) according to standard procedures (33Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for blotting with appropriate antibodies. Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence were used to detect the bound primary antibodies. Immunoblot detection of carbonyl groups into proteins was performed with the OxyBlot™ protein oxidation detection kit (Intergen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein loading was tested by stripping each membrane and reprobing it with β-actin antibody. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Separation of Proteasome Complexes by Gel Filtration—Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm ATP and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Extracts were centrifuged at 11,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and then an equal amount of protein from early/late passage cells (0.5–1.5 mg) was fractionated by gel filtration using a Pharmacia Superose 6 FPLC column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, 5 mm ATP, and 100 mm NaCl (34Rivett A.J. Bose S. Pemberton A.J. Brooks P.B. Onion O. Shirley D. Stratford F.L.L. Forti K. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The peak fractions containing 26 S and 20 S proteasomes were determined by activity assays (CT-L activity), which were carried out in duplicate. Immunoprecipitation of Proteasomes and Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Immunoprecipitated proteasomes were prepared as follows. Cell monolayers were washed and scraped into cold PBS containing 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. For radioactive-labeled immunoprecipitation, prior to washing and scraping, cells were starved in methionine-deficient medium for 1 h, followed by pulse labeling for 4 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in methionine-deficient medium. Scraped cells were diluted directly in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 containing 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (lysis buffer). Cell extracts (all equilibrated in lysis buffer) were then cleared by adding normal mouse serum and protein-A agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Meanwhile, protein A-agarose beads equilibrated in lysis buffer were coupled with 1–2 μg of antibody against α6 subunit for 3 h at 4 °C with constant rocking. The target antigen was then immunoprecipitated by adding in the pre-coupled antibody against α6 subunit-protein A the pre-cleared extracts. Binding reactions were performed overnight at 4 °C with constant rocking. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were collected, washed 4 times in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm ATP, 75 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (washing buffer), and eluted from the agarose beads by boiling for 5 min in the washing buffer without NaCl. Controls used to demonstrate the specificity of the observed immunoprecipitations included the use of normal serum instead of the specific antibody. Following immunoprecipitation of proteasomes, samples were processed for one-dimensional SDS-PAGE as described above. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out as follows. Immunoprecipitated proteasomes (starting from 650 μg of crude extracts) were diluted in sample buffer (9 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 2% Pharmalytes pH 3–10, 20 mm dithiothreitol and bromphenol blue). The first dimension was performed with Immobilines Drystrips (nonlinear, pH 3–10, length 13 cm) using the Multiphor II system (Amersham Biosciences). The Drystrip was rehydrated with the sample in a reswelling tray (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at room temperature and then focused for 50,000 volt hours (23 h). After focusing, the strips were equilibrated in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) SDS (equilibration buffer) supplemented with 1% dithiothreitol for 15 min and in equilibration buffer containing 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide and traces of bromphenol blue for 15 min. The second dimension was performed on a 12% SDS-PAGE using the Protean II system (Bio-Rad). Gels were fixed, amplified, dried, and directly exposed to low energy screen of STORM 860 phosphorimager. Gels were analyzed by the “STORM 860” and “Image Master 2D Elite analysis” softwares (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Statistical calculations and graphs were performed with the Microsoft Excel software. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance single factor and p value was used to determine the level of significance (p < 0.05). All values were reported as mean (the average of three independent experiments) ± S.E., unless otherwise indicated. Replicative Senescence Is Accompanied by a Decrease of Proteasome Activities and the Expression of Certain Subunits— Initially, we aimed to reveal the changes of the overall proteasome status and function in early (young) and late (senescent) passage WI38 fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 1A, all three major proteasomal activities (CT-L, PGPH, and T-L) were found to be significantly decreased in late passage cells as compared with their young counterparts. The activities were reduced by 2–4-fold in late passage cells with the most affected being the PGPH activity. It is well documented that oxidized proteins are degraded by the proteasome. Therefore a decrease of proteasomal activities would be expected to lead to increased levels of oxidized proteins. As shown in Fig. 1B (left panel) we observed accumulation of oxidized proteins in senescent cells consistent with the reduction in proteasome activities observed in these cells. We have also investigated the ability of senescent cells to ubiquitinate proteins for degradation by the proteasome. As shown in Fig. 1B (right panel), we observed increased amounts of ubiquitinated proteins in senescent cells. We next investigated the loss of proteasome function in senescent fibroblasts. Therefore we examined whe"

Initial studies indicated that final cleavage of APP by the γ-secretase (a complex containing presenilin and nicastrin) to produce Aβ occurred in the endosomal/lysosomal system. However, other studies showing a predominant endoplasmic reticulum localization of the γ-secretase proteins and a neutral pH optimum of in vitro γ-secretase assays have challenged this conclusion. We have recently identified nicastrin as a major lysosomal membrane protein. In the present work, we use Western blotting and immunogold electron microscopy to demonstrate that significant amounts of mature nicastrin, presenilin-1, and APP are co-localized with lysosomal associated membrane protein-1 (cAMP-1) in the outer membranes of lysosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these membranes contain an acidic γ-secretase activity, which is immunoprecipitable with an antibody to nicastrin. These experiments establish APP, nicastrin, and presenilin-1 as resident lysosomal membrane proteins and indicate that γ-secretase is a lysosomal protease. These data reassert the importance of the lysosomal/endosomal system in the generation of Aβ and suggest a role for lysosomes in the pathophysiology of AD.

Most investigators believe that the production and cerebral deposition of amyloid plaques composed of the 38–43-amino acid β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide is central to the development of AD (the amyloid cascade hypothesis) (1Selkoe D.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 924: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Aβ peptides are generated by 2 sequential proteolytic cleavages from a large transmembrane protein called the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This occurs first at a “β” site by the enzyme BACE (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme, β-secretase), which removes the large extracellular domain of APP and then at a slightly variable “γ” position (by the γ-secretase) within the transmembrane domain of APP (2Sisodia S.S. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Many lines of evidence support the hypothesis that γ-secretase cleavage of APP, Notch, and other proteins requires a protein complex containing the presenilins (PS-1 and PS-2) and nicastrin (reviewed in Refs. 2Sisodia S.S.

St. George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The strongest evidence for Aβ generation in the endosomal/lysosomal system comes from experiments in which APP was labeled at the cell surface, with 125I, biotin, or an antibody, and followed as it was endocytosed, cleaved into Aβ, and then either secreted or retained internally. This basic experiment has been repeated by multiple groups in a variety of cell types including cultured human neurons (14Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J.

(c) Aβ secretion from cultured cells can be dramatically reduced by treatments that prevent endosomal/lysosomal acidification, e.g. ammonium chloride and bafilomycin A1 (24Siman R. Mistretta S.

(d) Deletion of the internalization/endocytosis signal sequence, which for many proteins serve as a lysosomal targeting signal, from the C-terminal (cytoplasmic tail) of APP markedly reduces Aβ production (15Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other evidence suggesting a lysosomal/endosomal localization of γ-secretase activity comes from the study of the cell surface receptor Notch, which has been suggested to undergo endocytosis and γ-cleavage in a manner similar to APP (27Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 28Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J.

Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The idea that the same γ-secretase is responsible for both cleavages is supported by the fact that Notch processing is reduced in PS-1-deficient cells (30Song W. Nadeau P. Yuan M. Yang X. Shen J. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6959-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and that Notch and APP appear to compete for PS-1 (31Berezovska O. Jack C. Deng A.

Additionally, purified presenilin-containing complexes have recently been shown to cleave both APP and Notch (32Chen F. Gu Y. Hasegawa H. Ruan X. Arawaka S. Fraser P. Westaway D. Mount H.

The problem with this model of lysosomal/endosomal production of Aβ is that numerous experiments appear to show PS1 and γ-secretase activity localized to the ER and Golgi. For example, PS-1 is most easily observed in the ER using fluorescence microscopy (33Greenfield J.P. Tsai J. Gouras G.K. Hai B. Thinakaran G. Checler F. Sisodia S.S. Greengard P. Xu H. Proc. Natl.

The conflict between the apparent ER localization of PSs and nicastrin and the endosomal/lysosomal site of Aβ production is a serious problem in understanding the pathophysiology of AD, with some authors suggesting that it may represent a “spatial paradox” with the protease and its substrate occupying separate cellular compartments (3Annaert W. De Strooper B. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have demonstrated the presence of PS-1·nicastrin complexes on the cell surface (40Dewji N.N. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although these studies show that PS-1 is not limited entirely to the ER, they do not totally resolve the spatial paradox, if one accepts the above data localizing Aβ generation to the endosomal/lysosomal system. Additionally, if Aβ generation is in the endosomal/lysosomal system, failure to co-localize nicastrin, PS-1, and APP processing to these compartments undermines the hypothesis that presenilin-containing complexes are the γ-secretase. Numerous models have been suggested to reconcile these incongruities in intracellular localization. These include: (a) that α- or β-cleaved APP (generated at the cell surface or in the endosomal compartment) must be recycled back to the ER or Golgi for additional processing, or (b) that PS-1 is not a component of the γ-secretase and another enzyme remains to be discovered (23Chen F.

It was initiated by the identification of nicastrin, through de novo quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometry sequencing of tryptic peptides generated from a major protein spot excised from a two-dimensional-(IEF-SDS) gel of separated lysosomal membrane (LM) proteins from highly purified organelles. Furthermore, we demonstrated by protease protection that nicastrin was on the outer limiting membrane of the lysosome, i.e. not contained in an intralysosomal vesicle (44Bagshaw R.D. Pasternak S.H. Mahuran D.J. Callahan J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We now show that mature nicastrin, PS-1, and APP are (a) components of the outer LM, and (b) significantly enriched in the LM as compared with other intracellular fractions. We confirm the co-localization of nicastrin and PS-1 with LAMP-1 (lysosomal associated membrane protein-1) on the limiting lysosome membrane by double immunogold labeling of ultrathin cryosections. Finally, we extend these observations by demonstrating that our LMs are enriched in an acid γ-secretase activity that is precipitable with an anti-nicastrin antibody. Antibodies—Antibodies used were: APP C-terminal (Sigma), nicastrin (Affinity Bioreagents), Aβ, PS-1 (N-terminal), calnexin, LAMP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rab7 (CytoSignal). 6E10 was purchased as part of the “β-Amyloid Multipeptide ProteinChip Kit” (Ciphergen). Lysosome (Tritosome) Isolation Protocol—The isolation of tyloxapol-filled lysosomes has been described (44Bagshaw R.D. Pasternak S.H. Mahuran D.J. Callahan J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and is summarized in Fig. 1. Briefly, Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River) were given an intraperitoneal injection of the non-lytic detergent tyloxapol (Triton WR 1339; Sigma) 5 days prior to sacrifice. Rats are sacrificed and the livers were removed. Livers were then homogenized, and the nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min to yield a postnuclear supernatant (PNS). A crude organelle fraction was then collected by centrifugation at 34,000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 45% sucrose. This solution was layered beneath a discontinuous gradient of 14.3% sucrose and 34.5% sucrose and centrifuged at 77,000 × g for 2 h. Tyloxapol-filled lysosomes were removed from the 14.3-34.5% interface, diluted, and pelleted at 28,000 × g for 30 min. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm) was added to all solutions. Enzyme assays for β-hexosaminidase (45Tommasini R. Mahuran D.J. Lowden J.A. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and citrate synthase (46Robinson J.B. Brent L.G. Sumegi B. Srere P.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. An Enzymatic Approach to the Study of the Krebs Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle: Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 160-161Google Scholar) were performed on each fraction. Lysosomal Subfractionation—Soluble (luminal) lysosomal proteins were isolated by resuspending the lysosomes in PBS, freeze-fracturing them in dry ice/ethanol, and removing membranes by centrifugation for 30 min at 355,000 × g at 4 C (2×). The membrane-associated proteins were solubilized by resuspending the pellet in 0.1 m NaCO3, pH 11.0, incubated on ice for 30 min, with membranes removed by centrifugation at 355,000 × g for 30 min. The remaining pellet was solubilized in 2% SDS and was designated the integral membrane protein fraction. Western Blot Analysis—Western blots were performed as in described in Ref. 47Hou Y. Vavougios G. Hinek A. Wu K.K. Hechtman P. Kaplan F. Mahuran D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 52-58PubMed Google Scholar. Analysis was performed on a Macintosh Powerbook G4 computer using the public domain NIH Image 1.63 program (developed at National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet). 2www.rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image. Routine Transmission Electron Microscopy Preparation—Tyloxapol-filled lysosomes in sucrose were brought to 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, incubated 1 h on ice, and pelleted in a benchtop microcentrifuge for 15 min. Pellets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for a minimum of 2 h prior to a thorough wash in 0.1 m Sorenson's phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. They were postfixed in phosphate-buffered 2% OsO4 for 1 h, rinsed in distilled water, dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanols, and infiltrated and embedded via propylene oxide in Epon araldite. Following polymerization, ultrathin sections were prepared with a diamond knife and an ultramicrotome and mounted on grids. Sections were then stained with saturated ethanolic uranyl acetate and lead citrate prior to examination and photography in the transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 1200 EXII, JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA). Immunogold Labeling of Ultrathin Cryosections—Tyloxapol-filled lysosomes from the sucrose gradient were brought to 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde, 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and incubated 1 h on ice. They were then pelleted in a benchtop microcentrifuge for 15 min and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 4 h at room temperature. Samples were then embedded in 15% gelatin in PBS and minced into 1 mm3 cubes, infused with 2.3 m sucrose for several hours, mounted on aluminum pins, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were then prepared at –95 °C on a diamond knife using a Leica Ultracut S CryoUltramicrotome (Leica Canada, Willowdale, Ontario, Canada). Sections were transferred to formvar-coated nickel grids using a loop of molten sucrose. After several rinses in PBS containing 0.15% glycine and 0.5% BSA and PBS with BSA alone, samples were incubated with antibodies against either PS-1 or nicastrin for 1 h at room temperature. The grids were then rinsed thoroughly in PBS/BSA prior to incubation in goat anti-rabbit IgG 5-nm gold complexes for 1 h (room temperature). After a thorough rinse in PBS/BSA samples were incubated for 1 h (room temperature) in an antibody against human LAMP-1 (moderate cross-reactivity toward rat LAMP-1). The grids were then washed in PBS followed by an additional incubation at room temperature in goat anti-mouse IgG 10-nm complex for 1 h. The specimens were then rinsed in PBS and extensively washed in distilled water. Grids were then stabilized in a thin film of methyl cellulose containing 0.2% uranyl acetate and examined in the transmission electron microscopy. γ-Secretase Assay Substrate—A DNA template encoding amino acids 671–770 of human APP was amplified by PCR. The forward primer included a T7 promoter, a ribosome binding site, and a Met added in front of position 1 (GGATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAACAGCCACCATGGATGCAGAATTCCGACATG). The reverse primer contained a poly-A tail (T29 CTAGTTCTGCATCTGCTCAAA). This PCR product was used directly in in vitro transcription/translation kits (TnT T7 Quick for PCR DNA (Promega) or RTS100 (Roche Diagnostics)). To produce a radiolabeled probe, 10–20 μCi of [35S]methionine was added per reaction. Small molecules were removed by dialysis (48 h) against dH2O using 10,000 M r cutoff microdialysis cups (Pierce). In Vitro γ-Secretase Assay—Membranes were prepared by freeze/thaw lysis of whole lysosomes (or other fractions) in PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl. After 30 min on ice, membranes were recovered by centrifugation (355,000 × g, 15 min). The pellets were resuspended in PBS and re-centrifuged. Each assay was performed with 10–20 μg of protein in 20 μl in a reaction containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm zinc chloride, 0.25% CHAPSO, 2× Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics), and 50 mm citrate phosphate buffer at the required pH. Immunoprecipitation γ-Secretase Assay—Washed lysosomal membranes (as above) were solubilized in 2% CHAPSO for 1 h on ice, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Solubilized proteins (40 μg) were incubated with BSA-blocked Gamma-Bind beads (Amersham Biosciences) alone, or with 10 μg of an anti-nicastrin antibody at pH 7.5 for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with PBS, 0.25% CHAPSO and incubated with radiolabeled C100 at pH 4.5 for 4 h as above. Surface-enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS)/ProteinChip™ Arrays—The 6E10 antibody (1 μg) was applied to each spot on a PS20 ProteinChip™ Arrays (Ciphergen Biosystems Inc., Fremont, CA) and incubated (2 h at room temperature) in a humidified chamber. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 0.5 m ethanolamine/PBS for 30 min (room temperature). Samples were diluted in PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and incubated on the arrays (2 h, room temperature). The arrays were then washed for 3 × 15 min with PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 3 times for 5 min with PBS, and several rinses with 1 mm HEPES at room temperature. The matrix, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was applied to each spot on the array and mass analysis was performed by SELDI-TOF-MS, using the ProteinChip™ Biology System II. Characterization of Tyloxapol-filled Lysosomes—Lysosomes possess a heterogeneous size and density distribution, making them very difficult to purify. To overcome this problem, we used the tritosome technique developed by De Duve and co-workers (48Leighton F. Poole B. Beaufay H. Baudhuin P. Coffey J.W. Fowler S. De Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 482-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) to purify tyloxapol-filled lysosomes (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1). Extensive studies have documented that tyloxapol-filled lysosomes are biochemically identical to lysosomes (48Leighton F. Poole B. Beaufay H. Baudhuin P. Coffey J.W. Fowler S. De Duve C. J.

Wattiaux-De Coninck S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Similar to the original studies of De Duve and co-workers (48Leighton F. Poole B. Beaufay H. Baudhuin P. Coffey J.W. Fowler S. De Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 482-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), we have previously reported that the tritosome technique routinely yields lysosomes that are ∼70-fold enriched in β-hexosaminidase activity, a lysosomal marker, with essentially no citrate synthase activity, a mitochondrial marker, or NADPH: cytochrome c reductase activity, an ER marker. They are also significantly enriched in β-glucosidase activity, another lysosomal marker (44Bagshaw R.D. Pasternak S.H. Mahuran D.J. Callahan J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Table I summarizes the characteristics of 7 preparations of purified lysosomes. In these preparations 0.13% of the initial protein was recovered in the lysosomal fraction and the overall recovery of lysosomes (as estimated by hexosaminidase activity) was 8%. The specific activity of hexosaminidase was enriched by a factor of 70 in the lysosome fractions. Our estimate of the total lysosomal protein in the liver, based on our recovery of hexosaminidase activity, is 1.6%, which falls within the 1–2% range estimated to be the lysosomal component of cells.Table IPurification of lysosomesProtein yield relative ± S.D.Protein yield averageHexosaminidase yield relative ± S.D.Hexosaminidase yield averageSpecific activity S.D.Purification factor ± S.D.%mg%μM/hμM/h/mgHomogenate100250010022000.9 ± 0.21PNS60 ± 10160050 ± 2011000.7 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.2Organe"

Some ubiquinone analogues have been demonstrated previously to modulate the PTP open-closed transition in isolated mitochondria and thought to act through a common PTP-binding site rather than through oxidation-reduction reactions. We have demonstrated recently both in vitro and in vivo that the ubiquitous free radical scavenger and respiratory chain coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) prevents keratocyte apoptosis induced by excimer laser irradiation more efficiently than other antioxidants. On this basis, we hypothesized that the antiapoptotic property of CoQ10 could be independent of its free radical scavenging ability and related to direct inhibition of PTP opening. In this study, we have verified this hypothesis by evaluating the antiapoptotic effects of CoQ10 in response to apoptotic stimuli, serum starvation, antimycin A, and ceramide, which do not generate free radicals, in comparison to control, free radical-generating UVC irradiation. As hypothesized, CoQ10 dramatically reduced apoptotic cell death, attenuated ATP decrease, and hindered DNA fragmentation elicited by all apoptotic stimuli. This was accompanied by inhibition of mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and caspase 9 activation. Because these events are consequent to mitochondrial PTP opening, we suggest that the antiapoptotic activity of CoQ10 could be related to its ability to prevent this phenomenon.

Our preliminary observations that CoQ10 is endowed with antiapoptotic activity as a free radical scavenger (3Capaccioli S. Nucci C. Schiavone N. Quattrone A. Carella G. Bisantis C. Carella G.

The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) is a complex, large conductance channel that plays a pivotal role in triggering apoptosis (12Green D.R. Reed J.R. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The opening of PTP is responsible for disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane electrochemical gradient (ΔΨ from –180 to 0 mV). The oligomerization of apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family follows, thus forming mitochondrial transmembrane channels through which a number of apoptotic factors are released into the cytoplasm to trigger the mitochondrion-dependent (intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis execution (13Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar, 15De Giorgi F. Lartigue L.

This is orchestrated by caspase cascade activation, which leads to cleavage of cellular substrates. Mitochondrion-dependent (intrinsic) and membrane death receptor-dependent (extrinsic) apoptotic pathways are known to share the same caspases with two exceptions: caspase 9 for the former (16Wajant H. Science. 2002; 296: 1635-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) and caspase 8 for the latter (17Shiozaki E.N. Chai J. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Factors and mechanisms involved in PTP formation are still unclear. Nevertheless, three proteins, the adenine nucleotide translocator, the voltage-dependent anion channel, and cyclophilin-D, appear to play the main structural role (13Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar, 15De Giorgi F. Lartigue L.

Besides a number of ancillary structural/regulative proteins, such as benzodiazepine peripheral receptor, creatine kinase, hexokinase, and Bax, that are recruited by the voltage-dependent anion channel-adenine nucleotide translocator-cyclophilin-D complex, several molecules are positive (Bax, Ca2+, ROS, and atractyloside) or negative (Bcl-2, ATP, bongkrekic acid, and cyclosporin A) determinants of PTP opening (15De Giorgi F.

Irrespective of the method used to induce permeability transition, the opening of PTP was strongly inhibited by some ubiquinone analogues, including Ub0, decyl-Ub, and Ub10, whereas other tested quinones were ineffective or had antithetic effects (23Walter L. Nogueira V. Leverve X. Heitz M.P. Bernardi P. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29521-29527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Specific structural features have been demonstrated to be necessary for regulation of PTP by ubiquinone analogues, independently of their ability to decrease mitochondrial ROS production to the same extent. These results supported the idea that PTP regulation by ubiquinones is exerted through binding to a common site rather than through redox reactions (23Walter L. Nogueira V. Leverve X. Heitz M.P. Bernardi P. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29521-29527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the natural CoQ10 has a very strict structural analogy with the synthetic Ub10 (CoQ2); as shown in Fig. 1, their difference is restricted to the number of side isoprenoid units within the side chain, which has been reported to not influence substantially the folding of the molecule (25Di Bernardo S. Fato R. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These considerations prompted us to hypothesize that what was observed with ubiquinone analogues applied to isolated mitochondria (19Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol.

Res. 2002; 36: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) could underlie a natural phenomenon operating in the whole cell. In line with this possibility, the respiratory chain complex I has been suggested to be a constituent of mitochondrial PTP (26Chauvin C. De Oliveras F. Ronot X. Mousseau M. Leverve X. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41394-41398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Armstrong and co-workers (27Armstrong J.S. Jones D.P.

Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 252-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) have designed a new model for mitochondrial PTP, in which the ROS producer respiratory chain complex III is functionally linked to the permeability transition. The ability of complex III to generate ROS and to open mitochondrial PTP could override the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-2. Noteworthy, both respiratory chain complexes I and III share CoQ10 as electron acceptor or electron donor, respectively. These observations led us to explore the possibility that, besides its free radical scavenging property, CoQ10 may be endowed with antiapoptotic activity as a modulator of PTP opening. In this study we demonstrate that CoQ10 provides effective protection against apoptosis of rabbit keratocytes not only in response to the free radicals generated by UVC irradiation but also in response to three apoptotic stimuli generally known to act independently of free radical generation such as chemical hypoxic drug antimycin A (29Wang J.F. Jerrels T.R. Spitzer J.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the C2-ceramide, a cell-permeable analogue of natural lipidic apoptotic messenger ceramide (30Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 407: 145-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and survival factor withdrawal (serum starvation) (18Desagher S. Martinou J C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). This evidence emerged from examination of two classes of different parameters: 1) ROS, MDA, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity levels for assessment of the effect of our treatments on free radical generation; and 2) cellular morphology, number of living and apoptotic cells, ATP levels, and DNA status for assessment of the effect of our treatments on cell life and death. In contrast, another well known free radical scavenger, vitamin E (α-tocopherol) (31Meydani M. Lancet. 1995; 345: 170-175Abstract PubMed Google Scholar, 32Brigelius-Flohe R. Traber M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), whose effect in association with CoQ10 has been described in our previous work (5Brancato R. Fiore T. Papucci L. Schiavone N. Formigli L. Zecchi Orlandini S. Gobbi P.G. Carones F. Donnini M. Lapucci A. Capaccioli S. J, Refract Surg. 2000; 18: 135-139Crossref Google Scholar), provides effective protection against apoptosis only in response to UVC irradiation. The antiapoptotic activity of CoQ10 was mediated by hindering mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release to cytoplasm, and procaspase 9 activation. This suggests that the mechanism by which CoQ10 prevents apoptosis may involve inhibition of mitochondrial PTP opening that triggers the intrinsic execution pathway of apoptosis. This possibility and the hypothesis that this novel functional activity may underlie physical localization of CoQ10 in the PTP, possibly in association with other components of the complex, is now under study. Cell Cultures—Rabbit corneal keratocytes (RCE cell line) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 1:1, supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 50 IU/ml penicillin, in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were plated at the density of 3 × 105 cells/plate. Treatments—Each of the four damaging agents was applied at doses experimentally established to induce apoptosis: UVC irradiation (254 nm) at 15 mJ/cm2, the respiratory chain blocker antimycin A at 200 μm concentration, the apoptotic signaling lipid C2-ceramide (a synthetic cell-permeable analogue of endogenous ceramides) at 20 μm concentration, and FBS restriction to 0.5%. Treatments with 10 μm CoQ10 or with 10 μm vitamin E (α-tocopherol), both dissolved in 0.04% Lutrol F127 used as vehicle to ensure cellular uptake of this hydrophobic molecule (5Brancato R. Fiore T. Papucci L. Schiavone N. Formigli L. Zecchi Orlandini S. Gobbi P.G. Carones F. Donnini M. Lapucci A. Capaccioli S. J, Refract Surg. 2000; 18: 135-139Crossref Google Scholar, 6Brancato R. Schiavone N. Siano S. Lapucci A. Papucci L. Donnini M. Formigli L. Zecchi Orlandini S. Carella G. Carones F. Capaccioli S. Eur. J. Ophthalmol. 2000; 10: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), were commenced 2 h prior to application of apoptotic stimuli. Vehicle alone-treated cells were used as controls. In some experiments vitamin C (ascorbic acid) was also used. Identification of Apoptosis on the Basis of Cellular Morphology and DNA End Labeling by Klenow-FragEL™ Assay—Apoptotic RCE cells were identified by light microscopy following end labeling of DNA fragments by Klenow-FragEL™ kit (Oncogene Research Products, Boston). Briefly, following apoptotic treatments, the keratocytes were detached from substrate and fixed in 4% formaldehyde and 80% ethanol at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. Prior to detection, the cells (3 × 105) were affixed to glass slides by cytocentrifugation, air-dried, and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In this assay Klenow binds to exposed ends of DNA fragments and catalyzes the template-dependent addition of biotin-labeled deoxyribonucleotides, which are then detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Diaminobenzidine reacts with the labeled fragmented DNA of apoptotic cell nuclei, generating a dark brown insoluble chromogen that contrasts with counterstained methyl green cytoplasms. In contrast, viable cells appear uniformly green or even unstained. Measurement of ROS and MDA-4-HNE Levels and of SOD Activity— The extent of free radical generation by cultured cells exposed to UVC, antimycin A, C2-ceramide, or FBS restriction to 0.5% was measured by means of three independent indexes: reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation level, and superoxide dismutase activity. Generation of ROS was assessed immediately after treatments, using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Sigma) (33Oyama Y. Brain Res. 1994; 635: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), by a confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 1024 ES scanning microscope) equipped with a krypton/argon laser source. The emitted fluorescence was monitored at 488 and 568 nm wavelengths with a Nikon plan Apo × 60 oil-immersion objective. To this purpose, series of optical sections (512 × 512 pixels) were taken through the depth of cells with a thickness of 1 μm at intervals of 0.8 μm. Twenty optical sections for each samples examined were projected as a single composite image by superimposition. To monitor the rate of lipid peroxidation, the levels of typical end products of the process, which are MDA plus 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals, exemplified by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), were determined in the cellular extracts prepared and analyzed at 2 h following treatments. Measurements were made using a colorimetric method at 586 nm, according to the reaction of a chromogenic reagent, N-methyl-2-phenylindole, with MDA and 4-HNE in the presence of methanesulfonic acid at 45 °C (34Esterbauer H. Shaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). SOD activity was determined at 2 h following treatments using a spectrophotometric assay (Bioxytech, Portland, OR). For this purpose, RCE cells were lysed in 4 volumes of water added to 1 volume of cells, and the cellular lysates were extracted with ethanol/chloroform 62.5: 37.5 (v/v) and vortexed for 30 s. Cellular membranes were separated by centrifugation at 3000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The upper phase was collected to determine SOD activity. The absorbance of samples was measured spectrophotometrically at 525 nm. Quantification of Living and Apoptotic Cells—The number of living cells was evaluated by the MTT (C,N-diphenyl-N′-4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl tetrazolium bromide) colorimetric assay (reduction of tetrazolium salt to formazan as described previously (35van de Loosdrecht A.A. Beelen R.H. Ossenkoppele G.J. Broekhoven M.G. Langenhuijsen M.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar)). The cumulative apoptotic events were scored by the time-lapse videomicroscopy using a Zeiss inverted phase contrast microscope equipped with a 10× objective, Panasonic CCD cameras, and JVC BR9030 time-lapse video recorders. After cell detachment from the substrate, an apoptotic event was counted the moment the cell had shrunk completely and blebbing started (36Formigli L. Papucci L. Tani A. Schiavone N. Tempestini A. Orlandini G.E. Capaccioli S. Zecchi Orlandini S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 181: 41-49Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Analysis of ATP Levels—Cellular levels of ATP were evaluated 24 h following apoptotic stimuli, using untreated cells as control as reported previously (36Formigli L. Papucci L. Tani A. Schiavone N. Tempestini A. Orlandini G.E. Capaccioli S. Zecchi Orlandini S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 181: 41-49Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The cells (2–3 × 105) were pelletted, resuspended in distilled water, and boiled for 3–5 min. Samples were then cooled to room temperature and stored frozen at –20 °C for later measurements. ATP in the extracts was quantified by a bioluminescence assay with an ATP determination kit (Molecular Probes), using a liquid scintillation analyzer (Camberra Packard) for bioluminescence analysis, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection of Change in Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential (ΔΨ)—The change in ΔΨ occurring during apoptosis was detected by fluorescence-based assay. The RCE cells were cultured on coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the lipophilic cationic probe 5,5′, 6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1, 5 mg/ml, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 15 min at 37 °C. This dye has a unique feature: at hyperpolarized membrane potentials (to –140 mV) it forms a red fluorescent J-aggregate, whereas at depolarized membrane potentials (to –100 mV) it remains in the green fluorescent monomeric form. Prior to detection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and placed in an open slide-flow loading chamber that was mounted on the stage of a confocal scanning microscope (Bio-Rad) equipped with a krypton/argon laser source. The emitted fluorescence was monitored at 488 and 568 nm wavelengths with a Nikon plan Apo ×60 oil-immersion objective (37Reers M. Smith T.W. Chen L.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Imaging acquisition of the optical sections through the cell was performed as described above. Western Blot Analysis of Cytoplasmic Cytochrome c—RCE cells were evaluated 24 h following application of apoptotic stimuli. Cytosolic fractions were prepared as reported previously (38Ruties S.A. van der Heijden A. Utz P.J. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24799-24807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Proteins in the cytosolic extracts were quantified by the BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Proteins (25 μg/lane) were electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide 12.5% gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a transblotter (Bio-Rad). The nonspecific signals were blocked with blocking buffer (5% w/v instant nonfat milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml of anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen). The membrane was washed and subsequently incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). Detection was carried out using a commercial chemiluminescence procedure (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of Caspase 9 Activity—Caspase 9 activity was determined by the Caspase-9 Colorimetric Protease Assay (BioSource Europe, S.A., Nivelles, Belgium). Cytosolic extracts, prepared by lysing cells with Cell Lysis Buffer provided in the kit, were incubated with the colorimetric substrate Leu-Glu-His-Asp (LEHD) conjugated to the chromophore p-nitroanilide, in 50 μl of 2× Reaction Buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance of samples was measured at A405 nm in Bio-Rad enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Analysis of DNA (Nucleosomal Laddering)—Apoptotic internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was evaluated by classical assay, detecting electrophoretically a separated ladder of fragmented DNA. The genomic DNA was extracted from RCE cells as described by Blankenberg et al. (39Blankenberg F.G. Katsikis P.D. Storrs R.W. Beaulieu C. Spielman D. Chen J.Y. Naumovski L. Tait J.F. Blood. 1997; 89: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose containing ethidium bromide (0.2 μg/ml), UV-visualized, and photographed. Statistical Analysis—The statistical evaluation of the data was performed with the two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired values. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. The data are reported as percentage of the maximal value. UVC Irradiation, Antimycin A, C 2 -ceramide, and Serum Starvation Committed Cultured Keratocytes to Apoptosis—We have previously optimized by time-lapse videomicroscopy the doses of stimuli necessary to commit a substantial number of RCE keratocytes to apoptosis, but not to necrosis, within 24 h after treatments. The following doses were chosen: 15 mJ/cm2 UVC irradiation (254 nm), 200 μm antimycin A, 20 μm C2-ceramide, and serum starvation (0.5% FBS). Free Radical Generation Was Restricted to UVC-Irradiation—We have then analyzed the effects of the apoptotic doses of UVC irradiation, antimycin A, C2-ceramide and serum starvation on free radical generation. For this purpose, three different parameters, which are cellular levels of ROS, MDA-4-HNE levels, and SOD activity, were analyzed after application of apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2A, UVC irradiation was the only apoptotic stimulus able to generate ROS as visualized, immediately after treatment, by confocal microscopy following ROS labeling with the fluorescent indicator (2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate) as described by Formigli et al. (36Formigli L. Papucci L. Tani A. Schiavone N. Tempestini A. Orlandini G.E. Capaccioli S. Zecchi Orlandini S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 181: 41-49Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In keeping with this observation, Fig. 2B shows that only UVC irradiation markedly enhanced MDA-4-HNE levels (left panel) and SOD activity (right panel), evaluated at the 2nd h after treatment, compared with untreated cells (from 5.6 nmol/mg of protein to 19.4 nmol/mg of protein, and from 4.8 units/mg of protein to 17.2 units/mg of protein, respectively). Increase of ROS, MDA-4-HNE, and SOD activity induced by UVC irradiation was substantially lowered by a 2-h pretreatment with either 10 μm CoQ10 or vitamin E (Fig. 2C). CoQ 10 but Not Vitamin E Increased Cell Survival in Response to Free Radical Independent Apoptotic Stimuli—Once ascertained that apoptosis by antimycin A, C2-ceramide and serum starvation was not consequent to free radical generation, the effects of a 2-h pretreatment with 10 μm CoQ10 or vitamin E on cell survival at the 24th h following application of apoptotic stimuli was evaluated by the MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 3, UVC irradiation, antimycin A, C2-ceramide, and serum starvation induced a dramatic decrease in the number of living cells compared with untreated controls, which was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with CoQ10 (upper panel: from 82 to 49%, from 56 to 29%, from 61 to 24%, and from 51 to 80%, respectively). On the contrary, pretreatment with vitamin E was able to attenuate significantly this decrease only in response to UVC irradiation (lower panel: from 82 to 58%). The effects of the 2-h pretreatment with 10 μm CoQ10 or vitamin E on cell apoptosis induced by UVC irradiation, antimycin A, C2-ceramide, and serum starvation were then evaluated using light microscopy and ultramicroscopy (not shown) as reported pre"
https://openalex.org/W2068812138,"Phagocytosis of complement-opsonized targets is a primary function of neutrophils at sites of inflammation, and the clearance of neutrophils that have phagocytosed microbes is important for the resolution of inflammation. Our previous work suggests that phagocytosis leads to rapid neutrophil apoptosis that is inhibited by antibody to the beta2 integrin, Mac-1, and requires NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during phagocytosis. Here we report that phagocytosis-induced cell death (PICD) does not occur in Mac-1-deficient murine neutrophils, suggesting that PICD proceeds through a bona fide Mac-1-dependent pathway. A sustained, intracellular oxidative burst is associated with PICD. Furthermore, PICD does not require traditional death receptors, Fas, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor. TNF but not Fas synergizes with phagocytosis to enhance significantly PICD by increasing the oxidative burst, and this is Mac-1-dependent. Phagocytosis-induced ROS promote cleavage/activation of caspases 8 and 3, key players in most extrinsic (death receptor) mediated pathways of apoptosis, and caspases 8 and 3 but not caspase 9/mitochondria, are required for PICD. This suggests that ROS target the extrinsic versus the intrinsic (stress stimulus) apoptotic pathway. Phagocytosis also triggers a competing MAPK/ERK-dependent survival pathway that provides resistance to PICD likely by down-regulating caspase 8 activation. The anti-apoptotic factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) significantly enhances ROS generation associated with phagocytosis. Despite this, it completely suppresses PICD by sustaining ERK activation and inhibiting caspase 8 activation in phagocytosing neutrophils. Together, these studies suggest that Mac-1-mediated phagocytosis promotes apoptosis through a caspase 8/3-dependent pathway that is modulated by NADPH oxidase-generated ROS and MAPK/ERK. Moreover, TNF and GM-CSF, likely encountered by phagocytosing neutrophils at inflammatory sites, exploit pro-(ROS) and anti-apoptotic (ERK) signals triggered by phagocytosis to promote or suppress PICD, respectively, and thus modulate the fate of phagocytosing neutrophils."

Recent studies of CNP-deficient mice indicate that CNP plays an important role in chondrocyte differentiation and bone formation (11Chusho H. Tamura N. Ogawa Y. Yasoda A. Suda M. Miyazawa T.

The signal peptide is removed to form propeptides, but a further proteolytic cleavage of the propeptide is required to convert the precursor to a biologically active peptide. This activation mechanism is critical in regulation of the activity of the natriuretic peptides, but the enzyme(s) responsible for the conversion remained uncharacterized for many years. Recently, we identified a cardiac serine protease, corin (19Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), that is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family (20Hooper J.D. Clements J.A.

Biol. 2003; 54: 167-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cell-based functional studies, we showed that corin converted pro-ANP to biologically active ANP in a highly sequence-specific manner (22Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 23Wu F. Yan W. Pan J. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), indicating that corin is a convertase for pro-ANP and pro-BNP. To date, however, the enzyme responsible for pro-CNP processing has not been fully characterized.In addition to its abundant expression in cardiomyocytes, the corin gene is also expressed in several other tissues, such as the pregnant uterus and developing kidneys and bones (19Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In developing bones, corin mRNA was specifically expressed in the prehypertrophic chondrocyte, a subset of chondrocytes important in bone growth and maturation. Interestingly, pro-CNP mRNA is also expressed in the prehypertrophic chondrocyte in developing bones (11Chusho H. Tamura N. Ogawa Y. Yasoda A. Suda M. Miyazawa T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Kurihara T.

The co-localization of corin and pro-CNP mRNA expression suggested the hypothesis that corin was responsible for the processing of pro-CNP.In this study, we test this hypothesis by examining the processing of human pro-CNP. Our results showed that in human kidney epithelial 293 cells and chondrosarcoma SW 1353 cells, pro-CNP was processed intracellularly. The processing of pro-CNP was not enhanced in the presence of recombinant corin but was inhibited by an inhibitor of furin, a widely expressed precursor-processing enzyme. We also showed that the processing of pro-CNP did not occur in furin-deficient LoVo cells and that transfection of a plasmid expressing human furin in LoVo cells enabled the cells to process pro-CNP to CNP. Our data indicate that, unlike pro-ANP, pro-CNP is processed intracellularly by the endoprotease, furin, but not by the transmembrane serine protease, corin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Penicillin, streptomycin, l-glutamine, fetal bovine serum, and cell culture medium were purchased from Invitrogen. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells, chrondrosarcoma SW 1353 cells, and furin-deficient LoVo human colon adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained at the Core Facility at Berlex Biosciences. Anti-V5 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Recombinant furin was obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Furin inhibitor (decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone) and synthetic human CNP were purchased from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001 was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Tumor necrosis factor-α convertase (TACE) inhibitor and tumor necrosis factor-α protease inhibitor-1 (TAPI), was purchased from Calbiochem. Transfection reagent LipofectAMINE 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen. All other chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma.Cell Culture—Human 293 cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% l-glutamine. Chrondrosarcoma SW 1353 cells were grown in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% l-glutamine. LoVo cells were cultured in Kaighn's modification of Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% l-glutamine. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (Cambrex Bioscience Walkersville, Inc.) were grown in a smooth muscle cell growth medium (Cambrex Bioscience). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in humidified incubators with 5% CO2/95% air.Expression Vectors—Plasmid vectors expressing human pro-ANP (pcDNAproANP) and corin (pcDNACorin) were described previously (22Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Recombinant pro-ANP and corin expressed by these vectors contain a viral V5 and a His6 tag at their carboxyl termini, which facilitates the detection of the proteins. A plasmid expressing human furin was provided by E. Tuley and J. E. Sadler (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) (24Bodo I. Katsumi A. Tuley E.A. Eikenboom J.C. Dong Z. Sadler J.E. Blood. 2001; 98: 2973-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The full-length human pro-CNP cDNA was cloned by an overlap PCR method (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar) using the following four oligonucleotide primers: CNP1S, 5′-TGCCGCCCGTGTGCGCCCCTCGAC-3′; CNP2A, 5′-ACATCCCAGGCCGCTCATGGAGCC-3′; CNP3A, 5′-GGGTTCGCGGGACCTTCGGCGGCGCCCCGGGCTTG-3′; and CNP4S, 5′-GTCCCGCGAACCCCGCCGGCAGAGGAG-3′ (26Tawaragi Y. Fuchimura K. Tanaka S. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, two separate PCR products were amplified from human genomic DNA using primers CNP1S and CNP3A or CNP2A and CNP4S. The two PCR products were gel-purified and mixed. A second PCR was performed using primers CNP1A and CNP4S. The final PCR product was cloned into the expression plasmid pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). The sequence of the insert and its orientation were verified by automated DNA sequencing. The presence of the viral V5 tag at the carboxyl terminus of pro-CNP allows the detection of the recombinant protein by Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen).Transfection and Western Analysis—Transient transfection was performed in 293, chrondrosarcoma SW 1353, or LoVo cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conditioned medium was collected 13 to 24 h after transfection and subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 rpm to remove cell debris. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.6% Triton X-100. To analyze pro-ANP and pro-CNP processing, recombinant pro-ANP and pro-CNP and their derivatives in the conditioned media were immunoprecipitated by an anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Protein samples from the conditioned media or cell lysates were separated by SDS/PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen).Effect of Small Molecule Inhibitors—Human 293 cells were transfected with the pro-CNP expressing plasmid and grown in Opti-MEM medium for 3 h. Small molecule inhibitors, including a furin inhibitor (decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone) (27Garten W. Stieneke A. Shaw E. Wikstrom P. Klenk H.D. Virology. 1989; 172: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), an MMP inhibitor (GM6001) (28Park H.I. Turk B.E. Gerkema F.E. Cantley L.C. Sang Q.X. J. Biol.

Ware C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) were added separately to the medium and incubated for 24 h. The conditioned medium containing recombinant pro-CNP was collected. Cell lysate was prepared as described above. Pro-CNP and its derivatives were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody.Cleavage of Pro-CNP by Purified Recombinant Furin—LoVo cells were transfected with a pro-CNP-expressing plasmid or the control vector pcDNA and grown in Opti-MEM medium for 24 h. The cells (∼106) were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of 100 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm calcium chloride (30Do H. Lee W.S. Ghosh P. Hollowell T. Canfield W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29737-29744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant human furin was added to the cell lysate, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Cleavage of pro-CNP was analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody.cGMP Assay—To examine the activity of recombinant CNP, a cGMP assay was performed using a Biotrak enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (23Wu F. Yan W. Pan J. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16900-16905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat aortic smooth muscle cells were grown in 96-well plates in a smooth-muscle cell growth medium (Cambrex Bioscience). Confluent cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The LoVo cell lysate (180 μl), which contained recombinant pro-CNP and was treated with purified furin, was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. In this experiment, synthetic human CNP was used a positive control. The cells were lysed by addition of a lysis buffer (20 μl/well) containing 2% dodecyltrimethylammonium and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8. The intracellular cGMP concentration in CNP-stimulated aortic smooth muscle cells was then determined with the Biotrak enzyme immunoassay kit. Each experimental condition was assayed in triplicate.RESULTSProcessing of Pro-ANP and Pro-CNP in 293 Cells—To examine whether corin is involved in the processing of pro-CNP, transfection experiments were performed in 293 cells. As reported in our previous studies and shown here as a control, corin was required for the processing of human pro-ANP to ANP. Western analysis of the conditioned medium showed the conversion of recombinant pro-ANP to ANP when the cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing human corin and pro-ANP (Fig. 1A). Expression of recombinant human corin in the transfected cells was confirmed by Western analysis of the cell lysates (Fig. 1B). Western blotting also showed that only pro-ANP, but not ANP, was present in the cell lysates, indicating that pro-ANP was processed extracellularly by corin. In contrast, processed CNP was detected in the conditioned medium from cells transfected with the pro-CNP expressing plasmid alone or together with the corin expressing plasmid (Fig. 1C). Western analysis of the cell lysates showed that pro-CNP was processed similarly in the absence or presence of recombinant corin (Fig. 1D), indicating that pro-CNP was processed intracellularly by a corin-independent mechanism.Processing of Pro-ANP and Pro-CNP in Chondrosarcoma SW 1353 Cells—It is possible that the processing of pro-CNP observed in kidney-derived 293 cells might not reflect conditions in chondrocytes because two cell types will have different proteomes. Both corin and pro-CNP are expressed in chondrocytes; in these cells, corin might be the pro-CNP convertase. To test this, we next performed experiments in SW 1353 cells that were derived from a human chondrosarcoma. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, co-transfection of plasmids expressing human pro-ANP and corin led to the conversion of pro-ANP to ANP. Corin, however, was not required to process pro-CNP. Western analysis detected both pro-CNP and CNP in the conditioned medium and cell lysate from the cells transfected with the pro-CNP-expressing plasmid alone or together with the corin-expressing plasmid (Fig. 2, C and D). Expression of corin did not enhance the processing of pro-CNP. The results showed that the processing of pro-CNP in SW 1353 cells again occurred intracellularly but was less efficient than that in 293 cells. This data is consistent with the observation that corin is not required for the processing of pro-CNP.Fig. 2Processing of pro-ANP and pro-CNP in transfected SW 1353 cells. Transfection experiments were performed in human chondrosarcoma SW 1353 cells using plasmids expressing human pro-ANP (pProANP) (A and B) or pro-CNP (pProCNP) (C and D) with or without a plasmid expressing human corin (pCorin), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant pro-ANP, pro-CNP, and their derivatives in the conditioned media (A and C) and cell lysates (B and D) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody. The Western analysis also detected in the cell lysate the expression of recombinant human corin, as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of Small Molecule Inhibitors on Processing of Pro-CNP—The observation that pro-CNP was processed intracellularly suggested that the propeptide may be processed by one of the subtilisin-like proteases such as furin, which is known for its role in the processing of many precursor proteins (31Barr P.J.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of a furin inhibitor, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (27Garten W. Stieneke A. Shaw E. Wikstrom P. Klenk H.D. Virology. 1989; 172: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), on the processing of pro-CNP. Transfection experiments were performed in 293 cells using the pro-CNP expressing plasmid, after which the cells were incubated with the furin inhibitor. Western analysis showed an increase of pro-CNP and a decrease of mature CNP in the conditioned medium from the cells treated with increasing concentrations of the furin inhibitor (Fig. 3, top). Consistent with this result, mature CNP in the cell lysate was decreased in the presence of increasing concentrations of the furin inhibitor (Fig. 3, bottom). In contrast, the processing of pro-CNP was not inhibited when the transfected cells were cultured in the presence of either a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor (GM6001) or a TACE inhibitor (TAPI) (Fig. 3). These results suggest that furin, but not MMPs or TACE, is involved in the processing of pro-CNP.Fig. 3Inhibition of pro-CNP processing by small molecule inhibitors. Transfection experiments were performed in human 293 cells using a plasmid expressing human pro-CNP (pProCNP). The transfected cells were grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of a furin inhibitor (Dec-RVKR-CMK), or a high concentration (20 μm) of an MMP inhibitor (GM6001) or a TACE inhibitor (TAPI).

To examine the importance of furin in the processing of pro-CNP, we performed experiments using furin-deficient LoVo cells that were derived from a lymph node metastasis of a human colon adenocarcinoma and contain compound mutations in the furin gene (36Takahashi S.

As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, pro-CNP, but not CNP, was detected in the conditioned medium and cell lysates from cells transfected with the pro-CNP expressing plasmid alone or together with the corin-expressing plasmid. In controls, the conversion of pro-ANP to ANP was detected in LoVo cells co-transfected with pro-ANP- and corin-expressing plasmids (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating that furin is not required for the corin-mediated processing of pro-ANP. The results demonstrate that furin deficiency prevented the processing of pro-CNP in LoVo cells.Fig. 4Processing of pro-ANP and pro-CNP in transfected LoVo cells. Transfection experiments were performed in human colon adenocarcinoma LoVo cells using plasmids expressing human pro-ANP (pProANP) (A and B) or pro-CNP (pProCNP) (C and D) with or without a plasmid expressing human corin (pCorin), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant pro-ANP, pro-CNP, and their derivatives in the conditioned media (A and C) and cell lysates (B and D) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody.

Transfection experiments were performed in LoVo cells using plasmids expressing pro-CNP and human furin. As shown in Fig. 5, Western analysis detected both pro-CNP and CNP in cell lysates from LoVo cells co-transfected with plasmids expressing pro-CNP and furin. Consistently, increasing levels of processed CNP were found in the conditioned medium from LoVo cells transfected with the pro-CNP expressing plasmid and increasing amounts of the furin expressing plasmid (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Co-transfection of plasmids expressing furin and pro-CNP in LoVo cells. LoVo cells were transfected with a pro-CNP expressing plasmid together with increasing amounts of a plasmid expressing human furin, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant human pro-CNP and its derivatives in the conditioned media (top) and cell lysates (bottom) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody.

Recombinant pro-CNP was expressed in LoVo cells and cell lysate was prepared and incubated with increasing concentrations of purified recombinant human furin. The processing of pro-CNP was analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6, in the presence of increasing concentrations of recombinant furin, increasing amounts of pro-CNP were converted to CNP, demonstrating that purified furin is a pro-CNP convertase.Fig. 6Cleavage of pro-CNP by purified recombinant furin. Cell lysates from LoVo cells transfected with a plasmid expressing human pro-CNP (pro-CNP) were prepared and incubated with purified recombinant human furin (10 or 20 units) at 30 °C for 2 h.

Binding of CNP to its receptor stimulates the guanylyl cyclase activity, leading to generation of intracellular cGMP. To determine whether the furin-processed recombinant CNP is biologically active, an aortic smooth muscle cell-based cGMP assay was performed (37Abbey S.E. Potter L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42423-42430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, low levels of cGMP-stimulating activity were detected in the cell lysate from LoVo cells transfected with a control plasmid or the pro-CNP expressing plasmid alone. The cGMP-stimulating activity increased 2- and 3.7-fold, respectively, when 10 and 20 units of purified recombinant furin were added to the cell lysate containing pro-CNP (Fig. 7). Calculated amounts of recombinant CNP processed by 10 and 20 units of purified furin were 22.5 and 46 ng/106 cells, respectively. These results are consistent with the data showing that purified recombinant furin cleaves pro-CNP and demonstrate that furin-cleaved recombinant CNP is biologically active.Fig. 7Stimulation of intracellular cGMP production. Cell lysates from LoVo cells transfected with a control vector (control) or a plasmid expressing human pro-CNP (pro-CNP) were incubated with purified recombinant human furin (10 or 20 units) at 30 °C for 2 h and added to wells in a 96-well plate that had rat aortic smooth muscle cells cultured in it.

Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical studies reveal that the coactivator contains a short α-helical LXXLL sequence (where X = any amino acid), known as an NR box, that binds the nuclear receptor LBD. The NR box is capped by a charge clamp on the surface of the LBD formed by a lysine on helix 3 and a glutamic acid on the C-terminal AF2 helix (12Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E.

Despite the availability of multiple co-crystal structures of ligand/receptor complexes, the mechanism by which small molecule ligands activate nuclear receptors is still poorly understood (13Weatherman R.V. Fletterick R.J. Scanlan T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 559-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that a residue in the AF2 helix of LXRα, Trp-443, plays a role in the activation of the receptor by oxysterols (14Spencer T.A. Li D. Russel J.S. Collins J.L. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Moore L.B. Galardi C.M. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Watson M.A. Parks D.J. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we proposed a model where the AF2 helix was stabilized in its active conformation by a hydrogen bond from the tryptophan indole NH to the sterol agonist (14Spencer T.A. Li D. Russel J.S. Collins J.L. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Moore L.B. Galardi C.M. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Watson M.A. Parks D.J. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both the neutral sterol eCH and the acidic nonsterol T1317 are efficacious activators of LXRα and LXRβ in biochemical and cell-based assays (Fig. 1, b and c). To probe the molecular basis by which both sterol and nonsterol agonists regulate LXR activity, we initiated crystallographic investigations of both LXRα and LXRβ LBD. Diffracting crystals of the LXRβ LBD complexed to eCH and T1317 were readily obtained, allowing us to determine those structures.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLXRβ Expression and Purification—A construct of human LXRβ LBD (ligand binding domain) containing amino acids 214–461 and an N-terminal thrombin cleavable His tag was subcloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pRSETa (Invitrogen) and expressed in BL21(DE3). All subsequent steps are at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in NiA (25 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 3% 1,2-propanediol) and then lysed using a cell homogenizer (Rannie) followed by clarification by centrifugation.The soluble protein was loaded onto the pre-equilibrated nickelnitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen) followed by elution with a 10-column volume 50–500 mm imidazole gradient. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed versus 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol.Protein was further purified using anion exchange. His-tagged LXR was digested overnight with thrombin at a mass ratio of 1:500. The digested protein was diluted to 25 mm salt with Q0 (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol), loaded onto the preequilibrated anion exchange column, and eluted by a 20-column 0–250 mm NaCl gradient. LXR eluted as two peaks at ∼150 mm NaCl, which were kept separate for crystallization trials. The eluted protein was dialyzed versus 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, eCH, and SRC1, or T1317 was added, and the protein was concentrated to 12–14 mg/ml for crystallization trials.Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystallization trials were carried out using the hanging drop method by mixing 2 μl of protein solution with 2 μl of well buffer. LXRβ/T1317 complexes crystallized from 10 to 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 with 100 mm concentration of a number of salts, including NaF, KF, NaCl, KCl, sodium formate, sodium acetate, and potassium acetate at 4 °C. LXRβ/eCH/SRC1 complexes crystallized from 10 to 12% polyethylene glycol 3350–8000 with 0.2 m NaCl at 4 °C. Crystals took 4–6 weeks to grow. Crystals were frozen in LN2 after transferring stepwise to a cryo buffer containing the well buffer with 30% polyethylene glycol 400.All data were obtained at the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography Association Collaborative Access Team (IMCA CAT) 17 ID beam line at the Advanced Photon Source at a wavelength of 1 Å on a MAR CCD detector. Crystals of the LXRβ/T1317 complex diffracted to 2.3 Å and were in the space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 60.25, b = 82.454, c = 123.175. Crystals of the LXRβ/eCH/SRC1 complex diffracted to 2.7 Å and were in the space group C2221 with lattice constants of a = 71.17 Å, b = 120.01 Å, c = 147.56 Å. All diffraction data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). The LXRβ/T1317 structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe with a truncated monomeric form of human retinoic acid receptor-γ as a search model. The LXRβ/eCH/SRC1 structure was solved by molecular replacement using a refined LXR subunit from the LXRβ/T1317 structure as a search model. For both complexes, there were two molecules in the asymmetric unit related by a noncrystallographic dyad. Noncrystallographic averaging was utilized during refinement. Structures were subjected to multiple rounds of building using Quanta and refined using CNX and Refmac5.Biological Assays—LXR cell-free ligand sensing assays and LXR cell-based transactivation assays were performed as described previously (14Spencer T.A.

The T-CH hybrid was synthesized from chlol-5-en-24-al by addition of (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane catalyzed by tetrabutylammonium fluoride, oxidation with Dess-Martin periodinane, and addition of a second equivalent of (trifluoromethyl)-trimethylsilane catalyzed by tetrabutylammonium fluoride. Analytical data are as follows: 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) 5.40–5.34 (m, 1H), 3.61–3.48 (m, 1H), 2.36–0.83 (m, 40H); 19F NMR (CDCl3, 282 MHz) 76.7 (q, J = 9.1), 77.1 (q, J = 9.1); time-of-flight mass spectrometry (EI+) m/e 497 (MH+).RESULTSStructure Determination—The human LXRβ LBD (residues 214–461) was crystallized in complex with T1317 or with eCH and a peptide from the coactivator SRC1. Crystals of the LXRβ/T1317 complex diffracted to 2.3 Å, whereas the LXRβ/eCH/SRC1 complex diffracted to 2.7 Å (Table I). The LXRβ LBD had the anticipated three-layered α-helical fold seen for other nuclear receptors (13Weatherman R.V. Fletterick R.J. Scanlan T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 559-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The most distinguishing features of the LXRβ structure were a long helix 1 (∼18 residues) and a relatively large ligand binding pocket (830 Å3) as compared with the classic steroid hormone receptors (420–550 Å3). In both structures, the asymmetric unit contained an LXRβ homodimer, where each monomer was occupied by a single ligand (Fig. 2). The dimer interface was composed of residues in helices 7, 9, and 10 and is similar to other homo- and heterodimer interfaces (13Weatherman R.V. Fletterick R.J. Scanlan T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 559-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In the eCH structure, the Cα atoms in the two subunits have a root mean squared deviation of 0.4 Å, whereas in the T1317 structure, the Cα atoms have a root mean squared deviation of 0.6 Å.Table ICrystallographic data and refinementCrystalLXRβ/T317 complexLXRβ/eCH/SRC1 complexSpace groupP212121C2221Unit cella = 60.3, b = 82.5, c = 123.2a = 71.2, b = 120.0, c = 147.6α = β = γ = 90°α = β = γ = 90°Resolution range30-2.320-2.7Observations (unique)308126 (27968)141128 (19175)Completeness (final shell)95.7 (98.7)95.3 (81.6)I/σ (final shell)24.8 (3.4)28.7 (4.8)R merge % (final shell)aR merge = Σ I - 〈I〉/ΣI5.2 (29)5.5 (28)Refinement statisticsResolution range30-2.320-2.7% R free77R cryst (R free)bR cryst = Σ F obs - F calc/ΣF obs23.2 (25.7)21.5 (27.6)Protein atoms37384124Ligand atoms9658Water molecules320108r.m.s.d. bonds/anglescr.m.s.d., root mean squared deviation0.0085/1.6750.014/1.7a R merge = Σ I - 〈I〉/ΣIb R cryst = Σ F obs - F calc/ΣF obsc r.m.s.d., root mean squared deviation Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Structure of the LXRβ LBD.

This orientation was similar to that predicted in the model of Spencer et al. (14Spencer T.A. Li D. Russel J.S. Collins J.L. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Moore L.B. Galardi C.M. McKee D.D. Moore J.T.

Chem. 2001; 44: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and was similar to that of estradiol, progesterone, and dexamethasone in their complexes with the estrogen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors. However, the steroid core of eCH was flipped 180° around its long axis so that the angular methyl groups pointed in the direction opposite that in the steroid hormones (Fig. 3a). Although the epoxide oxygen atom lay adjacent to Trp-457, it actually made its hydrogen bond with the imidazole ring of His-435. The A-ring hydroxyl formed a hydrogen bond with Glu-281 on helix 3 and was positioned close to Arg-319 on helix 5. This is reminiscent of the estradiol/estrogen receptor complex, where the phenolic A-ring hydroxyl makes strong hydrogen bonds with Glu-353 on helix 3 and Arg-394 on helix 5 (17Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). However, in LXRβ, the A-ring hydroxyl group lay out of the plane of the Arg-319 guanidinium group, and despite its favorable distance, cannot make a hydrogen bond with good geometry. In addition to these polar interactions, eCH also made extensive lipophilic interactions with the ligand binding pocket, and its conformation was essentially the same in both subunits. In the T1317/LXRβ structure, the acidic carbinol group lay in approximately the same position as the epoxide of eCH and also formed a hydrogen bond with the histidine ring of His-435. However, the nonsterol ligand was observed in different conformations about the tertiary sulfonamide in the two LXRβ subunits. In one subunit, the T1317 adopted a gauche conformation (Fig. 3a), whereas in the other subunit, it adopted an anti conformation (Fig. 3b). As a result, the nonsterol ligand fit into a position corresponding to the C- and D-rings of eCH and made weak hydrogen bonds with Ser-278 in each case but did not reach into the volume occupied by the A-ring of eCH and failed to make interactions with either Glu-281 or Arg-319 (Fig. 3, a and b). Despite the differences in the regions of the ligand binding pocket occupied by the eCH and T1317, all of the amino acids contacting both ligands are conserved between LXRα and LXRβ.Fig. 3LXRβ ligand binding pocket. The ligand and amino acid residues forming the ligand binding pocket are shown in stick representation with nitrogen and oxygen atoms colored blue and red, respectively.

Chem. 2001; 44: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In LXRβ, the corresponding residue is Trp-457. In contrast to the published homology model (14Spencer T.A. Li D. Russel J.S. Collins J.L. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Moore L.B. Galardi C.M. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Watson M.A. Parks D.J. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), neither the sterol nor nonsterol ligand formed a direct interaction with the AF2 helix in the crystal structure (Figs. 3 and 4). The Trp-457 indole was oriented such that the nitrogen atom was pointed away from eCH, making it impossible to form a direct hydrogen bond with the epoxide oxygen. Instead, both ligands interacted with His-435, which made an edge to face interaction with the tryptophan on the inner surface of the AF2 helix (Fig. 4, a and b). The His-435 side chain had some freedom to rotate about its Cα-Cβ bond, allowing it to swing the edge of its imidazole ring across the face of the indole ring. This rotational freedom lets His-435 interact with either the weakly negative π-electron cloud of the five-membered pyrrole ring or the more strongly negative π-electron cloud of the benzene ring (18Mecozzi S. West Jr., A.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). This weak electrostatic interaction can become a strongly favorable “cation-π” interaction when the imidazole is positively charged and directed into the most negatively charged regions of the indole π-electron cloud (19Ma J.C.

In the eCH complex, the Nϵ2 atom of His-435 was positioned to donate a hydrogen bond to the epoxide of the sterol side chain at a distance of 3.45–3.50 Å (Fig. 4c). In this orientation, the imidazole directed its electropositive Cϵ1 and Nϵ2 hydrogens toward the Cγ atom and six-membered ring of the tryptophan side chain, corresponding to the electronegative π-cloud of the indole (18Mecozzi S.

In this orientation, the imidazole directed its electropositive Cϵ1 hydrogen into the π-cloud of the indole benzene ring, again holding Trp-457 in the active position. The imidazole rotation also opened space for a water molecule, observed in both subunits, that made a hydrogen bond to the backside Nδ1, further stabilizing the complex. Hydrogen bond lengths tend to correlate with their energy (21Steiner T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 48-76Crossref Scopus (4949) Google Scholar), suggesting that the acidic carbinol group makes a stronger hydrogen bonding interaction than the epoxide. This is consistent with quantum mechanics calculations, which indicate that the epoxide oxygen has a relatively weak electrostatic charge as compared with that on the bis-trifluoromethyl carbinol or even as compared with an ordinary hydroxyl group (data not shown). The T1317 hydrogen bond may be further strengthened by partial proton transfer, as can occur when the pK a values of the partners are suitably matched (21Steiner T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 48-76Crossref Scopus (4949) Google Scholar). In this case, the bis-trifluoromethyl carbinol group has a pK a of 8.4 in water, relatively close to that of histidine, with a pK a of 6.5–7.0. Thus, the His-Trp interface induced by T1317 may be an example of a cation-π electrostatic interaction (19Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1303-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar, 20Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar).

Although the degree of AF2 stabilization by the His-Trp interactions is believed to be different for the sterol and nonsterol ligands, the position of the C-terminal helix does not deviate significantly in the crystallized complexes.Mutagenesis of the His-Trp Activation Switch—To explore the functional differences in the electrostatics of the His-Trp activation switch, we utilized mutants of LXR that might allow activation by T1317 but not eCH. Although tryptophan is the optimal pairing for histidine in a cation-π interaction, phenylalanine or tyrosine can also substitute (18Mecozzi S. West Jr., A.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). LXR-GAL4 chimeras were generated where Trp-443 in LXRα and Trp-457 in LXRβ were mutated to phenylalanine or tyrosine. The transactivation capability of the LXR-GAL4 chimeras was measured by their ability to transcribe a secreted placental alkaline phosphatase reporter on a UAS-tk promoter in transient transfection experiments (Fig. 5). As demonstrated previously (14Spencer T.A. Li D. Russel J.S. Collins J.L. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Moore L.B. Galardi C.M. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Watson M.A. Parks D.J. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), neither tryptophan point mutant could be activated by eCH. However, T1317 activated both the W443F LXRα and the W457F LXRβ mutants. We interpret these data as evidence that phenylalanine can substitute for tryptophan in the electrostatic interaction induced by T1317 but not in the interaction induced by eCH. Neither compound activated the W443Y LXRα or the W457Y LXRβ mutants (data not shown).Fig. 5Activation of LXR point mutants.

However, the weaker hydrogen bond with eCH swung the His-435 Cϵ1 hydrogen to the edge of the W457F π-electron cloud, weakening the cation-π interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2021918518,"Misfolded glycoproteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes, a mechanism known as ERAD (ER-associated degradation). In the present study, we demonstrate that ERAD of the misfolded genetic variant-null Hong Kong α1-antitrypsin is enhanced by overexpression of the ER processing α1,2-mannosidase (ER ManI) in HEK 293 cells, indicating the importance of ER ManI in glycoprotein quality control. We showed previously that EDEM, an enzymatically inactive mannosidase homolog, interacts with misfolded α1-antitrypsin and accelerates its degradation (Hosokawa, N., Wada, I., Hasegawa, K., Yorihuzi, T., Tremblay, L. O., Herscovics, A., and Nagata, K. (2001) EMBO Rep. 2, 415–422). Herein we demonstrate a combined effect of ER ManI and EDEM on ERAD of misfolded α1-antitrypsin. We also show that misfolded α1-antitrypsin NHK contains labeled Glc1Man9GlcNAc and Man5–9GlcNAc released by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H in pulse-chase experiments with [2-3H]mannose. Overexpression of ER ManI greatly increases the formation of Man8GlcNAc, induces the formation of Glc1Man8GlcNAc and increases trimming to Man5–7GlcNAc. We propose a model whereby the misfolded glycoprotein interacts with ER ManI and with EDEM, before being recognized by downstream ERAD components. This detailed characterization of oligosaccharides associated with a misfolded glycoprotein raises the possibility that the carbohydrate recognition determinant triggering ERAD may not be restricted to Man8GlcNAc2 isomer B as previous studies have suggested. Misfolded glycoproteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes, a mechanism known as ERAD (ER-associated degradation). In the present study, we demonstrate that ERAD of the misfolded genetic variant-null Hong Kong α1-antitrypsin is enhanced by overexpression of the ER processing α1,2-mannosidase (ER ManI) in HEK 293 cells, indicating the importance of ER ManI in glycoprotein quality control. We showed previously that EDEM, an enzymatically inactive mannosidase homolog, interacts with misfolded α1-antitrypsin and accelerates its degradation (Hosokawa, N., Wada, I., Hasegawa, K., Yorihuzi, T., Tremblay, L. O., Herscovics, A., and Nagata, K. (2001) EMBO Rep. 2, 415–422). Herein we demonstrate a combined effect of ER ManI and EDEM on ERAD of misfolded α1-antitrypsin. We also show that misfolded α1-antitrypsin NHK contains labeled Glc1Man9GlcNAc and Man5–9GlcNAc released by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H in pulse-chase experiments with [2-3H]mannose. Overexpression of ER ManI greatly increases the formation of Man8GlcNAc, induces the formation of Glc1Man8GlcNAc and increases trimming to Man5–7GlcNAc. We propose a model whereby the misfolded glycoprotein interacts with ER ManI and with EDEM, before being recognized by downstream ERAD components. This detailed characterization of oligosaccharides associated with a misfolded glycoprotein raises the possibility that the carbohydrate recognition determinant triggering ERAD may not be restricted to Man8GlcNAc2 isomer B as previous studies have suggested.

Subsequently, the ER lectin chaperones, calnexin or calreticulin, specifically bind to monoglucosylated N-glycans, promoting proper glycoprotein folding. This ER quality control process is mediated by glucosidases I and II that remove the glucose residues from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 and by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase that reglucosylates incompletely folded glycoproteins. Correctly folded glycoproteins exit the ER to their final destinations, whereas misfolded glycoproteins are readily degraded (for reviews see Refs. 1Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A.

We recently reported the molecular cloning of mouse EDEM (ER degradation enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein) and its involvement in glycoprotein ERAD. It was suggested that EDEM is a putative lectin, which most likely binds Man8B on misfolded α1-antitrypsin and accelerates its degradation (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Two groups also reported the yeast homolog of EDEM and its function in yeast ERAD (16Jakob C.A. Bodmer D. Spirig U. Bättig P. Marcil A. Dignard D. Bergeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. Aebi M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 17Nakatsukasa K. Nishikawa S.-I. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8635-8638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), indicating that the ERAD mechanisms involved in the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins are similar in yeast and mammals. Both ER ManI and EDEM are ER resident transmembrane proteins containing characteristic signature motifs of class I α1,2-mannosidases (glycosylhydrolase family 47). Despite this significant sequence similarity, EDEM lacks α1,2-mannosidase activity with Man9GlcNAc as substrate (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In addition, these two proteins differ in their response to ER stress. EDEM is induced by various forms of ER stress, but ER ManI is not (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that overexpression of human ER ManI accelerates the degradation of the terminally misfolded α1-antitrypsin genetic variant-null Hong Kong (A1AT NHK) (18Sifers R.N. Brashears-Macatee S. Kidd V.J. Muensch H. Woo S.L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7330-7335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also show the combined effects of ER ManI and EDEM on the degradation of misfolded α1-antitrypsin. Glycan analysis on misfolded NHK shows that overexpression of ER ManI greatly increases the formation of Man8GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 and also stimulates trimming of N-linked oligosaccharides to Man5GlcNAc2 in vivo. These experiments suggest that the misfolded glycoprotein interacts both with ER ManI and EDEM before being recognized by downstream ERAD components. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human HEK 293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and transfection of plasmids encoding human ER ManI, mouse EDEM, and human α1-antitrypsin-null Hong Kong were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Approximately 1.5 × 105 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 3.5-cm dishes. After 24 h of plating, 0.5 μg of plasmid encoding ER ManI, EDEM, or pMH vector were mixed with 1 μg of plasmid encoding the α1-antitrypsin variant A1AT NHK for transfection, and cells were pulse-labeled and harvested 36 h post-transfection. Reagents—Kifunensine, an inhibitor of ER ManI, was kindly provided by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan) and added to the culture medium at a concentration of 5 μg/ml for 4 h prior to pulse-labeling. The proteasome inhibitor lactacystin was purchased from Kyowa Medics Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and added to the culture medium at a concentration of 1 mm for 4 h prior to pulse-labeling. The inhibitors were also present in the medium during the pulse and the chase periods. Plasmid Construction—Human ER ManI cDNA was subcloned into the pMH vector (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by PCR. The entire open reading frame (9Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was amplified from cDNA using a sense primer containing a HindIII site and a Kozak sequence (5′-AAAAAAGCTTCCACCATGGCTGCCTGCGAGGGCAGGAG-3′) and an antisense primer containing a NotI site and omitting the stop codon (5′-AAAAAAAAGCGGCCGCGCTGCAGGGGTCCAGATAGGCAGAG-3′). The open reading frame amplicon was digested with HindIII and NotI and cloned into the HindIII/NotI sites of pMH in-frame with the C-terminal HA-tag. Mouse EDEM cDNA was tagged with HA at its C terminus in pCMV-SPORT2 vector (Invitrogen) as described previously (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The NHK variant was constructed as described elsewhere (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were preincubated in DMEM lacking methionine (Invitrogen) for 30 min and labeled with Expre35S35S protein labeling mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 15 min at a concentration of 8.2 MBq/ml. The cells were then incubated in DMEM during the chase period. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline lacking Ca2+ and Mg2+, cells were incubated on ice for 20 min in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, supplemented with protease inhibitors) (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, Nonidet P-40 soluble cell lysates were mixed with various antibodies (1/50 dilution), and the immune complexes were collected using either Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham-Pharmacia, Amersham, UK) (19Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S-i. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). One-half of the cell lysate was used for immunoprecipitation using antibody against A1AT, and the other half was incubated with anti-HA antibody. In cells co-transfected with NHK and ER ManI or EDEM, the radioactivity of immunoprecipitated NHK decreased compared with cells transfected with NHK and pMH. To obtain approximately equal signals for the immunoprecipitated NHK at chase 0 h, the gels were exposed 2 or 3 times longer for samples co-transfected with ER ManI or EDEM than for those co-transfected with pMH. Alternatively in some experiments, one-half or one-third of the cell lysates was used for immunoprecipitation in pMH transfected cells in comparison with ER ManI or EDEM transfected cells. The conditions are indicated in the figure legends. The immune complex was boiled in Laemmli's sample buffer containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, unless otherwise indicated in the legends. Radioactivity was quantified by exposing the gels to a PhosphorImager (Storm, Amersham Biosciences), and the gels were exposed to x-ray films (HR-HA, Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Japan) afterward. For labeling with [3H]mannose, cells were preincubated in DMEM containing 1 mm glucose (Invitrogen) for 30 min and labeled with 7.4 MBq/ml d-[2-3H]mannose for 1 h. Cells were then chased for the times indicated in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 mm mannose (20Moore S.E.H. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12715-12721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE were performed as described for the labeling with 35S-protein-labeling mixture, and the samples were blotted onto a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) in 5 mm sodium tetraborate buffer. The position of the [3H]mannose-labeled NHK bands on the PVDF membrane were identified by exposing the membrane to a PhosphorImager. Antibodies—Antiserum against α1-antitrypsin was purchased from Cappel (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), and purified IgG against the HA-tag was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Human ER ManI antibody was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide (GRRDVEVKPADRHNLLRPET). The antiserum was affinity-purified using the peptide. For the antibody against mouse EDEM, multiple antigenic peptide was synthesized using the following peptide sequence, DERRYSLPLKSIYMRQID. Whole rabbit serum was used for the experiments. Western Blotting—Nonidet P-40-soluble cell lysates or immunoprecipitates prepared as described above (see “Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation”) were adjusted to 1 × Laemmli's buffer containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting, 40 μg of protein was loaded per lane. For Western blotting following immunoprecipitation, 400 μg of protein of Nonidet P-40-soluble cell lysate was used as starting material. After blotting to a nitrocellulose membrane, antigen-antibody complexes were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray films. Characterization of Oligosaccharides—The [3H]mannose-labeled NHK bands on the PVDF membranes were cut into small pieces. The pieces were first rinsed with methanol and then with 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, three times for 15 min at 37 °C, and the washes were discarded. The membrane pieces were then incubated with Endo-H (New England Biolabs) in the same buffer at 37 °C for 48 h. Endo-H (1000 units) was added at 0, 12 and 36 h of incubation, and the membrane pieces were washed three times with water. The extracts and washes were combined, boiled for 3 min, and lyophilized. The labeled oligosaccharides completely released by this procedure were dissolved in water, mixed with standard 14C-labeled Glc3Man9GlcNAc and fractionated by HPLC as described previously (21Romero P.A. Saunier B. Herscovics A. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In some cases, an internal standard of 14C-labeled Glc1Man8GlcNAc was also used. It was prepared by treatment of labeled Glc1Man9GlcNAc for 45 min at 37 °C with 0.2 mg of purified recombinant α1,2-mannosidase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (22Lipari F. Herscovics A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Enhanced Degradation of A1AT NHK by Overexpression of ER ManI—To examine the effect of ER mannosidase I on ERAD of misfolded glycoproteins, human ER ManI cDNA was transfected into HEK 293 cells along with the A1AT NHK. A1AT is a serum protein belonging to a serine protease inhibitor superfamily. Mutations in α1-antitrypsin cause emphysema or liver cirrhosis (23Cox D.W. Scriver C.B. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 4125-4158Google Scholar). The NHK genetic variant of A1AT misfolds terminally in the ER and is degraded by ERAD (12Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Transfection of human ER ManI greatly enhanced the degradation of misfolded A1AT NHK in comparison with mock transfected cells (Fig. 1A, closed arrow, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6). NHK was not secreted into the medium of cells co-transfected with ER ManI (data not shown) nor of cells co-transfected with vector alone (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 24Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis revealed that the t 1/2 of transfected NHK in 293 cells was ∼100 min. Co-transfection of ER ManI shortened the t 1/2 of NHK to about 50 min (Fig. 1C). NHK immunoprecipitated from cell lysates transfected with ER ManI migrated slightly faster on SDS-PAGE than that from mock transfected cells (Fig. 1A, closed arrow). Kifunensine inhibited the degradation of NHK in cells co-transfected with ER ManI (Fig. 2, A and C) and also resulted in a small decrease in NHK electrophoretic mobility, consistent with inhibition of ER α1,2-mannosidase activity (Fig. 2A, black arrow, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6). Therefore overexpression of ER ManI enhances ERAD of misfolded NHK by accelerating mannose trimming from its N-linked glycans. This conclusion was further supported by NHK oligosaccharide analyses described below. Co-immunoprecipitation of ER ManI with NHK was detected in cells transfected with ER ManI (Fig. 1A, open arrow). Notably, the transfected ER ManI was degraded very rapidly (Fig. 1B, lanes 4–6, and see below). A broad uncharacterized protein band of ∼170 kDa was co-immunoprecipitated with ER ManI using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1B, lanes 4–6). This 170-kDa band decreased in parallel with the HA-tagged ER ManI during chase. The degradation of co-transfected ER ManI was not inhibited by the addition of kifunensine (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6), in accordance with the fact that human ER ManI is not a glycoprotein (8Gonzalez D.S. Karaveg K. Vandersall-Nairn A.S. Lal A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21375-21386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Kifunensine also decreased the mobility of the 170-kDa co-immunoprecipitated protein band (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 4), suggesting that the 170-kDa band is glycosylated. Inhibition of NHK Degradation by Lactacystin—The effect of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin on NHK degradation was then examined. The accelerated degradation of NHK in cells transfected with ER ManI was repressed by lactacystin (Fig. 3A, arrow, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6), indicating that the enhanced NHK degradation induced by ER ManI overexpression occurs through the ERAD pathway. Again, it is notable that the transfected ER ManI is rapidly degraded (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–3, open arrow, see also Figs. 1B and 2B). General protein synthesis examined by the incorporation of [35S]methionine into the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction was not inhibited by transfection of ER ManI. The degradation of ER ManI is independent of proteasomes (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6). The degradation of ER ManI was not inhibited by other protease inhibitors including serine or cysteine protease inhibitors, calpain inhibitor, nor aspartic protease inhibitor. 2N. Hosokawa, I. Wada, and K. Nagata, unpublished observation. Combined Effects of ER ManI and EDEM on NHK Degradation—Recently, we reported that mouse EDEM, which has sequence homology to α1,2-mannosidases but lacks enzyme activity with Man9GlcNAc as substrate, accelerates ERAD of misfolded NHK when transfected into 293 cells (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). EDEM was shown to interact with NHK in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and was postulated to recognize misfolded glycoproteins to sort them for retrotranslocation. We first compared the effects of transfection with ER ManI and with EDEM on ERAD of NHK. ER ManI and EDEM expressed individually shortened the intracellular half-life of NHK (Fig. 4A, closed arrow, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6 or 7–9). Co-immunoprecipitation of either ER ManI or EDEM was detected with NHK, using antibody raised against A1AT (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–6, open arrow showing ER ManI; lanes 7–9, thin arrow indicating EDEM). In the immunoprecipitates using anti-HA antibody, protein bands of ∼170 and 150 kDa on SDS-PAGE were observed in ER ManI and EDEM transfected cells, respectively (Fig. 4B, lanes 4–6, open arrowhead for ER ManI; lanes 7–9, closed arrowhead for EDEM). Although transfected ER ManI is rapidly degraded, transfected EDEM is stable during the 2-h chase period (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 7–9). Co-transfection of 293 cells with both ER ManI and EDEM further enhanced ERAD of NHK, compared with ER ManI alone, showing that there is a combined effect of these two ER resident proteins on NHK degradation (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6). Enhancement of degradation of NHK was also evident in cells co-transfected with both ER ManI and EDEM compared with EDEM alone (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 7–9). Because of the rapid degradation of NHK observed following transfection of both ER ManI and EDEM in this experiment, cell lysates were examined at shorter chase periods. The levels of expression of ER ManI, EDEM, and NHK were reduced when both ER membrane proteins and substrate proteins were co-transfected. However, when the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin was added, similar amounts of labeled NHK were recovered from the immunoprecipitates of cell lysates (Fig. 5B, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8), whereas only a very small amount of NHK was detected in cells overexpressing both ER ManI and EDEM after a 45-min chase in the absence of lactacystin (Fig. 5B, lane 6). These results confirm that the reduced amount of labeled NHK immunoprecipitated from cells co-transfected with ER ManI and EDEM was actually due to degradation by the proteasomes and not due to reduced synthesis of NHK. We then investigated whether ER ManI and EDEM form a complex with each other. We prepared antisera against synthetic peptides from both ER ManI and EDEM. Each anti-serum recognized its corresponding overexpressed protein by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis but hardly detected endogenous levels of the proteins. Accordingly, we co-transfected HA-tagged ER ManI with untagged EDEM or untagged ER ManI with HA-tagged EDEM. We performed immunoprecipitation of labeled cell lysates, as well as immunoprecipitation of cell lysates followed by Western blotting using either HA-tag or synthetic peptide antibodies. We did not detect any interaction of overexpressed ER ManI with EDEM (data not shown). The co-immunoprecipitated band observed in cells transfected with ER ManI was consistently larger than that observed in EDEM transfected cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 4–9, open and closed arrowheads), indicating that the proteins differ. Characterization of Oligosaccharides on NHK—To determine the structure of the oligosaccharides present on NHK, cells were labeled with [2-3H]mannose, and the oligosaccharides released by Endo-H from immunoprecipitated NHK were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 6). In mock transfected cells the major labeled oligosaccharides on NHK were Glc1Man9GlcNAc and Man9GlcNAc following pulse-labeling, along with smaller amounts of Man8GlcNAc (Fig. 6A). The identity of the oligosaccharides was confirmed by exhaustive treatment with jack bean α1,2-mannosidase followed by HPLC of the products. Glc1Man9GlcNAc yielded about 47% labeled Glc1Man4GlcNAc and mannose whereas Man9GlcNAc was entirely converted to mannose (data not shown). With increasing times of chase, trimming of NHK glycans to Man7GlcNAc, Man6GlcNAc (Fig. 6, B and C), and even to Man5GlcNAc after 4 h of chase (data not shown) was observed. Therefore, the oligosaccharides on misfolded NHK are trimmed beyond Man8GlcNAc2 by endogenous α1,2-mannosidase activity. Overexpression of ER ManI caused a large increase in Man8GlcNAc, and an appearance of Glc1Man8GlcNAc (Fig. 6, D, E, and F, and Fig. 7A). At the same time, there was a large decrease in the proportion of Glc1Man9GlcNAc and Man9GlcNAc2 as well as an increase in Man5–7GlcNAc compared with mock transfected cells. An aliquot of the sample from Fig. 6F subjected to HPLC with an internal standard of Glc1Man8GlcNAc (Fig. 7A) confirmed the identity of the large peak of Glc1Man8GlcNAc and the disappearance of Man9GlcNAc in cells transfected with ER ManI compared with mock transfected cells. The Glc1Man8GlcNAc may have been formed by the action of ER ManI on Glc1Man9GlcNAc or by the addition of glucose to the increased Man8GlcNAc by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. These results show that ER ManI is capable of trimming beyond Man8GlcNAc2 in vivo as was recently reported for recombinant ER ManI in vitro (25Herscovics A. Romero P.A. Tremblay L.O. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 14G-15GPubMed Google Scholar). In cells overexpressing EDEM the major labeled oligosaccharides were Glc1Man9GlcNAc and Man9GlcNAc, as in mock transfected cells with smaller proportions of Man6–8GlcNAc (Fig. 6, G, H, and I). When a sample similar to that shown in Fig. 6I was fractionated in the presence of the Glc1 Man8GlcNAc internal standard (Fig. 7B), Man9GlcNAc and a small amount of Glc1Man8GlcNAc were found. When cells were treated with kifunensine the formation of Man6–8GlcNAc was nearly completely inhibited (Fig. 8B) showing that ER α1,2-mannosidase II is not responsible for trimming NHK oligosaccharides in vivo.Fig. 8Effect of kifunensine on the oligosaccharides of misfolded NHK. Cells were transfected with NHK and analyzed as described in Fig. 6. Cells were harvested after a 3-h chase. The cells were preincubated in either the absence (A) or the presence (B) of 5 μg/ml kifunensine for 4 h prior to metabolic labeling with [3H]mannose. The size of the oligosaccharides is indicated as in Fig. 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the present study, we have shown that overexpression of human ER ManI in HEK 293 cells enhances ERAD of the terminally misfolded glycoprotein NHK. Accelerated degradation of NHK in cells overexpressing ER ManI was inhibited by lactacystin and by kifunensine, indicating that misfolded NHK was degraded through the ERAD pathway and that overexpression of ER ManI enhanced ERAD by accelerating trimming of its N-glycans. It has been postulated that the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides to Man8B by ER ManI acts as a signal for degradation of misfolded glycoproteins (1Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 7Cabral C.M. Liu Y. Sifers R. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12885-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, all studies to date were based on the assumption that Man8B is the only oligosaccharide found on misfolded glycoproteins due to ER ManI activity and on observations of carbohydrate trimming from misfolded glycoproteins by shifts in their mobility upon SDS-PAGE. In this first study reporting HPLC analysis of the glycans on terminally misfolded NHK, the results clearly show that a mixture of oligosaccharides is found on NHK and that the accepted assumption that only Man8B is formed by ER ManI needs to be revised. In mock transfected cells, Glc1Man9GlcNAc, Man9GlcNAc, and Man8GlcNAc were the major oligosaccharides found on NHK, but smaller amounts of Man7GlcNAc and Man6GlcNAc were also present. It is therefore possible that oligosaccharides other than Man8B, or in addition to Man8B, may act as recognition markers for ERAD. The relatively small amounts of Man7GlcNAc and Man6GlcNAc found on NHK might be the result of selective ERAD of specific NHK glycoforms bearing these oligosaccharides. The presence of Glc1Man9GlcNAc on NHK is consistent with previous studies demonstrating NHK association with calnexin (26Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results also show that the additional trimming beyond Man8GlcNAc is not due to ER α-mannosidase II because it was sensitive to kifunensine (Fig. 8). Overexpression of ER ManI, which increased ERAD of NHK, also greatly stimulated trimming of mannose residues to Man5GlcNAc, Man6GlcNAc, Man7GlcNAc, and Man8GlcNAc, as well as the formation of Glc1Man8GlcNAc. With the exception of the latter, the same oligosaccharides were formed in mock transfected cells, showing that the stimulation of NHK degradation caused by overexpression of ER ManI is not likely caused by the formation of atypical glycans. The increased trimming of N-glycans beyond Man8GlcNAc observed in cells overexpressing ER ManI is consistent with previous experiments with recombinant ER ManI in vitro indicating that ER ManI is less specific than previously believed (25Herscovics A. Romero P.A. Tremblay L.O. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 14G-15GPubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of oligosaccharides found in EDEM and mock transfected cells is very similar, but there is always a shoulder ahead of the Man9GlcNAc peak that corresponds to a small amount of Glc1Man8GlcNAc, suggesting that EDEM somehow facilitates either trimming of Glc1Man9GlcNAc to Glc1 Man8GlcNAc or glucosylation of Man8GlcNAc by UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. We demonstrated combined effects of ER ManI and of EDEM on ERAD. We previously reported that EDEM interacts with and accelerates the degradation of misfolded NHK, suggesting that EDEM may be a putative lectin, which recognizes misfolded glycoproteins for ERAD (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). NHK degradation is faster in cells co-transfected with both ER ManI and EDEM than in cells transfected with ER ManI or EDEM alone (Fig. 5A). We also obtained evidence indicating that ER ManI and EDEM are part of different complexes because different proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with each of them, and no evidence that ER ManI and EDEM form a complex with each other was obtained. We propose a model whereby misfolded glycoproteins are recognized independently by ER ManI and by EDEM. The identities of the proteins co-immunoprecipitated with ER ManI and EDEM remain to be determined, which may aid in the elucidation of productive glycoprotein folding and in understanding the machinery leading to retrotranslocation and subsequent degradation by proteasomes. Notably, ER ManI transfected into 293 cells was degraded very rapidly through a mechanism independent of cytoplasmic proteasomes (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–6). Despite its rapid turnover, we could detect the expression of transfected ER ManI by Western blot analysis using antibody against HA-tag or human ER ManI peptide. The level of expression of ER ManI in transfected cells is higher than that of endogenous ER ManI because we could not detect the latter by Western blot analysis using anti-peptide antibody. Although the molecular mechanism and the reason for the rapid degradation of ER ManI will require further investigation, the results suggest that the level of ER ManI expression is stringently controlled.

Here we report the identification and cloning of a novel dexamethasone-induced gene designated dig2. Using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray analysis of ∼10,000 genes and expressed sequence tags, we found that the expression of dig2 mRNA is significantly induced not only in the murine T cell lymphoma lines S49.A2 and WEHI7.2 but also in normal mouse thymocytes following dexamethasone treatment. This result was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. The induction of dig2 mRNA by dexamethasone appears to be mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor as it is blocked in the presence of RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dig2 is a novel stress response gene, as its mRNA is induced in response to a variety of cellular stressors including thapsigargin, tunicamycin, and heat shock. In addition, the levels of dig2 mRNA were up-regulated after treatment with the apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic drug etoposide. Though the function of dig2 is unknown, dig2 appears to have a pro-survival function, as overexpression of dig2 reduces the sensitivity of WEHI7.2 cells to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis.

Glucocorticosteriod hormones are potent inhibitors of T cell proliferation and inducers of thymocyte death (1Ashwell J.D. Lu F.W. Vacchio M.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 2Distelhorst C.W. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Hence, glucocorticoids are frequently used as immunosuppressives to treat a broad range of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders and prevent graft rejection following bone marrow or organ transplantation. Also, glucocorticoids are effective agents for treatment of lymphomas and lymphoid leukemias, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3Forbes I.J. Zalewski P.D. Giannakis C. Cowled P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 198: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 4Gaynon P.S. Carrel A.L. Adv. Exp. Med.

Glucocorticoids suppress lymphocyte proliferation and survival by two fundamental processes. First, glucocorticoids arrest proliferating lymphocytes in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (6Harmon J.M. Norman M.R. Fowlkes B.J. Thompson E.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Second, glucocorticoids induce apoptosis in immature lymphocytes (7Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4162) Google Scholar). The negative effects of glucocorticoids on lymphocyte proliferation and survival are mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor that induces or represses transcription of individual genes and gene networks (8Yamamoto K.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 209-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). The transactivation activity of the glucocorticoid receptor appears essential for glucocorticoid-induced cell death, although glucocorticoid-induced “death genes” have not yet been identified (reviewed in Ref. 2Distelhorst C.W. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Recent developments in DNA microarray technology permit a large number of cellular transcripts to be analyzed in parallel fashion (9Staudt L.M. Brown P.O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 829-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Using this technology, we have analyzed gene expression profiles of dexamethasone (Dex) 1The abbreviations used are: Dex, dexamethasone; dig2, dexamethasone-induced gene 2; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ER, endoplasmic reticular; EST, expressed sequence tag; Grp, glucose regulated protein; Hsp, heat shock protein; STS, staurosporine; TG, thapsigargin; TU, tunicamycin.-treated lymphocytes to identify genes that are potentially involved in mediating or regulating glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. For this purpose, we have utilized three separate but related Dex-sensitive model systems, i.e. the S49.A2 murine T cell lymphoma line, the WEHI7.2 murine T cell lymphoma line, and primary murine thymocytes. Although there were many genes whose expression was either induced or repressed by Dex in these model systems, only seven genes or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were induced or repressed by Dex in all three systems. One of the ESTs was particularly intriguing, because it was induced very rapidly. In this report we show that this EST represents a novel stress response gene that is induced in response to Dex and a variety of other cellular stressors. Although the function of the protein encoded by this gene remains unknown, its overexpression inhibits apoptosis induction by Dex, suggesting that it has a pro-survival activity. Cell Culture—S49.A2 and WEHI7.2 murine T-cell lymphoma lines were gifts of Drs. Diane Dowd and Roger Miesfeld, respectively. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (dMEM) (Bio-Whittaker) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated bovine calf serum at 37 °C in a 7% CO2 atmosphere under high humidity. Dex was purchased from Sigma, and a stock solution was prepared in 100% ethanol. S49.A2 and WEHI7.2 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml for 12 h before treatment with 1 μm Dex for 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. The control cells at each time point were treated with ethanol vehicle only. Cell viability was monitored by trypan blue dye staining. Thymus Isolation—C57BL/6J female mice at 8–11 weeks old (Jackson Laboratory) were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. Thymus glands were removed, rinsed in ice-cold growth medium (dMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 12.5 units/ml penicillin, and 12.5 μg/ml streptomycin), and then dispersed through a steel wire mesh into 5 ml of fresh, cold growth medium per thymus. The suspension of thymocytes was filtered through a tube with a cell strainer cap (BD Discovery Labware) to remove connective tissue. For each experiment, thymocytes were pooled from five mice, diluted to 2–3 × 106 cells/ml in warm growth medium, treated with 1 μm Dex or ethanol vehicle control, and grown in a humidified 7% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For the microarray experiment, thymus glands were isolated from adrenalectomized female mice. Oligonucleotide Array Expression Analysis—Gene expression analysis was performed essentially as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip expression analysis technical manual. Total RNA was harvested from both Dex-treated (1 μm) and vehicle control populations at each time point by Trizol (Invitrogen) extraction. Trizol cell lysates were separated into aqueous and organic phases by the addition of chloroform to a final concentration of 20% (v/v). The aqueous phase was purified and concentrated using an RNeasy minicolumn (Qiagen). DNA complementary to total RNA samples were reverse transcribed using SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a T7-(dT)24 primer (Operon). This cDNA was used as a template for the synthesis of biotinylated cRNA using the T7 MEGAscript kit from Ambion. Biotinylated cRNA probes were fragmented and hybridized to MG-U74A(v2) GeneChips (Affymetrix) using an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 and standard Affymetrix protocols. Fluorescence intensities were captured with a GeneArray Scanner (Hewlett-Packard). GeneChip image files were processed using Microarray Analysis Suite, version 5.0 (Affymetrix). Probe cells displaying irregular fluorescence intensity over the area of the cell were excluded from subsequence analyses. To facilitate comparison between samples and experiments, the trimmed mean signal of each array was scaled to a target intensity of 1500. Comparative analysis between treatment and control samples for each time point was performed with the Affymetrix statistical algorithm using default parameters. To compensate for gene expression changes occurring in the control cultures over time, each treated sample was compared with a control sample that was split and harvested in parallel with the treated population. Metric files from expression and comparison analyses were exported to Microsoft Access XP for further filtering and analysis. In this work, genes called “significantly changed” were those that possessed a reliably detectable signal (absolute call ≠ “absent” and signal ≥500 in treatment or control samples for inductions or repressions, respectively) and were determined by the statistical algorithm to be changed 2-fold or greater (change call ≠ “no change” and signal ≥500 in treatment or control samples for inductions or repressions, respectively). To increase stringency, genes meeting the above criteria were filtered further to include only those that also were changed in the same direction (change call ≠ no change) in at least one adjacent time point regardless of magnitude. cDNA Cloning of dig2—Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using 5′-CTTCTGTGCGCCTTCATTC-3′ and 5′-CTCAGGTGGCTATCGTCAGT-3′ as primers with first strand DNA as templates that were reverse transcribed using total RNA purified from S49.A2 and normal mouse thymocytes. PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and DNA inserts were sequenced in both directions by Cleveland Genomics Inc. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by purification through an RNeasy minicolumn (Qiagen). Total RNA (10 μg for the sample from cultured cells and 2.5 μg for the sample from primary thymocytes) was separated in a 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 10× SSC (contents of 1× SSC, 0.15 m NaCl, and 15 mm sodium citrate, pH7.0) by capillary blotting. The RNA was fixed to the membrane by cross-linking with UV (245 nm, 30 s, 1200 μJ) using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Membranes were hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe in QuikHyb (Stratagene) at 65 °C. Membranes were subsequently washed at 65 °C twice for 15 min each in 2× SSC, once for 30 min in 2× SSC 0.1% SDS, and once for 10 min in 0.1× SSC 0.1% SDS. Densitometric analysis of Northern blot data was performed using NIH ImageJ software. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (10Wang Z. Malone M.H. He H. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. April 2, 2003; (DOI 10.1074/jbc.M301843200)Google Scholar). The anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was purchased from Clontech, and the anti-β-actin antibody was obtained from Sigma. Enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences) was used for antibody detection. Cloning of a Novel Dex-induced Gene—In response to Dex, S49.A2 and WEHI7.2 cells undergo cell growth arrest first, followed by apoptosis. In contrast, primary murine thymocytes are already growth-arrested and rapidly undergo apoptosis following Dex treatment (1Ashwell J.D. Lu F.W. Vacchio M.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 2Distelhorst C.W. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Because all three systems undergo apoptosis and because apoptotic pathways are generally highly conserved, we sought to identify Dex-induced genes common to all three cell systems. To identify Dex-regulated gene(s), we utilized oligonucleotide microarray technology. Total RNA was purified from S49.A2 and WEHI7.2 cells treated with or without 1 μm Dex for 6, 12, 18, and 24 h or isolated from primary thymocytes treated with 1 μm Dex for 2 h. The control cells at each time point were treated with ethanol vehicle only. Isolated RNA was then hybridized to Affymetrix MG-U74A(v2) oligonucleotide microarrays representing ∼10,000 genes and ESTs. Pairwise analysis (comparing gene expression between Dex-treated and time-matched untreated control cells) was used to identify differentially expressed genes. The expression of a total of 132 genes in S49.A2, 296 genes in WEHI7.2, and 59 genes in primary thymocytes were changed significantly (10Wang Z. Malone M.H. He H. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. April 2, 2003; (DOI 10.1074/jbc.M301843200)Google Scholar). However, only seven genes were coordinately regulated by Dex in S49.A2, WEHI7.2, and the primary thymocytes. The fold induction for these seven genes after Dex treatment at each time point is listed in Table I. One of the ESTs, AI849939, which was induced 2.3∼5.7-fold after Dex treatment in S49.A2, WEHI7.2, and the primary thymocytes, was selected for further study.Table IGenes regulated by Dex in S49.A2 cells, WEHI7.2 cells, and normal mouse thymocytesGene nameGenBank™S49.A2WEHI7.2Thymus (2 h)6 h12 h18 h24 h6 h12 h18 h24 hESTAI8499394.63.23.25.73.75.72.335.7TDAG8U398273.53.2445.36.18.611.35.7HerpAI8469382.61.62.63.24.35.75.37.52Acid phosphataseM990541.12.13.23.22.543.52.82.1BimLAA7966902.31.72.12.31.41.92.12.12.6IκBαAI642048NCNC23.2NC1.61.522ESTAA717740NC0.70.5NC0.40.40.5NC0.5 Open table in a new tab The results of the microarray for AI849939 as presented in hybridization signal intensity are shown in Fig. 1A. This was further confirmed by Northern blot analysis of RNA from Dex-treated S49.A2 cells, WEHI7.2 cells, and primary thymocytes using AI849939 as a probe (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, AI849939 was rapidly induced as early as 30 min after the addition of Dex to S49.A2 cells. Furthermore, AI849939 was also up-regulated when WEHI7.2 cells were treated with doses of Dex as low as 5 nm (data not shown). A BLAST search of the public data base revealed that AI849939 has 100% sequence homology with a previously uncharacterized gene, RIKEN cDNA (AK017926), and its single open reading frame codes for a putative protein of 229 amino acids. Therefore, we have designated it dig2 (for dexamethasone-induced gene 2). dig2 is transcribed as a single mRNA species around 1.8 kb. To clone the coding region of dig2, reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using RNA purified from Dex-treated S49.A2 and normal mouse thymus gland. The sequence of the PCR products revealed that dig2 has two isoforms with only three nucleotides (one amino acid) difference between them (Fig. 2A). Northern blot analysis using a mouse master blot (Clontech) revealed that dig2 is ubiquitously expressed not only in multiple mouse tissues in the adult but also in early developmental stages from embryo days 7 to 17 (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Nucleotide sequence of mouse dig2 cDNA and its expression in multiple tissues. A, the predicted amino acid sequence for dig2 is shown by the single-letter code under the nucleotide sequence. The numbers of amino acid positions relative to the initiating Met are shown in parentheses under those of the nucleotide positions. The underlined sequence (three nucleotides or one amino acid) for Dig2 is deleted to make the short form of Dig2 (GenBank™ accession number AY260552). B, distribution of dig2 in early developmental stages and various mouse tissues. A master blot membrane was purchased from Clontech (catalog no. 7771-1) and contains normalized loading of poly(A)+ RNA from 22 different mouse tissues and seven different control RNAs and DNAs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dex-induced dig2 Expression Requires Transcriptional Activation Mediated through the Glucocorticoid Receptor—Because Dex rapidly induced dig2 mRNA expression, we questioned whether this induction is transcriptionally regulated. As shown in Fig. 3A, actinomycin D (Act D) treatment inhibited dig2 mRNA induction by Dex, whereas cycloheximide (CHX) did not. This result suggests that the induction of dig2 by Dex is transcriptionally controlled. It is also notable that dig2 seems to have a relatively short half-life, because the abundance of dig2 mRNA decreased to nearly undetectable levels from 3 to 12 h after actinomycin D treatment. RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, prevented the induction of dig2 mRNA by Dex in S49.A2 cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, dig2 was not induced by Dex in S49.143R cells, which contain defective glucocorticoid receptors (data not shown). This indicates that the induction of dig2 mRNA expression requires a functional glucocorticoid receptor. dig2 Is a Novel Stress Response Gene—Among the seven genes regulated by Dex (Table I), herp has been reported as an endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress response gene induced by homocysteine, β-mercaptoethanol, tunicamycin (TU), A23187, and thapsigargin (TG) (11Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, we checked whether Dex treatment is able to induce an ER stress response. Though the treatment with Dex induced the expression of herp and gadd153/chop in S49.A2 cells as confirmed by Northern blot analysis, treatment with Dex did not induce the expression of the typical ER stress response genes encoding the glucose-regulated proteins (Grps), grp78 and grp94 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the ER stress inducers, TG and TU, did cause a rapid induction of dig2 in S49.A2 cells (Fig. 5A). The induction of dig2 expression by TG and TU was not dependent on a functional glucocorticoid receptor, because dig2 mRNA was induced dramatically in S49.143R cells, which do not have functional glucocorticoid receptors (Fig. 5B). This up-regulation of dig2 by TG and TU was not limited to T lymphoma cells, as it was also induced in MDA-MB-468 cells, a human breast cancer cell line (Fig. 5C). These results indicated that dig2 is a novel stress response gene. The Grps and heat shock proteins (Hsps) represent the two major groups of stress-response proteins. In Fig. 6A, we have shown that a brief heat shock treatment (43 °C, 5 min) also up-regulates dig2 gene expression in S49.A2 cells. Furthermore, when S49.A2 cells were treated with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 6B) or cultured under conditions of osmotic stress (dMEM with 0.15 m NaCl, 5 min) (Fig. 6C), the expression of dig2 mRNA was also induced, although the level of induction is not as significant as that following TU and TG treatment. These findings further support the concept that dig2 is a stress response gene.Fig. 5Induction of dig2 mRNA expression by ER stress inducers, thapsigargin (TG), and tunicamycin (TU). Total RNA from S49.A2 (A), S49.143R (B), and MDA-MB-468 (C) cells that were left untreated or treated by 1 μm Dex, 100 nm TG, or 10 μg/ml TU for the indicated hours were analyzed. Each lane contained 10 μg of total RNA. Membranes were first probed with dig2 and then stripped and probed for grp78 and grp94.

Cells were left untreated or treated by 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (BME) for the indicated hours (B). The membrane was stripped and probed for β-actin as a loading control.

Therefore, we tested whether the induction of dig2 expression is associated generally with apoptosis. As revealed by Northern hybridization, when S49.A2 cells were treated with 250 nm staurosporine (STS), a protein kinase C inhibitor, dig2 expression was not induced (Fig. 7A). However, etoposide, another apoptosis inducer in S49.A2 cells, induced dig2 expression significantly (Fig. 7B). dig2 induction by Dex, TG, TU, and etoposide was not affected by Bcl-2 overexpression (Fig. 7C). Overexpression of Dig2 Desensitizes Cells to Dex-induced Apoptosis—To assess the effect of Dig2 on the viability of WEHI7.2 cells, we cloned the cDNA encoding Myc-tagged Dig2 into the expression vector, pIRESneo2 (Clontech), in both sense and antisense orientations. We obtained clones stably expressing Myc-tagged Dig2 when WEHI7.2 cells were transfected with the sense orientation vector. Though the Dig2 protein has an estimated molecular mass of 25 kDa, Western analysis revealed that Myc-tagged Dig2 gives rise to a protein product with a size estimated around 35 kDa (Fig. 8A). This suggests that Dig2 is post-translationally modified. No clones were obtained when WEHI7.2 cells were transfected with the antisense vector. This finding suggests that the function of Dig2 may be essential for cell survival. Consistent with this conclusion, we found a lower percentage of dead cells in untreated cultures of WEHI7.2 cells that stably express Myc-tagged Dig2, versus control cells transfected with the empty vector (5.3 × 1.9% (at 24 h) and 4.3 × 2.8% (at 36 h) versus 13.5 × 6.1% (at 24 h) and 13.8 × 5.2% (at 36 h), n = 4, p is <0.05 (at 24 h) and <0.02 (at 36 h), respectively) (Fig. 8B). To determine whether Dig2 regulates cell death induction by Dex, cells stably expressing Myc-tagged Dig2 and empty vector control cells were treated with 1 μm Dex for 24 and 36 h. The percentage of dead cells following Dex treatment was much less in cells expressing Myc-tagged Dig2 compared with cells transfected with empty vector (9.6 × 0.9% (24 h after Dex) and 40.7 × 3.9% (36 h after Dex) versus 28.7 × 8.5% (24 h after Dex) and 73.0 × 6.5% (36 h after Dex), n = 4, p is <0.02 (24 h) and <0.0001 (36 h), respectively) (Fig. 8B). We have examined two independently selected clones of Neo and Dig2 and obtained essentially the same results in independent clones (data not shown). These findings indicate that Dig2 has a pro-survival function. We report the identification and cloning of a novel stress response gene, dig2. This gene has widespread tissue distribution. Moreover, it is strongly induced in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells by TG, TU, and etoposide, as well as being moderately induced by cellular stressors including osmotic stress, β-mercaptoethanol, and heat shock. Also, dig2 transcription is induced by Dex only in lymphoid cells (Fig. 1), whereas it is not induced by Dex in non-lymphoid MDA-MB-468 cells (data not shown). dig2 is a mouse homologue of a novel hypoxia-inducible factor 1-responsive gene, rtp801, reported during the course of the present work (12Shoshani T. Faerman A. Mett I. Zelin E. Tenne T. Gorodin S. Moshel Y. Elbaz S. Budanov A. Chajut A. Kalinski H. Kamer I. Rozen A. Mor O. Keshet E. Leshkowitz D. Einat P. Skaliter R. Feinstein E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2283-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Also, we detect an EST corresponding to dig2 among a list of p53-regulated transcripts (13Kannan K. Kaminski N. Rechavi G. Jakob-Hirsch J. Amariglio N. Givol D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3449-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings indicate that dig2 is induced in response to a wide variety of cellular stressors. One remarkable observation about dig2 is the rapidity of its induction. dig2 induction by thapsigargin was much more rapid than the induction of the well characterized ER stress response genes grp78 and grp94 (Fig. 5). This is much more rapid than most of the other Dex-induced transcripts detected with microarrays. Furthermore, although the induction of dig2 by Dex was mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor and blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486, the mechanism of dig2 induction is presently uncertain. Moreover, the increase in levels of dig2 mRNA following Dex treatment was blocked by actinomycin D but not by cycloheximide. These findings suggest that transcriptional up-regulation was at least in part responsible for dig2 induction and that new protein synthesis (e.g. of an intermediate signaling factor) was not required. Together, these findings, including the rapidity of induction, suggest the possibility of direct transactivation of the dig2 gene by the glucocorticoid receptor. However, analysis of the 5′ dig2 promoter sequence failed to detect a consensus sequence corresponding to a typical glucocorticoid response element. Moreover, an 800 base pair region 5′ to the transcription initiation site of dig2 was cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid. However, Dex failed to induce luciferase activity when this reporter plasmid was expressed by transient transfection in WEHI7.2 cells (data not shown). Thus, based on these preliminary findings, there is no evidence of direct regulation of a dig2 promoter/enhancer region by the glucocorticoid receptor. Further work will be needed to uncover the mechanism of dig2 induction by Dex and other cellular stressors. The mammalian stress response is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that allows cells to respond to adverse environment or metabolic conditions. A wide range of stresses, including heat shock, inhibition of energy metabolism, and oxidative stress induce expression of Hsps (14Jolly C. Morimoto R.I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Hsps assist in the recovery from stress either by degrading or repairing damaged proteins (protein refolding). The term “glucose-regulated proteins” encompasses a variety of ER chaperones that can be induced by glucose starvation or depletion of ER calcium (15Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Perturbations in ER function disrupt protein folding, leading to accumulation of unfolded proteins and protein aggregates that are detrimental to cell function and survival. Hence, the induction of Grps is referred to as the unfolded protein response. A number of different proteins are induced by ER stress. Many of these reside in the ER lumen (e.g. Grp78 and Grp94) or are located on the ER transmembrane (e.g. Herp), but several are in non-ER locations, including gadd153/CHOP (nucleus), GLUT-1 (plasma membrane) and asparagine synthetase (cytoplasm) (15Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 16Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We are interested in investigating the mechanism of apoptosis induction by glucocorticosteroid hormones. Exposure of lymphocytes to Dex induces a unique form of cell stress. Dex quickly up-regulates the ER stress gene herp and also induces the expression of gadd153/chop (Fig. 4), an ER stress and apoptosis-related protein. Here, we have found that Dex treatment rapidly induces a stress response gene, dig2. However, Dex does not elevate the expression of grp78 and grp94. This suggests that the induction of dig2 by Dex is mediated through a signaling pathway different from that mediating induction of grp78 and grp94. The events of cell stress and cell death are linked, such that the molecular chaperones induced in response to stress appear to function at key regulatory points in the control of apoptosis (14Jolly C. Morimoto R.I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Hsp expression is modulated by many conditions that lead to apoptosis. Exposure of cells to stress activates a survival response via the induction of Hsps. Moreover, induction of Grps is essential for maintenance of cell survival following ER stress (15Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Here, the induction of dig2 expression may well have been a survival response when cells were exposed to the apoptosis inducer Dex. This hypothesis is supported by the evidence that overexpression of Dig2 did inhibit Dex-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8). Moreover, enforced expression of rtp801, a homologue of dig2, inhibited hypoxia-induced apoptosis, although, paradoxically, this same gene appeared to promote apoptosis when expressed in non-dividing cells (12Shoshani T. Faerman A. Mett I. Zelin E. Tenne T. Gorodin S. Moshel Y. Elbaz S. Budanov A. Chajut A. Kalinski H. Kamer I. Rozen A. Mor O. Keshet E. Leshkowitz D. Einat P. Skaliter R. Feinstein E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2283-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Thus, although the mechanism of dig2/rtp801 action is unknown, this gene appears to play a role in regulating cell survival. In summary, the present work identifies dig2 as a novel stress gene that is rapidly induced in response to a variety of cellular stresses. The induction of dig2 may serve a protective function, delaying or inhibiting apoptosis. Its mechanism of action and potential other functions remain to be elucidated. Moreover, the signal transduction pathway(s) that mediate dig2 induction in response to such a wide range of cellular stresses provides a challenge for further investigation.

This study shows that the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGlu5, mobilizes nuclear Ca2+ independent of cytosolic Ca2+ regulation. Immunocytochemical, ultrastructural, and subcellular fractionation techniques revealed that the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGlu5, can be localized to nuclear membranes in heterologous cells as well as midbrain and cortical neurons. Nuclear mGlu5 receptors derived from HEK cells or cortical cell types bound [3H]quisqualate. When loaded with Oregon Green BAPTA, nuclei isolated from mGlu5-expressing HEK cells responded to the addition of glutamate with rapid, oscillatory [Ca2+] elevations that were blocked by antagonist or EGTA. In contrast, carbachol-activation of endogenous muscarinic receptors led to cytoplasmic but not nuclear Ca2+ responses. Similarly, activation of mGlu5 receptors expressed on neuronal nuclei led to sustained Ca2+ oscillatory responses. These results suggest mGlu5 may mediate intranuclear signaling pathways.

Changes in nuclear Ca2+ play an integral role in cellular functions such as protein import, apoptosis, and gene transcription (1Berridge M.J. Novartis Found Symp. 2001; 239: 52-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rogue P.J. Malviya A.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5147-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nuclear Ca2+ may be generated from a number of sources including diffusion of cytosolic Ca2+ waves through nuclear pore complexes (2Rogue P.J. Malviya A.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5147-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because the outer nuclear envelope is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum, which serves as an internal store of Ca2+, rises in nuclear Ca2+ may also be attributable to a luminal source (3Petersen O.H. Tepikin A. Park M.K. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 271-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recent studies using high speed imaging of intracellular Ca2+ have shown that waves of Ca2+ can invade the nucleus by emptying intracellular stores (4Power J.M. Sah P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3454-3462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium release from internal stores is controlled by various channels including the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PLC, phospholipase C; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HEK, human embryonic kidney; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; TBOA, dl-threo-β-benzoxylaspartate; TEA, threo-β-OH-aspartic acid; MPEP, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine. receptor and ryanodine receptor families (5Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J.

Novartis Found Symp. 2001; 239: 52-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) although nuclear IP3 can stimulate IP3 receptors located on the inner nuclear membrane and cADP ribose has been shown to activate nuclear ryanodine receptors (7Gerasimenko O.V.

Thus, although signals originating at the plasma membrane may be transmitted to the nucleus (4Power J.M. Sah P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3454-3462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the presence of specific Ca2+ transporters on the nuclear envelope argues for a nuclear Ca2+ regulatory system that may be independent of cytosolic Ca2+ regulation. Many components of G protein signaling pathways are also found in the nucleus or associated with nuclear membranes. These include phospholipase C isozymes (11Irvine R.

Cell Biol. 2002; 78: 387-394Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that plasma membrane-based signaling components may also serve a similar function at nuclear membranes. Indeed, several recent reports are consistent with the notion that nuclear G protein-coupled receptors directly modulate nuclear signal transduction pathways. For example, angiotensin II receptors were found on hepatocyte nuclear membranes (19Lu D. Yang H. Shaw G. Raizada M.K. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), opioid binding sites were described on ventricular myocardial nuclei (20Ventura C. Maioli M. Pintus G. Posadino A.M. Tadolini B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13383-13386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and endothelin-1 receptors were reported on vascular smooth muscle nuclear membranes (21Bkaily G. Choufani S. Hassan G. El-Bizri N. Jacques D. D'Orleans-Juste P. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 36: S414-S417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct evidence of nuclear receptor G protein signaling has also been demonstrated for prostaglandin receptors which, when stimulated, cause rapid Ca2+ influx into the nucleus (22Bhattacharya M. Peri K. Ribeiro-da-Silva A. Almazan G. Shichi H. Hou X. Varma D.R. Chemtob S. J. Biol.

Taken together, these data suggest that nuclear signaling may represent a versatile, independent system by which nuclear function is regulated. Glutamate, the major excitatory amino acid in the brain, activates a wide range of both ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors. The latter, so-called metabotropic glutamate receptors, are widely expressed throughout the central nervous system where they are thought to be involved with many critical processes including neuronal development, learning and memory, and neurodegeneration (24Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 465-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Structural and functional criteria have further subdivided the metabotropic receptors into 3 groups; Group I include mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors, which stimulate PLC activity and release Ca2+ from cytoplasmic stores (24Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 465-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 25Schoepp D.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 12-20PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium can also modulate the glutamate sensitivity of Group I receptors (Refs. 26Kubokawa K. Miyashita T. Nagasawa H. Kubo Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Kubo Y. Miyashita T. Murata Y. Science. 1998; 279: 1722-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Tabata T. Aiba A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19286-19293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although mGlu1 and mGlu5 utilize similar signal transduction pathways, activation of mGlu1 receptors elicits a single Ca2+ peak (30Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) whereas mGlu5 activation leads to a marked oscillatory response in heterologous cells (30Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A.

Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) as well as neocortical, hippocampal (33Flint A.C. Dammerman R.S. Kriegstein A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12144-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and spinal cord neurons (34Kettunen P. Krieger P. Hess D. El Manira A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1868-1873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been estimated that 90% of the Ca2+ oscillations that occur spontaneously in immature cortical neurons can be ascribed to mGlu5 receptors (33Flint A.C. Dammerman R.S. Kriegstein A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12144-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as Ca2+ oscillations can differentially affect gene expression (35Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), they play an important role in the control of developmental events. Electron microscopic studies have shown that Group l mGlu receptors can be localized at the edge of asymmetric and in symmetric synapses (36Hubert G.W. Paquet M. Smith Y. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1838-1847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lopez-Bendito G. Shigemoto R. Fairen A. Lujan R. Cereb.

Neuroanat. 1997; 13: 219-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) in a variety of brain regions. In addition, mGlu5 and mGlu1 have also been localized intracellularly where they are predominately associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or nuclear membranes (36Hubert G.W. Paquet M. Smith Y. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1838-1847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lopez-Bendito G. Shigemoto R. Fairen A. Lujan R. Cereb.

Neuroanat. 1997; 13: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because these receptors are activated by contact with their endogenous ligands at the cell surface, intracellular accumulation is presumed to represent either receptor sequestration and/or “extra” receptors poised to be inserted into the membrane if needed. Here, we show that activation of nuclear mGlu5 receptors can trigger Ca2+ oscillations in both the cytoplasm as well as isolated nuclei. These data suggest that nuclear receptors can independently activate rises in nuclear Ca2+ and that intracellular receptors can have functions other than serving as spare receptors. Cell Culture and Plasmids—HEK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) as described (32Romano C. Miller J.K. Hyrc K. Dikranian S. Mennerick S. Takeuchi Y. Goldberg M.P. O'Malley K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Midbrain cultures were prepared and maintained exactly as described (40Lotharius J. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38581-38588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The mGlu5 stable cell line was generated using standard transfection techniques followed by repetitive rounds of limiting dilution (32Romano C. Miller J.K. Hyrc K. Dikranian S. Mennerick S. Takeuchi Y. Goldberg M.P. O'Malley K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The N-terminal HA-tagged mGlu5 clone was generated previously (32Romano C. Miller J.K. Hyrc K. Dikranian S. Mennerick S. Takeuchi Y. Goldberg M.P. O'Malley K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid containing the full-length clone of GABAB2 was obtained from Dr. Bernhard Bettler (Novartis, AG, Basel, Switzerland). A GFP-tagged Gq plasmid was obtained from Dr. Thomas Hughes (Yale, New Haven, CT). The Semliki Forest virus vector used to deliver mGlu5 into postmitotic neurons was obtained from Dr. Kenneth Lundstrom (Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland). This cloning vector, pSFV(PD) contains two point mutations inhibiting cytotoxicity (41Lundstrom K. J. Recept. Signal Transduct Res. 1999; 19: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The construct, pSFV(PD)-mGlu5, was created using standard cloning methodologies. SFV stocks were produced as described (42Ehrengruber M.U. Lundstrom K. Curr. Prot. Neurosci. Wiley, New York2000: 4.22.1-4.22.23Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro transcribed RNA molecules from pSFV(PD)-mGlu5 were cotransfected via electroporation into BHK cells with the pSFV-Helper2 RNA. Viral stocks were harvested 18 h later and filter-sterilized. Viral stocks were subsequently activated with α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) and the reaction terminated with aprotinin (Sigma) as described (42Ehrengruber M.U. Lundstrom K. Curr. Prot. Neurosci. Wiley, New York2000: 4.22.1-4.22.23Google Scholar). Approximate viral titers were determined by transduction of HEK cells with serial dilutions of SFV(PD)-mGlu5 followed by immunocytochemistry 1 day later. Subcellular Fractionation—The mGlu5 receptor stable cell line was grown to near confluency, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping followed by centrifugation. Postnatal day 3 mouse forebrains were processed by mincing tissue on ice with a razor blade into 1 mm cubes. Tissue cubes or cellular pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of Buffer “A” medium containing 2.0 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and protease inhibitors (Complete Tablets; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). After swelling for 10 min on ice, cells were homogenized in a Wheaton glass homogenizer using 15 strokes with a “B” pestle. The homogenate was filtered through 3 layers of sterile gauze and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of Buffer N containing 0.25 m sucrose in buffer A. Resuspended nuclei were layered over 2 ml of medium containing 1.1 m sucrose in buffer A, and then recentrifuged at 1000 × g. This step was repeated twice. The final nuclear pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer as described (32Romano C. Miller J.K. Hyrc K. Dikranian S. Mennerick S. Takeuchi Y. Goldberg M.P. O'Malley K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The supernatant from the first pellet was concurrently further fractionated by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 40 min. This second supernatant represented soluble, cytoplasmic proteins whereas the high speed pellet contained plasma membrane proteins. Aliquots from each fraction were used for gel electrophoresis as well as membrane binding. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Immunocytochemical and Confocal Microscopic Studies—Cells for immunocytochemical and confocal microscopic studies were grown on poly-d-lysine-treated glass coverslips, 8-well chamber slides, and/or dishes with 35-mm glass grids (Mat-Tek, Ashland, MA). Fixation, blocking, and antibody incubation were as described (32Romano C. Miller J.K. Hyrc K. Dikranian S. Mennerick S. Takeuchi Y. Goldberg M.P. O'Malley K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) with the exception of experiments permeabilizing membranes with digitonin. In the latter cases, permeabilization, fixation, staining, etc. were performed exactly as described by Watkins et al. (43Watkins J.L. Murphy R. Emtage J.L. Wente S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6779-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies included affinity-purified anti-C-terminal mGlu5 (1:300; 44) and anti-mGlu1a (1:300; 45), polyclonal anti-HA (1:250; Babco, Berkeley, CA), monoclonal anti-lamin B2 (1:100; Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA), monoclonal anti-ryanodine receptor (1:200; MA3–925, Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO), and polyclonal anti-GFP (1:500; Chemicon, Temecula, CA). GABAB2 was detected with rabbit antibody AbC22 (1:1000; 46). Secondary antibodies included goat anti-rabbit and/or anti-mouse Cy3 (both at 1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:300; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:2000; Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy was performed using an Olympus Fluoview microscope and associated software. Electron Microscopy—Adult Long-Evans rats were perfused, fixed, and sectioned exactly as described (47Gonchar Y. Pang L. Malitschek B. Bettler B. Burkhalter A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 431: 82-97Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thin sections were mounted on nickel grids and staining was performed on drops of rabbit anti-mGlu5 antibody followed by a goat anti-rabbit secondary conjugated to 15-nm gold particles (1:25; Amersham Biosciences). Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and ultrastructural analysis was performed in a Jeol-100 electron microscope. [3H]Quisqualate Binding Assay—Nuclear and plasma membrane fractions were prepared as described. Both pellets were subsequently washed three times in 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with protease inhibitors followed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 35 min. The final pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm Ca2+, and protease inhibitors. Binding was performed as described (32Romano C. Miller J.K. Hyrc K. Dikranian S. Mennerick S. Takeuchi Y. Goldberg M.P. O'Malley K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Measurements of Intracellular Ca2 + —For whole cell measurements, mGlu5 expressing HEK cells were grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm Petri dishes overnight, washed with serum-free medium (SFM), and incubated with 10 μm Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM/0.00l% pluronic acid (Molecular Probes) in SFM for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with SFM and then imaged in real time using an Olympus Fluoview laser scanning confocal microscope. Drugs at 100× concentrations were added to the side of the dish and allowed to diffuse over the cells at room temperature. Glutamate was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, the mGlu5-specific antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP; Tocris) at 1 μm, the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, at 1 mm, and the glutamate transport blockers, dl-threo-β-benzoxylaspartate (TBOA) at 1, 10, and 100 μm and threo-β-OH-aspartic acid (TEA; Sigma) at 100 μm final concentration. In some experiments after dye loading, SFM was replaced with a standard ringers solution in which choline was substituted for sodium (138 mm choline, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.25). For whole cell measurements of SFV-transduced midbrain cultures, cells plated on glass ovals with grids were maintained in Neurobasal media until DIV 7 when they were transduced with SFV-mGlu5 or SFV-Pael-R viral particles at an MOI of 1 for 60 min. SFV-Pael-R served as a non-mGlu5-related control. Cells were subsequently allowed to recover and express foreign gene product for 5 h prior to being loaded with Oregon Green BAPTA and imaged as described above. To measure Ca2+ changes in individual nuclei, cells were plated at low density on 35-mm glass bottom, dishes with grids, and grown overnight. Cells were loaded with Oregon Green BAPTA as above, washed with SFM and then phosphate-buffered saline. Dishes were placed on ice and covered with medium containing 0.125 m sucrose, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and protease inhibitors for 10 min. These conditions were empirically found to gently lyse plasma cell membranes while leaving nuclear membranes intact and nuclei attached to the dish. Subsequently, the lysing medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then SFM. Nuclei were imaged immediately thereafter. Drug treatments were identical to whole cells. Following image collection, cells/nuclei were fixed, stained, with anti-mGlu5 and/or lamin B2, and field relocated to verify nuclear designations. mGlu1 Receptors Are Localized at Both the Nuclear and Plasma Membranes—Electron microscopic analyses have revealed Group l mGlu receptors on nuclear and ER membranes (36Hubert G.W.

To establish a system in which nuclear receptor function could be addressed, cDNAs for each receptor were transiently transfected into a variety of cell types including human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Antibodies against the C-terminal portion of the mGlu5 protein stained the plasma membrane as well as ER and nuclear membranes in transiently transfected (Fig. 1) and stable HEK cell lines (Fig. 2B). Nuclear localization was determined by co-staining with the nuclear membrane marker lamin B2 (Fig. 1). In contrast, GABAB2 was predominately localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). Ryanodine receptor family members are expressed in the ER as well as nuclear membranes (48Williams A.J. West D.J. Sitsapesan R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 61-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Anti-ryanodine receptor-2 co-localized with mGlu5 around the nuclear membrane (Fig. 1C). Treatment with 1 mm glutamate or baclofen did not produce an obvious re-distribution of receptor subtypes in these cultures (not shown). Naive HEK cells or ones expressing un-related receptors never exhibited mGlu5 immunoreactivity (Ref. 44Romano C. Sesma M.A. McDonald C.T. O'Malley K. Van den Pol A.N. Olney J.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 455-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar and not shown)Fig. 2Localization of mGlu5 N terminus to nuclear membranes. A, N-terminal-tagged mGlu5 receptors are present on nuclear membranes. HEK cells were transiently transfected with the cDNA for HA-tagged mGlu5 and then processed using digitonin permeabilization techniques as indicated. The lack of anti-HA staining under Digitonin-Fix conditions shows the lack of antibody accessibility to the nuclear lumen in the absence of Triton-X-100. B, anti-mGlu5 labels isolated nuclei from mGlu5 stable cell line. Aliquots of nuclei used for subcellular fractionation were allowed to adhere to a poly-d-lysine-treated coverslip prior to fixation, permeabilization, and incubation with antibodies directed against mGlu5 receptors (green), lamin B2 (red), or ryanodine receptors (red). Nuclei were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Merged images of single 0.4-μm optical sections confirm mGlu5/lamin B2 co-localization in yellow. C, GFP-tagged Gq is widely expressed in transfected HEK cells including the nuclear envelop. HEK cells transiently transfected with GFP-tagged Gq were fixed and permeabilized with Triton-X-100 and processed for immunocytochemistry using receptor-specific antibodies as well as anti-GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the presence of mGlu5 on the nuclear membrane, conditions were used in which the plasma membrane was briefly permeabilized with digitonin (43Watkins J.L. Murphy R. Emtage J.L. Wente S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6779-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were then fixed and stained (Dig-Fix) or fixed, treated with Triton X-100, and stained (Dig-Fix-Triton). Without Triton X-100 the nuclear envelope and nuclear pore complexes remained intact, restricting antibody access. Thus, inner nuclear proteins such as lamin B2 were not observed using Dig-Fix conditions versus buffers containing Triton X-100 (Fig. 1D versus Fig. 1E). This strategy allowed mGlu5 receptors to be clearly visualized at the nuclear membrane in close proximity to lamin B2 (Fig. 1D). Because anti-mGlu5 antibodies labeled these receptors in the absence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 1E), many of these receptors must be on the outer nuclear membrane with their C-terminal domains cytoplasmically accessible. In contrast, the GABAB2 receptor was never seen on the nuclear membrane using either standard fixation or digitonin permeabilization techniques (Fig. 1, B, D, and E). The latter process essentially removed all detectable GABAB2 receptor from the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, D and E). Identical intracellular localization patterns were observed for mGlu5 and GABAB2 receptors in CHO, PC12, and MN9D cells (not shown). These data suggest that a significant fraction of mGlu5 receptors but not GABAB2 can be expressed on nuclear membranes in heterologous cell types. Since the antibody used to determine the subcellular localization of mGlu5 was directed against its C terminus, HEK cells were transiently transfected with an N-terminal HA-tagged mGlu5 receptor (32Romano C. Miller J.K. Hyrc K. Dikranian S. Mennerick S. Takeuchi Y. Goldberg M.P. O'Malley K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) to determine whether the N-terminal portion of the receptor was also co-localized with nuclear membranes. Anti-HA antibodies also showed co-localization of this marker with lamin B2 (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that the entire mGlu5 receptor is present on the nuclear membrane, not just the C terminus. Using digitonin permeabilization techniques, N-terminally tagged mGlu5 receptors were only observed on nuclear membranes in the presence of Triton-X-100 (Fig. 2A). This finding suggests that the N terminus of mGlu5 is within the nuclear lumen and thus inaccessible to antibody. To confirm and extend the nuclear localization of mGlu5, aliquots of HEK nuclei prepared as described below were allowed to adhere to a poly-d-lysine-coated glass disc, fixed and processed for immunohistochemistry. The mGlu5 receptor staining co-localized with lamin B2 as well as the ryanodine receptor (Fig. 2B). Staining was confined essentially to the periphery of the nucleus or in regions of the endoplasmic reticulum adjacent to it. These results further corroborate the wh"

Here, the four disulfide bonds of AVR4 were identified as Cys-11-41, Cys-21-27, Cys-35-80, and Cys-57-72 by partial reduction with Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride, subsequent cyanylation, and base-catalyzed chain cleavage. The resulting peptide fragments were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Sequence homology and the disulfide bond pattern revealed that AVR4 contains an invertebrate (inv) chitin-binding domain (ChBD). Binding of AVR4 to chitin was confirmed experimentally. The three disulfide bonds encompassing the inv ChBD motif are also required for protein stability of AVR4. Independent disruption of each of the three conserved disulfide bonds in AVR4 resulted in a protease-sensitive protein, whereas the fourth disulfide bond appeared not to be required for protein stability. Most strains of C. fulvum virulent on Cf-4 tomato contain Cys to Tyr substitutions in AVR4 involving two (Cys-11-41, Cys-35-80) of the three disulfide bonds present in the inv ChBD motif. These natural Cys to Tyr mutant AVR4 proteins did retain their chitin binding ability and when bound to chitin were less sensitive to proteases. Thus, the widely applied tomato Cf-4 resistance gene is circumvented by C. fulvum by amino acid substitutions affecting two disulfide bonds in AVR4 resulting in the absence of the corresponding AVR4 isoforms in apoplastic fluid. However, these natural isoforms of AVR4 appear to have retained their intrinsic function, i.e. binding to chitin present in the cell wall of C. fulvum, most likely to protect it against the deleterious effects of plant chitinases.

To obtain sustainable resistance, the Cf resistance genes were introgressed from wild Lycopersicon species into commercial tomato cultivars. However, because of selection pressure new strains of C. fulvum emerged that had overcome the introgressed resistance traits by modification of the Avr genes (10Day P.R. Nature. 1957; 179: 1141Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although some Avr genes in these virulent C. fulvum strains were found to be absent (11van Kan J.A.L. van den Ackerveken G.F.J.M. de Wit P.J.G.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1991; 4: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), others contained point mutations (12Joosten M.H.A.J. Cozijnsen T.J. de Wit P.J.G.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 384-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) or transposon insertions (13Luderer R. Takken F.L. de Wit P.J.G.M. Joosten M.H.A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The natural strains of C. fulvum carrying these mutated Avr genes did not exhibit significantly reduced virulence under laboratory conditions (11van Kan J.A.L. van den Ackerveken G.F.J.M. de Wit P.J.G.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1991; 4: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 12Joosten M.H.A.J. Cozijnsen T.J. de Wit P.J.G.M.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that AVR proteins are not essential for virulence or that the modified isoforms of AVRs still contribute to virulence of C. fulvum. The genetic variation is so far strictly limited to the race-specific Avrs and is absent in genes that encode other extracellular elicitor proteins of C. fulvum (15Luderer R. de Kock M.J.D. Dees R.H.L. de Wit P.J.G.M. Joosten M.H.A.J. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2002; 3: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the intrinsic role of the AVR proteins of C. fulvum during infection remains obscure, they are anticipated to contribute to virulence in susceptible hosts (16Kjemtrup S. Nimchuk Z. Dangl J.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17White F.F. Yang B. Johnson L.B. Curr. Opin.

This implies that evasion of Cf-mediated resistance by modification of Avr genes might be associated with a reduction or loss in virulence unless a functional gene remains. A candidate protein to investigate the latter idea is the race-specific elicitor AVR4 because Cf-4-mediated resistance is overcome in all but one case by single amino acid substitutions in the Avr4 gene (12Joosten M.H.A.J. Cozijnsen T.J. de Wit P.J.G.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 384-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Joosten M.H.A.J. Vogelsang R. Cozijnsen T.J. Verberne M.C. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, for AVR4 a virulence function is proposed in association with its ability to bind to chitin. AVR4 was found to protect fungi against degradation by plant chitinases by association with their hyphal wall. 3H. A. van den Burg, S. Harrison, M. H. A. J. Joosten, J. Vervoort, and P. J. G. M. de Wit, submitted for publication.3H. A. van den Burg, S. Harrison, M. H. A. J. Joosten, J. Vervoort, and P. J. G. M. de Wit, submitted for publication. Mutations in the Avr4 gene, as found in natural C. fulvum isolates virulent on the tomato genotype Cf-4, encode mostly single Cys to Tyr substitutions. In addition, two other mutations were found, i.e. Thr-66 to Ile and Tyr-67 to His. The Cys to Tyr substitutions involved the positions 64, 70, or 109 (which corresponds with Cys-35, -41, and -80 in the mature protein, respectively) (14Joosten M.H.A.J. Vogelsang R. Cozijnsen T.J. Verberne M.C. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these avr4 alleles still exhibited necrosis inducing activity when transiently expressed in Cf-4 tomato using potato virus X (PVX) (14Joosten M.H.A.J. Vogelsang R. Cozijnsen T.J. Verberne M.C. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of the AVR4 mutant isoforms could be detected in apoplastic fluid isolated from tomato leaves inoculated with C. fulvum (14Joosten M.H.A.J. Vogelsang R. Cozijnsen T.J. Verberne M.C. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry revealed that all Cys residues in AVR4 are involved in disulfide bonding (20van den Burg H.A. de Wit P.J.G.M. Vervoort J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Disulfide bond patterns and the sequential spacing between Cys residues define to a large extent the protein fold of secreted small proteins (21Harrison P.M. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 603-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Mas J.M. Aloy P. Marti R.M.A. Oliva B. Blanco A.C. Molina M.A. De Llorens R. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here, the disulfide bond connectivities of AVR4 are elucidated. The disulfide bond pattern of AVR4 shows homologies with the disulfide bond pattern found in the recently identified invertebrate chitin-binding domain (inv ChBD) (23Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), i.e. three of the four disulfide bonds of AVR4 (Cys-11-41, Cys-35-80, and Cys-57-72) are represented in the inv ChBD motif. Independent disruption of each of these three disulfide bonds in AVR4 results in a protein that is sensitive to proteases present in the apoplast, which suggests that these disulfide bridges are required for conformational stability of AVR4. The Cys to Tyr mutations identified in natural strains of C. fulvum involve two (Cys-11-41 and Cys-35-80) of these three conserved disulfide bonds. AVR4 isoforms with a disruption in one of these two disulfide bonds are still able to bind chitin. Our data support a model where evasion of Cf-4-mediated resistance appears to be based on decreased conformational stability of the AVR4 isoform, leading to protein degradation upon release in the tomato apoplast. Noteworthy, the AVR4 isoforms were found to be more resistant to proteases when bound to chitin. These findings argue that mutant AVR4 isoforms are fully functional and can associate with chitin upon release, whereas excess of secreted (and unbound) protein is degraded before triggering host defense responses. Construction of PVX Derivatives and Transcription—Avr4 mutants encoding various Cys to Ala substitutions were generated by PCR-based primer-directed mutagenesis on the plasmid pTXΔGC3a, containing the native Avr4 sequence (14Joosten M.H.A.J. Vogelsang R. Cozijnsen T.J. Verberne M.C. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar). PCR amplification was carried out using mutagenic primers (see Supplementary Table for primers) designated to generate two overlapping PCR fragments. PCR was used to combine the overlapping PCR fragments using the primers OX10 and N31, and the PCR product was cloned into the ClaI site of the vector pTXΔGC3a (24Chapman S. Kavanagh T. Baulcombe D. Plant J. 1992; 2: 549-557PubMed Google Scholar) and sequenced. In vitro transcription of the plasmids and subsequent inoculation on Nicotiana clevelandii and tomato was performed as described (14Joosten M.H.A.J. Vogelsang R. Cozijnsen T.J. Verberne M.C. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar). N. clevelandii and the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) cultivars Moneymaker (MM) and the near-isogenic line MM-Cf4 were grown as described previously (25de Wit P.J.G.M. Flach W. Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1979; 15: 257-267Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Partial Reduction and Cyanylation of the AVR4 Protein—Expression of heterologous AVR4 was achieved in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, and AVR4 was purified from culture fluid (20van den Burg H.A. de Wit P.J.G.M. Vervoort J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The disulfide bonds of AVR4 were partially reduced with TCEP (Sigma) (26Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 27Wu J. Watson J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A stock solution of 0.1 m TCEP was prepared in 6 m guanidine-HCl in 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 3) and stored at –20 °C (without any deterioration for up to six months). For each reduction reaction, 100 μg of native AVR4 was dissolved in 10 μlof6 m guanidine-HCl in 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 3). The reaction was initiated by adding a 6-fold molar excess of TCEP to AVR4, followed by incubation at 20 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, an 80-fold molar excess of CDAP (Sigma) was added to cyanylate the freed thiol groups (15 min, 20 °C, in the dark). The 0.1 m CDAP stock solution in 6 m guanidine-HCl in 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 3) was freshly prepared prior to each reaction. Reverse-phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography of the Peptide Mixture—The TCEP/CDAP reaction mixtures were separated by analytical reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a 150 × 3.9 mm Delta-Pak C18 column (300 Å, 5 μm; Waters). The separation was monitored at 215 nm, and predominant peaks were manually collected. HPLC elution solvents consisted of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A), and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). The HPLC was operated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The applied gradient was 5% → 20%B (percentage B in solvent A) in 2 min, 20% → 30% in 40 min, and 30% → 60% in 3 min. AVR4 eluted at ∼25% B. Integration of the HPLC profile was achieved using the supplied Waters software. Appropriate fractions (containing the AVR4 des-species) were lyophilized for storage. All solvents used were HPLC grade. Peptide Cleavage and Full Reduction of the Disulfide Bonds/Peptide Mass Analysis—Lyophilized HPLC fractions containing the AVR4 des-species were dissolved in two consecutive steps: first, 2 μl in 1 m NH4OH, 6 m guanidine-HCl, and second, 5 μl of 1 m NH4OH, and incubated at 20 °C for 1 h. The excess of NH4OH was evaporated in a Speed-Vac system in 30 min (to almost complete dryness). Subsequently, the remaining disulfide bonds were reduced by adding an excess of TCEP (10 μl of 0.1 m TCEP stock), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The peptide mixtures were analyzed by mass spectrometry using a MALDI-TOF MS (Perseptive Biosystems Voyager DE-RP). Small aliquots of the peptide samples were applied to a saturated matrix solution that was freshly prepared (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid; Sigma; 10 mg/ml in acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (50/50/1, v/v/v)); one μl was deposited on a sample plate (28Karas M.

The instrument was generally operated in the positive mode at an acceleration voltage of 23 kV combined with delayed extraction. Spectra were externally calibrated with bovine cytochrome c (12,230.9 Da), bovine insulin (5,734.6 Da) (both Sigma), and Microperoxidase 8 (MP8, 1,506.5 Da; Ref. 30Primus J.L. Boersma M.G. Mandon D.

Incubation of the AVR4 Des-species with Apoplastic Fluid—Apoplastic fluids (AFs) were isolated from intercellular spaces of near isogenic tomato genotypes Cf-4 and Cf-0 (31de Wit P.J.G.M. Spikman G. Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1982; 21: 1-11Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar) that had been inoculated with race 4 of C. fulvum (strain 38, a non-AVR4 producing strain) and race 5 (an AVR4-producing strain), respectively (14Joosten M.H.A.J. Vogelsang R. Cozijnsen T.J. Verberne M.C. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar). Native AVR4 and AVR4 des-species (4 μg) were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in the presence of 0.1 μl of AF (∼0.1 μg of total protein). Protease inhibitors used were from a standard protein inhibitor mixture with EDTA (Roche Applied Science; 1 tablet/ml AF). Protein samples were separated on Tricine SDS-PAGE gels (32Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar). Polysaccharide Substrate Binding Assay—Native AVR4 and AVR4 des-species (4 μg) were incubated at ambient temperature for 1 h (unless stated otherwise) with an excess of 5 mg of insoluble chitin beads (New England Biolabs) or chitosan (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 150 mm NaCl (500 μl of final volume) as described (19Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar). The insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (13.000 × g for 3 min). Supernatants were recovered and lyophilized. The pellet fraction was boiled in 200 μl of 1% SDS to release bound protein and centrifuged. The retrieved supernatant (containing bound AVR4) as well as the lyophilized supernatant fraction (containing unbound AVR4) were examined for protein content by Tricine SDS-PAGE. Molecular Modeling of AVR4 with the Tachycitin NMR Structure— The mean NMR structure of tachycitin (Protein Data Bank code 1DQC) was used as template structure to model the structure of AVR4 using Modeler 6.1 (33Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10447) Google Scholar, 34Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. Van Vlijmen H. Karplus M.

Additional loop refinement was used to model the two relatively large gaps (12 and 6 amino acids). The disulfide bridges were fixed during the calculations. One thousand models were constructed, of which the ten lowest scoring structures were further examined. The models were found reliable using standard algorithms (36Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 37Sanchez R. Sali A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13597-13602Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Four Cys Residues Are Required in AVR4 to Induce Cf-4-specific Defense Responses in Tomato—By using transient PVX-mediated expression some AVR4 alleles, i.e. C35Y, Y38H, and C80Y, were identified that exhibited reduced necrosis-inducing activity (NIA) in the tomato genotype Cf-4, whereas the other natural Avr4 alleles induced no NIA (14Joosten M.H.A.J. Vogelsang R. Cozijnsen T.J. Verberne M.C. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether other Cys residues, for which no mutations were found in strains of C. fulvum, are also required for NIA of AVR4, we independently replaced all individual Cys residues by Ala in PVX::Avr4. Four-week-old tomato plants were inoculated with these PVX::Avr4 derivatives, and NIA was scored (Fig. 1) as described (14Joosten M.H.A.J. Vogelsang R. Cozijnsen T.J. Verberne M.C. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar). The introduction of an Ala residue at the positions 35, 41, and 80 gave similar results as previously reported for the corresponding Tyr mutations (14Joosten M.H.A.J. Vogelsang R. Cozijnsen T.J. Verberne M.C. de Wit P.J.G.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mutations C21A and C27A were found to result in reduced NIA on Cf-4 tomato similar to the mutations C35A and C80A. The PVX::Avr4 constructs carrying a Cys to Ala mutation in either Cys-11, -41, -57, or -72 induced no NIA on Cf-4 tomato plants. These finding suggest that the latter four Cys residues have interrelated disulfide bonds in AVR4. For Cys-21, -27, -35, and -80, of which the single mutations showed reduced NIA, double Cys to Ala mutations were constructed. Four of the six double mutants no longer induced hypersensitive response on Cf-4 tomato, whereas mutants carrying the mutations C21A+C27A and C35A+C80A were as active as the corresponding single Cys to Ala mutants (Table I). These data suggest that disulfide bonds connect Cys-21 with Cys-27 and Cys-35 with Cys-80.Table INecrosis inducing activity (NIA) on tomato cv. moneymaker-Cf4 of mutant PVX::Avr4 NIA was scored as described (14Joosten M.H.A.J.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 39van den Hooven H.W. van den Burg H.A. Vossen P. Boeren S. de Wit P.J.G.M. Vervoort J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3458-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The formed cysteine thiol groups were directly modified by alkylation with CDAP under acidic conditions, and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 2). In the presence of 6 molar equivalents of TCEP/AVR4, ∼50% of native AVR4 was reduced, as indicated by an increased HPLC retention time of the newly formed species (Fig. 2). Subsequent MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identified four product peaks containing AVR4 species with one disulfide bond reduced (hereafter denoted as des-species) (Fig. 2C). The peaks eluting at 30.8 and 30.9 min could not be separated by one HPLC run, but after an additional run both species appeared more than 85% pure (Fig. 2B). The peaks containing the des-species together constituted ∼70% of the reduced AVR4 species, whereas peaks that eluted at higher acetonitrile concentrations contained AVR4 species with more than one disulfide bond reduced (as detected by mass spectrometry). The increased retention time reflects the more unfolded state of these species, as the results of increased hydrophobicity of the protein species. Assignment of the Disulfide Bonds with Mass Mapping—To determine which disulfide bond was reduced in each des-species, the HPLC fractions were lyophilized and redissolved in 1 m NH4OH, which induces base-catalyzed cleavage at the peptide bond that precedes the modified half-cystines (converting them to iminothiazolidine derivatives) (27Wu J. Watson J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After complete reduction, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 3). Theoretically, the reaction should yield five peptide fragments per des-species, i.e. three peptide fragments originating from the double chain cleavage reaction and two fragments originating from a β-elimination (26Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 40Degani Y. Patchornik A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The latter is a side reaction that occurs at either one of the two half-cystines, thereby preventing cleavage at this half-cystine. Assignment of the disulfide bonds was performed in a two-step approach. Mass peaks that correspond with peptide fragments from the N and C terminus up to the reduced half-cystines were first assigned. In Fig. 3A, the mass peaks m/z 2286.6 and 6673.9 Da correspond to the peptide fragments encompassing the residues 1–20 and 27–86; Cys-27 is converted to an iminothiazolidine derivative in the latter fragment (Table II). This assignment could subsequently be confirmed by other mass peaks that originate from β-eliminations, i.e. m/z 2882.3 and 7271.3 Da (the peptide fragment 1–26 with a β-elimination at Cys-21 and 21–86 with a β-elimination at Cys-27, respectively). The remaining fragment (iminothiazolidine 21–26) was too small to be detected because of the settings of the lower mass detection limit (1000 Da). Together, these data establish the disulfide bond Cys-21-27. The relative mass deviations between measured and calculated mass were less than 0.05% for the majority of the peptide fragments. Comparable analyses of the other reaction mixtures resulted in the assignment of the other disulfide bridges, i.e. Cys-11-41, Cys-57-72, and Cys-35-80 (Fig. 3, B, C, and D, respectively). The intensity of the reoccurring mass peaks at 3805.4 and 5031.8 Da in fraction 3 (Fig. 3C) would suggest more overlap between fractions 3 and 4 than shown in the HPLC elution profile in Fig. 2B. However, these two mass peaks were consistently readily observed in multiple independent replicate experiments, which suggests that these two peptides are easily ionized by MALDI. The intensity of the mass peaks, therefore, does not correspond to the actual concentration of the purified des-species. In conclusion, we established the connectivities of the disulfide bonds. Moreover, these are consistent with the PVX data (Tables I and III).Table IITheoretical mass per charge ([M + H]) of the peptide fragments obtained after base-catalyzed cleavage of the peptide bond as calculated for the AVR4 des-speciesdes-(11-41)des-(21-27)des-(35-80)des-(57-72)Fragmentm/zFragmentm/zFragmentm/zFragmentm/z1-101144.31-202285.61-343805.41-566160.2itz-(11-40)3415.9itz-(21-26)676.8itz-(35-79)5031.8itz-(57-71)1800.0itz-(11-86)5075.9itz-(27-86)6673.7itz-(80-86)798.9itz-(72-86)1675.9β-(1-40)4482.2β-(1-26)2884.4β-(1-79)8759.2β-(1-71)7882.2β-(11-86)8413.8β-(21-86)7272.4β-(35-86)5752.7β-(57-86)3397.9 Open table in a new tab Table IIISummary of the observed phenotypes per disrupted disulfide bond in AVR4Disrupted disulfide bondaDisruption of one disulfide bond by either a cysteine substitution in PVX::Avr4 or by partial reduction.Cys residue pairbSuccessive numbering of the Cys residues as in Fig. 5.Necrosis inducing activitycNecrosis inducing activity was assayed on tomato cv. moneymaker-Cf4 using PVX::Avr4 (Fig. 1).Stability in apoplastic fluiddAVR4 des-species is present (+) or absent (-) after incubation with apoplastic fluid (Fig. 4).Binding to chitineAffinity of AVR4 des-species for chitin; +, binds to chitin; +/- decreased affinity for chitin (Fig. 6).Stability of the AVR4 chitin complexfStability of AVR4 des-species when bound to chitin in the presence of AF; +, stable; +/-, partially stable in the presence of chitin (Fig. 7).Number of strains of racegNumber of strains of Cladosporium fulvum identified so far with a single Cys substitution (12,14).Native-++++++++Cys-21-272-3++++++0Cys-57-726-7--+/-+(+/-)0Cys-11-411-5--++(+/-)2Cys-35-804-8+++-++6a Disruption of one disulfide bond by either a c"

Koretzky G.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1639-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). One of those pathways involves receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent activation of PLCγ, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and generates the second messengers InsP3 and DAG. InsP3 binds to the InsP3R in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and initiates release of its stored Ca2+. The depletion of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum activates SOC channels in the plasma membrane. These channels contribute to long lasting elevations of the intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i necessary for antigen-dependent T-cell activation and central for the T-cell-dependent immune response. SOC channels are defined as cation or Ca2+ entry channels considered to open as a direct result of store depletion. They can be activated by passive store depletion independently of PLC-coupled receptor activation using endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump blockers like TG. The mechanisms linking store depletion to Ca2+ entry are not fully understood, and it has been proposed that multiple mechanisms for signaling store operated Ca2+ entry may exist, including a conformational coupling of SOC channels to molecules located in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as a diffusible factor released from the stores (2Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In T-cells, store-operated Ca2+ channels resemble Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels (CRAC) found in mast cells, (3Hoth M. Penner R.

CRAC channels are the prototype of highly Ca2+-selective SOC channels, and their importance in T-cells is underscored by the devastating consequences of their functional impairment in some patients with severe-combined immunodeficiencies (8Feske S. Giltnane J. Dolmetsch R. Staudt L.M. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 9Le Deist F. Hivroz C. Partiseti M. Thomas C. Buc H.A. Oleastro M.

SOC channels could be viewed as a subfamily of receptor-operated Ca2+/cation channels, which are activated in a PLC-dependent manner following receptor stimulation and which depend on store depletion. Different PLC-dependent Ca2+ entry pathways, including activation by second messengers like InsP3 or arachidonic acid (reviewed in Ref. 11Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) coexist in one cell and might influence each other (12Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20186-20189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In DT40 B lymphocytes, it was shown that cation entry involves not only store-operated channels but also a population of Ca2+ channels requiring functional InsP3Rs (14Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.S. Joseph S.K. Putney J.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because receptor-operated Ca2+ channels are localized in the plasma membrane and can be easily accessed, they would constitute an excellent pharmacological target for drugs modulating immune function. The problem, however, is that in many cell types, including T-cells, the molecular composition and identity of those channels is still unknown. One approach to identify the molecular nature of TCR-dependent Ca2+ channels in T-lymphocytes was to generate random Jurkat T-cell mutants and select those with specific defects in Ca2+ entry and Ca2+-dependent gene expression (15Fanger C.M. Hoth M. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Five of those independent mutants, CJ-1 to CJ-5, have been characterized in detail. To varying degrees, they all show a reduction of Ca2+ channel activity and, correspondingly, a reduction of Ca2+ influx as well as Ca2+-dependent gene expression, strongly suggesting that mutations of the TCR-dependent Ca2+ channels underlie the mutant phenotypes. The molecular defects, however, were never identified. Members of the family of mammalian TRP-related proteins (for nomenclature see Ref. 16Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J. Bruford E.A. Caterina M.J. Clapham D.E. Harteneck C. Heller S. Julius D. Kojima I. Mori Y. Penner R. Prawitt D. Scharenberg A.M. Schultz G. Shimizu N. Zhu M.X. Mol.

Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). TRPC3 is one of the best studied members of the mammalian TRP family, but the analysis of its functional properties relies mostly upon the characterization of heterologously expressed proteins. Most reports agree that TRPC3 can be activated in a PLC-dependent manner and forms non-selective cation channels when expressed in heterologous expression systems (18Montell, C. (2001) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/90/re1.Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence that, depending on the cell type used for overexpression, TRPC3 channels can be activated spontaneously, by InsP3, DAG, Ca2+, and G-proteins, and following store depletion. Transient expression of TRPC3 in DT40 B lymphocytes for example revealed both InsP3R-dependent and InsP3R-independent channel activity (19Vazquez G. Lievremont J.P. St J. Bird G. Putney Jr., J.W.

The different findings regarding TRPC3 might at least in part be reconciled by the fact that TRPC3 is able to build heterooligomers with other members of the TRPC subfamily (29Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) that are to various degrees expressed endogenously in many cell types. In this report, we describe the molecular and functional analysis of mutant T-cell lines with specific defects in Ca2+ entry and Ca2+-dependent gene expression (15Fanger C.M. Hoth M. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) focusing on potential defects of TRPC proteins. We found the TRPC3 gene to be damaged in five independent mutant cell lines when compared with wild type cells, whereas TRPC1, TRPC4, TRPC5, and TRPC6 were unaffected. The alteration of the TRPC3 genotype was accompanied by a highly increased expression of truncated TRPC3 transcripts. These findings led to the hypothesis that reduced Ca2+ channel activity could be explained by defects in the TRPC3 gene. This was tested by transient transfection of the human wild type TRPC3 in two of the mutant cell lines. TRPC3 was able to restore TCR-activated Ca2+ channel activity and the resulting Ca2+ signals. We conclude that TRPC3 is part of endogenous Ca2+ channels in human T-lymphocytes and contributes to TCR-dependent Ca2+ entry in human T-lymphocytes. Cell Culture and Reagents—Jurkat T-cell lines were grown in culture medium consisting of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin as described previously (15Fanger C.M. Hoth M. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Reagents include thapsigargin (TG, 1 mm stock in Me2SO, Molecular Probes), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3, 20 mm stock in H2O, Calbiochem), and phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 10 mg/ml stock in H2O, Sigma). OKT3 was a generous gift from Andreas Stallmach (Homburg). All other chemicals were from Sigma (highest grade). Southern Blot Analysis—Genomic DNA was prepared according to standard protocols (30Sambrock J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 20 μg of DNA from Jurkat parental cells and the mutants CJ-1, CJ-2, CJ-3, CJ-4, and CJ-5 were each digested with EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII, BglI, or XbaI. Half of the material was loaded onto one lane of each of two 0.7% agarose gels, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membranes by capillary transfer to obtain blots 1 and 2 (Fig. 1). The probes were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol). Hybridizations were performed at 68 °Cin0.9 m NaCl, 90 mm sodium citrate, 0,1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Ficoll Type 400, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.5% SDS overnight and washed under stringent conditions (68 °C, 15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS). In a first round of hybridization we used the coding cDNA of human TRPC3 (accession number U47050) as a probe for blot 1 and the complete cDNA of human TRPC4 (accession number AF175406) for blot 2. The filters were stripped, and blot 1 was sequentially hybridized to nucleotides 2069–4773 of human INADL (accession number AJ 224747) and to the coding cDNA of human TRPC6 (accession number AJ271066). Blot 2 was hybridized to the coding cDNAs of human TRPC1 (accession number NM003304) and mouse TRPC5 (accession number AJ006204). Results were confirmed in an independent second experiment. Filters were exposed for 3–10 days to x-ray films using intensifying screens at –80 °C. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blots were performed as described previously (31Philipp S. Cavalie A. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Zimmer S. Trost C. Marquart A. Murakami M. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) using 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from Jurkat T-cells, rabbit brain and lung, human salivary gland adenocarcinoma cells HSG (kindly provided by Dr. Mitsunobu Sato, Tokushima University school of Dentistry, Japan), human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells (ATCC HTB-36), and human placenta. For detection of TRPC transcripts the same probes as for Southern blot analysis were used. TRPV6 mRNA was detected as described (32Wissenbach U. Niemeyer B.A. Fixemer T. Schneidewind A. Trost C. Cavalie A. Reus K. Meese E. Bonkhoff H. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19461-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The filters were exposed to x-ray films with intensifying screens at –80 °C. One filter was used for the analysis of TRPC3 and TRPC1 expression, and another filter was used for the analysis of TRPC5, TRPC4, and TRPC6 (in that order). For that purpose, filters were stripped, exposed to x-ray films to control residual signals, and hybridized with the next probe and, finally, with a 239-bp cDNA fragment of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Analysis of TRPC3 transcripts in the T-cell mutants was performed in two independent experiments with identical results. Generation and Purification of TRPC3 Antibodies—To generate polyclonal anti-TRPC3 antibodies, we expressed a fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal 213 amino acids of TRPC3 (accession number U47050) fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP) using the pMAL system (New England BioLabs) similar as described (33Li H.S. Xu X.Z. Montell C. Neuron. 1999; 24: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The MBP-TRPC3 fusion proteins were bound on amylose resin columns and eluted as described by the manufacturer before they were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, electroeluted (Bio-Rad), lyophilized, and used to immunize rabbits. Serum obtained before and after immunization was tested for its reactivity against TRPC3 fusion proteins. To purify the anti-TRPC3 antibodies, MBP and MBP-TRPC3 fusion proteins were linked to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated-Sepharose resin columns (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies directed against MBP alone were removed from the serum by chromatography on MBP-Sepharose. TRPC3 antibodies (AT3) were then enriched on MBP-TRPC3-Sepharose and checked for their reactivity against MBP-TRPC3 and MBP on Western blots. Specificity of the antibodies was determined as described under “Results.” Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitations, 107 Jurkat cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4), suspended in 1.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0,5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% (octylphenoxy)polyethoxyethanol (Igepal CA-630), 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm soybean protease inhibitor). The suspension was homogenized at 4 °C for 2 min using a Polytron homogenizer and by subsequent pressing through a 26-gauge cannula. After centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Nonspecific bindings were removed by a preincubation with 100 μl of protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h followed by centrifugation for 20 s at 12,000 × g. 100 μl of the supernatant was kept to quantify the protein concentration using the BCA determination method. 1 ml of the supernatant was then incubated with 10 μg of AT3 or the polyclonal anti-TRPC4 antibody AT4 overnight at 4 °C (AK236 (34Philipp S. Trost C. Warnat J. Rautmann J. Himmerkus N. Schroth G. Kretz O. Nastainczyk W. Cavalie A. Hoth M. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23965-23972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)). Immunocomplexes were precipitated by incubation with 100 μl of protein-A-Sepharose for 1 h, centrifuged, and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer buffer. Complexes bound to protein-A-Sepharose were eluted by incubation in 100 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged briefly at 12,000 × g. 5–15 μl of each sample, corresponding to the same amount of protein before precipitation, were subjected to SDS-PAGE. In vitro translation of bovine TRPC4 was performed using the TnT® system (Promega). Immunoblots and preparations of lysates from HEK 293 cells and HEK 293 cells stably expressing human TRPC3 (accession number U47050, clone T3-9 (35Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar)) or the short variant of human TRPC4 (accession number AF063823) were performed as described previously (34Philipp S. Trost C. Warnat J. Rautmann J. Himmerkus N. Schroth G. Kretz O. Nastainczyk W. Cavalie A. Hoth M. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23965-23972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and the Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The blot shown in Fig. 2B (upper panel) was reprobed with antibody AT4 (4 μg/ml, Fig. 2B, lower panel). For that purpose, the filter was stripped by 30-min incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C and checked for remaining signals before application of AT4 and the secondary antibody. Electroporation—Jurkat T-lymphocytes were always prepared to have a density of 0.5–0.8 × 106/ml on the day of transfection, which we found to be optimal to obtain high transfection rates. 1.2 × 107 cells were transfected in 300 μl of culture medium by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II (0.23 kV, 925 microfarads, 4-mm cuvette) and were analyzed after 36–48 h. The cDNA encoding the protein of interest (X) was cloned in the pCAGGS vector (36Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4616) Google Scholar), and 6 μg was used for co-transfection with 2 μg of EGFP-pCAGGS to allow identification of transfected cells by their green fluorescence. In addition, we used 6 μg of X-IRES-EGFP constructs for transfection allowing a dicistronic expression of X and EGFP from the same transcript. Whereas the number of green cells after transfection of IRES constructs was below 5% we obtained between 30 and 50% green cells in co-transfection experiments. The efficiency of co-transfection was tested by electroporation of 2 μg of EGFP-pCAGGS and 6 μg of EBFP-pCAGGS encoding the green and the blue fluorescent proteins, respectively. Analyzing more than a hundred green cells we found only one without blue fluorescence, indicating that under the chosen experimental conditions the rate of co-transfection is near 100%. For most of the patch-clamp experiments, we used the IRES constructs, because only a few transfected cells were needed, whereas for Ca2+ imaging we routinely used the co-transfection protocol to get a sufficient number of transfected cells. Imaging experiments were also repeated with the IRES constructs giving similar results. Electrophysiology—The standard pipette solution for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings contained (in mm): 0.05 InsP3, 140 cesium aspartate, 10 NaCl, 3 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.2 with CsOH). The bath solution contained (in mm): 155 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 22 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 d-glucose, and 5 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Patch-clamp experiments were performed at 22–25 °C in the tight-seal whole-cell configuration using fire-polished patch pipettes (2–5 MΩ uncompensated series resistance). Pipette and cell capacitance were electronically cancelled before each voltage ramp with an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier controlled by Pulse 8.3 software (Heka Elektronik). Membrane currents were filtered at 1.5–2.3 kHz and digitized at a sampling rate of 5–10 kHz. Whole-cell currents were elicited by 160-ms voltage-clamp ramps from –100 to +60 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV. To measure leak currents before activation of store-operated currents, 20 voltage ramps were applied within the first 5 s after establishment of the whole-cell configuration, followed by voltage ramps applied every second. All voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential of –12 mV between internal solutions and the bath solution. Transfected green cells were identified by their EGFP fluorescence. Fluorescence Measurements—Cells were loaded at room temperature (22–23 °C) for 20 min with 1 μm fura-2/AM in culture medium with 10 mm HEPES added (to buffer pH), washed with fresh medium, and stored in the dark at room temperature until use. Loaded cells were allowed to adhere to poly-l-ornithine-coated glass coverslip chambers on the stage of an Olympus IX 70 microscope equipped with a ×20 UApo 340 (numerical aperture (N.A.) 0.75) or a ×40 Uplan/Apo (N.A. 1.0) objective. Cells were alternately illuminated at 340 and 380 nm with the Polychrome IV Monochromator (TILL Photonics). The fluorescence emissions at λ > 440 nm were captured with a charge-coupled device camera (TILL Imago), digitized, and analyzed using TILL Vision software. Ratio images were recorded at intervals of 5 s. [Ca2+]i was estimated from the relation, [Ca2+]i = K*(R – R min)/(R max – R), where the values of K*, R min, and R max were determined from an in situ calibration of fura-2 in Jurkat T-cells as described previously (37Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Ringer's solution contained (in mm): 155 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 0–2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 d-glucose, and 5 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH). CaCl2 was replaced by MgCl2 in the 0-Ca2+ Ringer's solution with 1 mm EGTA added. A sandwiched self-made chamber was used for all measurements, which allowed for a complete solution exchange of <1 s. All experiments were conducted at 22–23 °C. EGFP-transfected cells were identified using 480-nm excitation (excitation filter: HQ 470/40, dichroic mirror Q 495 LP, emission filter HQ 525/50; all from AHF Analysentechnik, Germany). To determine an objective criteria to identify a green (= EGFP-expressing) cell, we used the following approach: Cells only transfected with vector or a construct not coding for EGFP were analyzed first resulting in the mean ± S.D. arbitrary fluorescence of non-green cells following 480-nm excitation. Cells were considered to be EGFP-positive if the arbitrary fluorescence was higher than the mean of non-transfected cells plus three times the standard deviation. Cells of the same experiment were considered EGFP-negative (and called control cells) if the arbitrary fluorescence was within the standard deviation of the mean of non-EGFP-transfected cells. Cells with an intermediate fluorescence (between one and three times the standard deviation) were disregarded for the analysis. T-cells with Defects in Store-operated Calcium Entry Are Mutated in the TRPC3 Gene—To facilitate the molecular identification of Ca2+ channels in T-lymphocytes, Fanger et al. (15Fanger C.M. Hoth M. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) generated random T-cell mutants with defects in TCR-dependent Ca2+ signaling pathways. The mutant lines were characterized in detail and were found to have reduced Ca2+ channel activity and reduced Ca2+-dependent gene expression. The molecular defects generating this phenotype, however, have not been elucidated. Proteins of the mammalian TRPC channel family are presently the best candidates to form receptor- and store-operated Ca2+ channels. We therefore systematically compared the genotypes of TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5, and TRPC6 in five mutant T-cell lines CJ-1 through CJ-5 and wild type parental cells by Southern blot. Hydrolysis of genomic DNA with several restriction endonucleases and hybridization with the cDNA of TRPC4 and hINADL (Fig. 1A) and with TRPC1, TRPC5, and TRPC6 (data not shown) showed an identical pattern of genomic fragments indicating that these genes are not affected by the mutagenesis procedure. Using the TRPC3 cDNA as probe for hybridization, we found the same band pattern for genomic DNA in Jurkat parental cells and in peripheral blood lymphocytes from two control persons (Fig. 1B , left panel) apart from fragments at ∼5.5 kb specific for Jurkat parental cells. These fragments might arise from genomic imbalances in the lymphoblastic cell line (38Gebhart E. Thoma K. Verdorfer I. Drexler H.G. Efferth T. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 21: 887-894PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we found divergent signals in every mutant line when compared with parental cells with each of the restriction enzymes used for hydrolysis of the DNA (Fig. 1B , right panel) indicating defects of the TRPC3 gene. Every mutant was affected and no mutant was found to have the same TRPC3 genotype as one would expect after generation of mutants by random mutagenesis and selection for a specific phenotype. These results link the phenotype of reduced Ca2+ entry in the mutant T-cells to the TRPC3 gene and suggest that the TRPC3 protein is part of TCR-dependent Ca2+ channels in T-lymphocytes. Expression Pattern of TRPC Channels in Jurkat T-lymphocytes—To investigate which TRPC genes are expressed in Jurkat T-lymphocytes, we performed Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2A) and found TRPC3 transcripts of ∼4.0 kb corresponding in size to transcripts present in human brain (35Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) likely to encode the functional TRPC3 channel protein. Shorter transcripts of ∼3.6 and ∼1.2 kb were also detected, which might arise from alternative splicing. In addition, we found weak expression of TRPC1, and possibly TRPC4 transcripts, whereas TRPC5 and TRPC6 mRNA could not be detected. Recently, TRPV6 (CaT1, CaT-L) has been described to contribute to store-operated calcium current in Jurkat T-cells (39Cui J. Bian J.S. Kagan A. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47175-47183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We could not detect the TRPV6 transcripts of the expected size of 3.0 kb in Jurkat T-cells, whereas 3.0-kb TRPV6 transcripts are readily detected in human placenta and the human JEG-3 cells (Fig. 2A , right panel) as well as in pancreas and prostate carcinoma (32Wissenbach U. Niemeyer B.A. Fixemer T. Schneidewind A. Trost C. Cavalie A. Reus K. Meese E. Bonkhoff H. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19461-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We also looked for the presence of TRPC channel proteins by Western blot (Fig. 2B). The polyclonal antibodies AT3 and AT4 raised against the N terminus of TRPC3 and the C-terminal peptide of TRPC4 (34Philipp S. Trost C. Warnat J. Rautmann J. Himmerkus N"
https://openalex.org/W2090457486,"We report that the product of the inducible gene encoding the kinase known as IKKi/IKKϵ (IKKi) is required for expression of a group of genes up-regulated by pro-inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). Here, using murine embryonic fibroblasts obtained from mice bearing deletions in IKK2, p65, and IKKi genes, we provide evidence to support a link between signaling through the NF-κB and CCAAA/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) pathways. This link includes an NF-κB-dependent regulation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ gene transcription and IKKi-mediated activation of C/EBP. Disruption of the NF-κB pathway results in the blockade of the inducible up-regulation of C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and IKKi genes. Cells lacking IKKi are normal in activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway but fail to induce C/EBPδ activity and transcription of C/EBP and C/EBP-NF-κB target genes in response to LPS. In addition we show that, in response to LPS or tumor necrosis factor α, both β and δ subunits of C/EBP interact with IKKi promoter, suggesting a feedback mechanism in the regulation of IKKi-dependent cellular processes.

Prototypic activators of innate immunity such as bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) are known to regulate both the NF-κB and the C/EBP pathways (4Silverman N. Maniatis T.

The C/EBP family is comprised of at least six proteins containing basic leucine zipper (bZIP) motifs (6Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 7McKnight S.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 259-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The NF-κB family is made up of fewer members including p50, p52, p65/RelA, c-Rel, and RelB (8Ghosh S. May M.J. Kropp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). These transcription factors regulate expression of distinct and overlapping subsets of genes encoding immune and pro-inflammatory modulators (3Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 9Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). Whether or not NF-κB and C/EBP family members influence each other is not well understood at this time. Current paradigms suggest that the rapidly and transiently activated NF-κB pathway is central in a primary wave of gene induction followed by a second wave of gene transcription some hours later mediated by other transcription factors including members of the C/EBP family (3Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 5Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite participating in regulation of overlapping sets of genes, the NF-κB and the C/EBP pathways are activated by distinct intracellular signaling mechanisms. Activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway depends on stability of the inhibitor known as IκBα. It stabilizes NF-κB complexes so that after its degradation the remaining subunits translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. NF-κB-dependent transcription of IκBα gene also provides a potent feedback mechanism maintaining the balance between cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of the NF-κB subunits (8Ghosh S. May M.J. Kropp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with specific inducers, such as TNF, IL-1, or LPS, results in the phosphorylation of IκBα at two serines (Ser-32 and Ser-36). This is a signal for its rapid ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and translocation of free NF-κB to the nucleus. IκBα phosphorylation is catalyzed by the IκB kinase (IKK), a complex composed of three subunits, IKKα/IKK1, IKKβ/IKK2, and NEMO/IKKγ/IKKAP1/FIP3. IKK1 and IKK2 are the catalytic subunits, whereas NEMO serves a non-enzymatic, regulatory function. Biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrate that IKK2 is essential for NF-κB activation in response to TNF, IL-1, and LPS, whereas IKK1 is not required for such responses (10Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of p65 or IKK2 gene affects TNF-induced transcription of the IκBα gene (11Beg A.A. Sha W.C.

Regulatory mechanisms for the C/EBP pathways differ markedly from those of NF-κB and include transcriptional and/or post-translational mechanisms as well as protein-protein interactions via dimerization through leucine-zipper domains (6Lekstrom-Himes J.

Some members of this family, specifically C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, have been linked to gene expression in the acute phase response and during inflammation (24Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O.

Furthermore, up-regulation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ gene expression occurs after exposure to pro-inflammatory stimuli such as TNF, IL-1, IL-6, or LPS (3Poli V. J. Biol.

Here we have performed experiments to identify possible regulatory links between the NF-κB and C/EBP pathways, with an emphasis on events related to innate immune responses. We have used murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) obtained from various strains of mice bearing targeted gene deletions in components of the NF-κB pathway. We show that fibroblasts isolated from p65–/– or IKK2–/–, but not from control, mice fail to induce C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ transcripts in response to cell stimulation with LPS. Furthermore, we observed that both p65 and IKK2 are required for induction of IKKi mRNA. In turn, in primary fibroblasts lacking the IKKi gene LPS induces C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ mRNAs and activates NF-κB, as observed in control cells, but importantly, fail to induce C/EBPδ-specific DNA binding activity. Furthermore, we report that LPS treatment of IKKi–/– MEFs reveals deficits in expressions of genes associated with immune and pro-inflammatory responses. In totality, these data support the contention that there is a link between the NF-κB and C/EBP pathways and that IKKi may be a key element in integration of signals from both pathways during inflammatory and immune responses.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed as described (31Ivanov V.N. Bhoumik A. Krasilnikov M. Raz R. Owen-Schaub L.B. Levy D. Horvath C.M. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 517-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The antibodies specific for C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, or p65 were used for the ChIP assay. The levels of IKKi or IκBα promoter DNA were determined by PCR using oligonucleotides from the 5′-untranslated region of IKKi gene (5′-TCTGTAAAGCAATGAGCAAG-3′; 5′-AGGAAGCTGACACAGTGTGG-3′) or IκBα gene (5′-AGGGAAAGAAGGGTTCTTGC-3′; 5′-CTGACTGTTGTGGGCTCG-3′). Metabolic Labeling—106 cells were plated per 60-mm dish. On the second day, the cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% of dialyzed fetal bovine serum and then incubated in the same medium containing 400 mCi/ml [32P]H3PO4 for 4 h. The last 2 h some cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml LPS. The cells were then washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and used for preparation of nuclear extract according to EMSA protocol (see above). The nuclear extracts were diluted by the addition of 10 volumes of standard radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and C/EBPδ or p65 proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies as indicated in Fig. 5C. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. We first sought an experimental system to investigate relationships between the C/EBP and NF-κB pathways. The promoter region of C3 gene contains C/EBP sites (32Wilson D.R. Juan T.S. Wilde M.D. Fey G.H. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6181-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); it is known that C3 expression is regulated by C/EBPδ (26Juan T.S.-C. Wilson D.R. Wilde M.D. Darlington G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2584-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that there are no identifiable NF-κB sites in the C3 promoter, transcription of the C3 gene is induced by NF-κB activators including LPS (9Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar, 33Rus H.G. Kim L.M. Niculesen F.I. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 928-933PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that measurements of LPS induction of C3 mRNA would be an appropriate marker for initial studies to investigate possible relationships between the NF-κB and C/EBP pathways. Here we have used MEFs from mice bearing targeted deletions of genes encoding IKK2, p65, and IKKi. We first examined induction of C3 mRNA in LPS-treated MEFs derived from IKK2–/– and control (IKK2+/+) embryos; the induction of C3 mRNA was observed in control cells but not in the IKK2-deficient cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, LPS-mediated induction of c-jun mRNA was nearly identical in both types of MEFs. Moreover, as shown here and as previously noted, IKK2–/– MEFs showed LPS-induced IκBα mRNA and NF-κB DNA binding activity that was partially reduced when IKK2–/– and IKK2+/+ cells were compared (Ref. 12Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar; Fig. 1, A and B). Similar findings were noted in experiments with spontaneously imMEFs derived from IKK2–/– and control cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, the absence of IKK2 revealed a deficiency in LPS-induced C3 induction that is not likely to result from loss of LPS responsiveness. To further probe the role of the NF-κB pathway we also examined the effects of p65 deficiency on LPS induction of C3 and IκBα mRNA. LPS-mediated induction of both IκBα and C3 mRNAs was completely abolished in p65–/– imMEFs (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that regulation of C3 gene expression requires an intact NF-κB pathway. However, we hypothesize that the role of NF-κB involves indirect mechanisms and requires additional gene expression under the control of NF-κB. In fact it has been shown that protein synthesis is required for LPS-induced expression of C3 mRNA (34Cardinaux J.-R. Allaman I. Magistretti P.J. Glia. 2000; 29: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The observation that LPS induces IKKi mRNA (13Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) prompted us to evaluate the effects of IKKi deletion on C3 gene expression. Thus, we next measured LPS-induced C3, IκBα, and IKKi mRNA in IKKi–/– and control MEFs as well as in IKK2–/– cells (Fig. 2A). As shown above, LPS-mediated induction of IκBα mRNA was reduced in cells lacking IKK2, whereas IKKi deficiency had no effect on LPS-induced expression of IκBα mRNA. In contrast, the induction of C3 mRNA was abolished in the IKKi–/– cells as well as in the IKK2–/– cells. Furthermore, we failed to observe induction of IKKi mRNA in the IKK2–/– cells. Nearly identical results were also obtained in similar experiments with LPS-stimulated IKKi–/– and IKKi+/+ imMEFs derived from the corresponding primary isolates of MEFs (Fig. 2B). As an additional specificity control, we also examined the LPS responses in MEFs derived from Egr-1-deficient embryos (28Yan S.F. Fujita T. Lu J. Okada K. Shan Zou Y. Mackman N. Pinsky D.J. Stern D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The LPS-mediated induction of C3 or IKKi mRNA was practically identical in Egr1–/– and Egr1+/+ cells (Fig. 2C), emphasizing the specificity of the effects observed here with IKK2–/–, p65–/–, and IKKi–/– MEFs. Thus, IKKi appears to be a key molecule for transcriptional induction of C3 gene in response to LPS, and its expression requires an intact NF-κB pathway. To further define how IKKi participates in gene regulation we performed the following experiments. Extracts from IKK2–/–, IKK2+/+, IKKi–/– (as negative control), or IKKi+/+ (as positive control) were immunoprecipitated to enrich the samples for IKKi, and the resultant immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed and then subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). As was expected, expression of IKKi protein was not detected in IKKi–/– cells. In contrast, IKKi+/+ or IKK2+/+ cells showed detectable IKKi protein expression that was increased after LPS addition. Compared with IKK2+/+ or IKKi+/+ cells, the basal level of IKKi protein was significantly reduced in IKK2-deficient cells. Importantly, LPS addition failed to up-regulate IKKi expression in this cell type. These data together with Northern blot studies support the contention that IKK2 is required for the inducible expression of IKKi mRNA and protein. These data prompted us to address the question of how IKKi regulates LPS-induced C3 gene expression. Specifically. we asked whether the failure to induce C3 results from the absence of IKKi protein or whether essential signaling including expression and/or activation of IKK2 is also affected by IKKi deficiency. To address these issues, we used Western blot analysis to compare the levels of IKK2 protein in extracts from IKKi–/–, IKKi+/+, IKK2–/– (as negative control), or IKK2+/+ (as positive control) cells. The results showed that IKKi–/–, IKKi+/+, and IKK2+/+ cells express nearly identical levels of IKK2 protein (Fig. 3B). Expression of IKK1 and NEMO subunits of the IKK complex was also unchanged in IKKi–/– cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, the absence of IKKi does not reduce the protein expression of other key members of the IKK complex. Furthermore, it is unlikely that IKKi is required for activation of IKK complex because LPS treatment up-regulated the kinase activity of the IKK similarly in IKKi–/– and IKKi+/+ cells (Fig. 3C). Thus, the absence of IKKi does not alter signaling that is directly related to NF-κB activation. The same extracts were subjected in parallel to an immunoprecipitation/kinase assay for IKKi. In addition LPS treatment did not alter the kinase activity of IKKi (Fig. 3C), in keeping with observations of others that pro-inflammatory mediators do not alter IKKi kinase activity but, rather, up-regulate its expression (13Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). To investigate whether IKKi deficiency alters the rate and extent of LPS-induced expression of a variety of genes associated with innate immune and inflammatory responses we measured LPS-induced expression of TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IP-10, RANTES, and COX-2 mRNA. LPS treatment increased mRNA expression for each of these genes in IKKi+/+ cells (Fig. 4A); we also showed that TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 protein levels also increased (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast IKKi deficiency resulted in a marked reduction of LPS-induced mRNA expression for each of this group of genes (Fig. 4A). Parallel decreases in protein expression for TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 were also noted (Figs. 4, B and C). The fact that both cell lines (IKKi–/– and IKKi"

Overexpression of SINK inhibited NF-κB-dependent transcription induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulation or its downstream signaling proteins but did not inhibit NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and binding to DNA. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays indicated that SINK specifically interacted with the NF-κB transactivator p65 and inhibited p65 phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, which has previously been shown to regulate NF-κB activation. Consistent with its role in inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription, SINK also sensitized cells to apoptosis induced by TNF and TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand). Taken together, these data suggest that SINK is critically involved in a novel negative feedback control pathway of NF-κB-induced gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2128141922,"Endogenous cardiotonic steroids (ECS) are putative ligands of the inhibitory binding site of the membrane sodium pump (Na+, K+-ATPase). There is growing evidence that cardiotonic steroids may promote the growth of cardiac and vascular myocytes, including evidence indicating growth stimulation at concentrations in the same range as circulating ECS concentrations. We investigated four parameters to determine whether ouabain, a proposed ECS, promotes growth of immortalized rat proximal tubule epithelial cells: cell count by hemocytometer; metabolic activity as reflected in the mitochondrial conversion of the tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, to its formazan product (MA); DNA synthesis reflected as bromodeoxyuridine incorporation (DNA); and mitosis reflected as histone phosphorylation state detected using anti-phosphohistone 3 antibody (HP). Maximum stimulatory responses were observed at 1 nm ouabain (MA, 20.3% increase, p < 0.01; DNA, 28.4% increase, p < 0.001; HP, maximum response at 0.5 h, 50% increase, p < 0.001). We observed that growth stimulation was associated with stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (ERK-P), and both growth and ERK-P could be blocked by the MEK inhibitor (U0126, 100 nm). Western blot analysis revealed that the only α isoform of Na+, K+-ATPase that could be detected in these cultures was the highly ouabain-resistant α1 isoform. Measurement of ouabain inhibition of ion transport in these cultures using 86Rb+ uptake revealed the predominance of the expected ouabain-resistant isoform (IC50 = 24 μm) and an additional minor (∼15%) ouabain-sensitive inhibition with IC50 ∼30 pm. Similar bimodal transport inhibition curves were obtained in freshly dissected rat proximal tubules. These results indicate that renal epithelial cells may be a sensitive target of the ERK1/2-activating and growth-promoting effects of ouabain even in the presence of ouabain-resistant Na+, K+-ATPase.

At present, two CS, ouabain and marinobufagenin, appear to best fulfill criteria for endogenous mammalian adrenocortical cardiotonic steroids (ECS) (1Schoner W. Cell. Mol. Biol.

Plant-derived CS-glycosides are widely used therapeutically to increase myocardial performance by inhibition of active transmembrane cation transport that results from binding to the membrane-inserted sodium, potassium-ATPase (Na+, K+-ATPase) (4Schoner W.

Recently, evidence has been generated indicating that, in addition to an ion transport inhibitory role, CS also activate a signaling function that influences growth and proliferation of cardiac and vascular myocytes (9Kometiani P.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46605-46611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although the growth-promoting effect of CS appears to depend on initiation of signaling complexes that result from binding of CS to Na+, K+-ATPase, stimulation of growth has been shown to be independent of inhibition of cation transport (11Xie Z. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 2001; 47: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar, 12Xie Z. Askari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that the usual physiological function of ECS lies not only in an ion transport inhibitory role but in influencing growth and proliferation of target cells. The kidney has long been considered a likely target of ECS (13Blaustein M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 232: C165-C173Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 14Blaustein M.P. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1748-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the effect of CS on renal epithelial cell growth and proliferation has not been examined. Modulation of growth and hypertrophy is an important element of renal development and the renal response to altered environment in both young and adult animals (15Feld S. Hirschberg R. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 423-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 16Flyvbjerg A. Bennett W.F. Rasch R. van Neck J.W. Groffen C.A. Kopchick J.J. Scarlett J.A. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 2048-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Parts of the kidney are also prone to injury from metabolic or osmotic stresses (17Sheridan A.M. Bonventre J.V. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 18di Mari J.F. Davis R. Safirstein R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F195-F203PubMed Google Scholar), and compensatory growth of adjacent uninjured tissue may be a normal element in adaptation to such renal injury. Thus, the existence of signaling mechanisms to drive renal growth globally or in response to local injury places importance on a full understanding of the regulation of renal growth and hypertrophy. Endogenous cardiotonic steroids may contribute to this adaptation. In the present study, we have investigated the ability of ouabain to influence growth of cultured renal epithelial cells that express only an α1 isoform of Na+, K+-ATPase that is highly resistant to inhibition by ouabain and other CS (K i ∼ 1.4 × 10–4m) (19Fallows D.

The doses of ouabain we have investigated for their growth-promoting effects correspond to normal plasma ouabain levels (22Manunta P. Rogowski A.C. Hamilton B.P. Hamyln J.M. J. Hypertens. 1994; 12: 549-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yuan C.M. Manunta P. Hamlyn J.M. Chen S. Bohen E. Yeun J. Haddy F.J. Pamnani M.B. Hypertension. 1993; 22: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Here we report that nanomolar concentrations of ouabain are able to stimulate mitosis and proliferative cell growth of rat renal epithelial by an ERK kinase-dependent signaling pathway. This work suggests that endogenous CS may have an important biological function even in rodent species previously considered resistant to these steroids. Rat renal proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells (PCT) were originally obtained from Dr. Ulrich Hopfer, Case Western Reserve Medical School, and we have maintained them for the past 5 years. The epithelial phenotype of the cell line is well documented, and the cells demonstrate numerous morphological and functional characteristics of differentiated PCT cells (24Hopfer U. Jacobberger J.W. Gruenert D.C. Eckert R.L. Jat P.S. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1-C11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Woost P.G. Orosz D.E. Jin W. Frisa P.S. Jacobberger J.W. Douglas J.G. Hopfer U. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 125-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (1:1) supplemented with 15 mm HEPES, 1.2 ng/ml NaHCO3, 4 mg/ml dexamethasone, 5 mg/ml transferrin, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate/100 international units of penicillin G. Our preliminary experiments showed that ouabain-induced growth effects were more pronounced in cultures at relatively low density that had a high number of proliferating cells (limited contact inhibition of growth). Based on these observations, growth stimulation experiments were performed using cell cultures that had reached 45–50% confluence at the beginning of the experiment. Proximal tubule (PT) fragments were isolated from 8-week-old male rats (WKY strain bred in our own colony) using the method described by Seri et al. (26Seri I. Kone B.C. Gullans S.R. Aperia A. Brenner B.M. Ballermann B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F52-F60PubMed Google Scholar). After induction of isoflurane anesthesia, the kidneys were removed and rapidly cooled in ice-cold saline, and the cortex was dissected and minced on ice to a paste-like consistency. This minced cortex was incubated with Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.075 g/100 ml Type I collagenase, 500 μm pyruvic acid, 1 mmol/liter lactic acid, and 1 mmol/liter sodium butyrate, pH 7.4. After of 45 min of incubation at 37 °C with continuous bubbling with 95% O2, 5% CO2, tissue fragments were placed on ice and then poured sequentially through sieves of 100-, 70-, and 40-μm pore size to obtain a PT-enriched suspension. The PTs were washed three times by centrifugation at 600 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman CS-6KR centrifuge. After the final centrifugation, PT were resuspended in culture medium and placed into an incubator for adaptation prior to ouabain-sensitive ion transport activity assay. Cell Proliferation—To determine the effects of ouabain on cell number, plates simultaneously seeded with cells were distributed into groups from which cells were counted by hemocytometer either before or after 8 or 24 h of ouabain treatment. Untreated cultures (medium without ouabain) were used as controls. Cells were detached from culture plate wells with mild trypsinization and gently shaken to disperse them. They were then diluted in culture medium for counting by hemocytometer using an inverted phase contrast microscope. To provide a measurement of cell growth reflecting the increasing metabolic activity occurring as cells grow we used the CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (catalog number G3580), as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). Briefly, cells were cultured in a 96-well plate (100 μl of culture medium/well) for 24 h and then exposed for 8 h to different concentrations of ouabain or to medium alone in control cultures. The growth of cells as reflected by metabolism of the tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, was determined using the CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution reagent. Titer reagent (20 μl) was added directly to culture wells and incubated for 3 h, and then absorbance at 490 nm was measured with a 96-well plate reader to quantify the amount of formazan product, which reflects the number of cells in culture (27Marshall N.J. Goodwin C.J. Holt S.J. Growth Regul. 1995; 5: 69-84PubMed Google Scholar). Data were normalized to a signal obtained for control, untreated cultures. BrdUrd Uptake for Assessment of DNA Synthesis—The Oncogene Research Products BrdUrd proliferation assay was used according to the accompanying manufacturer's directions. Briefly, cells were cultured in a 96-well plate for 24 h and then exposed for 8 h to different concentrations of ouabain or to medium alone in control cultures. At the same time, BrdUrd was added to each well. The quantitation of BrdUrd incorporation into newly synthesized DNA of proliferating cells was estimated immunologically using specific monoclonal anti-BrdUrd and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Analysis of Mitosis by Immunostaining with Antiphospho-Histone H3 Antibody—Cells were cultured in 8-well Lab-Tech chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) for 24 h and then incubated with vehicle or with 1 nm ouabain for 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 5 h. After fixation in 100% methanol at –20 °C for 45 min, the cells were washed three times for 5 min each with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline followed by 1 h incubation with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Triton-X100). Then they were incubated for 1 h with antibody to Ser-10-phospho-histone H3 (28Wei Y. Mizzen C.A. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7480-7484Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), a marker of mitotis (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), washed with 0.1% Triton-X100 in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody (Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Molecular Probes A-11037), stained with DAPI, and mounted with 150 μl of Antifade™ (Molecular Probes, S-7461). The slides were analyzed and imaged under fluorescence microscopy. Data are represented as the percentage of total cells per unit area positive for red staining. Each treatment was done in four chambers, and a minimum of 500 cells/chamber was counted. PCTs were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer (8 m urea, 40 mm Tris-base, 4% CHAPS). Cell lysates were scraped and then homogenized on ice for 1 min with a motorized microcentrifuge tube pestle. After centrifugation for 10 min at 6,000 × g and 4 °C, the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Protein content was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The proteins (10 μg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on 8% gels. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics Inc.) followed by immunodetection with specific antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 (New England Biolabs), ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or against the α1, α2, and α3 isoforms of Na,K-ATPase (provided by Dr. Thomas Pressley, Texas Tech University HSC) (29Pressley T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C743-C751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were detected with the ECL-Plus detection reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). In the pERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 experiments, autoradiograms were imaged by a flat-bed scanner, and band intensity was converted into densitometry units using NIH Image 1.58 software. Uptake of 86Rb+ was used as an indicator of Na+, K+-ATPase ion transport activity. Cells were cultured to confluence and trypsinized. These cells were grown to higher density than in the growth stimulation experiments to have a more abundant supply of cells, and therefore a greater transport signal, for the 86Rb+ uptake assay. Trypsinization was followed by centrifugation and rinsing with cell culture medium. The cells were then resuspended in cell culture medium and placed into an incubator for adaptation. The cell number per ml was calculated using a hemocytometer. After 30 min of adaptation, cells were aliquoted to 106 cells/sample tube and preincubated for 30 min with different concentrations of ouabain. Then, 86Rb+ uptake was initiated by the addition of 1 μCi of 86Rb+ as the chloride salt (Amersham Biosciences) to each sample, and the reaction was stopped after 30 min by placing tubes on ice with addition of 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by rapid centrifugation at 4 °C and 2500 rpm. Supernatant was aspirated, and the washing procedure was repeated. Cell pellets were counted in γ counter (Cobra Quantium, Packard). Ouabain-insensitive 86Rb+ uptake was determined in the presence of 1 mm of ouabain. The results are expressed as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's test or Student-Newman-Keuls test was performed using GraphPad Prism version 3 for Windows (GraphPad Software). Values were considered to be statistically different when p < 0.05. Nonlinear regression analysis was performed to analyze the dose-response curves of inhibition of 86Rb+ uptake by ouabain in PCT and rat kidney. Ouabain and Cell Proliferation in Cultured Rat Proximal Tubule Cells—To study the effect of ouabain on PCT proliferation, we assessed four parameters associated with cell proliferation: cell count, metabolic activity, DNA synthesis, and histone phosphorylation. Cell Count—To determine the effects of 1 nm ouabain on cell number, cells were counted by hemocytometer before and after ouabain treatment. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 1A and indicate increased cell numbers at both 8 and 24 h in the treated cultures. Metabolic Activity of Cells—We assessed metabolic activity of cells using an assay based on the reduction of the tetrasolium salt 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide by cellular metabolism. Bioreduction of tetrazolium salts probably reflects the integrated pyridine nucleotide dependent redox state of the cell (27Marshall N.J. Goodwin C.J. Holt S.J. Growth Regul. 1995; 5: 69-84PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the amount of formazan product is proportional to the metabolic activity of cells in culture and provides a widely used, although indirect, measurement of cell growth (30Cory A.H. Owen T.C. Barltrop J.A. Cory J.G. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 1B. The number of cells, as reflected by increased formazan generation, markedly increased in cultures treated with ouabain at dose ranges 0.1–10 nm. DNA Synthesis—During S phase, dividing cells undergo DNA synthesis and genomic replication. If the DNA precursor BrdUrd is added to the cell culture, cells undergoing division incorporate BrdUrd into their DNA. The incorporated BrdUrd can then be detected by a quantitative cellular enzyme immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies against BrdUrd (31Porstmann T. Ternynck T. Avrameas S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 82: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Again, ouabain at dose ranges 0.1–10 nm stimulated DNA synthesis in PCT (Fig. 1C). Histone H3 Phosphorylation—Since a culture increases in cell number when cells undergo mitosis, the fraction of mitotic cells in a growing cell population directly reflects the overall growth behavior of a cell culture. The phosphorylation of histone H3 closely correlates with the chromosomal condensation that accompanies the onset of mitosis, and therefore, represents a convenient marker for dividing cells (32Abu-Absi N.R. Srienc F. J. Biotechnol. 2002; 95: 63-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 33Gurley L.R. Walters R.A. Tobey R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3936-3944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hirano T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 115-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We have shown here (Fig. 2), that the percent of mitotic cells determined by the abundance of cells staining positive for phosphorylated H3 markedly increased in 30 min after treatment with ouabain and declined thereafter. Taken together, these data provide four independent measures, indicating that ouabain stimulates cell proliferation in rat PCT at low doses corresponding to circulating concentrations of endogenous CS. Intracellular Signaling Involved in Regulation of Ouabain-induced Proliferation—Regulatory mechanisms controlling proliferation include intracellular protein kinases that can transduce signals detected on the cell surface into changes in gene expression. Most prominent among the known signal transduction pathways that control these events are the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades whose components are evolutionarily conserved in structure and organization (35Hagemann C. Blank J.L. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It was shown in cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells that regulation of cell growth by ouabain includes signaling through the Raf/MEK/MAPK cascade that includes activation of p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/2) (9Kometiani P. Li J. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15249-15256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Aydemir-Koksoy A. Abramowitz J. Allen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46605-46611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Ouabain-induced DNA synthesis and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were both inhibited by the MEK inhibitor (10Aydemir-Koksoy A. Abramowitz J. Allen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46605-46611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Here we show that ouabain stimulation of cell growth in PCT occurs concurrently with rapid activation of ERK1/2. The time course of ERK1/2 activation by 1 nm of ouabain is shown in Fig. 3A. Ouabain induced marked activation of ERK1/2 that reached a peak at 30 min and declined thereafter. Blockade of this pathway with 0.1 μm of the MEK inhibitor U0126 (36Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar) prevents both ERK1/2 activation and the growth response to ouabain (Fig. 3, A and C). Total ERK1/2 levels were unaffected by ouabain and U0126 (Fig. 3B). Sodium Pump Isoforms Expressed by Immortalized Rat Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells—Our evidence that low nanomolar quantities of ouabain produce growth and cell division in rat PCT raises the question of which Na+, K+-ATPase isoforms are expressed in rat PCT cells. In other studies, we have shown that, in vivo, the rat proximal tubule expresses exclusively the α1 isoform of Na+, K+-ATPase that is highly resistant to inhibition by ouabain (37Hayward A.L. Hinojos C.A. Nurowska B. Hewetson A. Sabatini S. Oefner P.J. Doris P.A. J. Hypertens. 1999; 17: 1081-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Detection of the expression of the α2 or α3 isoforms in PCT might provide an explanation for the remarkable dose sensitivity of the observed growth response to ouabain. Here we confirm by immunoblotting analysis that the ouabain-resistant α1 isoform is detectable in these cultures as well as in blots made by loading an equal amount of brain protein lysate. As expected, Western blots from brain lysates also produced appropriately sized immunoreactive bands, indicating the presence of α2 and α3 isoforms. However, no α2 and α3 isoforms could be detected in the PCT cell line (Fig. 4A). Dependence of Growth Stimulation on Inhibition of Na + , K + -ATPase Ion Transport—Although early findings suggested a role for Na+, K+-ATPase in the regulation of cell growth and expression of various genes, only in recent years has evidence emerged that this plasma membrane enzyme can communicate with the nucleus through second messenger signaling pathways. Work suggesting signal transduction occurring by an action of ouabain on Na+, K+-ATPase has been carried out on rat cardiac myocytes (12Xie Z. Askari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), canine vascular myocytes (10Aydemir-Koksoy A. Abramowitz J. Allen J.C. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These signaling pathways are rapidly elicited by ouabain and were shown to be independent of changes in intracellular Na+ and K+ concentration (11Xie Z. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 2001; 47: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar, 12Xie Z. Askari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 38Haas M. Wang H. Tian J. Xie Z. J.

To examine the dependence of growth-stimulating signaling on ouabain-induced inhibition of Na+, K+-ATPase ion transport in PCT, we used the 86Rb+ uptake method to assess sodium pump activity during ouabain treatment. The dose-response curve of 86Rb+ uptake inhibition by ouabain in PCT cells is shown in Fig. 4B. Surprisingly, we have detected a small (about 10–15%) decrease in 86Rb+ uptake observed at concentrations of ouabain as low as 0.1–1 nm. Although relatively minor and unexpected, this observation has been consistently observed in multiple independent experiments and may reflect a capacity of a subset of sodium pumps to bind and respond to low concentrations of ouabain. Much higher concentrations of ouabain were required to effectively inhibit the majority of 86Rb+ uptake, as expected in rat renal epithelial cells (19Fallows D. Kent R.B. Nelson D.L. Emanuel J.R.

Further analysis of inhibition of 86Rb+ uptake by ouabain in PCT was performed using nonlinear regression analysis of the inhibition curves obtained across a wide range of ouabain concentrations. The data was fitted to two models with one and two classes of binding sites, respectively. We have shown that the two-site model fits our data better than the one-site model (p < 0.0001). Results of this analysis are presented in Tables I and II. To confirm this unexpected observation, ouabain-induced inhibition of 86Rb+ in freshly harvested rat PT fragments was examined. The dose-response curve obtained for PT is similar to that for PCT cultures and is shown in Fig. 4B. Nonlinear regression analysis again indicated that a two-site model fits the ion transport inhibition data better than a single-site model (Tables I and II).Table IAnalysis of 86Rb+ uptake inhibition dataTissuePCT culturesFreshly harvested rat PTModelOne siteTwo sitesOne siteTwo sitesDF72702321Sum of squares17,790997338571674R20.46730.70140.58100.8178Best fit modelTwo-site modelTwo-site modelF value27.4413.69p valuep < 0.0001p < 0.0002 Open table in a new tab Table IIInteraction of ouabain with renal Na+,K+-ATPasePCT culturesFreshly harvested rat PTHigh affinity IC50 (pmol/liter)Low affinity IC50 (μM/liter)High affinity IC50 (pmol/liter)Low affinity IC50 (μM/liter)30 (1.2-619)24 (10-55)790 (74-8520)39 (5-314) Open table in a new tab The major finding of this study is that the cardiotonic steroid-glycoside, ouabain, which has been proposed to be an"

The characterization of the βAPP-derived catabolites indicates that cells expressing BACEs produce less genuine Aβ1– 40/42 but higher amounts of secreted sAPPβ and N-terminal-truncated Aβ species. This was accompanied by a concomitant modulation of the C-terminal counterpart products C89 and C79 for BACE1 and BACE2, respectively. These cells were used to set up a novel BACE assay based on two quenched fluorimetric substrates mimicking the wild-type (JMV2235) and Swedish-mutated (JMV2236) βAPP sequences targeted by BACE activities. We show that BACEs activities are enhanced by the Swedish mutation and maximal at pH 4.5. The specificity of this double assay for genuine β-secretase activity was demonstrated by means of cathepsin D, a “false positive” BACE candidate. Thus, cathepsin D was unable to cleave preferentially the JMV2236-mutated substrate. The selectivity of the assay was also emphasized by the lack of JMV cleavage triggered by other “secretases” candidates such as ADAM10 (Adisintegrin and metalloprotease 10), tumor necrosis α-converting enzyme, and presenilins 1 and 2. Finally, the assay was used to screen for putative in vitro BACE inhibitors. We identified a series of statine-derived sequences that dose-dependently inhibited BACE1 and BACE2 activities with IC50 in the micromolar range, some of which displaying selectivity for either BACE1 or BACE2.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the cortical and sub-cortical accumulation of proteinaceous deposits called senile plaques (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). The main constituent of these aggregates is referred to as amyloid β peptide (Aβ). 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β peptide; βAPP, β-amyloid precursor protein; Abz, p-aminobenzoic acid; tBu, tertio-butyl; EDDnp, N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HBTU, O-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Boc, tert-butyloxycarbonyl; Sta, statine; Norsta, norstatine; AHPPA, (3S,4S)-4-amino-3-hydroxy-5-phenyl-pentanoic acid; ACHPA, (3S,4S)-4-amino-5-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxy-pentanoic acid; Qui, quinolein-2-carboxylic acid; TACE, tumor necrosis α-converting enzyme; CS, commercial substrate; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholine-ethanesulfonic acid; Bz, benzoyl. Aβ is generated from the β amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) by the subsequent attacks by β- and γ-secretases, which liberate the N- and C-terminal moieties, respectively (2Checler F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1431-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). It is now clear that under this generic terminology, “Aβ” gathers a series of distinct “Aβ-related species,” some of them truncated at their β-secretase-derived N terminus (3Suh Y.-H. Checler F. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 469-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Although the nature of the γ-secretase is still discussed (4Checler F. J.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the identity of the β-secretase candidate is more consensual. BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme) is an aspartyl protease recently identified by several groups (6Hussain I. Powell D. Howlett D.R. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Gloger I.S. Murphy K.E. Southan C.D.

Thus, BACE1 is an acidic protease mainly localized in the Golgi apparatus and in endo-somal compartments and exhibits a lumenal active site fitting well with the lumenal cleavage of βAPP occurring in these acidic compartments where Aβ had been detected. The overexpression of BACE1 leads to increased recovery of Aβ-related fragments, mainly 1– 40 and 11– 40 that are also observed when recombinant BACE is incubated with βAPP (7Vassar R. Bennett B.D.

The opposite phenotype is observed when BACE is down-regulated by an antisense approach (7Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Khan S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R.

Downs D. Dashti A. Tang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) that seems to contribute poorly to neuronal Aβ production. However, BACE2 could be important in Down syndrome pathology because the enzyme is encoded by chromosome 21 (13Acquati F. Accarino M. Nucci C. Fumagalli P. Jobvine L. Ottolenghi S. Taramelli R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Saunders A.J. Kim T.-W. Tanzi R.E.

Lett. 2002; 326: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). BACE1 not only behaves as a β-secretase, in vitro, but likely corresponds to the main contributor of the β-secretase pathway, in vivo. Thus, it was evidenced that the invalidation of the BACE gene led to abolishment of Aβ production in knockout mice (16Luo Y. Bolon B. Kahn S. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Denis P. Fan W. Kha H. Zhang J. Gong Y. Martin L. Louis J.C. Yan Q. Richards W.G. Citron M. Vassar R. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) and neurons (17Cai H. Wang Y. McCarthy D. Wen H. Borchelt D.R. Price D.L. Wong P.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 233-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). That this deletion appeared totally innocuous (18Roberds S.L. Anderson J. Basi G.

Here we fully characterize the βAPP-derived catabolites generated by BACE1 and BACE2-expressing cells. Furthermore, we describe a novel fluorimetric assay and new in vitro inhibitors of potential interest to further characterize BACE1 and BACE2 properties. Chemical Reagents—Fmoc-amino acids, HBTU, and the resin were purchased from Senn Chemicals (Gentilly, France). The reagents and solvents for solid-phase peptide synthesis were obtained from Acros (Noisy-le-Grand, France) or from SDS (Peypin, France). All other chemicals were of the purest grade available. Synthesis of Peptides and Inhibitors—The intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptidic substrates Abz-Val-Lys-Met-Asp-Ala-Glu-EDDnp (JMV2235) and Abz-Val-Asn-Leu-Asp-Ala-Glu-EDDnp (JMV2236) contain the ortho-aminobenzoyl (Abz)/dinitrophenyl groups as the donor/acceptor pair (19Hirata I.Y. Sedenho Cezari M.H. Nakaie C.R. Boschcov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1994; 1: 299-308Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). They were synthesized essentially by solid phase methods (20Barany G. Kneib-Cordonier N. Mullen D.G. Intr. J. Pept. Protein. 1987; 30: 705-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), starting from the C-terminal residue Glu-EDDnp. The latter was first assembled in solution by coupling Fmoc-Glu(γ-tBu)-OH to EDDnp using HBTU as the coupling agent, in the presence of diisopropylethylamine. The resulting Fmoc-Glu(γ-tBu)-EDDnp was treated by trifluoroacetic acid to free the γ carboxylate group that was subsequently attached to the linker of a Wang resin by the symmetric anhydride method. After manual assembling of the substrates using the solid phase Fmoc strategy and HBTU as the coupling agent, cleavage of the peptides from the resin and simultaneous deprotection of side chains were carried out by treatment with a solution containing trifluoroacetic acid, thioanisole, water, phenol (8.5/0.5/0.5/0.5) for 2 h at room temperature. The final deprotected peptides were purified by reverse-phase chromatography on a C18 column (Deltapack Waters, 40 × 100 mm) by means of a linear gradient of 20 –35% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min (flow rate 50 ml/min), and their purity and identity were assessed by reverse-phase HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry (Abz-VKMDAE-EDDnp: experimental mass 1018.7 ± 0.2, calculated mass 1018.4; Abz-VNLDAE-EDDnp: experimental mass 986.6 ± 0.2, calculated mass 986.4). All peptidic inhibitors were amidated at their C-terminal end and blocked at their N terminus, either by an acetyl or by a Boc group (excepted the Qui-containing compounds), to protect them from exopeptidasic attacks. The peptide backbone of the compounds was stepwise assembled by classical methods, using Boc as the α-amino protecting group and benzotriazol-1-yloxy tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate as the coupling reagent, either in homogeneous phase or on solid phase with methylbenzhydrylamine resin, necessitating a final HF cleavage procedure. Published protocols were followed for the formation of the peptide bond isostere moieties, reduced amide bond (Leu-Ψ(CH s NH)-Asp in JMV963) (21Fehrentz J.-A. Castro B.

Medium was replaced 48 h after transfection with selective medium containing neomycin and/or zeonin (1 g/liter). Transfectants were screened by 10% SDS-PAGE gels analysis and Western blotting (see below).

Western Blot Analyses—HEK293 cells were scraped and lysed in RIPA 1× buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Equal quantity of proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel for the detection of BACE1 and BACE2 proteins and transferred to Hybond-C (Amersham Biosciences) membranes. After transfer, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated overnight with the primary antibody anti-1D4 (1:1000) (mouse monoclonal antibody donated by Scott Waniger at the National Cell Culture Center, National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN). Immunological complexes were revealed with an anti-mouse peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). All protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) procedure as described. Measurements of Total Aβ—Stably transfected WT, WTB1, WTB2, and SW HEK293 cells (see above) were incubated for7hinthe presence of phosphoramidon (1 μm) (Sigma). Media were collected, diluted in 1/10 RIPA 10× buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40), and incubated overnight with a 200-fold dilution of FCA18 (total Aβ) as described (33Ancolio K.

After further incubation for 3 h with protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and centrifugation, pelleted proteins were submitted to 16.5% Tris/Tricine gels and then Western blotted on Hybond C membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for 45 min. Nitrocellulose sheets were heated in boiling phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and capped with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h.

Measurements of sAPPβ, sAPPα, and C-terminal Products—WT, WTB1, and WTB2 cells were allowed to secrete for 7 h as above and then 15 (sAPPα/β′2) or 50 μl (sAPPβ1/2) of secretate were loaded on 8% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with 10D5C or WT192 (kind gift from Dr. D. Schenk, Elan Pharmaceuticals), respectively. Immunological complexes were revealed with the adequate IgG coupled to peroxidase. C-terminal products were analyzed from the same cell lysates and were separated on large Tris/Tricine 16.5% gels, Western blotted, and probed with BR188 as described (35Petit A. Bihel F. Alves da Costa C. Pourquié O. Kraus J.L. Checler F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Fluorimetric Assay—Different cell types were lysed, in 10 mm Tris, pH 7, and then various amounts of total homogenate proteins were preincubated for 10 min with a commercial β-secretase inhibitor (KTEEISEVN-(Sta)-VAEF-OH, Enzyme System Products, Livermore, CA) or with distinct JMV inhibitors (10 μm) in 96-well plates. The JMV2235, JMV2236, or a β-secretase commercial substrate (Mca-SEVNLdAEFRK-(dinitrophenyl)-RR-NH2, R & D Systems) were then added (10 μm) and incubated for various times at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, fluorescence was recorded at 320 and 420 nm as excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. When the effect of pH was monitored, lysed cells were pelleted, then resuspended in 25 mm Na+-acetate/MES/Tris/TES adjusted at pH values ranging from 2 to 10 and then incubations were performed as above. Controls include membrane proteins or substrate alone and background fluorescence was subtracted to recorded BACE activities. This fluorescence was very low and did not change with the time of incubation at 37 °C. Cathepsin D activity (Sigma, 0.5 μg) was assayed as above with JMV2235, JMV2336, or with the commercial substrate. Characterization of Secreted and Intracellular βAPP-derived Products Generated by BACE1 and BACE2-expressing Human Cells—We have set up stably transfected HEK293 human cells overexpressing 1D4-tagged BACE1 and BACE2 with expected molecular weights (Fig. 1A), either alone (called B1 and B2) or in combination with wild-type βAPP (referred to as WTB1 and WTB2). We have used WT192 monoclonal antibodies that recognize the two last amino acids of the secreted products derived from the canonical β-secretase cleavages taking place at the N terminus of the Asp-1 residue of Aβ (see β1 and β2 sites in Fig. 1, E and F). sAPPβ1 and sAPPβ2 generated by BACE1 and BACE2 were identical (Fig. 1, E and F) and theoretically both were recognized by WT192. As expected, secreted WT192-immunoreactive products were recovered in higher amounts in both BACE1- and BACE2-expressing cells than in WT cells (Fig. 1B). Additional β′1- and β′2-derived cleavages targeted by BACE1 and BACE2, respectively, occur inside the Aβ sequence and theoretically liberate sAPPβ′1- and sAPPβ′2-secreted fragments (see Fig. 1, E and F). sAPPβ′2, as well as sAPPα, the physiological α-secretase-derived APP fragment, retain a 10D5C epitope that was disrupted by β′1 cleavage (see Fig. 1, E and F). As expected, 10D5C-positive fragments secreted by WT and WTB2 cells (corresponding to sAPPα/β′2) were recovered in much higher amounts than with WTB1 cells (Fig. 1C). The C-terminal counterparts of the above products were probed in cell lysates using BR188, a polyclonal antibody that interacts with the C terminus of all fragments (Fig. 1, E–G). As expected, β1- and β2-derived cleavages (Fig. 1, E and F) increase C99 in WTB1 and WTB2 (Fig. 1D), in agreement with higher production of their N-terminal counterpart sAPPβ1/2 (Fig. 1B). The nature of C99 was confirmed by means of FCA18 (36Barelli H. Lebeau A. Vizzavona J. Delaere P. Chevallier N. Drouot C. Marambaud P. Ancolio K. Buxbaum J.D. Khorkova O. Heroux J. Sahasrabudhe S. Martinez J. Warter J.-M. Mohr M. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 695-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a polyclonal antibody that specifically interacts with the free Asp-1 residue of Aβ and C99 (not shown). A fragment of lower molecular weight was specifically recovered with WTB1 cells (Fig. 1D). Although not definitively identified, this product likely corresponds to C89, the β′1-derived specific product generated by WTB1 cells (Fig. 1, D and E). Finally, a low molecular weight product present in BACE2 but not BACE1 cells could derive from the β′2 cleavage (Fig. 1F). This product tentatively ascribed to C79 co-migrates with the C83 major product generated by α-secretase in WT cells (Fig. 1, D and G). C89- and C79-like products were FCA18-negative (not shown), confirming that the fragments lack the intact N terminus present in C99. Characterization of Genuine Aβ in BACE1- and BACE2-expressing HEK293 Cells—The use of FCA18 was proved useful to monitor secreted genuine Aβ. Thus, this antibody only recognizes free Asp-1 residue of Aβ or C99 (Fig. 2) because acetylation or removal of this aspartyl residue abolishes recognition by FCA18 (36Barelli H. Lebeau A. Vizzavona J. Delaere P. Chevallier N. Drouot C. Marambaud P. Ancolio K. Buxbaum J.D. Khorkova O. Heroux J. Sahasrabudhe S. Martinez J. Warter J.-M. Mohr M. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 695-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, FCA18 does not label N-terminal truncated Aβ-related species. As expected, the overexpression of wild-type βAPP increases Aβ1– 40/42 (compare mock and WT in Fig. 2). Interestingly, as previously described (27Chevallier N. Jiracek J. Vincent B. Baur C.P.

Both WTB1 and WTB2 cells secrete less Aβ than WT cells (Fig. 2), indicating that the β′1 and β′2 cleavages are likely more efficient than the β1 and β2 breakdowns elicited by BACE1 and BACE2 (see Fig. 2), respectively. It is noteworthy that while “complete” Aβ is still detectable in BACE1-expressing cells, it was not recovered in WTB2. The fact that sAPPβ was augmented in BACE2 (Fig. 1B) suggests that the β2 cleavage before Asp-1 of Aβ sequence indeed occurs. However, the relatively faint augmentation of the C-terminal counterpart C99 and the accumulation of C79 (Fig. 1D) suggests that BACE2-elicited β′2 cleavage was particularly efficient and could take place using C99 as a substrate, thereby explaining the low recovery of “full-length Aβ” observed with these cells (Fig. 2). Design of a Novel BACE Fluorimetric Assay—Several studies have indicated that the Swedish mutation responsible for a familial form of Alzheimer's disease leads to increased production of Aβ via an exacerbation of the β-secretase-derived cleavage (37Cai X.-D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 38Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I.

Genet. 1994; 6: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have set up a new assay based on the cleavage of quenched fluorimetric substrates mimicking the wild-type (JMV2235) and Swedish-mutated (JMV2236) sequences (Fig. 3) targeted by β-secretase (s) with the assumption that a good assay should be reflected by a favored hydrolysis of mutated JMV2236. At acidic pH, B1 and B2 cell extracts (see Fig. 1) hydrolyze both JMV2235 and JMV2236 in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). It should be noted that kinetic analyses indicate that activities recovered with JMV2236 plateaued at the same fluorescence value (Fig. 4). This could be because of either depletion of available substrate or, alternatively, to an inhibitory effect by one of the products of the reaction. The latter hypothesis was ruled out by the fact that the rates of hydrolyzes of JMV2235 by B1 and B2 cells were not affected by 100 μm Bz-VNL, Bz-VKL, Bz-VNL-NH2, and Bz-VKL-NH2. These N-terminal degradation products lack the N-terminal fluorescent moiety and were either free or amidated at the C terminus (to prevent it from putative carboxypeptidase attack (not shown). In agreement with a substrate extinction, standard fluorescence observed with synthetic Abz-VNL (10 μm) corresponds to the value observed at plateau when 10 μm substrate is used, indicating that this fluorescence indeed corresponds to 100% hydrolysis of the substrate (not shown). We used a β-secretase commercial inhibitor to further validate our assay. Interestingly, mock-transfected cells exhibit faint JMV2235- and JMV2236-hydrolyzing activities that remained insensitive to the inhibitor (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that endogenous β-secretase activity was low in HEK293 cells. The JMV2235- and JMV2236-hydrolyzing activities of B1 cells returned to the mock-transfected cell value in the presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that most of the fluorescence recorded was indeed because of BACE1 in B1 cells. This conclusion also stands for BACE2-expressing cells (Fig. 5C) although the extent of inhibition was slightly lower (69 versus 97% of inhibition for B2 and B1 cells, respectively, see Fig. 6B). Interestingly, in B1 cells, hydrolysis of JMV2236-mutated substrate is twice as efficient as that observed for the non-mutated analog (Fig. 5C).Fig. 6Inhibitor-sensitive JMV2236 hydrolysis by BACE1- and BACE2-expressing cells is pH-dependent. BACE1- (HEKB1) or BACE2- (HEKB2) expressing cell proteins (30 μg) were incubated with 10 μm JMV2236 (A) for 30 min at pH 4.5 or 8, in the absence (–) or presence (+) of a commercial β-secretase inhibitor (CI, 10 μm), then the activity was fluorimetrically recorded as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bars are the mean ± S.E. of eight determinations. Specific activities in B correspond to initial velocity measurements of the JMV2236-hydrolyzing activity obtained with or without inhibitor. The % of inhibition was calculated after subtraction of the CI-insensitive activity obtained in mock-transfected cells (see “Results”). A fluorescence of 700 corresponds to 1 nmol of Abz-VNL-OH liberated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Another clue for stating that our novel assay was β-secretase-specific was the strong pH requirement observed.

Both CCN proteins have been shown to support cell adhesion and induce cell migration through interaction with integrin receptors. Recently, we have identified integrin αMβ2 as the major adhesion receptor mediating monocyte adhesion to CCN1 and CCN2 and have shown that the αMI domain binds specifically to both proteins. In the present study, we demonstrated that activated monocytes adhered to a synthetic peptide (CCN1-H2, SSVKKYRPKYCGS) derived from a conserved region within the CCN1 C-terminal domain, and this process was blocked by the anti-αM monoclonal antibody 2LPM19c. Consistently, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the αMI domain (GST-αMI) bound to immobilized CCN1-H2 as well as to the corresponding H2 sequence in CCN2 (CCN2-H2, TSVKTYRAKFCGV). By contrast, a scrambled CCN1-H2 peptide and an 18-residue peptide derived from an adjacent sequence of CCN1-H2 failed to support monocyte adhesion or αMI domain binding. To confirm that the CCN1-H2 sequence within the CCN1 protein mediates αMβ2 interaction, we developed an anti-peptide antibody against CCN1-H2 and showed that it specifically blocked GST-αMI binding to intact CCN1. Collectively, these results identify the H2 sequence in CCN1 and CCN2 as a novel integrin αMβ2 binding motif that bears no apparent homology to any αMβ2 binding sequence reported to date.

(cysteine-rich 61, CYR61) and CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF), products of immediate-early genes transcriptionally activated in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells upon growth factor stimulation, belong to the CCN (CYR61/CTGF/nephroblastoma-overexpressed) family of matricellular signaling molecules that have been implicated in diverse biological functions (1Lau L.F.

Other CCN family members include CCN3 (nephroblastoma-overexpressed, Nov) and the wnt-1-induced secreted proteins CCN4 (WISP-1), CCN5 (WISP-2), and CCN6 (WISP-3). These conserved and modular proteins consist of an N-terminal secretory peptide followed by four structural domains that include 1) an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein homology domain, 2) a von Willebrand factor type C domain, 3) a thrombospondin type 1 repeat homology domain, and 4) a C-terminal domain with heparin binding motifs and sequence similarity to the C termini of von Willebrand factor and mucin (4Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Consistent with their localization to the extracellular matrix and their homology to extracellular matrix proteins, several CCN members have been shown to support cell adhesion, induce adhesive signaling, promote cell migration, and augment growth factor-induced cell proliferation through interaction with integrin receptors and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (5Kireeva M.L.

The expression of CCN1 is essential for normal embryonic development inasmuch as targeted disruption of the CCN1 gene in mouse results in embryonic lethality (15MO F.E. Muntean A.G. Chen C.C.

Interestingly, the majority of the CCN1-null embryos exhibit vascular defects, consistent with an essential role of CCN1 in normal embryonic angiogenesis. In adults, CCN1 is present at low levels in the cardiovascular system (16Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V. Kolesnikova T.V. Chen C.C. Yang G.P. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Exp.

It is well established that leukocyte adhesion and emigration play an important role in inflammation, wound healing, and atherosclerosis (24Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6409) Google Scholar). In a recent report, we showed that human peripheral blood monocytes adhere to CCN1 and CCN2 in an activation-dependent manner through integrin αMβ2 (12Schober J.M. Chen N. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Jovanovic I. Emeson E.E. Ugarova T.P. Ye R.D. Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), underscoring the importance of these proteins in the pathophysiologic function of leukocytes. To establish these CCN proteins as novel ligands of αMβ2, we demonstrated direct binding of the I domain of the integrin αM subunit (αMI) to immobilized CCN1 and CCN2 (12Schober J.M. Chen N. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Jovanovic I. Emeson E.E. Ugarova T.P. Ye R.D. Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that monocyte adhesion and αMI domain binding to CCN1 are blocked by anti-αM monoclonal antibodies as well as by soluble heparin. These findings suggest that the αMβ2 binding site may lie in close proximity to the heparin binding motifs within the C-terminal domain of CCN1. To gain further insight into the interaction of αMβ2 with CCN proteins, we sought to identify the αMβ2 binding site in CCN1. In the present study, we demonstrated αMβ2-dependent adhesion of monocytes to SSVKKYRPKYCGS present in the C-terminal domain of CCN1. Furthermore, the αMI domain binds specifically to this 13-residue sequence of CCN1 with a similar affinity as to the P2 (YSMKKTTMKIIPFNRLTIG) sequence, an αMβ2 binding site in the fibrinogen γ chain (25Ugarova T.P.

Our newly identified αMβ2 binding sequence in CCN1 bears no sequence homology to any known αMβ2 binding motif reported to date and may provide a target for blocking CCN1-αMβ2 interaction.

For solid phase binding assays, anti-GST goat polyclonal antibody was from Amersham Biosciences, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG was from Sigma. For ELISA, HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody was from Pierce. An anti-peptide antibody (anti-CCN1367–381) against a peptide sequence corresponding to the extreme C terminus of CCN1 (F367PFYRLFNDIHKFRD381) was raised in rabbits and affinity-purified as previously described (13Grzeszkiewicz T.M.

Anti-domain I and anti-domain II polyclonal antibodies, raised in rabbits using GST fusion proteins linked to domain I or domain II of CCN1 as immunogens, were pre-absorbed with GST and then affinity-purified. In ELISA, both anti-domain I and anti-domain II antibodies reacted with full-length CCN1 as expected.

For isolation of mononuclear cells, the remaining packed red blood cells and buffy coat was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.35, 0.15 m NaCl) and centrifuged through a layer of Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) at 400 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The mononuclear cell layer was diluted in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA, sedimented, and washed twice with modified Tyrode's buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.35, 135 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO2,1mm MgCl2,1mm CaCl2, 0.1% dextrose, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) by centrifugation at 130 × g for 10 min. To further separate monocytes from lymphocytes, the mononuclear cells were suspended in modified Tyrode's buffer and subjected to centrifugation through a discontinuous density gradient of Percoll (Amersham Biosciences). Monocytes were isolated between a Percoll density of 1.047 and 1.050 g/ml, washed with modified Tyrode's buffer, and resuspended to a final concentration of 2–3 × 106 cells/ml. The purity of the monocyte preparation was greater than 80%, as measured by anti-CD14 staining in flow cytometry, and cell viability was more than 95% as judged by trypan blue exclusion. Cell Adhesion Assay—Microtiter wells (Immulon 2 Removawell strips, Dynex Technologies, Inc.) were coated with 10 μg/ml CCN1 or CCN1ΔCT protein or with 4 mg/ml peptide for 20 h at 4 °C. After protein or peptide coating, the wells were blocked with 0.2% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for 30 min at 37 °C. The amounts of immobilized CCN1 and CCN1ΔCT protein were quantified by an ELISA using anti-domain I and anti-CCN1367–381 antibodies as indicated. The amounts of immobilized peptides were measured by incubation for 2 h at 22 °C with 10 μm PEO-maleimide-activated biotin (Pierce), which reacts with the free sulfhydryl group in the cysteine residue of the peptides. After washing, the amounts of coupled biotin were quantified by incubation with 0.5 μm125I-labeled streptavidin, and bound radioactivity was measured by γ-counting. In cell adhesion experiments, isolated monocytes were activated with 20 μm ADP, added to the wells (100 μl/well), and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. After washing to remove non-adherent cells, adherent cells were quantified using the acid phosphatase assay by incubation with the substrate solution (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, and 0.1% Triton X-100; 100 μl/well) for 2 h at 37 °C (29Connolly D.T. Knight M.B. Harakas N.K. Wittwer A.J. Feder J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μlof1 n NaOH/well, and A 450 was measured. In inhibition studies, monocytes were preincubated with antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C before addition to microtiter wells. Binding of GST-αM I to Immobilized CCN1 and CCN-derived Peptides—Microtiter wells were coated with 30 μg/ml wild type or truncated CCN1 or 4 mg/ml synthetic peptides for 20 h at 4 °C and blocked with 0.2% PVA for 30 min at 37 °C. GST-αMI fusion protein was added to the wells and incubated for 1–2 h at 22 °C. Unbound GST-αMI was removed by washing with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% PVA. Bound GST-αMI was detected by an ELISA using anti-GST followed by an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) as the substrate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 6 n HCl, and A 490 was measured. In inhibition experiments using an anti-αM monoclonal antibody, GST-αMI was preincubated with the antibody for 30 min at 37 °C before addition to the wells. In inhibition studies using anti-CCN1-H2 polyclonal antibodies, CCN1-coated wells were blocked with 1% BSA and preincubated with the antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C before the addition of the GST-αMI fusion protein. Binding proceeded for 30 min at 37 °C, and bound GST-αMI was detected as described above. In binding isotherm studies, input GST-αMI concentrations required for half-maximal binding of the fusion protein to immobilized peptides were estimated using the GraphPad Prism software in which the data was fitted to the one-site binding equation. The C-terminal Domain of CCN1 Is Required for Monocyte Adhesion and αM I Domain Binding—We previously identified αMβ2 as the major adhesion receptor on monocytes for CCN1 and CCN2 and showed that the I domain of the αM subunit bound specifically to both proteins (12Schober J.M. Chen N. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Jovanovic I. Emeson E.E. Ugarova T.P. Ye R.D. Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Moreover, soluble heparin inhibited monocyte adhesion and αMI domain binding by interacting with the heparin binding motifs at the C-terminal domain of CCN1. The inhibitory effect of heparin suggests that the αMβ2 recognition site in CCN1 may be located in its C-terminal domain. To investigate this possibility, we performed monocyte adhesion and αMI domain binding experiments on a truncated CCN1 mutant that lacks the C-terminal domain (CCN1ΔCT) (10Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Kirschling D.J. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21943-21950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that monocytes adhered to wells coated with wild type CCN1 protein. By contrast, no cell adhesion to CCN1ΔCT-coated wells was observed. In agreement with the cell adhesion results, a GST fusion protein containing the αMI domain (GST-αMI) bound only to intact CCN1 but not to CCN1ΔCT (Fig. 1B). To determine whether similar amounts of CCN1 and CCN1ΔCT protein were immobilized onto microtiter wells, we performed an ELISA using two polyclonal antibodies raised against the entire domain I of CCN1 (anti-domain I) or a synthetic peptide corresponding to residue Phe367–Asp381 at the C terminus of CCN1 (anti-CCN1367–381). As shown in Fig. 1C, almost equal signals were obtained using the anti-domain I antibodies, indicating that similar amounts of CCN1 and CCN1ΔCT were immobilized. As expected, anti-CCN1367–381, directed against the extreme C terminus of CCN1, reacted with intact CCN1 but not with CCN1ΔCT, which lacks the C-terminal domain. Together, these results indicate that the C-terminal domain of CCN1 is required for both monocyte adhesion and αMI domain binding. Thus, the αMβ2 binding site likely resides within the C-terminal region of CCN proteins. The H2 Sequence in the CCN1 C-terminal Domain Supports Monocyte Adhesion—The inability of CCN1ΔCT to support monocyte adhesion and αMI domain binding suggests that the recognition site for αMβ2 is located in the C-terminal domain of CCN1. We focused on the first half of the C-terminal domain, because this region is highly homologous between CCN1 and CCN2, and both proteins support monocyte adhesion and αMI domain binding. Also, heparin has been shown to inhibit monocyte adhesion and αMI domain binding to CCN1 (12Schober J.M. Chen N. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Jovanovic I. Emeson E.E. Ugarova T.P. Ye R.D. Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and therefore, we examined the possibility that αMβ2 binds directly to the heparin binding motifs in CCN1. In these studies we synthesized two peptides, CCN1-H1 and CCN1-H2, that correspond to the two heparin binding motifs of CCN1 (Fig. 2A). The peptides were immobilized onto microtiter wells, and their ability to support monocyte adhesion was examined. To determine the coating efficiency of CCN1-H1 and CCN1-H2 onto the wells, PEO-maleimide-activated biotin was allowed to react with the free sulfhydryl group in the single cysteine residue present in each peptide followed by detection with 125I-labeled streptavidin. Quantitation of bound radioactivity indicates that similar amounts of both peptides were immobilized onto the wells (Fig. 2B). In cell adhesion studies we found that monocytes adhered to CCN1-H2, but not to CCN1-H1 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, monocyte adhesion to CCN1-H2 was completely blocked by 2LPM19c, an anti-αM monoclonal antibody, whereas control mouse IgG had no effect. Microscopic examination of the monocytes adherent to CCN1 protein and CCN1-H2 peptide revealed that the cells were well spread on both substrates (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that the H2 sequence in the C-terminal domain of CCN1 specifically mediates monocyte adhesion in an αMβ2-dependent manner. We previously reported that monocyte adhesion to CCN1 is markedly enhanced after cellular activation with ADP and formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (12Schober J.M. Chen N. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Jovanovic I. Emeson E.E. Ugarova T.P. Ye R.D. Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Enhanced adhesion of activated monocytes to CCN1 is likely due to inside-out signaling, resulting in increased αMβ2 affinity for CCN1 and/or mobilization of internal αMβ2 to the cell surface. In addition to inside-out signaling, the activation states of integrins can be modulated by extracellular divalent cations inasmuch as Mn2+ has been shown to increase the apparent affinity/avidity of multiple integrins including αMβ2 (30Li R. Rieu P. Griffith D.L. Scott D. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the effect of extracellular Mn2+ on monocyte adhesion to intact CCN1 protein and to the CCN1-H2 peptide. As expected, the addition of 1 mm Mn2+ to the cell suspension resulted in enhanced monocyte adhesion to CCN1 (Fig. 3). Likewise, monocyte adhesion to the CCN1-H2 peptide was also significantly enhanced in the presence of Mn2+. In a specificity control, monocytes were allowed to adhere to wells coated with a scrambled CCN1-H2 sequence (CCN1-scrH2). To confirm that CCN1-scrH2 was adsorbed onto microtiter wells, we performed binding of PEO-maleimide-activated biotin and 125I-labeled streptavidin as described above. Even though a higher amount of CCN1-scrH2 (95.6 ± 6.1 fmol/well) was coated onto the wells as compared with CCN1-H2 (43.6 ± 0.9 fmol/well), no significant cell adhesion to CCN1-scrH2-coated wells was observed in the absence and presence of Mn2+. The ability of Mn2+ to enhance monocyte adhesion to CCN1 and CCN1-H2, but not to CCN1-scrH2, indicates that activated αMβ2 binds with a higher affinity to intact CCN1 and to the CCN1-H2 sequence. Binding of αM I Domain to the H2 Sequences in CCN proteins—The above cell adhesion data suggest that the CCN1-H2 sequence, but not CCN1-H1, serves as a binding site for integrin αMβ2. To corroborate cell adhesion studies with receptor binding, we performed αMI domain binding experiments on immobilized CCN1-H1 and CCN1-H2. Fig. 4A shows that GST-αMI bound directly to wells coated with the CCN1 protein or with the CCN1-H2 peptide, but not to wells coated with the CCN1-H1 peptide (filled bars). As controls, GST itself did not bind to CCN1, CCN1-H1, or CCN1-H2 (open bars). To demonstrate binding specificity, we tested the effect of 2LPM19c on αMI domain binding. As shown in Fig. 4B, inhibition of GST-αMI binding to CCN1-H2 was observed with 2LPM19c (anti-αM) but not with an isotype-matched mouse IgG. These results indicate that integrin αMβ2 binds directly to the CCN1-H2 sequence to mediate monocyte adhesion to CCN1 protein. In addition to CCN1, we previously reported that the αMI domain also binds to CCN2, another CCN family member highly homologous to CCN1 (12Schober J.M. Chen N. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Jovanovic I. Emeson E.E. Ugarova T.P. Ye R.D. Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed solid phase binding studies to examine whether GST-αMI also binds to the corresponding H2 sequence in CCN2. Fig. 5A shows the H2 sequences in CCN1 and CCN2 with the non-conserved residues underlined. The αMI domain was found to bind dose dependently to both CCN1-H2 and CCN2-H2 peptides, whereas no binding was observed with wells coated with the CCN1-scrH2 sequence (Fig. 5B). Using the GraphPad Prism software, we estimated that half-maximal binding of GST-αMI to immobilized CCN1-H2 and CCN2-H2 occurred at input GST-αMI concentrations of 47.2 ± 6.4 and 128.0 ± 26.3 nm (means ± S.E.; n = 5 for CCN1-H2 and n = 3 for CCN2-H2), respectively. Thus, the results of the binding isotherms indicate that the αMI domain binds with a higher affinity to CCN1-H2 than to CCN2-H2 (Student's t test, p < 0.01). Consistently, we previously showed that monocytic THP-1 cells adhere more strongly to CCN1 than to CCN2 (12Schober J.M. Chen N. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Jovanovic I. Emeson E.E. Ugarova T.P. Ye R.D.

https://openalex.org/W2067427645,"Snu114p, a yeast U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) homologous to the ribosomal GTPase EF-2, was recently found to play a part in the dissociation of U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) from U6 snRNA. Here, we show that purified Snu114p binds GTP specifically. To test the possibility that binding and hydrolysis of GTP by Snu114p are required to stimulate the unwinding of U4 from U6, we produced several mutations of Snu114p. Residues whose mutations led to lethal phenotypes were all clustered in the P loop and in the guanine-ring binding sequence (NKXD) of the G domain, which in elongation factor-G is required for the binding and hydrolysis of GTP. An arginine residue in domain II, which in EF-G forms a salt bridge with a residue of the G domain, when mutated in Snu114p (R487E), led to a temperature-sensitive phenotype. The substitution D271N in the NKXD sequence is predicted to bind XTP instead of GTP. Spliceosomes containing this mutant, isolated by affinity chromatography after heat treatment, retained U4 snRNA paired with the U6 snRNA. U4 snRNA was released efficiently only when these arrested spliceosomes were reactivated by lowering the temperature in the presence of a mixture of ATP and XTP. Because non-hydrolyzable XTP analogues did not consent the release of U4, we conclude that the release requires hydrolysis of XTP. This suggests that Snu114p needs GTP to influence, directly or indirectly, the unwinding of U4 from U6. An additional role for Snu114p is also demonstrated: after growth of the D271N and R487E strains at high temperatures, we observed decreased levels of the U5 and the U4/U6·U5 snRNPs. This indicates that, before splicing, Snu114p plays a part in the assembly of both particles.

This indicates that, before splicing, Snu114p plays a part in the assembly of both particles. Splicing of mRNA precursors (pre-mRNA) proceeds by two consecutive transesterification steps that are catalyzed by the spliceosome. The spliceosome is formed by the ordered interaction of the U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6 snRNPs 1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; XTP, xanthosine triphosphate; XMP-PNP, xanthosine-5′-[(β,γ)-imido]triphosphate; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); EF-G, elongation factor G.1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; XTP, xanthosine triphosphate; XMP-PNP, xanthosine-5′-[(β,γ)-imido]triphosphate; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); EF-G, elongation factor G. (in which the U4 and U6 RNAs are base paired) and of several splicing factors, with the pre-mRNA (1Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar). The spliceosome is assembled by the initial interaction of the U1 snRNP with the 5′ splice site, thereafter the U2 snRNP recognizes and binds to the branch site, forming the pre-spliceosome. Spliceosome assembly is completed by the subsequent association of the U4/U6 and U5 snRNPs in the form of a U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP complex.Activation of the assembled spliceosome into a catalytically functional machine requires extensive reorganization of the components. Thus, during spliceosome activation, base-pairing between U4 and U6 is disrupted and a new base-pairing between U2 and U6 occurs (reviewed in Ref. 2Nilsen T.W. Simons R.W. Grunberg-Manago M. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 279-307Google Scholar). Concomitantly with these events, base-pairing of U1 with the 5′ splice site is exchanged for base-pairing between U6 and the 5′ splice site (3Kandels-Lewis S. Séraphin B. Science. 1993; 262: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 4Lesser C.F. Guthrie C. Science. 1993; 262: 1982-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). After these rearrangements, U1 and U4 snRNPs are released from the spliceosome prior to catalysis. The conserved loop I of U5 RNA makes contact with exonic sequences at the 5′ and 3′ splice sites, while the splicing reaction proceeds (5Sontheimer E.J. Steitz J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1989-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar).The unwinding of the U4/U6 snRNA duplex is an important step toward the activation of the spliceosome and depends on the functioning of a large number of protein factors. In addition to the putative U4/U6 helicase Brr2p, five splicing factors in yeast have already been implicated in the release of U4 snRNA during spliceosome activation. These are the U4/U6 snRNP protein Prp4p (6Ayadi L. Miller M. Banroques J. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 197-209PubMed Google Scholar), the non-snRNP protein Prp19p (7Tarn W.Y. Lee K.R. Cheng S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10821-10825Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the tri-snRNP protein Prp38p, and the U5 snRNP proteins Prp8p and Snu114p (8Xie J. Beickman K. Otte E.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Previously we showed that the G domain-containing protein Snu114p and its human orthologue protein U5–116K are close homologues of the ribosomal elongation factor EF-2 (10Fabrizio P. Laggerbauer B. Lauber J. Lane W.S. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4092-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Consistently with this, the U5–116K protein cross-links specifically to GTP in purified U5 snRNP particles, and this cross-linking is stimulated by poly(U) (10Fabrizio P. Laggerbauer B. Lauber J. Lane W.S. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4092-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Remarkably, as predicted by its homology with EF-2, we found that Snu114p is involved in rearranging the spliceosomal RNP structure. Indeed, a temperature-sensitive deletion mutant of Snu114p (snu114ΔN), led to the accumulation of arrested, precatalytic spliceosomes in which U4 is still base-paired with the U6 snRNA. This suggested that Snu114p is involved in the transition to an active form of the spliceosome by influencing factors that are directly required for the unwinding of the U4/U6 duplex (11Bartels C. Klatt C. Lührmann R. Fabrizio P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).As described above, Snu114p is involved in this rearrangement step together with several additional factors, and there is increasing evidence for a link between Snu114p and some of these factors, for example, between Prp8p and the putative U4/U6 helicase Brr2p. The most direct evidence for this link is the strong RNA-independent protein-protein interaction that has been detected in the human system between the proteins 220K/Prp8p, 200K/Brr2p, and 116K/Snu114p after dissociation of these proteins as a stable complex from the U5 snRNP in high salt buffer (12Achsel T. Ahrens K. Brahms H. Teigelkamp S. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6756-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In yeast, several studies have shown that Snu114p is in contact with Prp8p and that Prp8p interacts with Brr2p (13Dix I. Russell C.S. O'Keefe R.T. Newman A.J. Beggs J.D. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14van Nues R.W. Beggs J.D. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1451-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we had hypothesized (11Bartels C. Klatt C. Lührmann R. Fabrizio P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that Snu114p is a crucial factor, acting in an earlier step to trigger the function of Prp8p/220K and/or of the Brr2p/200K RNA unwindase, in this intricate network of factors involved in the U4/U6 unwinding during spliceosome activation.To define the details of the reaction that Snu114p catalyzes in concert with other factors, and primarily to test the possibility that binding and hydrolysis of GTP by Snu114p are required for spliceosome activation, we replaced or deleted several amino acids in evolutionarily conserved domains of Snu114p. We found that residues that led to lethal phenotypes are all clustered in the G domain, more precisely, in the P loop and in the guanine-ring-binding sequence (NKXD), which in EF-G are required for GTP binding and hydrolysis (15Aevarsson A. Brazhnikov E. Garber M. Zheltonosova J. Chirgadze Y. Al-Karadaghi S. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 16Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We also found that an arginine in domain II, which in EF-G forms a salt bridge with a residue of the G domain, when mutated in Snu114p (R487E), led to a weakly viable, temperature-sensitive phenotype even at 25 °C. Surprisingly, all of the point mutations made in the other domains did not lead to any significant effect, except for a residue in domain IV.We also replaced aspartic acid 271 with asparagine, in the NKLD sequence of the G domain of Snu114p, to give the mutant snu114-D271N. An analogous substitution in several GTPases changes their specificity of binding and hydrolysis from GTP to xanthosine triphosphate (XTP) (17Bishop A. Buzko O. Heyeck-Dumas S. Jung I. Kraybill B. Liu Y. Shah K. Ulrich S. Witucki L. Yang F. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because this mutant does not lead to a lethal phenotype, we tried to address the interesting question of whether GTP hydrolysis (XTP in this case) is required to trigger the unwinding of U4 from U6. This mutant should allow the identification of the XTP-dependent function of mutated Snu114p and the characterization of this function in a crude extract containing a variety of ATPases, some of which are known to bind and hydrolyze GTP as well.As a prerequisite to these studies, we determined first that Snu114p, similar to its human orthologue, binds GTP in vitro in a specific manner, as analyzed by UV cross-linking. Thus, we show that Snu114p is a genuine GTP-binding protein. Next, we studied the D271N mutant in more detail, and found that this mutant leads to a slow growth phenotype that at high temperatures results in arrested splicing in vivo. Importantly, we show that heat treatment of the D271N extract leads also to a defect of splicing in vitro that is reversed by lowering the assay temperature. We establish that the in vitro thermal inactivation results in accumulation of arrested spliceosomes in which U4 is not released, because it is still base-paired with the U6 snRNA. These precatalytic complexes are isolated by affinity chromatography, depleted of residual nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), and finally reactivated by adding back a mixture of ATP/XTP and by lowering the assay temperature. Using this system, we show that U4 is released efficiently from the spliceosome only when a mixture of ATP (required for the helicases) and hydrolyzable XTP (required by snu114-D271N) is added. Thus, these experiments suggest that snu114-D271N needs hydrolyzable XTP (and wild-type Snu114p needs GTP) to influence the unwinding of U4 from U6.We also found an additional role for Snu114p. Growth of the D271N and R487E mutant strains at high temperatures leads to extracts that have reduced levels of U5 and tri-snRNP particles, thus suggesting that Snu114p is, directly or indirectly, involved in maintaining proper amounts of U5 and tri-snRNP as well.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGlycerol Gradient Centrifugation—2.5 mg of yeast splicing extract was diluted to reduce the concentration of glycerol from 20% to 8% and loaded on a 10–30% (w/w) glycerol gradient containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 200 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 108,000 × g, for 18 h at 4 °C, the gradients were fractionated into 24 fractions of 500 μl. Each fraction was phenol-chloroform-extracted, and their RNA composition was analyzed by Northern blotting. The proteins were acetone-precipitated and assayed by Western blotting.Yeast Strains—Strains were YPF39, trp1-Δ1; his3-Δ; ura3–52; lys2–801; ade2–101; snu114Δ::HIS (TRP1 pRS424-GPD1/SNU114, 6his N-terminal, ARS, CEN); YPF37, trp1-Δ1; his3-Δ; ura3–52; lys2–801; ade2–101; snu114Δ::HIS (TRP1 pRS314/snu114D271N, 6his N-terminal, ARS, CEN); and YCK13, trp1-Δ1; his3-Δ; ura3–52; lys2–801; ade2–101; snu114Δ::HIS (TRP1 pRS314/snu114R487E, Flu-tag C-terminal, ARS, CEN).Mutagenesis—Most of the mutations in the SNU114 gene were introduced by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene), as described previously (10Fabrizio P. Laggerbauer B. Lauber J. Lane W.S. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4092-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of SNU114 and containing the desired substitution, were designed. The PCR cycling parameter suggested by the QuikChange method was employed, using native Pfu DNA polymerase. The mutant allele was screened for the desired mutation by sequencing. A PCR-based strategy was used to delete 162 amino acids of domain IV, from position 700 to 862. Plasmids pRS314/SNU114, containing the desired substitution or deletion, were sequenced and separately transformed into strain YPF8. The plasmid-shuffling strategy was applied (18Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). After selection at 25 °C in medium lacking tryptophan, transformants were streaked once on medium lacking tryptophan and grown at 25 °C. Patches were streaked three times on 5-fluoroorotic acid plates to select for cells lacking of the URA3 plasmid. Cells that survived on 5-fluoroorotic acid plates were streaked on rich medium, and their growth phenotypes were analyzed by incubating cells and dilutions (5 × 104, 5 × 103, and 5 × 102 at 37, 30, 25, and 17 °C for 1–2 days or longer). A good temperature-sensitive strain was one that did not grow in -Ura plates at any of the temperatures and, in addition, did not grow in rich medium at 30 or 37 °C but grew at 25 °C.Antibody Production—The SNU114 BamHI SnabI fragment from plasmid pBSIISK(–)/SNU114, was cloned into vector pQE-30 (Qiagen) between BamHI and SmaI restriction sites. The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain M15 (pREP4) and used to overexpress a histidine tag containing Snu114p fragment of 59.5 kDa bearing the N-terminal acidic domain, the G domain, and part of domain II. The protein was purified from crude cell lysates by Ni-NTA chelate chromatography, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen), and used to immunize a rabbit. The polyclonal antiserum obtained was specific for Snu114p, as tested by Western blot analysis and ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences) of total yeast snRNPs and purified Snu114p. The protein could be clearly detected when the serum was diluted 1:5000.Purification of Snu114p—His-tagged Snu114p was purified from YPF39 extracts by Ni-NTA chelate chromatography according to the protocol supplied by Novagen. The binding buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). In the wash buffer the imidazole concentration was increased to 10 mm. In a second washing step, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole were used instead. Elution was performed with the latter buffer containing in addition 10% glycerol and 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 mm imidazole. Most of Snu114p was eluted between 100 and 150 mm imidazole. To the eluted protein, glycerol and β-mercaptoethanol were added to give a final concentration of 20% and 20 mm, respectively. For further purification, the peak fractions of the nickel column eluate were loaded separately on a Superdex G-200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The running buffer contained 50 mm NaH2PO4 and 300 mm NaCl. Fractions of 100 μl were collected, and a 30-μl aliquot of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.GTP Cross-linking Assays and Immunoprecipitation—15 pmol of purified Snu114p was incubated in 25 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 1.3 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.6 μg/μl poly(U) with 20 μCi (6.6 pmol) of [α-32P]GTP (Amersham Biosciences, specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) for 5 min at room temperature. The subsequent UV cross-linking reaction was performed essentially as described previously (19Laggerbauer B. Lauber J. Lührmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), except that the cross-linking time was extended to 7 min with the sample at a distance of 4.5 cm from the UV lamp. The cross-linked proteins were then immunoprecipitated with the anti-Snu114p antibody or non-immune serum. For the immunoprecipitations, 5–10 μl of anti-Snu114p antisera were coupled to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose in 500 μl of buffer NET2–150 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) for 1.5 h at 4 °C and subsequently washed with three times 1 ml of NET2–150. The cross-linked samples or splicing extracts (400 μg of total proteins, see Figs. 3C and 5A) were added together with 500 μl of NET2–150 buffer to the washed beads, and Snu114p was precipitated from the reactions for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed four times with 1.5 ml of NET2–150 and precipitated proteins were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1, v/v). After acetone precipitation, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and cross-linked proteins were detected by autoradiography.Fig. 5Strains containing the D271N and R487E snu114p mutants lead to low levels of U5 and U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP particles when grown at high temperatures. A, immunoprecipitation of U5 and tri-snRNP particles obtained from wild-type, D271N, and R487E strains grown at 30 or 25 °C, respectively. Extracts (400 μg) were used in immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-Snu114p antibodies (lanes 1–6), anti-Prp8p antibodies (lanes 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, and 15) or non-immune serum (lanes 7, 10, and 13). After immunoprecipitation the reactions were washed with different salt concentrations, and the RNA content of the precipitates was analyzed by Northern blotting. The bands were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. B, wild-type, D271N, and R487E extracts (2.5 mg) obtained from the corresponding strains grown at 30 or 25 °C were sedimented on a 10–30% glycerol gradient. The fractions were phenol-chloroform-extracted, and their snRNA content was analyzed by Northern blotting using U4, U5, and U6 snRNA probes or U1 and U2 snRNA probes (see D). C, Western blot of the gradient fractions from wild-type and D271N extracts using anti-Snu114p antibodies. The Western blot of the gradient fractions obtained from the R487E mutant extract showed very low levels of protein, and it is not shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Splicing Extracts, in Vitro and in Vivo Splicing, Temperature Inactivation, and Complementation Assays—Splicing extracts of YPF36 (11Bartels C. Klatt C. Lührmann R. Fabrizio P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), YPF37, YPF39, and YCK13 were prepared by grinding frozen cells under liquid nitrogen (20Umen J.G. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For extract preparation the cells were grown at 25 or 30 °C. In vitro splicing reactions were performed as described previously (21Lin R.J. Newman A.J. Cheng S.C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14780-14792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), generally using actin pre-mRNA transcribed in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. For in vitro thermal inactivation according to Ref. 8Xie J. Beickman K. Otte E. Rymond B.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2938-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, the prepared extracts were incubated in 120 mm KPO4 at 37 °C for the times indicated prior to the splicing reaction. When time-dependent measurements were made, the samples taken at each time point were placed on ice until the splicing reaction was initiated. As a control, the extract was incubated in 120 mm KPO4 on ice for the whole period of heat treatment. The splicing reactions after thermal inactivation were performed under standard splicing conditions (60 mm KPO4, 3% polyethylene glycol 8000, 2 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm spermidine). Complementation was achieved by mixing equal volumes of the two thermally inactivated extracts before the splicing reaction was carried out. In the experiment shown in the left panel of Fig. 3B, thermal inactivation was performed by directly incubating the splicing reaction at 32 °C instead of at 25 °C. In vivo accumulation of unspliced pre-U3A and pre-U3B RNA transcripts was measured by primer extension as described previously (10Fabrizio P. Laggerbauer B. Lauber J. Lane W.S. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4092-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).Affinity Purification of Spliceosomes—For affinity purification of spliceosomes, actin pre-mRNA was transcribed in the presence of biotin-16-UTP (Roche Applied Science) with a UTP/biotin-16-UTP ratio of 20:1 (22Grabowski P.J. Sharp P.A. Science. 1986; 233: 1294-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Standard splicing reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 40 μl of extract and 270 fmol of biotinylated actin pre-mRNA. After incubation for 25 min at 32 °C, ATP was depleted by adding 4 mm glucose and incubating the samples for an additional 10 min. Subsequently, samples were added, together with 500 μl of NET2-75, to 25 μl of washed streptavidin beads (Roche Applied Science) in siliconized tubes. For affinity purification, the samples were rotated for 90 min at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed extensively with NET2-75, and 25 μl of 1× splicing buffer was added together with the indicated concentrations of different nucleotides. Subsequently, the samples were incubated for 25 min at 25 °C, and the precipitates were washed another three times with NET2-75. The precipitates were treated with proteinase K and extracted with phenol/chloroform. The RNAs were ethanol-precipitated and separated on a 10% denaturing gel. The gels were then blotted onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), which was UV-irradiated at 120 mJ/cm2. Northern analyses with uniformly radiolabeled DNA probes specific for snRNAs U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 was performed.RESULTSBinding of GTP by Snu114p—Because Snu114p exhibits the same domain structure as the ribosomal GTPase EF-2, including the GTP-binding and -hydrolyzing G domain (10Fabrizio P. Laggerbauer B. Lauber J. Lane W.S. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4092-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we asked whether GTP is required for Snu114p function in splicing. First, we investigated whether Snu114p binds GTP. It was previously shown that the human homologue of Snu114p, the U5–116K protein, binds GTP when it is a part of the U5 snRNP (10Fabrizio P. Laggerbauer B. Lauber J. Lane W.S. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4092-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), but until now it was unclear whether the yeast protein Snu114p binds GTP independently of the other proteins and RNA present in the U5 snRNP complex. To address this question, we overexpressed Snu114p in yeast and purified it from the extract in two steps, nickel-agarose chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1A).Fig. 1Purified Snu114p binds GTP specifically. A, SDS-PAGE of purified Snu114p, which was overexpressed in yeast and purified via Ni-NTA chromatography (Ni2+, lane 1) and size-exclusion chromatography (gel filtration, lane 2). For visualization the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. The position of Snu114p is indicated with an arrow. The purity of the protein preparation was checked by mass spectrometry, which confirmed that Snu114p is 90–95% pure. The asterisk indicates a frequently detected contamination (alcohol dehydrogenase-1-P). In addition, traces of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, cyclin-dependent protein kinase 33, and alkaline phosphatase 8 were found. B, binding of GTP to purified Snu114p. Snu114p was incubated with radioactively labeled GTP (lanes 1–12) or ATP (lane 13) in the absence or presence of 10× (66 pmol), 25× (165 pmol), and 50× (330 pmol) excess of unlabeled nucleotides. After cross-linking Snu114p was immunoprecipitated with anti-Snu114p antibody (lanes 1–10, 12, and 13) or non-immune serum (lane 11). The precipitates were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE and radioactive Snu114p (cross-linked to GTP or ATP) was detected by autoradiography. The lines indicate degradation products of Snu114p.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 1B shows that [α-32P]GTP cross-links to purified Snu114p after UV irradiation (lanes 1 and 2, 6–10, and 12). Radiolabeled Snu114p, cross-linked to GTP, can be specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-Snu114p antibodies (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–10 and 12) but not with the non-immune serum (lane 11). The observed cross-link is stimulated, as in the case of the human U5 snRNP (10Fabrizio P. Laggerbauer B. Lauber J. Lane W.S. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4092-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), in the presence of poly(U) (compare lane 2 with lane 1). To determine the specificity of the cross-link obtained with labeled GTP, we performed competition experiments by adding an excess of unlabeled NTPs. Fig. 1B (lanes 3–5) shows that the [α-32P]GTP cross-linked to Snu114p can be competitively displaced by a 10-, 25-, and 50-fold excess of unlabeled GTP, but not by unlabeled ATP (lanes 6–8) or CTP or UTP (lanes 9 and 10). This result suggests that purified Snu114p has very high affinity for GTP only.Some [α-32P]ATP also became cross-linked to Snu114p, although to a lesser extent, corresponding to about 5% or less of the cross-linked [α-32P]GTP (Fig. 1B, lane 13). This cross-link could reflect a low affinity of Snu114p for ATP. Preliminary results indicate that this cross-link to ATP is prevented by competition from all of the unlabeled NTPs used, suggesting that Snu114p has unspecific affinity for ATP (data not shown).Mutagenesis of the G Domain of Snu114p—The finding that Snu114p indeed binds GTP in a highly specific manner (see above) and that a point mutation in Snu114p G domain leads to a lethal phenotype (10Fabrizio P. Laggerbauer B. Lauber J. Lane W.S. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4092-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), raised the intriguing question whether Snu114p hydrolyzes GTP, in analogy to the ribosomal translocases, during its function in splicing.Up to now GTP has never been reported as an essential cofactor for splicing. This could, however, be due to the fact that GTP is already available in the extract, or to the complexity of the splicing process. The non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP, GTPγS, is not suitable to clarify this question, because it can inhibit splicing by binding not only to Snu114p but also to any of the numerous RNA unwindases that are involved in the splicing process and that are known to bind and hydrolyze promiscuously several of the NTPs (23Wang Y. Wagner J.D. Guthrie C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).To address the complex question of GTP requirement in splicing, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of Snu114p G domain. This mutagenesis revealed that the G domai"
https://openalex.org/W2006759162,"We have previously shown that interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2) is acetylated by p300 and PCAF in vivo and in vitro. In this study we identified, by mass spectrometry, two lysine residues in the DNA binding domain (DBD), Lys-75 and Lys-78, to be the major acetylation sites in IRF-2. Although acetylation of IRF-2 did not alter DNA binding activity in vitro, mutation of Lys-75 diminished the IRF-2-dependent activation of histone H4 promoter activity. Acetylation of IRF-2 and IRF-2-stimulated H4 promoter activity were inhibited by the adenovirus E1A, indicating the involvement of p300/CBP. Mutation of Lys-78, a residue conserved throughout the IRF family members, led to the abrogation of DNA binding activity independently of acetylation. H4 is transcribed only in rapidly growing cells and its promoter activity is dependent on cell growth. Consistent with a role for acetylated IRF-2 in cell growth control, IRF-2 was acetylated only in growing NIH 3T3 cells, but not in growth-arrested counterparts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that IRF-2 interacted with p300 and bound to the endogenous H4 promoter only in growing cells, although the levels of total IRF-2 were comparable in both growing and growth-arrested cells. These results indicate that IRF-2 is acetylated in a cell growth-dependent manner, which enables it to contribute to transcription of cell growth-regulated promoters.

The IRF (interferon regulatory factor) family of transcription factors has been extensively studied in the context of host defense and oncogenesis. Members of this family have extensive homology within their DNA binding domain. By binding to the common target DNA, ISRE, and IRF proteins regulate transcription of interferon and interferon-inducible genes. Some IRF proteins interact with other transcription factors such as TFIIB, coactivators p300 and PCAF (29Wang I.-M. Blanco J.C.G. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Ozato K. Mol. Cell.

IRF-2 has generally been described as a transcriptional repressor, and it is thought to function by competing with the transcriptional activator IRF-1. However, IRF-2 can act as a positive regulator for ISRE-like sequences including the H4 promoter (34Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. Van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), VCAM promoter (35Jesse T.L. Lachance R. Iademarco M.F. Dean D.C. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23445-23451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hence, IRF-2 is similar to factors such as YY1, RAP-1, Dorsal, and Kruppel, which exhibit both transcriptional activating and repressing activities (37Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Biologically, IRF-2 plays an important role in cell growth regulation, and has been shown to be a potential oncogene, as overexpression of IRF-2 causes anchorage-independent growth in NIH 3T3 cells and tumor formation in mice (38Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We previously reported that IRF-2 in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated U937 cells is complexed with p300, as well as PCAF, and is itself acetylated (39Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, recombinant IRF-2 was acetylated by p300, and to a lesser degree by PCAF, in vitro (39Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), providing the first example of acetylation in the family. Since then, additional IRF members, IRF-3 and IRF-7, were shown to be acetylated in vivo and in vitro (40Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22304-22313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 41Caillaud A. Prakash A. Smith E. Masumi A. Hovanessian A.G. Levy D.E. Marie I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49417-49421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In a previous paper (39Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we documented that acetylation of IRF-2 does not alter its DNA binding activity, although acetylation increases DNA binding activity and transcription for some transcription factors. However, acetylation of IRF-2 led to inhibition of histone acetylation by p300, suggesting a possible mechanism for transcriptional repression by IRF-2. In this paper, we identified two lysine residues located in the IRF-2 DNA binding domain that are acetylated. We show that one residue, Lys-75 is important for the interaction with p300 and the stimulation of histone H4 promoter activity. Histone H4 is transcribed during cell replication, where IRF-2 functions as an activator (42Vaughan P.S. van der Meijden C.M. Aziz F. Harada H. Taniguchi T. van W.A. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Providing further evidence of the biological significance of IRF-2 acetylation, we show that IRF-2 is acetylated only in rapidly growing NIH 3T3 cells but not in growth-arrested cells, although IRF-2 is expressed at a similar level in both type of cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that acetylated IRF-2 forms a complex and binds to the endogenous H4 promoter. Together, IRF-2 is acetylated by p300 in NIH 3T3 cells in a cell growth-dependent manner, enabling it to participate in gene regulation crucial for cell growth control. Cell Culture—NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen) with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation/Western Blotting—Nuclear extracts were prepared by the methods of Dignam with modifications including the addition of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) to buffers. Immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-IRF-2 antibody as described previously (39Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The precipitates or the whole cell lysates containing equal amounts of total proteins were suspended in the SDS sample buffer with boiling, separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for 1 h. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in a PBS-T buffer (containing PBS and 0.5% Tween 20) for 1 h, incubated with anti-IRF-2 (Santa Cruz), anti-p300 (Santa Cruz), anti-acetyllysine (New England Biology), anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-histidine (Qiagen) antibodies for 1 h, and washed in PBS-T. The antigen-antibody interaction was visualized by incubation in a chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to x-ray film. Analysis of Acetylation Site—Ten micrograms of GST-IRF-2 DBD was incubated with 1 μg of rp300 or rPCAF at 30 °C for 2 h in 60 μl of acetyltransferase reaction buffer (39Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated with 10 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h to cleave the GST region and IRF-2DBD was purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (phenyl-5WRP). Purified GST-IRF-2 (∼4 μg) was incubated with 100 ng of endopeptidase Lys-C (Roche Diagnostics) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 8 m urea for 16 h at 37 °C. Acetylated peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry (high performance liquid chromatography ESI-MS). Plasmid Constructs and Transient Transfection—GST-IRF-2DBD (amino acids 1–129) and GST-IRF-2ΔDBD (amino acids 86–349) were generated by cloning a PCR-amplified fragment into pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences). To make the IRF-2DBD mutant, a mutated oligonucleotide was produced by PCR and inserted into pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences) at the BamHI and SmaI sites. GST-IRF-2DBD mutant proteins were synthesized in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (39Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To make full-length IRF-2 mutants, wild type IRF-2 was point mutated by changing to the oligonucleotide produced by PCR to produce an IRF-2KR pcDNA3.1 mutant. Adenovirus E1A and E1AΔN plasmids were kindly provided from Dr. Y. Nakatani (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). For H4 reporter analysis, wild type IRF-2pcDNA3.1 or IRF-2KRpcDNA3.1 mutants were co-transfected into NIH 3T3 cells with H4 reporter (30Masumi A. Wang I.-M. Lefebvre B. Yang X.-J. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) by LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen), and luciferase activity was analyzed 24 h after transfection. For transient transfection of 293T cells, IRF-2pcDNA3.1, E1A, and E1AΔN were cotransfected by FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics). Synthesis and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—FLAG-tagged human PCAF was purified in Sf9 cells by using a baculovirus expression system and purified as previously described (30Masumi A. Wang I.-M. Lefebvre B. Yang X.-J. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). His6-tagged human p300 baculovirus were kindly gifted from Dr. Kraus and Dr. Ito (22Ito T. Ikehara T. Nakagawa T. Kraus W.L. Muramatsu M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1899-1907PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro translatable products from plasmids were made using a rabbit reticulocyte tnt assay kit (Promega) as described previously (30Masumi A. Wang I.-M. Lefebvre B. Yang X.-J. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In Vitro Acetylation Assays—Substrate proteins (GST-IRF-2DBD) (200 ng) were incubated with 100 ng of recombinant p300 or PCAF in 20 μl of acetylation buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm sodium butyrate with 10 μm acetyl-CoA (Sigma) or [14C]acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The reactions were analyzed first by Western blotting with an anti-acetyllysine antibody to evaluate acetylation activity, and the same gel was subsequently subjected to immunoblot with an anti-GST antibody to verify the amounts of proteins used in each reaction. Radiolabeled reactions were analyzed by autoradiography after staining by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. FLAG-Pull Down Assay—Cell lysates from 293T transfectants were incubated with M2-agarose (Sigma) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin and washed three times. Bound materials were eluted in an SDS sample buffer, resolved on an SDS-12.5% PAGE, detected by Western blotting. Affinity DNA Binding Assay and Electromobility Shift Assay—The DNA affinity binding assay was performed as described (30Masumi A. Wang I.-M. Lefebvre B. Yang X.-J. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 39Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts (500 μg of protein) were incubated with magnetic beads conjugated to biotinylated oligonucleotide from the H4 gene (34Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. Van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Bound materials were immunoblotted with anti-IRF-2 and anti-acetyllysine antibodies. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using a 32P-labeled H4 promoter oligonucleotide (34Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. Van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) made by T4 kinase (Promaga). In vitro translated products were incubated with a reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA) in the presence of a labeled probe. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from the free probe by gel electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels in a 0.5 × TBE buffer. The gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was performed essentially as described (16Kuo M.-H. Allis D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A total 3 × 107 NIH 3T3 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) plus a protein inhibitor mixture (Sigma), incubated on ice for 10 min, and sonicated to an average size of 500 bp by an ultrasonic cell disruptor (MISONIX, MICROSON™). One hundred-μl aliquots of sonicated chromatin were diluted in 1 ml of buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) and precleared with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and protein G-Sepharose (Invitrogen) (50 μl of 50% slurry in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with no antibody, anti-IRF-2 (C-19: Santa Cruz sc-498), or rabbit IgG (Sigma). A 50-μl aliquot of protein G-Sepharose, and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA were added to each immunoprecipitation and incubated for 1 h. Precipitates were washed sequentially for 10 min in a 1× washing buffer I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), 2× washing buffer II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl), 1× washing buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and 2× TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA). Samples were extracted twice with 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3), heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-links, and DNA fragments were purified with a QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). A 5-μl aliquot from a total of 40 μl was used in the PCR. Primers used in PCR were the H4 promoter (5′-AAGAAAAACAGGAAGATGATGCAA; 3′-AGCTAATGTAATCTGAAACACCAG) and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-AGAACATCATCCCTGCCTCTACTG; 3′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC). Input DNAs were diluted 1:100. The PCR products were amplified for 35 cycles, which was established as the linear range of PCR. Lys-75 and Lys-78 of IRF-2 Are Major Sites of Acetylation—We previously reported that the DBD of recombinant IRF-2 is acetylated by p300 and PCAF in vitro (39Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether the DBD and C-terminal domain were acetylated to a similar degree. Bacterially expressed GST-IRF-2DBD and GST-IRF2 ΔDBD containing only the C-terminal region were incubated with recombinant PCAF or p300 in the presence of acetyl-CoA, and acetylated peptides were detected by an anti-acetyllysine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, p300 strongly acetylated DBD. Although less strongly than p300, PCAF also acetylated DBD as expected (39Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, ΔDBD did not show detectable acetylation under these conditions. The control GST also did not show acetylation either. Predominant acetylation of DBD was also observed when acetylation was assessed by 14C-acetyl-CoA uptake (data not shown). We next sought to determine individual lysine residues within the IRF-2 DBD that are acetylated by p300 and PCAF. To this end, the GST-DBD peptides were acetylated by p300 and PCAF in vitro, digested by endopeptidase Lys-C, and the resultant peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis to identify acetylated peptides. We found that peptide 1 and peptide 2 in Fig. 1B were clearly modified by acetylation among other peptides. Peptide 1 covers amino acids 26–32, containing three lysines, Lys-29, Lys-31, Lys-32, whereas peptide 2 encompasses amino acids 65–78 containing Lys-71, Lys-75, and Lys-78. To further assess major acetylation sites within these regions, mutant DBDs were constructed in which each of the Lys residues was changed to arginine. These mutants were acetylated in vitro by p300 and PCAF, and the levels of acetylation were assessed by immunoblot with an anti-acetyllysine antibody. Wild type IRF-2DBD was intensely acetylated both by p300 and PCAF (Fig. 1C). Mutants K29R, K31R, K32R, and K71R were also acetylated, although slightly less than the wild type DBD. However, levels of acetylation were markedly reduced for K75R, observed both by PCAF and p300. In addition, acetylation by PCAF was significantly reduced for K78R, although the reduction was less significant when tested with p300 (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that Lys-75 is the major site of acetylation by p300 and PCAF, whereas Lys-78 is also acetylated by PCAF, albeit to a lesser degree. The lysine residue at 75 is shared between IRF-1 and IRF-2, but not in other IRF family members. Lys-78 is a residue conserved in all IRF family proteins, and is critical for ISRE binding activity (41Caillaud A. Prakash A. Smith E. Masumi A. Hovanessian A.G. Levy D.E. Marie I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49417-49421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, although mass spectrometry found other Lys residues (Lys-29, Lys-31, and Lys-32) to be acetylated, the overall acetylation level of these residues appear much less extensive. Having identified Lys-75 and Lys-78 as the main sites of IRF-2 acetylation in vitro, it was important to determine whether these Lys residues were acetylated in vivo. FLAG-tagged wild type IRF-2 as well as FLAG-tagged, full-length IRF-2 mutants K75R and K78R were transfected into 293T cells. Extracts were precipitated by an anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by immunoblot with an anti-acetyllysine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D, the anti-acetyllysine antibody gave much stronger signals for wild type IRF-2 than the K75R and K78R point mutants and K75R,K78R double mutants. Acetylation of K75R,K78R double mutants was decreased further compared with each point mutant. Immunoblot with the anti-FLAG antibody verified that the four IRF-2 were expressed at comparable levels. These results verify that Lys-75 and Lys-78 are acetylated in vivo. The Acetylation Mutant K75R Fails to Stimulate H4 Promoter Activity—We previously showed that acetylation of IRF-2 does not alter DNA binding activity (39Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here, we tested whether the substitution of Lys to Arg in amino acid positions 75 or 78 affected DNA binding activity. In vitro transcribedtranslated mutants K75R and K78R were tested in gel mobility shift assays using the ISRE of the histone H4 promoter as a probe (Fig. 2A). The K75R mutant bound to the ISRE as well as the wild type IRF-2. In contrast, the K78R mutant failed to bind to the DNA. Lysine at 78 is conserved throughout the IRF family and is directly involved in DNA binding (43Escalante C.R. Yie J. Thanos D. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and the mutation of this residue likely impaired a structure/conformation required for DNA binding, because mutation of the homologous residue in several IRF family proteins abolishes DNA binding activity (41Caillaud A.

IRF-2 acts as an activator or repressor depending on the promoter context. IRF-2 functions as an activator for the H4 gene promoter in NIH 3T3 cells (34Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. Van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To examine whether the mutation of Lys-75 or Lys-78 influences the ability of IRF-2 to activate H4 promoter activity, transfection assays were performed using vectors for K75R and K78R mutants and a H4-luciferase reporter. Results obtained with NIH 3T3 cells are shown in Fig. 2B. As expected, transfection of wild type IRF-2 enhanced the H4 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. However, the K75R mutant only modestly enhanced promoter activity, reaching ∼50% of the enhancement seen by wild type IRF-2. The K78R mutant that did not bind to the target DNA, did not enhance th"

In this study, we examined the control of hepatocyte proliferation by amino acids and protein intake. In short-term culture, hepatocytes demonstrated normal entry into S phase and cell cycle protein expression in the absence of essential amino acids. However, deprivation of a set of nonessential amino acids (NEAA) potently inhibited cell cycle progression and selectively down-regulated the expression of proliferation-control proteins. Notably, NEAA withdrawal after the mitogen restriction point still inhibited entry into S phase, suggesting that these amino acids regulate a distinct checkpoint. Cyclin D1, an important mediator of hepatocyte proliferation, was markedly inhibited at the transcriptional level by NEAA deprivation, and transfection with cyclin D1 (but not cyclin E) overcame the cell cycle arrest. As previously shown, protein-deprived mice demonstrated impaired hepatocyte proliferation in vivo after 70% partial hepatectomy. The expression of cyclin D1 and downstream cell cycle proteins after partial hepatectomy was inhibited in these mice. Transfection with cyclin D1 in vivo triggered hepatocyte DNA synthesis and the expression of S phase proteins in the absence of dietary protein. Cyclin D1 also induced global protein synthesis in NEAA-deprived hepatocytes and promoted liver growth in vivo in the setting of protein deprivation. These results indicate that cyclin D1 is a key target of amino acid signaling in hepatocytes. The mechanisms by which amino acids regulate the cell cycle are not well characterized.

In addition to providing the substrates for protein synthesis, amino acids serve as regulatory molecules that modulate numerous cellular functions (1Reeds P.J. Biolo G. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2002; 5: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It has long been recognized that the availability of amino acids controls growth and proliferation in cell culture systems, but the mechanisms have not been well defined (2Malumbres M. Barbacid M.

A substantial body of literature indicates that amino acids regulate overall protein synthesis, an essential component of growth and proliferation, through several pathways that control the translational apparatus (4Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 5Kimball S.R. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the downstream elements that link amino acids to the cell cycle remain to be determined. In yeast systems, nutrient insufficiency inhibits the expression of G1 cyclins, which are required for normal entry into S phase (6Parviz F. Hall D.D. Markwardt D.D. Heideman W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4508-4515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Parviz F. Heideman W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 225-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Prober D.A. Edgar B.A. Curr. Opin. Genet.

However, a similar mechanism has not been clearly established in mammalian cells. In the normal adult liver, hepatocytes rarely replicate, but these cells rapidly enter the cell cycle following injuries that reduce functional liver mass (10Fausto N. Liver Transpl. 2001; 7: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte proliferation is an important component of the adaptive response to liver diseases. In the best-studied model of hepatocyte proliferation in vivo, that of 70% partial hepatectomy (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PH, partial hepatectomy; cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EAA, essential amino acids; NEAA, nonessential amino acids; CHOP, c/EBP homologous protein; TOR, target of rapamycin; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor. in rodents, most of the remaining hepatocytes enter the cell cycle in a relatively synchronous manner, and liver mass is restored within 1–2 weeks. In addition, primary hepatocytes in short-term culture proliferate readily in response to appropriate mitogens. Thus the hepatocyte culture and PH models offer excellent systems to study proliferation of normal parenchymal cells. Older studies (11Holecek M. Nutrition. 1999; 15: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Diehl A.M. Semin. Liver Dis. 1991; 11: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have shown that amino acid withdrawal inhibits hepatocyte proliferation in culture, and protein deprivation impairs liver regeneration after PH. However, these previous studies did not identify potential intracellular mediators of this antiproliferative response. Cell cycle progression is controlled by protein kinase complexes consisting of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), and associated regulatory proteins (reviewed in Refs. 2Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar and 3Sears R.C. Nevins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11617-11620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). During G1 phase, mitogens up-regulate expression of the d-type cyclins, which bind cdk4 and cdk6 to form active kinases that phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and the related proteins p107 and p130. This is followed by activation of cyclin E/cdk2 in late G1 phase, which phosphorylates Rb at different sites. The combined phosphorylation of Rb leads to derepression of E2F transcription factors, which promote entry into S phase. Phosphorylation of Rb may represent the biochemical basis of the mitogen restriction point in late G1 phase, when the cell no longer requires mitogens to complete the cell cycle. Antiproliferative signals impact on cyclin/cdk activity through several mechanisms, including decreased cyclin expression, changes in cdk phosphorylation, and induction of cdk inhibitory proteins. Previous studies have suggested that cyclin D1 plays an important role in hepatocyte proliferation (10Fausto N. Liver Transpl. 2001; 7: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Loyer P.

In the current study, we examined whether this protein might also be a target of amino acid-dependent signaling. Our results suggest that cyclin D1 is significantly regulated by selective amino acid withdrawal in culture and dietary protein deprivation in vivo. Furthermore, cyclin D1 expression induced growth and proliferation in the absence of normal amino acids or dietary protein. The results suggest that in mammalian cells, cyclin D1 regulates cell cycle progression in response to nutrients, similar to the previously characterized response in yeast. Hepatocyte Culture—Primary rat hepatocytes were harvested and plated on collagen film in the presence or absence of EGF (10 ng/ml) and insulin (20 milliunits/ml) as previously described (14Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were cultured in minimal essential medium (SelectAmine MEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with the following (in mm): cupric sulfate 4 × 10–7, ferric sulfate 2.5 × 10–7, manganese sulfate 5 × 10–7, sodium bicarbonate 26.2, glutathione (reduced) 1.63 × 10–4, methyl linoleate 1.02 × 10–4, HEPES 20, dexamethasone 5 × 10–6, ascorbic acid 1 × 10–4, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml), and minimal essential medium vitamin solution (1×) (Invitrogen). The final glucose concentration was 11.1 mm. Rapamycin was added at a concentration of 10 nm as previously described (17Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Tucker M.M. Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Biol.

Kits containing amino acid mixtures were obtained from Invitrogen and used as previously described (18Xu G. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol.

The minimal essential medium amino acids solution, which is referred to as the “essential amino acids (EAA)” mixture in this report, was used in all cell culture experiments (except as indicated in Fig. 1, A and C) at the 1× concentration (in mm): l-arginine 0.29, l-cystine 0.331, l-histidine·HCL·H2O 0.0967, l-isoleucine 0.382, l-leucine 0.573, l-lysine HCl 0.478, l-methionine 0.101, l-phenylalanine 0.152, l-threonine 0.336, l-tryptophen 0.049, l-tyrosine 0.0194, and l-valine 0.427.

Western and Northern Blot Analysis—Liver tissue and hepatocyte harvest, Western blots, and Northern blot analysis were performed as previously described (14Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Albrecht J.H. Poon R.Y. Ahonen C.L. Rieland B.M. Deng C. Crary G.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2141-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The antibody to CHOP was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cyclin D1 Promoter-luciferase Assays—The –1745 CD1LUC plasmid containing the human cyclin D1 promoter was previously described (21Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). At 48 h after plating, hepatocytes on 35 mm-dishes were transfected in triplicate with 1 μg/ml of the –1745 CD1LUC (firefly) plasmid and the 1 μg/ml pRL-null (Renilla control) plasmid (Promega) using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. At 72 h after plating, cells were harvested following the instructions included in the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luminescence assays were performed using an EG&G Berthold 9507 luminometer. Firefly luciferase was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Animals—Male BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley. At 8 weeks of age, PH or adenovirus-mediated transfection was performed as previously outlined (16Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G.

Rapamycin (or Me2SO vehicle alone) was administered at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day beginning 2 h prior to PH as previously described (17Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Tucker M.M. Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J.

Liver harvest, BrdUrd immunohistochemistry, and tissue homogenization were performed as described elsewhere (19Nelsen C.J. Hansen L.K. Rickheim D.G. Chen C. Stanley M.K. Krek W. Albrecht J.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1825-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Figs. 6 and 8, mice were either provided normal laboratory chow and water ad libitum or provided only 10% dextrose in the drinking water beginning 24 h prior to PH or adenovirus injection (22Mead J.E. Braun L. Martin D.A. Fausto N. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7023-7030PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 7, the protein-deprived mice were provided a protein-free chow (Teklad) beginning 24 h before PH. The daily amount of food intake was recorded every 24 h. The protein-fed mice received an isocaloric chow containing 18% casein (Teklad). For each 24 h period, the protein-fed mice received an amount of chow equal to the average intake of the protein-deprived group, divided in three equal doses.Fig. 8Cyclin D1 induces hepatocyte proliferation and liver growth in nutrient-deprived mice.

One mixture contained 12 amino acids, including those that are essential for human adults (EAA). In addition, we used a mixture of seven other nonessential amino acids (NEAA). These kits do not include glutamine, which was added to all experiments. We examined mitogen-stimulated primary rat hepatocytes in culture, which is a well established model of hepatocyte proliferation (10Fausto N. Liver Transpl. 2001; 7: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When cultured in the presence of EGF and insulin, these cells demonstrate a relatively long G1 phase of about 48 h and undergo peak DNA synthesis (S phase) at 72 h (13Loyer P. Cariou S. Glaise D. Bilodeau M. Baffet G. Guguen-Guillouzo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11484-11492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, in these short-term experiments omission of EAA had little effect on hepatocyte proliferation as measured by DNA synthesis at 72 h or on the expression of cell cycle proteins (Fig. 1). On the other hand, omission of NEAA markedly inhibited DNA synthesis and selectively down-regulated the expression of cell cycle proteins, including cyclin D1. Previous studies have found that cyclin E, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and p21 are induced downstream of cyclin D1 in hepatocytes (14Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Timchenko N.A. Stanley M.W. Albrecht J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8564-8568PubMed Google Scholar), and these proteins were down-regulated in response to NEAA deprivation. CHOP, a stress response protein which is up-regulated in response to amino acid deprivation (4Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), was induced in the absence of NEAA. Addition of twice the normal concentration of EAA did not overcome the cell cycle arrest induced by NEAA deprivation (data not shown), suggesting that a lack of calories or overall amino acid load was not responsible for the effect. These studies indicate that selective amino acid deprivation inhibits cyclin D1 expression and cell cycle progression in hepatocytes. We then used the NEAA deprivation conditions to further examine the role and regulation of cyclin D1 in this response. NEAA Regulate a Distinct Cell Cycle Checkpoint—Studies in other systems (23Hidalgo M. Rowinsky E.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6680-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 24Volarevic S. Thomas G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 101-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that amino acid availability regulates the activity of the target of rapamycin (TOR) protein, which modulates cell cycle progression and protein synthesis in many types of cells, including hepatocytes. We have recently found that cyclin D1 is a key rapamycin-dependent mediator of proliferation in hepatocytes (17Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Tucker M.M. Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3656-3663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To examine whether inhibition of TOR with rapamycin and NEAA withdrawal had similar effects, we evaluated phosphorylation of the S6 protein, which is regulated by TOR (24Volarevic S. Thomas G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 101-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As previously shown, rapamycin treatment inhibited S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D) (17Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Tucker M.M. Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3656-3663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 25Boylan J.M. Anand P. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44457-44463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As noted in other systems (26Saitoh M. Pullen N. Brennan P. Cantrell D. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20104-20112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), rapamycin also diminished the expression of total S6 protein. NEAA deprivation also inhibited S6 phosphorylation, although not as completely as rapamycin treatment. This suggests that NEAA may regulate hepatocyte proliferation in part through TOR. However, as shown below, NEAA withdrawal and rapamycin treatment have distinct effects on cyclin D1 expression and hepatocyte cell cycle progression. Previous studies have shown that mitogen-stimulated rat hepatocytes progress through the G1 restriction point at ∼40 – 44 h after plating, which corresponds with induction of cyclin D1 (13Loyer P. Cariou S. Glaise D. Bilodeau M. Baffet G. Guguen-Guillouzo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11484-11492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 2A, we confirmed that withdrawal of EGF/insulin after the restriction point (i.e. at 48 h) did not significantly alter DNA synthesis or cyclin D1 expression at 72 h. However, withdrawal of NEAA at 48 h potently inhibited DNA synthesis and cyclin D1 expression at 72 h. We have previously shown that addition of rapamycin did not inhibit cell cycle progression if added after the restriction point (17Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Tucker M.M. Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3656-3663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); as is shown in Fig. 2B, addition of rapamycin at 48 h did not substantially inhibit either DNA synthesis or the expression of cyclin D1 at 72 h. These data suggest that NEAA regulate a cell cycle checkpoint that is distinct from the mitogen restriction point and that rapamycin treatment and NEAA deprivation do not have equivalent effects on cell cycle progression. To further characterize the regulation of cyclin D1 by NEAA, we performed Northern blot analysis of cells cultured in the presence or absence of EGF/insulin or NEAA (Fig. 3A). Cyclin D1 mRNA was markedly down-regulated in the absence of mitogens or NEAA. In addition, the activity of a cyclin D1 promoter-luciferase reporter gene was inhibited 59% by NEAA deprivation (Fig. 3B, p < 0.007). These data suggest that NEAA regulate cyclin D1 expression, at least in part, at the level of transcription. In addition, because rapamycin inhibits hepatocyte cyclin D1 expression at the level of protein but not mRNA (17Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Tucker M.M. Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3656-3663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Hidalgo M. Rowinsky E.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6680-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), these data suggest that NEAA deprivation and rapamycin treatment regulate cyclin D1 through distinct mechanisms. Cyclin D1 Promotes Cell Cycle Progression and Protein Synthesis in NEAA-deprived Hepatocytes—To further address the question of whether cyclin D1 is the key target of NEAA-mediated signaling in hepatocytes, we transfected cells with an adenovirus encoding cyclin D1. Previous studies have demonstrated that recombinant adenoviruses readily transfect hepatocytes in culture and in vivo (14Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Timchenko N.A.

Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). We found that cyclin D1 expression was sufficient to induce DNA synthesis and the expression of downstream cell cycle proteins in the absence of NEAA (Fig. 4A). Transfection with cyclin E, on the other hand, did not promote cell cycle progression (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that cyclin D1 is the key NEAA-dependent mediator of cell cycle progression in hepatocytes. In addition to promoting proliferation, recent studies have suggested that cyclin D1 can induce cell growth, and by inference, cellular protein synthesis (2Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 8Prober D.A. Edgar B.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Tapon N. Moberg K.H. Hariharan I.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based on previous studies, we anticipated that selective amino acid withdrawal would diminish global protein synthesis (4Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 5Kimball S.R. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As expected, NEAA deprivation inhibited the mitogen-stimulated induction of hepatocyte protein synthesis (as measured by [3H]leucine incorporation into cellular proteins) by 60% (Fig. 5, p < 0.003). Transfection with cyclin D1 restored protein synthesis to a level similar to that seen in mitogen-stimulated cells in the presence of complete amino acids. These results suggest that cyclin D1 acts downstream of nutrients to induce protein synthesis under mitogenic conditions. Because enhanced protein synthesis is a requirement for cell growth (8Prober D.A. Edgar B.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Tapon N. Moberg K.H. Hariharan I.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Volarevic S. Thomas G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 101-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this further suggests that cyclin D1 plays a role in growth as well as cell cycle regulation. Protein Deprivation Inhibits Cyclin D1 Expression and Liver Regeneration in Vivo—A number of previous studies (11Holecek M. Nutrition. 1999; 15: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Diehl A.M. Semin. Liver Dis. 1991; 11: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that normal liver regeneration depends on adequate intake of dietary protein and amino acids, but the molecular events linking nutritional status and hepatocyte cell cycle progression have not been determined. To examine this further, we performed standard 70% PH in mice under conditions of protein deprivation. In normal mice after PH, a large population of hepatocytes progresses through the cell cycle in a relatively synchronous fashion, with peak DNA synthesis occurring at 36 – 42 h after the procedure (10Fausto N. Liver Transpl. 2001; 7: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Albrecht J.H. Poon R.Y. Ahonen C.L. Rieland B.M. Deng C. Crary G.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2141-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that cyclin D1 is induced in G1 phase in this model and persists for at least 72 h (20Albrecht J.H. Poon R.Y. Ahonen C.L. Rieland B.M. Deng C. Crary G.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2141-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In Fig. 6, we examined mice that were fed normal diets or provided only 10% dextrose in the drinking water (to prevent hypoglycemia), adapting a previously described model (22Mead J.E. Braun L. Martin D.A. Fausto N. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7023-7030PubMed Google Scholar). As expected (11Holecek M. Nutrition. 1999; 15: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Mead J.E. Braun L. Martin D.A. Fausto N. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7023-7030PubMed Google Scholar), hepatocyte proliferation was markedly inhibited in the nutrient-deprived mice. At 42 h after PH, hepatocyte DNA synthesis (as measured by BrdUrd immunohistochemistry) was 26.7% in the fed mice as compared with 1.2% in the mice provided only dextrose (p < 0.001). The expression of cyclin D1 was markedly down-regulated, as was the induction of proteins acting downstream in the cell cycle. The inhibition of protein expression was selective, because other proteins (e.g. p27, S6, eIF-4E, and actin) were not affected. Interestingly, nutrient deprivation did not prevent the phosphorylation of S6 after PH, whereas rapamycin was inhibitory (as previously reported, Refs. 17Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Tucker M.M.

They function as molecular recognition elements that mediate specific contact with DNA, RNA, or other proteins and are composed of a ββα fold surrounding a single zinc ion that is ligated by two cysteine and two histidine residues. In a number of variant zinc fingers, the final histidine is not conserved, and in other unrelated zinc binding domains, residues such as aspartate can function as zinc ligands. To test whether the final histidine is required for normal folding and the DNA-binding function of classical zinc fingers, we focused on finger 3 of basic Krüppel-like factor. The structure of this domain was determined using NMR spectroscopy and found to constitute a typical classical zinc finger. We generated a panel of substitution mutants at the final histidine in this finger and found that several of the mutants retained some ability to fold in the presence of zinc. Consistent with this result, we showed that mutation of the final histidine had only a modest effect on DNA binding in the context of the full three-finger DNA-binding domain of basic Krüppel-like factor. Further, the zinc binding ability of one of the point mutants was tested and found to be indistinguishable from the wild-type domain. These results suggest that the final zinc chelating histidine is not an essential feature of classical zinc fingers and have implications for zinc finger evolution, regulation, and the design of experiments testing the functional roles of these domains.

It is estimated that around 3% of all human gene products contain one or more zinc-binding domains, or zinc fingers (ZnFs). 1The abbreviations used are: ZnF, zinc finger; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BF3, BKLF-F3; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy.1The abbreviations used are: ZnF, zinc finger; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BF3, BKLF-F3; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy. These domains are defined by the presence of one or more Zn(II) ions that stabilize the folded structure of the domain. More than 20 different classes of zinc fingers have been described, and these differ in the number of Zn(II) ions bound and in the spacing and identities of the ligands. The Zn(II) ion is normally coordinated by histidine and cysteine residues, although aspartate has been reported in LIM domains (1Dawid I.B. Breen J.J. Toyama R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 156-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The most common configuration is termed the classical (CCHH or C2H2) ZnF, which has the consensus sequence Cys-X 2–4-Cys-X 12-His-X 2–6-His. Over 14,000 of these domains are predicted in current sequence data bases.The majority of classical ZnFs are found in transcription factors, and a single transcription factor may contain more than 30 ZnF domains. It is well established that many of these domains mediate specific protein-DNA interactions (2Luscombe N.M. Austin S.E. Berman H.M. Thornton J.M. Gen. Biol. 2000; 1: 001.001-001.037Crossref Google Scholar), although recent reports have also demonstrated that at least some classical ZnFs can act as protein recognition motifs (for a review, see Ref. 3Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of a number of ZnF-DNA complexes have been determined, and a great deal is understood about the roles of individual amino acids in determining DNA sequence specificity (4Wolfe S.A. Grant R.A. Elrod-Erickson M. Pabo C.O. Structure. 2001; 9: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Pabo C.O. Peisach E. Grant R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). These ZnFs bind to DNA using a tandem array of more than one ZnF (often three), where each ZnF contacts three base pairs.The identification of ZnF motifs in the ever growing number of protein sequences is based primarily on the presence of conserved cysteine or histidine residues and the spacing between them. Further, DNA binding ability is sometimes inferred when three or more contiguous classical ZnFs are identified. This ability to infer function from sequence is becoming increasingly important as the amount of available sequence data increases. Interestingly, an examination of sequence data bases reveals that there are a number of proteins that contain sequences that correspond to one or more classical ZnFs, with the exception that the final zinc-ligating residue in the last ZnF is neither cysteine nor histidine (for examples, see Fig. 1). The question therefore arises as to whether these sequences are capable of folding and forming modules that are functional even in the absence of the typical final zinc-binding residue or whether the mutation leads to proteins that can no longer fold or (for example) bind to DNA.In order to address this question, we have investigated the physical and functional properties of a panel of point mutants based on the transcriptional repressor basic Krüppel-like factor/Krüppel-like factor 3 (BKLF) (6Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). BKLF binds to DNA sequences containing CACCC motifs by means of three characteristic Krüppel-like ZnFs (Krüppel-like fingers are a subset of classical CCHH fingers with significant homology to those found in the archetypal protein Drosophila regulatory protein Krüppel). We chose to study the third or C-terminal zinc finger of BKLF (BKLF-F3, or BF3). We show that the third zinc finger is essential for high affinity DNA binding and that the final zinc-ligating histidine of BKLF-F3 can be substituted with a number of different residues without severely compromising the DNA binding ability of BKLF. Further, the mutant BF3 domains still bind Zn(II) and form substantial secondary structure, although they are clearly not as well ordered as the wild-type domain. Remarkably, the His → Asn mutant binds Zn(II) with an affinity that is essentially indistinguishable from that of the wild-type BF3.These results demonstrate that three side chains can be sufficient to bind a Zn(II) ion. Further, our data show that such domains, even when partially folded, can act in concert with other ZnFs to bind DNA. These findings further our understanding of the basic ZnF scaffold and show that attempts to identify DNA-binding ZnFs from amino acid sequence data should not necessarily exclude apparently incomplete ZnF configurations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—The region encoding zinc fingers 1–3 of BKLF (BKLF-F1–3 residues 254–344) was amplified from the murine BKLF cDNA using primers CGGGATCCACCATGGCAAGGAAGCGCAGGATAC (A19) and CGGAATTCAGACTAGCATGTGGCGTT (A866), using the original murine BKLF cDNA clone in the vector pMT2-BKLF (6Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The resulting fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into pGEX-2T to generate in-frame fusions of BF3 with glutathione S-transferase, and the plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. This plasmid also contains a thrombin cleavage site between the GST and the insert. Mutant derivatives were similarly constructed using primers related to A866 but differing in the codon corresponding to BKLF H341, the final histidine. Single finger constructs corresponding to both wild-type BF3 (residues 316–344) and BF3 mutants were similarly generated, using the 5′ primer CGGGATCCATCAAACCTTTCCAGTGTCC (A259) and the same 3′ A866 primer used above. The deletion constructs BF1-2 and BF1-3(–HMLV) were generated using the 5′ primer A19 and the 3′ primers CGGAATTCACCCAGTGTGTTTTCGGAAATG (A877) and CGGAATTCTACTAGCGTTTCCTGTGTAGGGCAA (A876). BF1-2½ was constructed by digesting the pGEX-2T-BF1-3 plasmid with HindIII and EcoRI, filling in the overhangs with Klenow, and religating. This created a stop site after Ser327. DNA sequencing was carried out in order to confirm the sequences of all constructs.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—In order to compare the effects of the point mutations, EMSAs were carried out. Reactions were set up in a total volume of 30 μl, comprising 0.1 pg of 32P-labeled probe, ∼100 ng of recombinant protein, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. The reactions used in the quantitative EMSAs further included 1 mg/ml dI-dC, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. In these reactions, 67 pm32P-labeled DNA and 0–2000 nm wild-type BF3 or 0–4500 nm mutant BF3A protein were used. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the samples were loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel made up in 0.5× TBE. The gel was then subjected to electrophoresis at 15 V/cm and 4 °C for 2 h, dried, analyzed, and quantified when necessary using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The probes used in the experiments were end-labeled according to standard procedures using polynucleotide kinase (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.59-10.61Google Scholar). The sequence was 5′-TAGAGCCACACCCTGGTAAG-3′ (only the top strand is shown). The DNA-binding affinities of the wild-type BF3 and mutant BF3A were estimated by nonlinear least squares analysis as follows. The fraction of DNA complexed to the BF1-3 proteins (f cx) was calculated by using the equation f cx = I cx/(I cx + I f), where I cx and I f are the intensities of the bands corresponding to peptide-complexed DNA and free DNA, respectively. The DNA-binding affinity, K a, was obtained by fitting the experimentally derived f cx to the equations, fcx=[D.P]Dtot(Eq. 1) and Ka=[D.P](Dtot-[D.P])(Ptot-[D.P])(Eq. 2) where [D.P] is the concentration of DNA-protein complex, D tot is the total DNA concentration, K a is the association constant, and P tot is the total protein concentration.Overexpression and Purification of BF3 and Mutants—The wild-type and mutant BF3 proteins were expressed and purified in the same manner. Luria broth was inoculated with transformed E. coli cells at 37 °C. When the A 600 reached ∼0.6, protein expression was induced with the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (0.4 mm). After 4 h, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at –20 °C prior to lysis. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) and lysed by gentle sonication. The soluble fraction, separated from the insoluble fraction by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 4 °C, 20 min), was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose beads. Unbound proteins were washed away from the beads with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0), and the beads were equilibrated with thrombin buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0). Thrombin was added, and the mixture was incubated for either 2 h at 37 °C or overnight at 25 °C. The eluted peptides were lyophilized, redissolved in water, and further purified by reversed-phase HPLC (using a gradient of 5–95% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The purified peptides were lyophilized and stored at –20 °C. The identity of each peptide was confirmed using positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry.Far UV CD Spectropolarimetry—Each HPLC-purified peptide was dissolved in a solution containing TCEP (1 mm) and ZnSO4 (1 mm) to concentrations of either 30 μm (BF3, BF3D, BF3E, and BF3N) or 12 μm (BF3A). The pH of these solutions was ∼2.0. A far UV CD spectrum of each peptide was taken, the pH was then adjusted to ∼5.5 with the addition of NaOH, and a second spectrum of each peptide was recorded. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Neslab RTE-111 temperature controller. Spectra were recorded in a 1-mm path length cell with a resolution of 0.5 nm and bandwidth of 1 nm over the wavelength range of 190–250 nm. Each spectrum represented the average of three scans accumulated at a speed of 20 nm min–1 with a response time of 1 s.For the Zn(II) titration experiments, aliquots of a solution containing ZnCl2 (13–20 mm; pH 5.5) were added to solutions of the wild-type BF3 (13 μm) and the mutant BF3N (20 μm), each containing 0.5 mm TCEP, pH 5.5. CD spectra were taken at each point in the titration, allowing 5 min for equilibration after each Zn(II) addition. Spectra were recorded over the wavelength range of 195–200 nm with a resolution of 1 nm and as the average of 50 scans. Spectra were base line-corrected by subtraction of a spectrum of TCEP/ZnSO4 buffer alone.Values of the association constant for zinc binding (K a) were determined by plotting the change in ellipticity at a single wavelength against the total Zn(II) concentration. Nonlinear least squares analysis was used to determine the Zn(II)-binding affinities, using the equations, θ=θP+[P.Zn]Ptot(θP.Zn-θP)(Eq. 3) and Ka=[P.Zn](Ptot-[P.Zn])(Zntot-[P.Zn])(Eq. 4) where θ represents the observed ellipticity, θP is the ellipticity of the apoprotein, [P.Zn] is the concentration of the protein-Zn(II) complex, P tot is the total protein concentration, θP.Zn is the ellipticity of the holoprotein, K a is the association constant for Zn(II) binding, and Zn tot is the total Zn(II) concentration. The final values of K a were obtained by averaging the values determined at 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, and 200 nm.Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using an Optima™ XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) equipped with an An-60ti rotor. BF3E (at concentrations of 8.6, 20, and 33.6 μm; all in 1 mm TCEP, 1 mm ZnSO4, pH 5.6) was centrifuged against a matched buffer at 25 °C at 30,000 and 42,000 rpm, using double sector cells. Data were collected as A 230 versus radius scans in 0.001-cm increments, and 10 scans were averaged for each data set. Base line correction was achieved by the subtraction of data recorded at 360 nm. Scans were taken at 3-h intervals and compared to ensure that the samples reached equilibrium. Analysis of the data was carried out using the NONLIN software (8Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), and the final parameters were determined by a nonlinear least squares fit of the data to a single species model. The goodness of fit was determined by examination of the residuals derived from the fit. The partial specific volume was determined from the amino acid sequence (9Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), and the solvent density was determined to be 0.997 g ml–1 using the program SEDNTERP (10Hayes D.B. Laue T. Philo J. SEDNTERP, 1.05. University of New, Durham, NHe1995Google Scholar).Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—Samples of BF3 were prepared by dissolving either 3.5 mg of 15N-labeled BF3 or 11 mg of BF3 in H2O/D2O (95:5) containing 1.5 molar equivalents of both TCEP and ZnSO4. The pH was adjusted to 5.5 using 0.1 and 0.01 m NaOH; this gave sample concentrations of 1 mm for 15N-labeled BF3 and 3 mm for BF3.For the comparison of wild-type BF3 with BF3E, both peptides were dissolved in a solution containing TCEP (1 mm) and ZnSO4 (1 mm). The pH was adjusted to 5.5, and each solution was supplemented with D2O (5%, v/v) and d 4-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid (1 μl). The final sample concentrations were 100 μm (BF3) and 85 μm (BF3E). The pH of the BF3E sample was subsequently dropped to pH ∼2 to obtain the spectrum of the unfolded protein. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance (HCN) probe and three-axis pulsed-field gradients. NMR spectra used for the comparison of BF3 and BF3E were recorded at 298 K, whereas those used for structure determination were acquired at 280 K. The solvent signal was suppressed using pulsed field gradients. One-dimensional 1H spectra consisted of 128 scans collected as 8,192 complex data points over a spectral width of 7,200 Hz. The following homonuclear two-dimensional experiments were recorded on the unlabeled BF3 sample: TOCSY (11Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) (τm = 70 ms), DQFCOSY (12Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar), and NOESY (13Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) (τm = 200 ms). Three-dimensional HNHA (14Vuister G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) and three-dimensional TOCSY-HSQC (15Marion D. Driscoll P.C. Kay L.E. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) (τm = 70 ms) experiments were used to assign the 15N,1H HSQC spectra of the 15N-labeled BF3, whereas the HNHA spectrum was used to derive 3 J HNHα coupling constants. Spectra were processed as described previously (16Kowalski K. Czolij R. King G.F. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The 1H frequency scale was referenced to d 4-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid at 0.00 ppm.Determination of the Structure of BF3—Resonance assignment was carried out using the standard homonuclear sequential assignment method (17Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Cross-peaks in the two-dimensional NOESY spectra were integrated in XEASY and converted to upper distance limits using the CALIBA module of DYANA (18Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) and the default DYANA parameters, except that an empirical correction of 0.5 Å was added to the upper distance limits involving β-methylene groups to account for spin diffusion. Dihedral angle restraints for φ angles were derived from 3 J HNHα coupling constants measured from the HNHA spectrum (14Vuister G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Residues with positive φ angles were verified using methods as described in Ref. 19Ludvigsen S. Poulsen F.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar.Initially, structure calculations were performed in DYANA, and additional NOEs were assigned iteratively based on earlier sets of structures. At this stage, structures were calculated without incorporating the Zn(II) atom. Analysis of preliminary structures established that the Nϵ2 atoms of both histidine residues were coordinating the Zn(II). This was later confirmed using a 1H-15N HMQC experiment optimized to detect J-couplings in histidine side chains (20Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In order to include additional distance and angle constraints that maintain the tetrahedral bonding geometry and appropriate bond lengths with the zinc ion (21Neuhaus D. Nakaseko Y. Schwabe J.W. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as well as to incorporate ambiguous restraints, subsequent structural refinement was performed in CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) using the package ARIA (23Nilges M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 24Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Manually assigned NOEs in combination with the remaining ambiguous NOEs were included in the ARIA structure calculations, and the latter were iteratively assigned in an automated manner.Briefly, one cycle of 200 structures was followed by seven cycles of 20 structures each and a final cycle of 1000 structures. Manually assigned NOEs were included in iteration zero as soft restraints. In each cycle, the seven lowest energy structures from the previous iteration were used to extract additional NOE restraints with a tolerance of 0.02 ppm in the F1 dimension and 0.015 ppm in the F2 dimension. If a restraint was violated by more than a predefined target value in over 50% of the seven structures, it was discarded. The violation target value was progressively reduced from 1000 Å in iteration zero to 0.1 Å in iteration eight. 18 of 782 distance restraints were discarded in the final iteration due to these violations. Ambiguous distance restraints were treated as described previously (25Nilges M. Fold Des. 1997; 2: S53-S57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the peak volume cut-off was gradually reduced from 1.01 in the first iteration to 0.80 in the last. The final assignments made by ARIA were checked and corrected manually where necessary. Calculations were carried out in the simplified all-hydrogen PARALLHDG5.2 force field with nonbonded interactions modeled by the PROLSQ force field (26Hendrickson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 252-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar); floating chirality assignment (27Folmer R.H. Hilbers C.W. Konings R.N. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was used for all methylene and isopropyl groups.Finally, the 25 lowest energy structures were subjected to water refinement using the standard water refinement protocol supplied by ARIA1.2 (28Linge J.P. Williams M.A. Spronk C.A. Bonvin A.M. Nilges M. Proteins. 2003; 50: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The structures were immersed in a 7-Å shell of water molecules and were subjected to a short molecular dynamics simulation taking into account the Lennard-Jones, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions and based on a slightly modified OPLS force field (29Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These water-refined structures were visualized and analyzed using the programs MOLMOL (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6469) Google Scholar), PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar), and WhatIf (32Vriend G. Sander C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 47-60Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The coordinates of BKLF-F3 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 1P7A.Atomic Absorption Spectrometry—BF3 and BF3D samples used in far UV CD analyses were dialyzed against sodium acetate buffer (10 mm, pH 5.4) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, in order to remove excess Zn(II). The resulting samples were rechecked by CD to confirm that they had remained folded. The Zn(II) content of BF3 (26 μm) and BF3D (19 μm) samples were determined on a Varian SpectrAA 10/20 flame emission spectrometer at 213.9 nm. Concentrations were determined by reference to a standard curve constructed using atomic absorption standard zinc(II) solution (1000 mg/liter in 0.5 mol/liter nitric acid; BDH), diluted with Milli-Q® water to final concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/liter.RESULTSMany Variants of CCHH Zinc Fingers Exist—A search of the Pfam data base (available on the World Wide Web at pfam.wustl.edu/) using the search pattern X 2-C-X 1–5-C-X 12-H-X 3–6-(H/C) reveals 20,646 protein domains classified as CCHH zinc fingers (as of March 10, 2003). Within this set, ∼250 domains actually contain a cysteine in place of the final histidine residue. It was demonstrated recently that variant domains of this type could form stable folded structures that closely resemble other classical CCHH zinc fingers (33Liew C.K. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Newton A. Sharpe B.K. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Structure. 2000; 8: 1157-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More unusual are the 82 sequences that lack either a cysteine or a histidine in the corresponding position (position 23 in Fig. 1A). Of these, 10 sequences, however, do exhibit a cysteine or histidine residue at position 20, 21, or 22 (Fig. 1A), and it is conceivable that this residue acts as the fourth zinc ligand. 71 of the remaining 72 sequences (with the exception of HKR2; Fig. 1A) contain neither cysteine nor histidine in any of the positions 20–28. Interestingly, a number of these CCHX variants appear to be located at the C-terminal end of an array of CCHH fingers.Given the dogma that four ligating amino acid side chains are required for the formation of a classical zinc finger structure, the existence of these variants led us to ask whether such sequences can form functional zinc finger domains, or if instead they represent vestigial domains that no longer play a role in the function of the parent protein.CCHX Mutants of BKLF Bind to DNA—In order to address this question, we made a series of single site mutations in the zinc finger region of the transcriptional repressor BKLF (6Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). At its C terminus, BKLF has three contiguous CCHH fingers (Fig. 1B); this three-finger array binds with high affinity and specificity to oligonucleotides containing the sequence CACCC (6Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We generated a fusion protein encompassing the three fingers of murine BKLF (BKLF-F1–3 residues 254–344) C-terminal to glutathione S-transferase (GST). Six mutants were also prepared that harbored substitutions of the final histidine ligand in the third finger, namely aspartate, glutamate, asparagine, glutamine, alanine, and arginine (Fig. 1B). These constructs were termed BF1-3X (where X represents Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln, Ala, and Arg). Aspartate is known to act as a zinc ligand in LIM domains (34Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), a class of zinc fingers in which two zinc atoms are bound. Glutamate, asparagine, and glutamine were chosen as residues with side chains that could conceivably act as ligands to Zn(II), and alanine and arginine were selected as negative controls. We initially also attempted to make a derivative containing a cysteine, but despite several attempts, we were not successful at generating this protein by normal methods in E. coli, since the protein appears to be cytotoxic; this mutant was therefore not pursued further.The seven proteins (wild-type BF1-3 and the six mutants) were tested for their ability to bind a typical CACCC box motif, namely the motif in the β-globin promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). GST alone and probe alone were also included as negative controls in this experiment (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, all of the point mutants retained near native DNA binding ability. This result was unexpected, given the generally accepted view that four zinc ligands are required for the formation of a folded zinc finger domain and the low probability that either argi"

The functional role of ATP, however, remains unclear since several reports have indicated that ADP and AMPPNP (5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate) are also able to support the formation of the cis ternary complex and the cis folding. To minimize the effect of contaminated ATP and adenylate kinase, we have included hexokinase plus glucose in the reaction mixtures and obtained new results. In ADP and AMPPNP, GroES bound quickly to GroEL but bound very slowly to the GroEL loaded with unfolded rhodanese or malate dehydrogenase. ADP was unable to support the formation of cis ternary complex and cis folding. AMPPNP supported cis folding of malate dehydrogenase to some extent but not cis folding of rhodanese. In the absence of hexokinase, apparent cis folding of rhodanese and malate dehydrogenase was observed in ADP and AMPPNP. Thus, the exclusive role of ATP in generation of the cis ternary complex is now evident.

Thus, the exclusive role of ATP in generation of the cis ternary complex is now evident. The bacterial chaperonin system consisting of GroEL and GroES facilitates folding of other proteins using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. GroEL is composed of 14 identical 57-kDa subunits, each containing a site for binding and hydrolysis of ATP. Seven GroEL subunits are arranged in a heptamer ring forming a central cavity, and two heptamer rings are stacked back to back. GroES is a dome-shaped, single heptamer ring of 10-kDa subunits. GroEL binds a wide range of unfolded proteins at the apical cavity surface and subsequently binds ATP and GroES to the same GroEL ring (the cis ring, a GroEL heptamer ring that binds to GroES), producing the complex consisting of GroEL, unfolded protein, and GroES (the cis ternary complex). Since the residues of the GroEL apical surface involved in GroES binding are mostly overlapped with substrate protein binding (1Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), GroES binding results in encapsulating unfolded protein into the enlarged cavity of the cis GroEL ring capped by GroES (the cis cavity) (2Weissman J.S.

The unfolded protein initiates folding in the cis cavity without a risk of aggregation (the cis folding). ATP hydrolysis in the cis ring and subsequent ATP binding to the opposite side of GroEL ring (the trans ring) induce the release of GroES, ADP, and substrate protein (whether folded or not) from the cis ring (3Rye H.S.

When unfolded protein is added to the GroEL-GroES complex, it binds to the trans ring, and its folding is arrested (2Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Binding and release from the trans ring enable the folding for some proteins (2Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), especially large ones that are too large to be encapsulated in the cis cavity, by lowering the concentration of aggregation-prone folding intermediates in bulk solution (5Chaudhuri T.K.

In contrast, the stringent substrate proteins for chaperonin fold efficiently by the cis folding in the presence of ATP (3Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L.

Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that the functional significance of ATP for the cis ternary complex formation is unclear yet. It was reported that slow cis folding of rhodanese, a stringent substrate protein, is observed when GroES and ADP or AMPPNP 1The abbreviations used are: AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; AMPPNPhex, AMPPNP that is always exposed to hexokinase and glucose; AMPPNPraw and ADPraw, commercial AMPPNP and ADP that have not been exposed to hexokinase; ADPhex, ADP that is always exposed to hexokinase and glucose; ATPsingle, ATP exposed to hexokinase at 3 s after initiation of the reaction, by which time only a single turnover of ATP hydrolysis of GroEL can occur; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; GroESN, GroES(T19C) labeled by 5(2-iodoacetylaminoethyl) aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; GroESC, GroES(98C) labeled by 5(2-iodoacetylaminoethyl) aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; Ap5A, diadenosine pentaphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. were added to GroEL-unfolded rhodanese complex (2Weissman J.S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The cis folding of dehydrofolate reductase in the presence of ADP was also reported (9Mayhew M. da Silva A.C.R. Martin J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and Rubisco were shown to form the cis ternary complex in ADP. However, these complexes did not promote folding (3Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These observations have raised an intriguing question: what is the difference between the non-productive ADP-induced cis ternary complex and the productive ATP-induced cis ternary complex? As reported previously (10Makino Y. Amada K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we have noticed that inclusion of hexokinase and glucose in the reaction mixtures diminished ADP-dependent cis folding of green fluorescent protein. Commercially prepared ADP and AMPPNP usually contain a trace amount of ATP. Also, if a trace amount of adenylate kinase is contaminated in purified protein, it can produce ATP from ADP constantly. Hexokinase would eliminate these unwanted ATPs during the reaction period. Another potential factor that can affect the results is heterogeneity of GroEL complexes in the reaction mixtures. For example, if two GroEL rings are not saturated by unfolded proteins and if GroES can bind preferably to free GroEL rings rather than the unfolded protein-loaded GroEL rings, two kinds of complexes would be generated: GroEL-unfolded protein complex without GroES or GroEL-GroES complex without unfolded protein in the cis cavity. Since these two complexes cannot be separated, the results may be taken as an evidence for the existence of the GroEL-GroES-unfolded protein ternary complex. Here, we reexamined the nucleotide requirement for the cis ternary complex by taking the precautions described above. The results showed that ADP is incompetent to generate the cis ternary complex, that is, ATP is stringent for the fast GroES binding to the unfolded protein-loaded GroEL rings and subsequent cis folding of substrate protein. Materials—Single-stranded DNAs of the plasmid pET-EL and pET-ES2 were obtained by infecting Escherichia coli CJ236 cells with helper phage M13KO7 (Amersham Biosciences). Mutant GroES(T19C) was made by Kunkel methods using an oligonucleotide 5′-CAGCAGATTTGCATTCAACTTCTTTACG-3′. GroEL, GroES mutants, and rhodanese were expressed and purified as described (11Motojima F. Makio T. Aoki K. Makino Y. Kuwajima K. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). GroEL purified by the procedures including gel permeation column chromatography in the presence of 30% methanol (11Motojima F. Makio T. Aoki K. Makino Y. Kuwajima K. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) contained only a very small amount of contaminated proteins (<0.1 Trp residues/GroEL tetradecamer). MDH from pig heart, hexokinase, ATP, ADP, and AMPPNP were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap5A) was purchased from Sigma. Protein concentrations were measured by BCA protein assay (Pierce) and calibrated on the basis of quantitative amino acid analysis. GroEL Saturated with Unfolded Proteins—Rhodanese (4 μm) or MDH (4 μm) was heat-denatured at 60 °C for 15 min in the buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) containing 1 μm GroEL. 2Concentrations of GroES and GroEL are all expressed as heptamer and tetradecamer, respectively, in this article. By this treatment, GroEL was not impaired at all, as shown by its 100% retention of ATPase activity and chaperone activity, whereas substrate proteins were completely inactivated. Temperature was shifted down to 25 °C, and GroEL-unfolded protein complex was isolated with gel permeation HPLC. In the latter stage of this study, we used ultrafiltration (Microcon YM-100, Millipore), which was as effective as HPLC to remove unbound substrate proteins. cis Folding Assays—To initiate cis folding reactions, the solution containing GroEL loaded with unfolded proteins (rhodanese or MDH) and GroES was mixed with a 3-fold volume of the solution containing the nucleotide (ATP, ADP, or AMPPNP). When indicated, hexokinase was included in the nucleotide (ADP or AMPPNP) solutions. Final concentrations of the components in the reaction mixtures were 1 mm nucleotides, 0.5 μm GroEL saturated with rhodanese or MDH, 1.0 μm GroES, 200 mm glucose, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 200 mm CH3COOK, 10 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 1 mm DTT and, when indicated, 0.04 units/μl hexokinase. In the case of rhodanese, 20 mm Na2S2O3 was additionally included in the reaction mixtures. For the single turnover ATP hydrolysis experiment, excess ATP was hydrolyzed by adding hexokinase (final concentration, 0.04 units/μl) to the reaction mixture at 3 s after initiation of the reaction. We confirmed that 1 mm ATP in the reaction mixture was quenched completely within next 3 s. To measure the time course of rhodanese folding, aliquots (5 μl) were taken out at indicated times and mixed with 750 μl of the solution containing 100 mm KH2PO4, 150 mm Na2S2O3, and 1 mm EDTA, and recovered rhodanese activities were measured (8Hayer-Hartl M.K. Weber F. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Motojima F. Makio T. Aoki K. Makino Y. Kuwajima K. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the experiments to observe the effect of pretreatment with hexokinase, the nucleotide solutions were treated with hexokinase (0.04 units/μl) for 15 min and separated from hexokinase by ultrafiltration (Microcon YM-3). When indicated, 1 mm Ap5A was included in the nucleotide solutions. The abovementioned assays were all carried out at 25 °C. To quantitate the amount of GroES and the substrate protein in the cis cavity, at 2 h of incubation, released GroES and substrate protein were removed by repeated (four times) dilution-ultrafiltration procedures (Microcon YM-100). Subsequently, proteinase K (final concentration, 1 μg/ml) was added to digest non-protective unfolded protein. After a 30-min incubation at 25 °C, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added at final concentration of 1 mm, and digested products smaller than 100 kDa were removed by ultrafiltration as described above. An aliquot of the resulting solution (∼20 μg) was applied to 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS, and Coomassie Blue R-250-stained band intensities of substrate proteins and GroES were quantitated by using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image) and calibrating with band intensities of the known amount of proteins. Additional aliquots of proteinase K-treated, ultrafiltered samples were used for measuring the recovered activities of rhodanese or MDH that corresponded to the cis folding. To release all the proteins from the cis cavity, GroES was detached from GroEL by the addition of an equal volume of 50 mm EDTA to the aliquot. After a 90-min incubation at 25 °C (in which active dimers were formed in the case of MDH), activities of rhodanese and MDH were measured. Kinetics of GroES Binding to and Release from GroEL—GroES(98C) and GroES(T19C) (0.14 mm) were incubated at 4 °C for 24 h with 2 mm 5(2-iodoacetylaminoethyl) aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Molecular Probes). Free labeling reagent was quenched by 10 mm DTT and removed by a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 200 mm CH3COOK, 10 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, and 1 mm DTT. The fractions containing GroES were concentrated by Ultrafree-4 (Millipore). The molar ratio of the labels to GroES was ∼0.2:1 for both GroESs. The labeled GroES(98C) (GroESC) and labeled GroES(T19C) (GroESN) were fully active in GroEL-GroES-dependent folding of rhodanese and in suppression of ATPase activity of GroEL (data not shown). The time course of GroES binding to GroEL was monitored by the fluorescence of GroESN that increased upon binding to GroEL. The solution containing GroESN and nucleotide was mixed at 25 °C with free GroEL or GroEL saturated with unfolded proteins, prepared as described above, using a stopped-flow rapid mixing apparatus (SFM-400, BioLogic) equipped with fluorometer. Final concentrations of GroESN and nucleotide were 0.02 μm and 1 mm, respectively. GroEL concentrations were varied (final concentrations, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.25 μm). The excitation wavelength was 340 nm, and the emission light above 420 nm was measured. The same experiments were repeated five times, and the data were averaged. The binding was analyzed assuming the simple bimolecular binding scheme, GroEL + GroESN → GroEL-GroESN. Since the dissociation rate constant (k off) is small enough to be ignored, the association rate constant k on is calculated from linear fitting to the apparent rate constants (k app) obtained from single exponential fitting at different GroEL concentrations; k app = k on [GroEL]. The rate of release of GroES from GroEL was estimated from the loss of fluorescence of GroESC from the GroEL-GroESC complexes. The cis ternary GroEL-GroESC-rhodanese complex and the GroEL-GroESC complexes were made by the procedures described above except that 1 μm GroEL and 0.5 μm GroESC were used in the presence or absence of rhodanese. The complexes were incubated at 25 °C with excess amount (final concentration, 10 μm) of non-fluorescent, native GroES to prevent the rebinding of GroESC. Aliquots were taken out at indicated times and applied to a gel permeation HPLC column equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 200 mm CH3COOK, 10 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 0.1 mm ADP, 20 mm glucose, 0.01 units/μl hexokinase, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05% NaN3. The GroESC fluorescence eluted in the GroEL peak was measured with an on-line fluorometer at 490 nm with excitation at 340 nm. Elimination of Contaminated ATP by Hexokinase—Trace amount of ATP in ADP and AMPPNP solutions cannot be accurately measured with the usual HPLC analysis, and we applied a luciferase assay. Commercially available ADP and AMPPNP usually are contaminated with ATP, ranging 0.1–2.0%. Purification of ADP using a Dowex ion exchange column decreased the amount of ATP to 0.02–0.05%. Treatment with hexokinase plus glucose was more effective, and ATP contamination in ADP and AMPPNP was decreased down to 0.005–0.009% (10Makino Y. Amada K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Taking into account that purified protein could contain trace amounts of adenylate kinase that potentially generate ATP (and AMP) from ADP continuously during the reaction period, we have included hexokinase plus glucose in the reaction mixtures. Hereafter, commercial AMPPNP and ADP that have not been treated with hexokinase are referred to as AMPPNPraw and ADPraw, respectively. Those treated with hexokinase plus glucose are as AMPPNPhex and ADPhex, respectively. Hexokinase was also used for the single turnover ATP hydrolysis experiment (referred to as ATPsingle); hexokinase added at 3 s after initiation of the reaction hydrolyzed all free ATP so that the second chaperonin cycle was prevented. The folding yields of rhodanese and MDH in the cis cavity under the conditions of ATPsingle were 1.1 and 0.60 mol/mol of GroEL-GroES complex, respectively, which were approximately the same as those (1.2 and 0.66 mol/mol) achieved by GroEL(D398A), a mutant deficient in ATP hydrolytic activity. Therefore, it is confirmed that the single turnover reaction of chaperonin can be measured by this procedure. Saturation of GroEL by Heat-denatured Proteins—At first, we prepared GroEL in which all the binding sites for substrate proteins were saturated with unfolded proteins. Dilution from the concentrated protein solutions containing chemical denaturants such as guanidium hydrochloride or urea into the reaction solution was avoided because of the inhibition effect of the denaturants on GroEL-GroES association (12Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Instead, we simply heated the mixtures of GroEL and substrate proteins, either rhodanese or MDH, at 60 °C for 15 min. Rhodanese and MDH were denatured completely by this heat treatment. GroEL is a rather heat-stable protein and remained intact as ensured by the unaffected ATP hydrolysis activity and chaperone activity after the heat treatment (data not shown). Denatured substrate proteins occupied all the substrate protein binding sites of GroEL, and the GroEL loaded with a saturating amount of unfolded proteins (referred as the loaded GroEL) was separated from unbound substrate proteins with gel permeation HPLC or ultrafiltration. The molar stoichiometry of the bound substrate protein to GroEL estimated from band intensities in SDS-PAGE was 2.4 (rhodanese) and 2.5 (MDH). Saturation of substrate protein binding sites of GroEL by this procedure was confirmed as described later. GroES Binding to the Free and Loaded GroEL—The fluorescently labeled GroESN increases its fluorescence upon binding to GroEL. The extent of increase is ∼25%, regardless of nucleotides and the presence or absence of unfolded proteins (Fig. 1, data not shown for ADPhex and AMPPNPhex). Using the fluorescence increase of GroESN as a probe, we measured time courses of binding of GroES to GroEL. GroESN bound rapidly to unloaded GroEL in ATP, ADPhex, and AMPPNPhex with ATP being the fastest and ADPhex the second fastest (Fig. 2A). Binding rates of GroESN in ADPraw and AMPPNPraw were slightly faster than those treated with hexokinase (Table I). The binding reactions for all nucleotides are simulated by single exponential curves, and the calculated association rate constants (k on) are in the same order of magnitude, 107m–1 s–1 (Table I). The k on value of the GroESN binding to unloaded GroEL in ATP (7.5 × 107m–1 s–1) is consistent with the previously reported values 4 × 107m–1 s–1 (13Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; : 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and 5 × 107m–1 s–1 (4Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), ensuring the validity to use GroESN for the binding experiments. These results show that ADP and AMPPNP are as effective as ATP in mediating GroES binding to free GroEL. However, these nucleotides have a very different effect on the GroESN binding to the loaded GroEL (Fig. 2, B–D and Table I). In ATP, GroESN binding to the rhodanese-loaded GroEL and MDH-loaded GroEL were slightly slower than that to free GroEL but still very rapid, completed within 1 s (k on > 107m–1 s–1) (Fig. 2B). In AMPPNPraw, the rates were slowed down by ∼102-fold (Fig. 2C). In AMPPNPhex, the rates were slowed down further; GroES binding to the MDH-loaded GroEL and the rhodanese-loaded GroEL were reached only 40 and 5% after 5 min, respectively. Similarly, the binding of GroESN to the loaded GroEL was slow in ADPraw and even slower in ADPhex (Fig. 2D). Although these slow GroES binding to the loaded GroEL in ADP and AMPPNP have not been known previously, this can be expected because GroES and unfolded protein compete for the overlapping binding sites on the GroEL. Rather, a new mechanism is required to understand this rapid GroES binding in ATP to the loaded GroEL.Fig. 2Binding of GroES to free GroEL and the loaded GroEL in various nucleotides. Binding was monitored with the fluorescence change of GroESN. The reactions were initiated by mixing the solution containing GroESN and nucleotide with the solution containing free GroEL or the loaded GroEL. Final concentrations of GroEL, GroESN, and nucleotides were 0.1 μm, 0.02 μm, and 1 mm, respectively.

Indeed, in ADPhex, GroESN bound rapidly to two-thirds of the 1:1 (molar ratio of rhodanese and GroEL) rhodanese-loaded GroEL and to a quarter of the 2:1 rhodanese-loaded GroEL (Fig. 3). The rapid binding was no longer observed for the 2.5:1 rhodanese-loaded GroEL, indicating that all the substrate binding sites of GroEL were occupied by unfolded rhodanese. These results showed that 2.5 rhodanese and MDH can bind to GroEL even if GroEL has only two rings for substrate protein binding. This discrepancy may be due to the error in estimation of protein concentration or the occasional binding of two substrate proteins to one GroEL ring as reported using citrate synthase as substrate protein (14Grallert H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33305-33310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Dissociation of GroES from GroEL—Dissociation of GroES from GroEL was measured by the exchange of fluorescently labeled GroESC bound on GroEL with an excess amount of unlabeled GroES. As shown in Fig. 4, the GroEL-GroESC complexes formed in ATPsingle and ADPhex without substrate protein are surprisingly stable; only 10% of the GroEL-GroESC complexes released GroESC after 1 week. The GroEL-GroESC complex formed in ATPsingle becomes identical to that in ADPhex since the bound ATP in the complex is hydrolyzed to ADP. This result shows the extraordinary stability of the GroEL-GroESC complexes in ADP. The complex without substrate protein formed in AMPPNPhex was relatively unstable and decayed in 2 days. The GroEL-GroESC-rhodanese complex formed in ATPsingle was slightly less stable than the GroEL-GroESC complex in ATPsingle in the absence of unfolded protein. This instability in the presence of rhodanese may be due to the stimulation of GroES release by substrate protein binding to trans ring (4Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A.

Calculated dissociation rate constants (k off) (Table I) are smaller than the previously reported value (3.8 × 10–5 s) estimated from the dissociation of ADP moiety from the GroEL-GroES complex (15Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The reason of this discrepancy is not known, but there is a possibility that a trace amount of contaminated ATP would stimulate the exchange of bound ADP. The estimated dissociation constants of GroES binding to GroEL are extremely small (∼10 fM) and comparable with the dissociation constant of the biotin-avidin binding. This strong GroES binding may enable GroES to bind the loaded GroEL, the GroES binding site of which is covered by substrate protein. cis Folding of Rhodanese—From the slow binding of GroES to the rhodanese-loaded GroEL in ADPhex and AMPPNPhex, it can be predicted that formation of the cis ternary complex and the cis folding cannot occur in these nucleotides. To examine this, we compared the effect of these nucleotides on the chaperonin-assisted folding of rhodanese. Since it has been known that rhodanese folds in the cis cavity but does not fold spontaneously (16Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), all the recovered rhodanese activity can be attributed to the result of the cis folding. The reaction was started by mixing the rhodanese-loaded GroEL, GroES, and nucleotides (Fig. 5A). In ATP, the yield of recovered rhodanese reached to more than 80% of the total bound rhodanese in 60 min. In ATPsingle, the recovered rhodanese was nearly 50%, showing that unfolded rhodanese bound in one GroEL ring is folded in the cis cavity after single ATP hydrolytic cycle was terminated. We observed significant recovery of rhodanese activity also in ADPraw (∼50%) and AMPPNPraw (∼20%). The same results were reported previously by others (7Weissman J.S. Rye H.S. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 8Hayer-Hartl M.K. Weber F. Hartl F.U.

Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and it has been thought that ADP and AMPPNP can substitute ATP to some extent for the chaperonin function. However, hexokinase treatment diminished rhodanese activity in ADPhex and AMPPNPhex (Fig. 5A). To determine which is the cause of ATP contamination, contaminated ATP or ATP production by contaminated adenylate kinase, rhodanese activity was measured using pre-hexokinase-treated ADP and AMPPNP (ADPpre-hex and AMPPNPpre-hex) that were treated with hexokinase and separated from hexokinase by ultrafiltration (Fig. 5B). Approximately 50% of rhodanese was recovered in ADPpre-hex. The initial lag period in the rhodanese recovery in ADPpre-hex can be interpreted as the time required for the accumulation of ATP by adenylate kinase. Indeed, in the presence of Ap5A, a potent inhibitor of adenylate kinase (17Reinstein J. Vetter I.R. Schlichting I. Rosch P. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7440-7450Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), rhodanese reactivation disappeared in ADPraw, whereas it was not affected in ATP. The reason for no rhodanese recovery in AMPPNPpre-hex may be explained by the low concentration of contaminated ADP that is not enough for adenyate kinase to produce ATP. These results lead to conclusion that the causes for rhodanese recovery in ADPraw and AMPPNPraw are trace amounts of contaminated adenylate kinase and contaminated ATP, respectively. Formation of the cis Ternary Complex—We assessed the formation of the cis ternary complexes by using protease treatment; the substrate proteins entrapped in the cis cavity are protected from the protease digestion, whereas those bound to the trans ring are readily digested as well as free unfolded proteins (2Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 16Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The samples incubated for 120 min as in Fig. 5A were ultrafiltrated to remove free GroES, digested by proteinase K, and ultrafiltrated to remove proteinase K and digested polypeptide. Three kinds of GroEL complexes, GroEL, GroEL-GroES, and the GroEL-GroES-rhodanese cis ternary complex, should exist after this procedure. The relative populations of GroEL, GroES, and rhodanese were estimated from the band intensities in the CBB-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6A). The rhodanese-loaded GroEL contained 2.4 mol rhodanese/mol of GroEL (lane 1), and all rhodanese molecules were digested by proteinase K (lane 2). In ATP, the folded rhodanese molecules had been removed by ultrafiltration, and GroEL-GroES complexes remained (lane 3). In AMPPNPraw, ADPraw, and ATPsingle, significant amount of proteinase K-resistant rhodanese were observed (lanes 4–6). Molar ratios among GroEL, rhodanese, and GroES in these three lanes were 1.0:0.8–1.4: 0.7–1.1, indicating that the GroEL-GroES-rhodanese cis ternary complex was formed in these nucleotides. The rhodanese molecules held in the cis cavity of these complexes had finished folding because rhodanese activity of these complexes is equivalent to the estimated amount of rhodanese from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6A, lower panel). In contrast, in AMPPNPhex and ADPhex, no rhodanese and a faint amount of GroES were observed (lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that GroES cannot bind to the rhodanese-loaded GroEL or can form only unstable GroEL-GroES-rhodanese ternary complex. Slow GroES binding to rhodanese-loaded GroEL in AMPPNPhex and ADPhex (Fig. 2, C and D) can be due to the formation of such unstable complex. Next, we used MDH as a substrate protein (Fig. 6B). Molar ratios among GroEL, MDH, and GroES in AMPPNPraw, ADPraw, and ATPsingle (lanes 4–6) were 1.0:0.8–1.1:1.0–1.1, indicating the stoichiometric formation of the cis ternary complexes as well as rhodanese. The results of AMPPNPhex (lane 7) and ADPhex (lane 8) are different from those of rhodanese. In AMPPNPhex, smaller amounts of MDH than ATPsingle were encapsulated in the cis cavity, whereas rhodanese was not encapsulated. In ADPhex, no MDH band was observed as rhodanese; however, GroES was bound to GroEL in contrast to rhodanese. Probably, MDH was gradually released from GroEL, and then GroES bound to these newly available binding sites. Folding of MDH in the cis cavity was assessed by measuring MDH activity after the MDH dimer was formed by releasing the MDH monomer from the cis cavity using EDTA to open the GroES cap (Fig. 6B, lower panel). Recovered MDH activity of each sample roughly corresponds to the amount of MDH in SDS-PAGE. ADPhex did not support cis folding of MDH, but AMPPNPhex did so in some extent. This ATP analogue seems to mimic the action of ATP in this case by a yet unknown mechanism. 3In AMPPNPhex and ADPhex, MDH in the MDH-loaded GroEL appeared to be gradually released from GroEL, and then GroES bound tightly to the newly available binding sites, because recovery of some MDH activity was observed even before the addition of EDTA (data not shown). In this case, recovery occurred much more slowly in AMPPNPhex than in ADPhex, indicating higher affinity of MDH to GroEL in AMPPNPhex than in ADPhex, which is consistent with slower GroESN binding to MDH-loaded GroEL in AMPPNPhex than in ADPhex (Fig. 2, C and D). The small cis folding of MDH in AMPPNPhex detected in Fig. 6B may be related to this relatively strong affinity of MDH to GroEL in AMPPNPhex and accidental entrapping of MDH in the cis cavity, whereas GroES competes for its binding sites. Conclusions—The previously reported ability of ADP, less efficient than that of ATP in the formation of the cis ternary complex, has made the current conception of the ATP-dependent chaperonin function ambiguous. However, our results clearly show that the cis ternary complex is not formed and that the cis folding does not occur in ADP. Also, cis folding of substrate proteins in ADP has been caused by the contaminated adenylate kinase because its inhibitor, diadenosine pentaphosphate, suppressed the cis folding of rhodanese. It should be noted that the direct measurement of adenylate kinase activity contaminated in the purified GroEL is hard to detect due to the immediate hydrolysis of produced ATP by GroEL. In contrast, AMPPNP appears to be able to mimic the action of ATP to some extent; it supports cis folding for MDH but not for rhodanese. This work sheds light on the key question on the chaperonin function; how can ATP enable rapid binding of GroES to the substrate protein-loaded GroEL whose binding sites for GroES are occupied by the substrate protein?

A peptide from the C-terminal cell binding domain, KRFYVVMWKK (4N1K) binds to IAP and stimulates the integrin-dependent cell functions, including platelet aggregation. We investigated the mechanism by which TS-bound IAP modulates the affinity of platelet integrin, αIIbβ3. Platelet aggregation induced by 4N1K was not completely inhibited by energy depletion with sodium azide and 2-deoxy-d-glucose, although ADP or collagen-induced platelet response was completely inhibited. The binding of ligand-mimetic antibody PAC1 to αIIbβ3 was also induced in the energy-depleted platelets. In the transfected Namalwa cells, 4N1K induced activation of the αIIbβ3 with mutated β3 (Ser-752 to Pro), which is a non-responsive form to inside-out signaling, as well as wild type αIIbβ3. The truncated form of IAP with only the extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain was sufficient for the activation of αIIbβ3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells, although the IAP-mediated intracellular signaling was abolished, which was monitored by the absence of down-regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Furthermore, the soluble recombinant Ig domain of IAP induced PAC1 binding to αIIbβ3 on Chinese hamster ovary cells when added with 4N1K. Physical association between the soluble recombinant Ig domain of IAP and purified αIIbβ3 was detected in the presence of 4N1K. These data indicate that the extracellular Ig domain of IAP, when bound to TS, interacts with αIIbβ3 and can change αIIbβ3 in a high affinity state without the requirement of intracellular signaling.

This extracellular event would be a novel mechanism of affinity modulation of integrin. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptor complexes involved in numerous physiological processes such as angiogenesis, immune response, and hemostasis (1Hynes R.O. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 2Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). They function in cell adhesion and signaling by interacting with an extracellular matrix or cellular counter receptors. The adhesive function is subject to rapid regulation referred to as inside-out signaling. A prototypical example of integrin modulation is the transition of platelet αIIbβ3 (GPIIb-IIIa complex) from a low affinity/avidity state to a state in which it can effectively bind soluble ligands such as fibrinogen (3Phillips D.R.

Recent evidence suggests that physiologically relevant signals are transduced to the integrin through its cytoplasmic domains by intracellular associated factors, such as β3-endonexin, calcium integrin-binding protein, or cytoskeletal protein, talin (6Kashiwagi H.

In addition, cell surface membrane proteins including urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, CD98, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, and integrin-associated protein (IAP/CD47) 1The abbreviations used are: IAP, integrin-associated protein; srIAP, soluble recombinant form of IAP; TS, thrombospondin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IL-2, interleukin 2; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. are also likely involved in the affinity modulation (12Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thus, the control of platelet αIIbβ3 seems to be complex. Recent crystallographic determination of the structure of integrin has shown that a bent integrin conformation has low affinity, and an extended structure is linked to high affinity access of macromolecular ligands to its contact site in the integrin head (13Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 14Arnaout M.A. Goodman S.L. Xiong J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Such a dynamic conformational rearrangement in the integrin extracellular domains can be induced by ligand mimetic peptides, Mn2+, and also by inside-out signaling. However, the molecular basis for regulation of its extracellular conformation is not entirely clear. IAP is a 50-kDa membrane glycoprotein that has 5 transmembrane-spanning regions and 1 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like extracellular domain (15Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 16Brown E.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was originally reported to be physically associated with certain integrins including α2β1, αVβ3, and αIIbβ3 (17Chung J. Wang X.Q. Lindberg F.P. Frazier W.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 642-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Blockade of IAP with monoclonal antibody inhibits some aspects of integrin function, and ligation of IAP with activating antibodies induces the modulation of integrin-dependent cell adhesion. A gene-targeting study showed that IAP plays a key role in host defense by participation in migration and activation of leukocytes in response to bacterial infection (20Lindberg F.P. Bullard D.C. Caver T.E. Gresham H.D. Beaudet A.L. Brown E.J. Science. 1996; 274: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was reported that IAP is a receptor for the C-terminal cell binding domain of thrombospondin (TS) (21Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). TS, its C-terminal cell binding domain, and a peptide from the C-terminal cell binding domain, KRFYVVMWKK (4N1K), all stimulate the integrin-dependent adhesion, spreading, and motility of the cells including endothelial cells, leukocytes, and smooth muscle cells (18Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 22Wang X.Q. Frazier W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IAP is a ligand for the transmembrane signal-regulatory protein (23Seiffert M. Brossart P. Cant C. Cella M. Colonna M. Brugger W. Kanz L. Ullrich A. Buhring H.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this case, IAP likely plays a role in macrophage function. The role on hematopoiesis (24Furusawa T. Yanai N. Hara T. Miyajima A. Obinata M. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or adhesion of sickle red blood cell (25Brittain J.E. Mlinar K.J. Anderson C.S. Orringer E.P. Parise L.V. Blood. 2001; 97: 2159-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was also reported. In platelets, the functional role of IAP was hardly detected using only a monoclonal antibody against IAP (26Fujimoto T. Fujimura K. Noda M. Takafuta T. Shimomura T. Kuramoto A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the peptide 4N1K induces platelet aggregation (27Dorahy D.J. Thorne R.F. Fecondo J.V. Burns G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1323-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and spreading on immobilized fibrinogen or collagen (19Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The ability of the peptide depends on its interaction with IAP because platelet response was decreased by treatment with an antifunctional IAP antibody or in platelets from IAP-deficient mice (17Chung J. Wang X.Q. Lindberg F.P. Frazier W.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 642-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are reports showing that the binding of 4N1K to IAP initiates intracellular signaling that would result in affinity modulation of αIIbβ3 (19Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). 4N1K induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins such as Syk and focal adhesion kinase. The effect of 4N1K is inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating the participation of a heterotrimeric Gi protein (19Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This sort of stimulation of integrin function via G proteins is similar to that caused by agonists through seven transmembrane spanning receptors, such as ADP, epinephrine, and thrombin. Recently cloned ADP receptor (P2Y12) (28Hollopeter G. Jantzen H.M. Vincent D. Li G. England L. Ramakrishnan V. Yang R.B. Nurden P. Nurden A. Julius D. Conley P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) also involves activation of Gi-containing heterotrimeric GTPases. However, these receptors are not necessarily present close to αIIbβ3. Therefore, the functional significance of the association of IAP with the integrin is not clear. In this report we investigate the mechanism by which IAP modulates the affinity of αIIbβ3. We provide evidence that only the extracellular Ig domain of IAP interacts with αIIbβ3 and can change αIIbβ3 to a high affinity state without requirement of intracellular signaling when it binds to TS. These phenomena might correspond with the dynamic structural change of integrin. The extracellular event reported here would be a novel mechanism of affinity modulation of integrin. Materials—Hybridoma cells producing anti-IAP monoclonal antibody B6H121 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; HB-9771, Manassas, VA). The antibody was purified from mouse ascites using HiTrap protein G affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody and anti-p44/p42 MAP kinase antibody were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Control antibodies were from Organon Technica (West Chester, PA). FITC-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse immunoglobulins and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were from TAGO (Burlingame, CA). Human αIIbβ3 was purified from platelet concentrates as previously described (32Fujimoto T. Fujimura K. Kuramoto A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Anti-αIIbβ3 antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with purified human αIIbβ3 according to a standard protocol. IgG was purified by protein A CL-4B-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specificity of the antibody was confirmed by Western blot using human platelets. ADP was purchased from Biopool (Ventura, CA). Human fibrinogen was purified as previously described (26Fujimoto T. Fujimura K. Noda M. Takafuta T. Shimomura T. Kuramoto A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A peptide from the C-terminal cell binding domain of TS, 4N1K (KRFYVVMWKK), and a control scrambled peptide (KVFRWKYVMK) were synthesized by BioSynthesis (Lewisville, TX) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. CHO-K1 cells and Namalwa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and RPMI-1620 (Invitrogen), respectively, and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Expression vectors for αIIb and β3 in pBK-EF and CHO cells stably expressing αIIbβ3 were described previously (26Fujimoto T. Fujimura K. Noda M. Takafuta T. Shimomura T. Kuramoto A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet Aggregation—Blood samples were collected from consenting healthy volunteer donors in a 1:10 volume of 3.8% trisodium citrate (w/v). Platelets were isolated from platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml prostaglandin E1 and 1 unit/ml apyrase. The pellet was resuspended and washed twice in 85 mm sodium citrate, 111 mm dextrose, 71 mm citric acid, pH 7.0, containing prostaglandin E1 and apyrase and then resuspended at a concentration of 3 × 108 platelets/ml in a modified Tyrode-HEPES buffer (138 mm NaCl, 0.36 mm NaH2PO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). Platelet aggregation was measured by the addition of peptides (4N1K or control peptide) at 37 °C in an aggregometer (Chrono-log, Havertown, PA), with continuous stirring at 1200 rpm. To inhibit the fibrinogen binding or 4N1K binding, 100 μg/ml T10 or B6H12 was added 10 min before aggregation measurements. B6H12 induced direct aggregation of the platelets from some subjects depending on the polymorphism of Fc receptor, FcγRII. Therefore, the effect of B6H12 was tested using the platelets from “non-responders.” To block the intracellular metabolism, platelets were incubated with 0.4% sodium azide and 4 mg/ml 2-deoxy-d-glucose at 37 °C for 1 h. Human fibrinogen was added at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml before the addition of several agonists (100 μm peptides, 5 μg/ml collagen, or 5 μm ADP). Flow Cytometric Analysis—The affinity state of αIIbβ3 was determined by flow cytometric analysis using ligand-mimetic monoclonal antibody PAC1. PAC1 is an IgM monoclonal antibody that binds only to the activated form of αIIbβ3 in the same manner as the physiological ligand (31Shattil S.J. Cunningham M. Hoxie J.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 307-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were suspended at a concentration of 2 × 107/ml in a modified Tyrode-HEPES buffer and stimulated with peptides or agonists in the presence of 20 μg/ml FITC-conjugated PAC1 for 20 min at room temperature without stirring. Fifty μl of each aliquot was then diluted with 500 μl of the buffer, and the mixture was directly analyzed by a flow cytometer, Epics XL (Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Single platelets were gated and analyzed. In the case of cultured Namalwa and CHO cells, cells were harvested and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in a modified Tyrode-HEPES buffer. Cells were incubated with 100 μm peptides and/or antibodies (50 μg/ml LIBS6 for stimulation and 100 μg/ml T10 or B6H12 for inhibition) in the presence of 20 μg/ml FITC-PAC1 for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, cells were stained with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide, and propidium iodide-negative cells were gated to exclude permeabilized dead cells. To estimate the expression of αIIbβ3 or IAP, cells were incubated with the first antibody, T10 or B6H12, (10 μg/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution with Ca2+ containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% NaN3. After washing, they were incubated again with FITC-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse immunoglobulins. Each incubation was performed on ice for 1 h. Cells were finally washed and analyzed in the buffer containing propidium iodide. Because the expression levels of wild type and mutant forms of IAP in CHO cells were different, PAC1 binding was standardized by the mean fluorescence intensity of B6H12 binding to each cell type. Mutational Analysis—Mutant cDNAs of αIIbβ3 and IAP were constructed by PCR according to the strategy previously described (33Fujimoto T. Stroud E. Whatley R.E. Prescott S.M. Muszbek L. Laposata M. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11394-11400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To mutate Ser-752 of β3, PCR was performed using cDNA of wild type β3 as a template. The sense primer contained the BamHI site at base 1500 within the β3 cDNA, and the antisense primer contained the Ser-752 to Pro mutation. After gel purification, the PCR product was used for the second PCR. The second PCR was performed with the same sense primer and another antisense primer that overlapped with the first antisense primer and contained the stop codon of β3 cDNA and the HindIII site for cloning. The PCR fragment was digested by BamHI and HindIII, isolated by gel electrophoresis, and then used to replace the fragment of the wild type β3 cDNA extending from the BamHI site in the cDNA to the HindIII site in the multicloning site of the expression vector. IAP cDNA in the expression vector was previously described (26Fujimoto T. Fujimura K. Noda M. Takafuta T. Shimomura T. Kuramoto A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type IAP in this study was identical to the so-called form 2, which is the most abundant isoform (15Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Two truncated mutants were constructed. In the first construct (IAP Δ291) a stop codon was introduced just after the 5th transmembrane domain, resulting in deletion of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail after Lys-291. In the second (IAP Δ163) a stop codon was created after the first transmembrane domain, which resulted in deletion after Lys-163. In both cases PCR was performed with the sense primer containing the translation initiation codon and the antisense primer containing the indicated stop codon. In another mutant form (IAP-Tac) the extracellular domain of IAP was fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the IL-2 receptor α chain (Tac antigen/CD25). Primer sets were prepared in which half of the sequence was identical to the end of the extracellular domain of IAP, before Asn-142, and the other half was identical to the beginning of the transmembrane domain of the IL-2 receptor. Two PCR were performed separately to amplify the extracellular domain of IAP and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the IL-2 receptor. The PCR products were mixed, and the final PCR was performed using the outside primers. All constructs were then cloned into the expression vector, pBK-EF, and verified by nucleotide sequencing of the region encoding the PCR products using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 310, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cells Expressing Recombinant αIIbβ3 and IAP—Namalwa and CHO cells were transfected using DMRIE-C and LipofectAMINE reagents (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Permanent transfectants were selected with G418 as described elsewhere. To establish the cells that stably express αIIbβ3 and/or IAP, stable cells were sorted by reactivity to the antibody T10 and/or B6H12 using a cell sorter (Epics Elite, Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Cells were cultured again for 5–7, days and the positive clones were obtained. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Analysis—To determine the association of αIIbβ3 and IAP, platelets or transfected cells were lysed in an ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were chilled on ice for 1 h followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were precleared with protein G-agarose (Immunopure Immobilized Protein G, Pierce), and the resultant supernatants were incubated for 1 h with protein G-agarose that was preincubated with antibodies T10, B6H12, or control antibody. Protein G-agarose was washed with the lysis buffer three times. The samples were then separated into two aliquots. One was solubilized with SDS sample buffer under reduced conditions and applied to 7% polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel (PAGE) for the detection of αIIbβ3. The other was incubated with SDS sample buffer under non-reduced conditions at 60 °C for 30 min and applied to 10% PAGE for IAP. The resolved proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 10% skim milk in TBS buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and then incubated with anti-αIIbβ3 rabbit polyclonal serum or 1 μg/ml B6H12 for 2 h. After extensive washing with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, antibody binding was detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG and visualized with ECL chemiluminescence reaction reagents (Amersham Biosciences). MAP Kinase Phosphorylation—To determine the intracellular signaling events, MAP kinase activation was analyzed in the CHO cells expressing IAPs (34Wang X.Q. Lindberg F.P. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 4N1K or control peptide for 10 min and lysed by the addition of an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer (35Fujimoto T. McEver R.P. Blood. 1993; 82: 1758-1766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm molybdic acid, 80 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 mm trifluoroperazine, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 2% Triton X-100). After removal of the insoluble fraction by centrifugation, cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody. Immunoblotting was performed as described above, except that blocking was with 2% bovine serum albumin. To reprobe with anti-MAPK antibody to detect the total MAPK levels, membranes were incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) at 70 °C for 1 h, washed, and then used for the second immunoblotting. Recombinant Soluble Form of IAP and Pull-down Assay—An expression vector that sequentially introduces a FLAG epitope, His tag, and a stop codon at 3′-end of cDNA in pBK-EF was kindly provided by Dr. K. Fukudome (Saga Medical College, Saga City, Japan) (36Fukudome K. Kurosawa S. Stearns Kurosawa D.J. He X. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17491-17498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To make recombinant soluble IAP (rsIAP), the extracellular domain of IAP until Asn-142 was PCR-amplified, digested, and ligated to this vector. Human 293 cells were transfected and selected with G418. High producing clones were screened in culture dishes by agarose diffusion immunoassay for secreted protein as previously described (37Ushiyama S. Laue T.M. Moore K.L. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15229-15237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoassay was performed with B6H12 and the anti-FLAG antibody, M2. The cells producing the highest amount of rsIAP were grown until semi-confluent, and the culture medium was changed to serum-free medium for 293 cells, SFMII (Invitrogen). After 5 days of culture, the medium was collected, and the rsIAP was purified by a His-Trap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purification procedure was repeated twice, and the protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). The effects of rsIAP on the affinity state of αIIbβ3 in CHO cells were analyzed by flow cytometer. To analyze the association of αIIbβ3 and rsIAP in vitro, pull down assay was performed. Purified human αIIbβ3 (32Fujimoto T. Fujimura K. Kuramoto A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and rsIAP (10 μg each) were mixed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1% CHAPS, and then 100 μg peptide was added in a total volume of 100 μl for 3 h. Protein G-agarose, which was preincubated with 5 μg of antibodies Tab or M2, was added and further incubated for 1 h. The protein G-agarose was subsequently washed three times with the above buffer. Bound proteins were released in the SDS sample buffer and then determined by immunoblotting. 4N1K Induces the Activation of αIIbβ3 on Human Platelets— 4N1K peptide, which is from the C-terminal cell binding domain of TS, induced aggregation of washed human platelets dose-dependently, with a maximal response at 100 μm. The mutated control peptide did not. Pretreatment with an inhibitory anti-αIIbβ3 antibody, T10, partially blocked the aggregation by ∼50%. A functional antibody for IAP, B6H12, also partially inhibited 4N1K-induced aggregation (Fig. 1A). We next tested platelets in which intracellular response was prevented (energy-depleted). The mechanism of inside-out signaling is not entirely clear, but it is known that the affinity modulation of platelet αIIbβ3 requires metabolic energy and can be abolished by pretreatment with sodium azide and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (6Kashiwagi H. Schwartz M.A. Eigenthaler M. Davis K.A. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the treated platelets, aggregation induced by collagen or ADP was completely abolished. However, 4N1K induced aggregation in the presence of fibrinogen, although the aggregation was decreased compared with non-treated platelets. This aggregation was also partially inhibited by antibody T10 or B6H12 (Fig. 1B). This result suggested that 4N1K induced platelet aggregation in part through agglutination, which was not dependent on αIIbβ3 and IAP, as reported recently (38Tulasne D. Judd B.A. Johansen M. Asazuma N. Best D. Brown E.J. Kahn M. Koretzky G.A. Watson S.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 3346-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but also indicated the presence of aggregation mediated by αIIbβ3 and IAP. The latter part of the response partially depended on intracellular metabolism. The activation state of αIIbβ3 was estimated by the binding of ligand mimetic antibody, PAC1 (Fig. 2). 4N1K induced PAC1 binding to platelets, whereas control peptide did not. The binding was completely inhibited by T10 and also partia"

We applied solid state NMR as a novel method to obtain structural information about the phospholipase C-δ1 (PLC-δ1) pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the lipid bilayer surface. NMR spectra of the alanine residues in the vicinity of the β5/β6 loop in the PH domain revealed changes in local conformations due to the membrane localization of the protein. We propose that these conformational changes originate from a hydrophobic interaction between the amphipathic α-helix located in the β5/β6 loop and the hydrophobic layer of the membrane and contribute to the membrane binding affinity, interdomain interactions and intermolecular interactions of PLC-δ1.

It has been proposed that these domains function as mediators of intermolecular interactions analogous to many other structural modules involved in cellular signaling (e.g. SH2 and SH3 domains). Many kinds of inositol lipids and inositol phosphates have been identified as important ligands of PH domains (3Bottomley M.J. Salim K. Panayotou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Takeuchi H. Yagisawa H. Jpn. J.

Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 39-74PubMed Google Scholar). The PH domain of phospholipase C-δ1 (PLC-δ1) is one of the most extensively studied PH domains. It has been proposed that it regulates the membrane localization of PLC-δ1 (7Cifuentes M.E. Honkanen L. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11586-11593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ramirez F. Jain M.K. Prot. Struct. Funct.

Peterson A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) (10Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

Despite the rather low sequence similarity among the PH domain families, the secondary and tertiary structural motifs of the PH domain are highly conserved (3Bottomley M.J. Salim K. Panayotou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Takeuchi H. Yagisawa H. Jpn. J.

Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). A high resolution structural model of the rat PLC-δ1 PH domain forming a complex with Ins(1,4,5)P3 has been determined by x-ray diffraction study at 1.9-Å resolution (11Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The model consists of a seven-stranded β sandwich formed by two orthogonal anti-parallel β-sheets and a C-terminal amphipathic α-helix. These are conserved structural motifs among the PH domains whose structures have been determined by x-ray diffraction and NMR studies. The loops between the β strands, particularly the β1/β2, β3/β4, and β6/β7 loops, differ greatly among the PH domains, and, in the case of the PLC-δ1 PH domain, the β1/β2 and β3/β4 loops mainly interact with Ins(1,4,5)P3. The β5/β6 loop of the PLC-δ1 PH domain includes a characteristic short amphipathic α-helix (α2-helix) that is not found in other PH domain model structures studied so far. Because functionally important intermolecular interactions of PLC-δ1 with its ligand, PtdIns(4,5)P2, or other proteins included in the signal transduction pathways (e.g. transglutaminase II (Gαh)) take place at the membrane surface (12Yagisawa H.

Commun. 2002; 293: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), structural information of PLC-δ1 at the membrane surface is indispensable for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the functions of PLC-δ1. The conformation and dynamics of peripheral membrane proteins at the lipid bilayer surface are expected to be different from those in solution, due to intermolecular interactions between the protein and lipids, changes in pH and ionic strength induced by surface charges of the membrane, and drastic changes in the dielectric constant at the lipid bilayer surface. Despite the importance of the PLC-δ1 structure at the lipid bilayer surface, there is virtually no structural information about the peripheral membrane proteins at the membrane surface, due to a lack of means of investigating the molecular structure of proteins at the lipid bilayer surface at atomic resolution. In this study, we applied solid state NMR as a novel method of gaining insights into atomic level structural information of a peripheral membrane protein at the membrane surface under conditions similar to those of natural membranes. Solid state NMR is a highly suitable technique for this purpose, because it can provide information about the conformation and dynamics of individual amino acid residues in an intact protein under a wide variety of conditions, including those in a protein-lipid vesicle complex suspended in buffer at ambient temperature. By metabolic introduction of carbon-13-labeled alanine residues into a protein as NMR probes, the local conformation and dynamics of selectively labeled amino acid residues are readily analyzed (15Tuzi S.

Here, we applied this “site-directed” high resolution solid state 13C NMR technique to the PH domain of PLC-δ1 as the first trial of a high resolution solid state NMR investigation of peripheral membrane proteins involved in lipid signal transduction pathways and obtained evidence for the conformational change of the PH domain at the membrane surface. Materials—Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) from bovine liver was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). PtdIns(4,5)P2 from bovine brain and Ins(1,4,5)P3 were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). l-[3-13C]Alanine was from CIL (Andover, MA). All reagents were used without further purification. Expression Vector and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The cDNA encoding rat aortic PLC-δ1 fragment (1–140) was subcloned into a pGEX-2T-based bacterial expression vector (pGEX-2T from Amersham Biosciences), designated pGST3. Individual point mutations were introduced into the plasmid pGST3-PLC-δ1 Δ(141–768) encoding the PH domain of the wild type enzyme by T4 DNA polymerase-based mutagenesis using a Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech). The selection primer was (5′-GGTTTCTTAGTCGACAGGTGGCAC-3′), which converts the AatII site (3502–3525) of pGST/PLC-δ1 Δ(141–768) into a SalI site, and the mutagenic primers were A21L, 5′-ACCCGGACCTTCAGCTCCTTCTGAAGGGCA-3′; A88G, 5′-TGGAGAAGTTTGGCCGAGACATCCCCGAG-3′; A112G, 5′-ACCCTAGACCTCATTGGCCCATCACCAGCTGA-3′; A116L, 5′-TTGCCCCATCACCACTTGACGCTCAGCACT-3′; and A118G, 5′-ATCACCAGCTGACGGTCAGCACTGGGTG-3′. The desired point mutation and the sequence flanking the mutagenic primer-annealing site were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Protein Expression and Purification—The wild-type and mutated PLC-δ1 PH domains (1–140) were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli (PR745) (20Yagisawa H. Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Sakuma K. Tanaka H. Yabuta N. Kamata H. Hirata H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20179-20188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in M9 medium (1Mayer B.J. Ren R. Clark K.L. Baltimore D. Cell. 1993; 73: 629-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), which contains 100 mg of each of 20 amino acids but with l-alanine replaced by l-[3-13C]alanine and were incubated in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (5 h at 37 °C). After centrifugation, the resulting cell pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 units/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mm banzamidine) and subjected to sonication using a Vibra cell (Sonics and materials). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min). The [3-13C]Ala-labeled PLC-δ1 PH domain-GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) affinity chromatography, and the [3-13C]Ala-labeled PLC-δ1 PH domain was consequently obtained by cleavage of the link between the PH domain and GST using thrombin (Sigma). The amino acid sequence of the wild type PLC-δ1PH domain is shown in Fig. 1. Final preparations of the wild type and mutant PH domains included additional amino acid residues, GSRST- and -ELGPRPNWPTS, at the N and C termini of the natural amino acid sequence, respectively. Solid State 13C NMR Sample Preparation—The [3-13C]Ala-labeled PLC-δ1 PH domain-PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicle complexes were prepared as follows: PtdCho and PtdIns(4,5)P2 dissolved in chloroform (molar ratio of PtdCho and PtdIns(4,5)P2 was 20:1) were cast on glass to form a thin film. After evaporation of the chloroform in vacuo for 1 day, the lipids were suspended in 20 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.025% NaN3 followed by three freeze-thaw cycles. The process for the preparation of whole vesicles was performed under N2 atmosphere to prevent oxidization of the phospholipids. The phospholipid vesicle suspensions were mixed with the purified wild-type and mutant [3-13C]Ala-labeled PLC-δ1 PH domains in 20 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.025% NaN3 (molar ratio of PtdCho, PtdIns, and PH domain was 40:2:1) and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C to allow complex formation. The protein-vesicle complexes were concentrated by ultra-centrifugation (541,000 × g for 6 h at 4 °C). The [3-13C]Ala-labeled PLC-δ1 PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex was prepared by mixing the PH domain and Ins(1,4,5)P3 solutions (10 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5) containing 25 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.025% NaN3; the molar ratio of the PH domain and Ins(1,4,5)P3 was 1:1.1). The PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration using Microcon YM-3 (Amicon). The [3-13C]Ala-labeled PH domain-PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicle complexes and the [3-13C]Ala-labeled PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex were placed in a 5-mm outer diameter zirconia pencil-type solid state NMR sample rotor and sealed with epoxy resin to prevent evaporation of water. Measurement of Solid State 13C NMR Spectra—High resolution solid state 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Infinity 400 spectrometer (13C: 100.6 MHz), using cross polarization-magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) and single pulse excitation dipolar decoupled-magic angle spinning (DD-MAS) methods. The spectral width, acquisition time, and repetition time for CP-MAS and DD-MAS experiments were 40 kHz, 50 ms, and 4 s, respectively. The contact time for the CP-MAS experiment was 1 ms. Free induction decays were acquired with 2,048 data points and Fourier-transformed as 32,768 data points after 30,720 data points were zero-filled. The π/2 pulses for carbon and protons were 5.0 μs, and the spinning rates were 4 kHz. The dipolar decoupling field strength was 55 kHz unless indicated otherwise in the text. Transients were accumulated 20,000–40,000 times until a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio was achieved. The 13C chemical shifts were referenced to the carboxyl signal of glycine (176.03 ppm from tetramethylsilane (TMS)) and then expressed as relative shifts from the TMS value. Measurement of Dynamic Light Scattering—Dynamic light scattering of the wild-type PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex in 10 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5) containing 25 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.025% NaN3 was measured at 20 °C using a Dyna Pro dynamic light scattering/molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions). The molecular weights of the monomeric or oligomeric PLC-δ1 PH domain particles were estimated from the particle sizes by assuming the particles had a spherical shape. NMR Spectra of [3-13C]Ala Residues in the PLC-δ1 PH Domain-Ins(1,4,5)P 3 Complex— Fig. 2 (A and B) shows NMR spectra of the [3-13C]Ala-labeled PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex in solution measured using the single pulse excitation dipolar decoupled-magic angle spinning (DD-MAS) method using different amplitudes of magnetic fields for dipolar decoupling: 19 and 55 kHz. Five narrow peaks resonating at 14.55, 15.35, 15.77, 17.49, and 18.46 ppm in Fig. 2A, which are unaffected by dipolar decoupling field strength, are ascribed to the 13C-labeled side-chain methyl groups of five alanine residues in the monomeric or oligomeric PH domain. The dipole-dipole interactions between 1H and 13C nuclei that cause serious increases in the line width of 13C signals are decoupled by fast isotropic rotational motions of the small PH domain particles. A peak at 11.41 ppm, indicated by an asterisk, is thought to be an artifact because of the lack of reproducibility. An obvious increase in line width of the peak at 16.79 ppm under the weaker decoupling field (Fig. 2A) indicates that this signal arises from larger complexes that undergo slow rotational motions with a frequency lower than 105 Hz, that of 1H-13C dipolar interactions. Dynamic light scattering measurement indicated that the [3-13C]Ala-labeled PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex forms two components with different particle sizes in solution. A major component consists of particles with a hydrodynamic radius of 1.5–5 nm and average molecular mass between 19 and 50 kDa. A minor component consists of particles with a hydrodynamic radius greater than 10 nm and an average molecular mass higher than 5 MDa. The former component is thought to comprise the monomeric, dimeric, and/or trimeric PH domains, and the latter aggregated represents clusters of PH domains consisting of a large number of molecules. These results support the above-mentioned assignments of the signals to particles with different sizes. Although the large aggregated clusters undergo slow rotational motions, these motions are sufficiently fast to eliminate most of the dipole-dipole interaction between 1H and 13C nuclei that is required to form magnetization through cross-relaxation between 1H and 13C nuclei, because no signal was observed using the cross polarization-magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) method (data not shown). Studies of synthetic polypeptides, structural proteins, and membrane proteins have shown that the chemical shift of the Cβ carbon in the Ala residue in high resolution solid state 13C NMR is primarily determined by the torsion angles (ϕ,φ) of the main chain of the residue itself (21Saito H. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1986; 24: 835-852Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 22Saito H. Ando I. Annu. Rep. NMR Spectrosc. 1989; 21: 209-290Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 23Saito H. Tuzi S. Naito A. Annu. Rep. NMR Spectrosc. 1998; 36: 79-121Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The narrow line widths and the symmetric line shape of the peaks from the smaller particles in Fig. 2A reveal that the conformation of the Ala residues in the monomeric PH domain and dimer and/or trimer, if any, observed by NMR are identical, showing no structural variation that causes displacement of chemical shifts. The buffer composition of the [3-13C]Ala-labeled PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex solution was the same as the crystallization buffer used in the x-ray diffraction study in which the three-dimensional structural model of the PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex was determined (11Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Because the secondary structures of the PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex in solution is expected to be similar to those of the complex in the crystal, the narrow peaks observed in the 13C NMR spectra of the PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex (Fig. 2A) were assigned on the basis of the conformational dependence of chemical shift and the three-dimensional model structure of the PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex. The chemical shifts of the Cβ carbons of Ala residues contained in the typical α-helix (14.9 ppm) and β-sheet (19.9 ppm) of poly l-alanine and random coil (16.9 ppm) of the C terminus of bacteriorhodopsin (16Saito H. Tuzi S. Yamaguchi S. Tanio M. Naito A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Tuzi S. Naito A. Saito H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15046-15052Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) are shown by vertical bars at the bottom of Fig. 2. The peaks resonated at 14. 55, 15.35, and 15.77 ppm in Fig. 2A, similar to the chemical shifts of the typical α-helix attributed to three Ala residues, Ala-21, Ala-116, and Ala-118, contained in the α helices at the N and C termini of the PH domain. The peak at 18.46 ppm can be ascribed to the Ala-112 located at the C terminus of the β7 strand of the PH domain based on the chemical shift similar to that of the β-sheet. The peak at 17.49 ppm, whose chemical shift does not correspond to any secondary structure, is ascribed to Ala-88 contained in the loop between the β5 and β6 strands (the β5/β6 loop). These assignments of the peaks were found to be consistent with the assignments of the NMR spectra of the PH domain-PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicle complex based on site-directed replacements of the Ala residues as described below. The chemical shift of the peak arising from the large aggregated particle, 16.79 ppm, agrees with the chemical shift of the C-terminal random coil of bacteriorhodopsin. This signal presumably comes from the mobile random coil moiety of the large denatured aggregate. High Resolution Solid State NMR Spectra of the PH Domain-PtdIns(4,5)P 2 Complex— Fig. 3 (A and B) show DD-MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra of the [3-13C]Ala-labeled PH domain forming a complex with PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 liposome suspended in buffer solution at 20 °C. The chemical shifts of the signals from the [3-13C]Ala-labeled PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex are shown by vertical bars at the bottom of the spectra. The signals from the lipid molecules are indicated by asterisks. The relative intensity of the lipid signals in the CP-MAS spectrum (Fig. 3B) is lower than that in the DD-MAS spectrum (Fig. 3A) because of the lower efficiency of magnetization formation through the cross-polarization process due to the high mobility of the lipid molecules. Chemical shifts of the peaks at 14.41, 15.37, and 15.83 ppm in the CP-MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 3B) and those at 15.40 and 15.83 ppm in the DD-MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 3A) are very similar to those of the peaks observed for the PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex (14.55, 15.35, and 15.77 ppm; Fig. 2A). In contrast to these signals, the signals resonated at 17.49 and 18.46 ppm in the spectra of the PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex (Fig. 2A) show an upfield displacement to 16.99 ppm and a downfield displacement up to 19.1 ppm, respectively. To assign these signals, mutant PH domains in which Ala residues are replaced by Gly or Leu residues are prepared. Fig. 4 (A and B) show the CP-MAS NMR spectra of the [3-13C]Ala-labeled A112G mutant PH domain in which Ala-112 is replaced by Gly and A88G mutant PH domain in which Ala-88 is replaced by Gly forming complexes with PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicles, respectively. The signals resonating between 18.5 and 19.1 ppm (Figs. 3B and 4A) were assigned to Ala-112 based on the disappearance of these peaks in the spectrum of A112G. The replacement of Ala-112 by Gly induced downfield displacement of the peak at 16.99 ppm in the CP-MAS spectrum of the wild type PH domain (Fig. 3B) to 17.50 ppm (Fig. 4B). The peaks at 15.37 and 15.83 ppm in the CP-MAS NMR spectrum of the wild type PH domain (Fig. 3B) were also shifted in the range of 15.51 and 16.40 ppm (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4C shows the CP-MAS NMR spectrum of the [3-13C]Ala-labeled A88G mutant PH domain. The peak at 16.99 ppm in the CP-MAS spectrum of the wild type PH domain (Figs. 3B and 4A) was assigned to Ala-88, because this peak disappeared in the spectrum of A88G (Fig. 4C). Fig. 5 (A–C) shows the DD-MAS NMR spectra of A116L, A118G, and A21L mutant PH domain-PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicle complexes, respectively. The signals resonating at 15.83 and 15.40 ppm were ascribed to Ala-116 and Ala-118 based on the disappearances of the peaks indicated by arrows in the spectra of A116L (Fig. 5A) and A118G (Fig. 5B), respectively. As shown by a closed triangle in Fig. 5B, a strong suppression of the signal of Ala-112 was induced by the replacement of Ala-118 by Gly. This suppression would be caused by decrease in an efficiency of the dipole decoupling due to an interference between the frequency of the dipole decoupling field (55 kHz) and a newly induced thermal motion of the Ala-112 residue at a frequency around 104-105 Hz (25Rothwell W.P. Waugh J.S. J. Chem. Phys. 1981; 75: 2721-2732Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The removal of the side-chain methyl group of Ala-118 could facilitate such a thermal motion of Ala-112, because the side chain of Ala-118 is in van der Waals contact with the side chain of Ala-112 in the three-dimensional model structure. Fig. 5C shows the DD-MAS spectrum of A21L mutant PH domain-PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicle complex. A remarkably intense signal at 16.9 ppm indicated by an open triangle was ascribed to the random coil structure of the denatured PH domain included in the aggregated cluster similar to that observed for the PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex (Fig. 2). The replacement of Ala-21 might reduce a stability of the PH domain. Because the peaks at 15.83 and 15.40 ppm remained intact in the spectrum of A21L, the peak resonating at 14.41 ppm in the CP-MAS spectrum of the wild type PH domain-PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicle complex (Fig. 3B) could be ascribed to Ala-21, although an effort of direct assignment from a removal of the peak by the replacement of Ala-21 was unsuccessful due to the intense signal of the methyl carbon of the lipid resonated at 14.20 ppm either in the DD-MAS or CP-MAS spectra of the A21L mutant PH domain-PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicle complex.Fig. 4CP-MAS NMR spectra of the [3-13C]Ala-labeled PLC-δ1 PH domain-PtdIns(4,5)P 2 complexes measured at 20 °C.

Conversely, the upfield displacement of 0.50 ppm from 17.49 ppm in the spectrum of the PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex (Fig. 2A) observed for the peak at 16.99 ppm in the CP-MAS spectrum (Fig. 3B) indicates a significant conformational change of the Ala-88 in the β5/β6 loop. The slight upfield displacement of this signal from 16.99 ppm in the CP-MAS NMR spectrum to 16.89 ppm in the DD-MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 3A) could be the result of a minor contribution to the signal from a small amount of the aggregated cluster of the denatured PH domain observed at 16.79 ppm in the DD-MAS NMR spectra (Fig. 2, A and B). The broad signal resonating between 18.5 and 19.4 ppm in the DD-MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra of the PH domain-PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicle complex (Fig. 3, A and B), corresponding to the peak of the PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex at 18.46 ppm (Fig. 2A), is attributed to the coexistence of a variety of different conformations of Ala-112 at the C terminus of the β7 strand. Notably, the higher relative signal intensity of the peak at 18.82 ppm in the CP-MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 3B) compared with that in the DD-MAS spectrum (Fig. 3A) indicates that the Ala-112 taking the conformation corresponding to this peak is highly immobile. Fig. 6 (A and B) shows the DD-MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra of the PH domain-PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicle complex, respectively, at 4 °C (solid trace) and 20 °C (dotted trace). In the CP-MAS NMR spectrum at 4 °C, a peak at 14.27 ppm originating from the phospholipid methyl groups is enhanced due to the improved cross-polarization efficiency caused by decrease in mobility of the lipid molecules at 4 °C (Fig. 6B). In the DD-MAS spectrum at 4 °C, the relative intensity of the Ala-112 signal increased to form a new peak at 18.78 ppm (Fig. 6A). In the CP-MAS spectrum at 4 °C, the line width of the Ala-112 signal resonating at 18.77 ppm is narrower than that in the spectrum at 20 °C (Fig. 6B). These changes indicate that the conformation of Ala-112 corresponding to the chemical shift of 18.77–18.78 ppm, which is most immobile at 20 °C, becomes dominant at 4 °C. In this study, we aimed to gain insights into the structural features of the PH domain at the lipid bilayer surface when the domain forms a complex with PtdIns(4,5)P2. The PH domain of PLC-δ1 forms a high affinity complex with either PtdIns(4,5)P2 or Ins(1,4,5)P3 with comparable binding constants (10Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) through a specific interaction between the phosphoinositol group and the side chains located at the basic surface of the PH domain (e.g. the β1/β2 and β3/β4 loops) (11Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). There is a possibility, however, that additional interactions between the PH domain and the lipid bilayer contribute to the characteristics of the PH domain at the membrane surface, such as binding affinity, conformation, mobility, and orientation. Such nonspecific interactions might be responsible for the dependence of binding affinity of the PH domain to inositol compounds on assay conditions, such as pH, ionic composition of buffer, or lipid composition of membrane (4Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Takeuchi H. Yagisawa H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Possible candidates for such interactions are electrostatic interactions between the positively charged surface of the PH domain, which is not involved in the specific interaction with PtdIns(4,5)P2 and the lipid head groups, and hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic surfaces of the PH domain and the hydrophobic inner layer of the lipid bilayer. These interactions, if any, would modify the conformation, dynamics, and orientation of the PH domain at the lipid bilayer surface, which in turn, would influence lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions at the membrane surface involved in signal transduction pathways. In the case of multidomain proteins such as PLC-δ1, which contains the PH domain, EF-hands, an active site domain and a C2 domain, intramolecular interaction between the domains would also be affected by the conformational characteristics of the domains at the membrane surfaces. As shown in Fig. 3, changes in the 13C NMR spectra of the [3-13C]Ala-labeled PLC-δ1 PH domain clearly revealed conformational changes induced by localization of the domain at the surface of the PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicle. The changes in the PH domain structure were found to occur in the vicinity of the β5/β6 loop containing Ala-88 and the C terminus of the β7 strand containing Ala-112. In contrast, the N- and C-terminal α-helices located at the surface opposite to the ligand binding site of the PH domain showed virtually no conformational change. The side chains of Leu-84 and Ala-88 in the β5/β6 loop and Ile-111 in the β7 strand form a hydrophobic cluster between the α-helix in the β5/β6 loop (α2-helix; Fig. 7A) and the β7 strand according to the three-dimensional model structure of the PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex (11Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The proximity of Ala-88 and Ala-112 in the model structure suggests a relationship between these residues in the conformational changes. The origin of the upfield displacement of the Ala-88 signal is ascribed to a direct interaction between the α2-helix and the membrane, considering the close location of the β5/β6 loop to the positively charged lipid-binding surface of the PH domain (Fig. 7A). Taking into account the highly amphipathic nature of the α2-helix (as shown in Fig. 7B by a helical wheel), it is plausible to predict a hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic face of the α2-helix and the hydrophobic inner layer of the lipid bilayer. In fact, x-ray diffraction studies of membrane binding states of synthetic model peptides (26Hristova K. Wimley W.C. Mishra V.K. Anantharamiah G.M. Segrest J.P. White S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 27White S.H. Ladokhin A.S. Jayasinghe S. Hristova K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32395-32398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) have suggested that such a hydrophobic interaction facilitates the orientation of an amphipathic α-helix parallel to the membrane plane at the interface between the layer of the polar head groups and the inner layer of the membrane. The reorientation of the α2-helix is thought to cause an opening of the hydrophobic cluster between the α2-helix and the β7 strand (Fig. 7C). As a result, hydrophobic interaction between the newly exposed hydrophobic surface and the inner layer of the lipid bilayer may induce tilted orientation of the PH domain (Fig. 7C, right). The downfield displacement of the Ala-112 signal to the chemical shift of the typical β sheet, together with the reduction of mobility at the membrane surface, suggests the formation of an additional hydrogen bond at the C terminus of the β7 strand between the carbonyl group of Ala-112 and the amide group of Arg-95. The formation of a new hydrogen bond elongates the anti-parallel β sheet structure of the β6 and β7 strands and stabilizes it (Fig. 8). This conformational change is consistent with the above-mentioned “open and tilt” model. The opening of the β5/β6 loop would result in the breakage of a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of Pro-92 and the amide group of Arg-95 contained in the β turn connecting the β5/β6 loop and the β7 strand. As shown in Fig. 8, the rupture of this hydrogen bond is expected to facilitate formation of a hydrogen bond between the amide group of Arg-95 and the carbonyl group of Ala-112. Because only changes of three torsion angles, φ of Asp-94 and ϕ and φ of Arg-95, are required for the reorientation of the amide group of Arg-95, this reconstitution of the hydrogen bond is expected to occur readily. The chemical shift of the Ala-112 signal at 4 °C (18.77–18.78 ppm; Fig. 6) reflects the conformation with the lowest energy at the membrane surface that might include the hydrogen bond between Arg-95 and Ala-112. Another reason for the origin of the conformational change at the C terminus of the β7 strand is interaction between the β6/β7 loop located at the positively charged surface of the PH domain and the polar head groups of the lipids. Because the β6/β7 loop does not contribute to the specific interaction between the PH domain and Ins(1,4,5)P3 in the model structure, except by an indirect hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of Thr-107 and the 4-phosphate of Ins(1,4,5)P3, nonspecific electrostatic interactions between the charged side chains of this loop (Lys-102, Asp-103, and Arg-105) and the polar head groups of phospholipids are likely to occur at the membrane surface. A variety of these nonspecific interactions might induce a variety of conformations of Ala-112 at the C terminus of the β7 strand through conformational change of the main chains of the β6 and β7 strands.Fig. 8A possible conformational change in the vicinity of Ala-112 at the membrane surface. The conformation and hydrogen bonds proposed in the model structure (11Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) (left) could change into the structure containing a newly formed hydrogen bond between Arg-95 and Ala-112 and the consequently elongated β6 and β7 strands (blue arrows) at the membrane surface (right). Pro-92 and Arg-95 are expressed as blue circles, and Ala-112 as a green circle. Dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds. Reorientation of the amido group of Arg-95 is shown as an open red arrow.

These auxiliary mechanisms for membrane binding are probably susceptible to assay conditions, such as the structures of the hydrophobic acyl-chains of the lipids, surface charges of the membrane, pH value, and ionic strength of the buffer (4Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Takeuchi H. Yagisawa H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For example, although it has been reported that the K d value of the PLC-δ1PH domain-PtdIns(4,5)P2 interaction measured using dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC)-PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicles is 1.66 μm, eight times larger than that of the PLC-δ1 PH domain-Ins(1,4,5)P3 interaction (210 nm) (10Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), the affinity of the PLC-δ1 PH domain to PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the natural membrane could be different and might be higher than that observed for the DMPC vesicle system due to the presence of unsaturated acyl chains. Although more detailed structural information about the membrane binding state of the PH domain is required to judge the validity of these models, the results of the solid state NMR experiments clearly indicate that the PLC-δ1 PH domain has an unique conformation and dynamics at the lipid bilayer surface, which are different from those in solution. The structural information at the membrane surface is indispensable for gaining insights into the molecular mechanisms of the functions of peripheral membrane proteins. Our results also proved that solid state NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for obtaining structural information about peripheral membrane proteins at the membrane surface under conditions mimicking physiological conditions."

Crystallographic studies of the ERα ligand-binding domain suggest that Leu-536 may be involved in hydrophobic interactions at the start of a helix, “helix 12,” that is crucial in the agonist-stimulated activity of ERα, as well as in the ability of antagonists to block the activity of ERα. We found that certain mutations of Leu-536 increased the ligand-independent activity of ERα although greatly reducing or eliminating the agonist activity of 17β-estradiol (E2) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT), on an estrogen response element-driven and an AP-1-driven reporter. The mutations impaired the interaction of the ER ligand-binding domain with the SRC1 receptor-interacting domain in a mammalian two-hybrid system. When tested in the yeast two-hybrid system, mutation of Leu-536 increased the basal reactivity of ERα to probes that recognize the agonist-bound conformation but did not significantly alter its reactivity to these probes in the presence of E2. Most interestingly, mutation of Leu-536 reduced the interaction of the 4OHT-bound ERα and increased the reactivity of the raloxifene- or ICI 182,780-bound ERα, with probes that recognize the 4OHT-bound ERα conformation in a yeast two-hybrid system.

The human estrogen receptor-α (hERα) 1The abbreviations used are: hERα, human estrogen receptor-α; E2, 17β-estradiol; 4OHT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; DBD, DNA-binding domain; LBD, ligand-binding domain; ERE, estrogen response element; SERMs, selective estrogen receptor modulators; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RLU, relative luciferase unit(s); wt, wild type; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid(s); RID, receptor interacting domain; DES, diethylstilbestrol. is an allosteric protein whose activity is modulated by the binding of ligands, including estradiol (E2), the cognate ligand, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT), the active metabolite of a drug used in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer (1Evans R.M.

Like other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, hERα is a multidomain protein having an N-terminal domain, a centrally located DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) that is near the C terminus of the protein (1Evans R.M.

The DNA-binding domain mediates the binding of ER to estrogen response elements (EREs) of estrogen-regulated genes (4Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P.

Transcriptional enhancement results from the synergistic action of two separate activation functions, AF-1 and AF-2, that are located within the N-terminal domain and the LBD, respectively (5Berry M.

Whereas the action of AF1 can be independent of hormone, AF2 requires hormone for its activity (6Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tassett D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P.

The coactivator proteins, in turn, recruit histone acetyltransferases to the complex (2Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The ERα can also modulate transcription at AP-1 sites through protein-protein interactions (16Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N. Kwok G.R. McInerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Nilsson S. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1672-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Drugs that antagonize estrogen action, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI 182,780, are used to treat and prevent breast cancer (18The Consensus Conference on Treatment of Estrogen Deficiency Symptoms in Women Surviving Breast CancerObstet. Gynecol. Surv. 1998; 53 (Consensus statement, S2-S10): S1-S83PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gradishar W.J. Curr. Treat. Options Oncol. 2003; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Because tamoxifen and raloxifene show tissue-specific agonist, as well as antagonist, effects, they are referred to as selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs. The agonist activity of SERMs is due at least in part to AF-1 (20Shang Y. Brown M. Science. 2002; 295: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 21Smith C.L. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). To develop compounds with desirable profiles of agonist and antagonist activity, particularly for use as breast cancer prevention agents that need to be taken for extended periods of time, it is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms through which these compounds exert their tissue-specific agonist and antagonist activity. Crystallographic studies of the 4OHT- and raloxifene-bound LBD show that the extended side chains of these ligands displace helix 12, which then occupies the coactivator binding groove and blocks the binding of coactivators to AF2 (13Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 390: 753-758Crossref Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 14Shiau A.K. Barstad D.

The orientation of helix 12 is, therefore, a critical determinant of the activity of the ligand-bound hERα. Interestingly, the position at which helix 12 initiates is different in the agonist- and antagonist-bound structures; helix 12 starts at Asp-538 in the agonist-bound structure and at Leu-536 in the antagonist-bound structures (13Brzozowski A.M.

Particular motifs termed “capping motifs” have frequently been found to stabilize the start of α helices in model peptides and in proteins. These motifs, which are characterized by the dihedral angles of the peptide backbone as well as by the pattern of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues at the start of the helix, use hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions to stabilize the start of α helices (reviewed in Ref. 22Aurora R. Rose G.D. Prot. Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Leu-536 has previously been suggested to be part of a capping motif at the start of helix 12 in the agonist-bound ERα; it could participate in a hydrophobic interaction with the hydrophobic residues Leu-540 and/or Leu-541 within the helix (23Skafar D.F. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 33: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Examination of the crystallographic structures shows that, in the diethylstilbestrol-bound ERα LBD (Protein Data Bank code 3ERD, the side chain of Leu-536 is oriented toward the ligand and the core of the LBD in one molecule, possibly interacting with the side chains of Leu-540 and Leu-541, but it projects away into the solvent in the other. On the other hand, no side chain of Leu-536 is visible in the estradiol-bound ERα LBD (PDB code 1ERE (13Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 390: 753-758Crossref Scopus (2963) Google Scholar)). In the 4-OHT-bound complex (PDB code 3ERT (14Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar)), Leu-536 points toward the core of the LBD. In the complex with raloxifene (PDB code 1ERR (13Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 390: 753-758Crossref Scopus (2963) Google Scholar)), the side chain of Leu-536 is in direct contact with the ligand and so is predicted to play a role in sensing the nature of the bound ligand (Fig. 1) (13Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 390: 753-758Crossref Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 14Shiau A.K. Barstad D.

We therefore wanted to determine the role of hydrophobic interactions involving Leu-536 in the E2-bound and the tamoxifen-bound states by examining the effects of mutating Leu-536 on the activity and conformation of ERα. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium without phenol red was obtained from Invitrogen; dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal calf serum was purchased from HyClone. Estradiol and 4-hydroxytamoxifen were purchased from Sigma. ICI 182,780 was purchased from Tocris, and raloxifene was obtained from Eli Lilly. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega). SuperFect and plasmid preparation kits were purchased from Qiagen. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) vector and EGFP-specific Color Antibody were purchased from Clontech. ERα-specific Ab-1, which recognizes an epitope in the AB domains of the receptor, was purchased from NeoMarkers. The ECL™ (Amersham Biosciences) detection system was used to visualize bands in Western immunoblotting. [3H]Estradiol, 40–60 Ci/mmol, was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Construction of Vectors—The expression vector containing the estrogen receptor α cDNA, HEGO in pSG5, was the generous gift of Drs. Pierre Chambon and Hinrich Gronemeyer. Mutants at Leu-536 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Gene Editor kit (Promega). The mutations converted leucine 536 to alanine (L536A), glutamic acid (L536E), glycine (L536G), isoleucine (L536I), lysine (L536K), or asparagine (L536N). The pAP1-luc reporter vector was constructed by cloning a DNA fragment corresponding to the AP-1 consensus sequence from the promoter region of human collagenase 1 (-73 to -52) into the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites of the multicloning region of pLuc-MCS vector, which has a simple TATA box between the multicloning site and the firefly luciferase coding region (Stratagene). The single strands of the AP1 site (sense: AGCTTATGAGTCAGACACCTCTGGCTTC and antisense: tcgagaagccagaggtgtctgactcata) were synthesized by Operon and were annealed into double strands for cloning. The p2ERE-luc reporter vector was constructed by cloning a DNA fragment containing two estrogen response elements corresponding to the consensus vitellogenin ERE into the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites in the vector pLuc-MCS. The single strands (sense: AGCTTCTAGAGGATCCAGGTCACAGTGACCTGGGCCCGGATCCGGGCCCAGGTCACAGTGACCTGGCCC and antisense: tcgagggccaggtcactgtgacctgggcccggatccgggcccaggtcactgtgacctggatcctctaga) were synthesized by Operon and were annealed prior to cloning. The nature of each mutant ER and the constructed reporter vectors was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The internal control vector pRL-SV40 was purchased from Promega. The expression vectors for mammalian two hybrid assay, which will produce the Gal4-ERα LBD and VP16-SRC1 fusion proteins, were generated by cloning ERα LBD amino acids 264–595 into pBind-CMV and SRC1 amino acids 190–400 into pAct-CMV (Promega). The Gal4-ER LBD fusion protein contains a yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain, which will bind to the Gal4 binding sites of the pG5luc reporter vector (Promega). The VP16-SRC1 fusion protein possesses the VP16 activation domain. In addition, the pBind-CMV vector expresses Renilla luciferase for normalizing transfection efficiency. For detecting the binding of estradiol to the wt and mutated ERα, the cDNA encoding Ser-282 to Val-595 of the receptor was inserted into the multicloning site of pET-42b(+) (Novagen). Construction of Yeast Two-hybrid Vectors—Yeast strains EGY48, MATα his3 trp1 ura3 leu2::6LexAop-LEU2, and RFY206, MATa his3Δ200 leu2–3 lys2Δ201 trp1Δ::hisG ura3–52, have been described (24Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 25Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) and were purchased from Origene. The plasmids for B42-monobody, B42-SRC-1 fusions, and pEGERα297–595 have been described (26Koide A. Abbatiello S. Rothgery L. Koide S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Variants of pEGERα297–595 with Leu-536 mutations were constructed by subcloning the NcoI-BamHI fragment (BamHI digestion was followed by Klenow treatment) of pSG-hER-Leu-536 mutants into the NcoI-XhoI segment (XhoI digestion followed by Klenow treatment) of pEGERα297–595. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assays—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal calf serum without phenol red. Cells (3 × 105/well) were seeded in six-well dishes and 20 h later cotransfected by 0.8 μg of ERα expression vector (wild-type or mutant), 50 ng of pRL-SV40 with either 2 μg of p2ERE-luc or pAP1-luc reporter plasmid using SuperFect as carrier. After 4 h, the transfection medium was removed and replaced with culture medium containing ethanol (vehicle control), 17-β estradiol (0.1, 1, 10, or 100 nm), or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (0.1, 1, 10, or 100 nm and 1 μm). After 48 h, the cells were harvested and the luciferase activity was measured with the Dual Luciferase Assay kit on a Turner 20/20 luminometer. The activity of firefly luciferase reporter was normalized to the activity of Renilla luciferase expressed from the internal control vector pRL-SV40, and the results are expressed as relative luciferase units (RLUs). Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—For determination of the interactions between SRC1 and the wt or mutated ERα, HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of pBind-ERα (wt or mutant), 1.2 μg of pAct-SRC1, and 1.5 μg of pG5luc using SuperFect. The empty vectors, either 1.0 μg of pBind-CMV or 1.2 μg pAct-CMV, were also transfected into parallel cultures of HeLa cells as negative controls. After 3 h, the transfection medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and culture medium containing ethanol (vehicle control) or 17β estradiol (100 nm) and then maintained for an additional 24 h. The cells were then harvested, and luciferase activity was measured with the Dual Luciferase Assay kit on a Turner 20/20 luminometer. The activity of firefly luciferase was normalized to the activity of the Renilla luciferase. Western Blotting—HeLa cells were transfected with vectors expressing the wt or mutated ERα and the EGFP vector, from which enhanced green fluorescent protein was translated and used as internal control. The whole cell extracts were prepared, and SDS-gel electrophoresis was carried out. The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was immunoblotted with ERα-specific Ab-1, and with EGFP-specific Color Antibody. Bands were visualized using the ECL™ system. Binding of Estradiol to the wt and Mutant ERα—BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) was used as host for expressing a GST-tagged ERα(S282-V595) fusion protein. After transformation with pET-42b(+)-hERα, a single colony was cultured in 4 ml of LB broth with glucose (1%), chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml), and kanamycin (35 μg/ml) until the A 600 was between 0.6 and 1. Two milliliters of the culture was transferred to 25 ml of the same medium and cultured to a density of 0.6 of A 600 at 37 °C with shaking. 20 ml of the culture was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 0.4 mm for 4 h at room temperature (about 25 °C), and the cells were collected by centrifugation. Cell extracts were prepared following procedures similar to those described in Ref. 27Zhong L. Skafar D.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4209-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, with the exceptions that cells were lysed using a French press, and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min. Aliquots (200 μl) of the cell extracts containing wild-type or mutant ERαs were incubated with 50 nm [3H]estradiol for 1 h at 0 °C. The nonspecific binding was determined in a parallel set of incubations containing a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled estradiol. Free and bound steroids were separated by dextran/charcoal assay. The concentration of protein in the cell extracts was measured using the Bradford protein assay. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast was grown in YPD media or YC dropout media following instructions from Origene and Invitrogen. Quantitative assays were performed using the RFY206 strain containing all plasmids as described previously for the interactions of SRC-1, monobodies (small binding proteins) E3#6, E2#23, and the hERα mutants (26Koide A. Abbatiello S. Rothgery L. Koide S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To measure interactions of monobodies OHT#1 and OHT#33 with the Leu-536 mutants, EGY48 harboring the monobody plasmid and RFY206 harboring the hERα-EF plasmid and pSH18–34 were mated, and then β-galactosidase assays were performed on the diploid cells. Assays using haploid and diploid cells, respectively, yielded essentially the same results (not shown). Data Analysis—To analyze the activity of the wt and mutated ER on the ERE-driven and AP-1-driven reporters and in the mammalian two-hybrid assay (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), the data were first subjected to a log transformation. Random effects-generalized linear models were used to assess the statistical significance of differences in response; observations from experiments run on the same day were assumed to be correlated. The first model fitted included indicators for mutants, for ligand concentrations, and for their interaction. Ligand concentrations were included in the model as indicator variables to avoid constraining the shape of the relationship between concentration and response. If the simultaneous test for interaction terms was not significant, a reduced model was fitted in which the interaction terms were omitted. Finally, an even simpler model was fitted in which ligand was parameterized as presence or absence, collapsed over different concentrations. If there was significant interaction in the full model, separate models were fitted for each mutant in which ligands were compared. In the case of significant interaction, separate models for each ligand were also fitted, and the mutants were compared. Holm's stepdown procedure was used to control type I errors when making multiple tests among coefficients. Model goodness of fit was assessed graphically.Fig. 3Response of the wt and mutant hERα to 4OHT and ICI 182,780 on an ERE-driven promoter. The activity of ER in response to 4-OHT and ICI 182,780 was measured using transiently transfected HeLa cells as described under “Experimental Procedures” and the legend to Fig. 2, with the exception that single concentrations of the indicated ligands were used. The ligand concentrations used were 4-OHT, 10-7m, and ICI 182,780, 10-6m. The values are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Response of the wt and mutant hERα to 4OHT on an AP-1-driven promoter.

Leu-536 was replaced with residues having a negatively charged (glutamic acid, L536E), a positively charged (lysine, L536K), a polar (asparagine, L536N), a small (alanine, L536A, and glycine, L536G), and the isomeric (isoleucine, L536I) side chain. We then tested the activity of the mutants in a transient cotransfection assay in HeLa cells. Cells were transiently cotransfected with a wt ERα or a mutant expression vector, and a reporter plasmid containing either two consensus EREs or an AP1 consensus sequence upstream of a simple TATA box linked with the firefly luciferase coding sequence, and a transfection control vector that constitutively expresses the Renilla luciferase (pRL-SV40). Using this system, we examined the transcriptional response of the wt and mutated ERs to the endogenous agonist E2, the SERM 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and the antagonist ICI 182,780. Activity of the Leu-536 Mutants at an ERE-driven Promoter—Mutation of Leu-536 alters the response of ERα to E2 (p = 0.03). The wt ERα and the L536I mutant exhibited 18- and 6-fold higher transcriptional activity in the presence of E2 than their basal activity, respectively (Fig. 2). Remarkably, all other mutants have lost the E2 dependence of their transcription activity (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the activity of the L536A, L536E, L536I, and L536K mutants in the presence of E2 is less than the activity of the E2-stimulated wt ER (p = 0.05 for L536E; all others p < 0.001). No consistent differences in the level of expression of the wt and mutant proteins were detected by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 2). We tested whether the loss of response to E2 was due to an inability of receptors having mutations at Leu-536 to bind hormone. We expressed GST-tagged ERα(S282-V595) having the wt or mutated ER sequence in E. coli and measured the binding of [3H]estradiol (50 nm) in cell extracts. All GST-ER(S282-V595) fusion proteins bound estradiol in vitro, at levels ranging from 10.6 ± 2.5 pmol of [3H]E2 bound/mg of protein for the non-mutated ER sequence, up to 76 ± 20 pmol of [3H]E2 bound/mg of protein for the L536G mutation (n = 3). Therefore, the lack of effect of E2 on transcription activation was not due to a loss of hormonebinding activity. Moreover, ERs having mutations at Leu-536 exhibit estradiol-dependent activity in yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays, which provides additional support for their ability to bind E2 (see below). These results show that the presence of a large hydrophobic residue, either leucine or isoleucine, at position 536 of the hERα is critical for the ability of E2 to sti"

FucU, a paralogue of RbsD conserved from bacteria to human, is also the only protein whose function is unknown among the seven gene products of the l-fucose regulon. Here we report the crystal structures of Bacillus subtilis RbsD, which reveals a novel decameric toroidal assembly of the protein. Nuclear magnetic resonance and other studies on RbsD reveal that the intersubunit cleft of the protein binds specific forms of d-ribose, but it does not have an enzyme activity toward the sugar. Likewise, FucU binds l-fucose but lacks an enzyme activity toward this sugar. We conclude that RbsD and FucU are cytoplasmic sugar-binding proteins, a novel class of proteins whose functional role may lie in helping influx of the sugar substrates.

The Escherichia coli high affinity ribose transport system consists of six proteins encoded by the rbs operon (rbsD, -A, -C, -B, -K, and -R). Ribose-binding protein (RBP 1The abbreviations used are: RBP, ribose-binding protein; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry.; encoded by rbsB) binds d-ribose at the periplasmic space (1Willis R.C. Furlong C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6926-6929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sugar-bound form of RBP interacts with the membrane-bound permease (encoded by rbsC) that transports ribose across the inner membrane (2Furlong C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) coupled with the action of the ATP-binding cassette component (encoded by rbsA) (3Buckel S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7659-7662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transported d-ribose is phosphorylated into d-ribose 5-phosphate by ribokinase (encoded by rbsK), which is believed to be the first step for the utilization of the sugar in biosynthetic or metabolic pathways (4Anderson A. Cooper R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 177: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). RbsR is the repressor that binds to the transcriptional start site of the rbs operon. Among the six components, RbsD is the only protein whose function is unknown. The only clue about the function of RbsD is that it enhances the ribose uptake and growth of a mutant E. coli strain lacking the rbs operon but containing plasmid-encoded RbsK and mutated glucose transporter ptsG on its genome, which allows transport of d-ribose at low affinity (5Oh H. Park Y. Park C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14006-14011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). mcd-Ribose in solution exists as multiple forms: β-pyranose (58.9%), α-pyranose (20.3%), β-furanose (13.3%), α-furanose (7.4%), and open chain aldehyde form (0.13%) (6Drew K.N. Zajicek J. Bondo G. Bose B. Serianni A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 307: 199-209Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, d-ribose in biomolecules is exclusively in the furanose forms, the five-membered ring forms. The cyclic forms of the sugar interconvert spontaneously via the least populated acyclic aldehyde. Surprisingly, ribokinase binds and phosphorylates the α-furanose form of d-ribose, the least populated ring form (7Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For an efficient supply of the α-furanose form of d-ribose to ribokinase, an enzymatic activity of increasing the interconversion between the different forms of the sugar may be required, or the spontaneous conversion of the sugar at physiological conditions is fast enough so that such an enzyme activity is unnecessary. A sequence alignment shows that RbsD is found in a variety of bacteria and that an evolutionarily conserved protein FucU (Fucose, Unknown) is a close paralogue of RbsD, with any compared pair of RbsD and FucU homologues sharing about 20% amino acid sequence identity with each other. Prokaryotic FucU exists as a component of fucose regulon (8Zhu Y. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2352-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T.

Drake R. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5685-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The fucose regulon encodes the following seven components: fucose permease (l-fucose H+ symporter), fucose isomerase, fuculose kinase, fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase, 1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase, regulatory protein, and FucU (9Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6024) Google Scholar). Of these, FucU is the only protein whose function is unknown. l-Fucose is the major component in various oligo- and polysaccharides and glycosides in mammals as well as bacteria and plant (12Flowers H.M. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1981; 39: 279-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The isomerization of l-fucose into l-fuculose, which is subsequently phosphorylated into fuculose 1-phosphate, is the first step in the degradation of the sugar (13Chen Y.M. Zhu Y. Lin E.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 210: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Or l-fucose is converted into l-fucose 1-phosphate by fucose kinase as the first step in the synthesis of fucose-containing oligo- and polysaccharides (11Park S.H. Pastuszak I. Drake R. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5685-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The conservation of FucU in higher organisms including human highlights the functional significance of the protein. Both FucU and RbsD, containing no signal sequence, must be cytoplasmic proteins. We sought to elucidate the biochemical function of RbsD and FucU on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of RbsD or FucU to provide a complete picture of the energy-driven transport of ribose and fucose. We determined the structure of Bacillus subtilis RbsD, which reveals a novel protein fold that associates into a homodecameric assembly. Crystallographic and other physicobiochemical studies led to the conclusion that RbsD binds specifically the β-anomeric forms of d-ribose and FucU binds l-fucose, revealing the existence of cytoplasmic sugar-binding proteins. The name is coined reminiscent of the periplasmic sugar-binding proteins that are one component of the proteins involved in the active transport of various neutral sugars. A potential role of these proteins may lie in helping translocation of sugar substrates into cells. Overexpression, Purification, and Crystallization of RbsD—E. coli RbsD and B. subtilis RbsDs were cloned from respective genomes and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The purification and crystallization of E. coli RbsD were reported (14Kim M.S. Oh H. Park C. Oh B.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Luria-Bertani media containing 0.1 mg ml–1 ampicillin. The expression of the protein was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at an optical density of 0.6 at 37 °C for 7 h. Both RbsDs were produced without a tag, which was the right choice since the both N and C termini are involved in the oligomerization of the proteins. B. subtilis RbsD was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (50–60% fractionation) and column chromatographic separation employing a Hitrap Q (Amersham Biosciences) and a Hiload 26/60 Superdex 200 size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein was concentrated to 10 mg ml–1 in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 m NaCl and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The crystals of B. subtilis RbsD were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion method against reservoir solution containing 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 19% isopropyl alcohol, and 100 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5). Overexpression and Purification of E. coli FucU—The E. coli FucU was amplified by the PCR technique from E. coli cell lysate. The PCR products were ligated into pET21a vector (Novagen). The resulting vector was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The expression of recombinant FucU protein was induced by 1 mm IPTG at an optical density of 0.4 at 37 °C for 7 h. Bacterial lysate was prepared by sonication in a buffer solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (30% fractionation) and using a Q-Sepharose fast-flow column (Amersham Biosciences). The purified FucU was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Overexpression and Purification of E. coli Ribokinase—The E. coli RbsK gene was amplified by the PCR method from E. coli cell lysate. The PCR products were ligated into pPROEX HTa vector (Invitrogen) and introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The protein was expressed as a fusion protein containing a His6 tag at the N terminus. The cells were grown in Luria-Bertani media containing 0.1 mg ml–1 of ampicillin. The expression of the protein was induced by 1 mm IPTG at an optical density of 0.6 at 18 °C for 7 h. Bacterial lysate was prepared by sonication in buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.1 m NaCl. The fusion protein bound to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) was eluted with buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole after washing the column with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions containing RbsK were dialyzed against buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Structure Determination of RbsD in Complex with Glycerol—Initially, we tried to solve the structure of E. coli RbsD. Although we obtained the crystals of the protein (14Kim M.S. Oh H. Park C. Oh B.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), difficulty with cryocooling of the crystals hampered the determination of the structure. Subsequently, we switched to B. subtilis RbsD, whose crystals were easier to handle. The crystals belong to the space group C2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 123.52, b = 108.66, c = 83.31 Å, and β = 128.68°. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contained a pentameric ring of RbsD molecules. A data set at three different wavelengths was collected with a selenomethionyl RbsD crystal at 100 K on the beamline 6B of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory at Pohang, Korea, and were processed using the HKL software (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). Before cryocooling, crystals were briefly immersed in the same precipitant solution containing 7% glycerol. Ten selenium sites in the asymmetric unit of the crystal were located and used for phase determination at 2.8 Å with the program SOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), and phases were subsequently improved by density modification with the program RESOLVE (17Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). The electron density was of excellent quality showing nearly all features of protein side chains. The program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) was used for model building, and refinement was performed against 2.3-Å native data with the CNS package (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). From the beginning of the chain tracing, binding of glycerol to the protein was apparent. Determination the Structures of RbsD and the Protein in Complex with Ribose or Ribose 5-Phosphate—Diffraction data were collected at room temperature with crystals mounted on a capillary tubes using a Rigaku Raxis IV2+ area detector system on a rotating anode generator. For the structure determination of the complexes, a small amount of d-ribose or d-ribose 5-phosphate was introduced directly into the crystallization drops using a hair, which then sat at least overnight before data collection. The RbsD structure and the structures of the complexes were solved by direct refinement of the structure of the RbsD-glycerol complex against each of the two data sets. The resulting models fell within the limits of all the quality criteria of the program PROCHECK (20Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab NMR Spectroscopy— 13C NMR spectra of d-[1-13C]ribose and 1H NMR spectra of l-fucose were collected with Bruker DRX500 spectrometer at 25 °C with proton decoupling. For 13C NMR spectra, a total of 16 transients (ribose only) or 256 transients (ribose + RbsD) in 64 K data points, relaxation time of 2.0 s, and spectral width of 10,000 Hz were used. For 1H NMR spectra, a total of 64 transients in 32 K data points, relaxation time of 2.0 s, and spectral width of 7,000 Hz were used. No line broadening was employed in processing free induction decays with XWIN-NMR software (Bruker Instruments). The 13C chemical shift was referenced from the reported value for C-1 of the α-pyranose form of d-ribose (6Drew K.N. Zajicek J. Bondo G. Bose B. Serianni A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 307: 199-209Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the 1H chemical shift was referenced from that of the water peak set to 4.6 ppm. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—All measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a MicroCalorimetry System (Microcal). RbsD and FucU were dialyzed against a buffer solution containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.6) and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. d-Ribose, d-ribose 5-phosphate, and l-fucose were dissolved in the same buffer. The samples were degassed for 20 min and centrifuged to remove any residuals prior to the measurements. Dilution enthalpies were determined in separate experiments (titrant into buffer) and subtracted from the enthalpies of the binding between the proteins and the sugars. Data were analyzed using the Origin software (OriginLab Corp.). Description of the Structure of RbsD—Unless stated otherwise, RbsD refers to B. subtilis RbsD throughout the text. The structure of RbsD was determined with multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing by using one selenomethionine derivative crystal of the protein (Table I). The final model, refined against data to 2.3-Å resolution, consists of all the residues, 5 glycerol molecules, 2 chloride ions, and 369 water molecules. The electron densities for all the backbone atoms are well defined. The 5 RbsD molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal are associated in a head-to-tail fashion to form a pentameric ring structure, which tightly interacts with the adjacent pentameric ring that is related by the crystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 1a). The inner and the outer diameter of the ring is ∼20 and 80 Å, respectively, whereas the thickness of the decameric assembly is ∼60 Å. Extremely tight interactions between the two pentameric toroids obscure physical distinction of the two, whereas the 5 molecules on a pentameric toroid are discernible. We reported previously that E. coli RbsD is an octamer in solution on the basis of an analytical centrifugation analysis (14Kim M.S. Oh H. Park C. Oh B.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, the structure of E. coli RbsD, determined by the molecular replacement method, shows that it is also a decamer (data not shown). The incorrect conclusion is ascribed to the non-globular shape of the quaternary structure of the protein. The subunit structure can be described as an α/β fold with the central 6-stranded β-sheet sandwiched by three α-helices on one side and one α-helix plus one β-strand-like loop on the other side (Fig. 1b). The N-terminal loop (residues 1–9) of one molecule is extended from the main body of the structure and tightly interacts with three adjacent molecules on the decameric assembly. A strong and round electron density was found surrounded by the amino group of Lys-2 and water molecules at the interface of the pentameric rings (Fig. 1c). This cage, which is completely buried inside the protein, is most likely to arise from binding of a chloride ion. The same feature is found in the structure of E. coli RbsD, and Lys-2 is conserved in all but two RbsD homologues in the sequence data bases, suggesting that this ion cage is important for the assembly and stability of the decameric structure. A search for analogous folding architectures in the PDB data base using the program Dali (21Holm L. Sanders C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) revealed that the structure of RbsD is distinct from any other known protein folds. The structure of a hypothetical trimeric protein YjgF (Protein Data Bank code 1QU9; Z-score 3.5), listed as the closest match, is obviously different from that of RbsD. Unlike the structure of RbsD, one side of the central β-sheet of YjgF has no peptide segment and serves as the trimeric interface of the protein. We found that the clefts between the RbsD subunits bind glycerol (data not shown) when the crystals were immersed in the cryoprotectant containing 7% glycerol before data collection. It has been commonly observed that enzymes with a toroidal structure have the active site at the interface between adjacent subunits (for examples, 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, cyanase, muconolactone isomerase, and glutamine synthetase), indicating that the oligomer formation is vital for the enzyme activity. The interaction between RbsD and glycerol is weak when assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). It was not possible to measure the dissociation constant K D by this method. The high concentration of glycerol present in the cryoprotectant presumably allowed the observation of the bound glycerol. Glycerol may be one of the polyol compounds that are able to bind fortuitously to the binding pocket of RbsD that is designed to interact most strongly with d-ribose (discussed below). The interaction of RbsD with glycerol is presumably physiologically irrelevant. RbsD Lacks an Enzyme Activity toward Ribose—We recorded 13C NMR spectra of d-[1-13C]ribose in the presence and absence of RbsD. The addition of RbsD did not give rise to new peaks, demonstrating that the protein lacks an enzyme activity to convert d-ribose into other compounds. Instead, it caused significant broadening of the resonances arising from the 13C-1 atoms of the β-pyranose and β-furanose forms but not those of the α-furanose and α-pyranose forms (Fig. 2). These spectroscopic data indicate that RbsD binds both the β-anomeric forms of d-ribose but not the α-anomeric forms of the sugar. Because the NMR spectrum does not indicate binding of the α-anomeric d-ribose, RbsD is not an anomerase, which catalyzes the interconversion between the α- and β-anomeric forms of the sugar. We considered the possibility of RbsD being an enzyme that could increase the interconversion between the β-anomeric forms and the open chain form of d-ribose. If RbsD has this enzyme activity, the line broadening of the two NMR peaks would be due to chemical exchange process between the β-furanose and β-pyranose forms of d-ribose with the open chain aldehyde. Such an enzyme activity could enhance the availability of the least populated α-furanose form of d-ribose for ribokinase. For example, when the α-furanose form is depleted (a non-equilibrium situation), rapid conversion of β-anomeric forms into the open chain form should increase the appearance of the α-furanose form through the spontaneous conversion of the open chain form into the α-furanose form. We cloned and overexpressed E. coli ribokinase and measured the enzyme activity of phosphorylating ribose in the presence and absence of RbsD according to the method reported in the literature (22Andersson C.E. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). RbsD did not enhance the enzyme activity of ribokinase (data not shown), indicating that the protein does not have this hypothetical enzyme activity. We also compared the rates of the change in the optical rotation of freshly dissolved solid d-ribose, which is exclusively in the β-furanose form, in the presence and absence of RbsD. Consistent with the enzymatic assay of ribokinase, the protein did not enhance the rate. Binding of the β-Pyranose Form of d-Ribose—The exposure of the intersubunit clefts to the bulk solvent in the RbsD crystals facilitated the determination of the structures of RbsD in complex with d-ribose or d-ribose 5-phosphate using the crystals soaked with each of the two compounds. In order to avoid competition of glycerol for binding to the clefts, data were collected at room temperature. With a d-ribose-soaked crystal, less featured “fat” electron density was found at each of the 10 intersubunit clefts (Fig. 3). The poorly defined electron density, despite the high resolution of the data (1.95 Å), suggested the binding of ribose molecules in different configurations. Given the NMR data demonstrating the binding affinity of RbsD for the both β-pyranose and β-furanose form of d-ribose, we first interpreted the density with the most populated β-pyranose form of d-ribose. The modeled β-pyranose in a standard chair conformation mostly accounted for the electron density (Fig. 3a). The sugar-binding mode reveals that one of the two adjacent RbsD molecules provides a predominant contribution over the other. Asp-28, His-98, Lys-102 (via a water molecule), Tyr-120, and Asn-122 of one subunit and only His-20 of an adjacent subunit are in contact with the bound ribose. The aromatic ring of Tyr-120 is packed against the hydrophobic part of the bound sugar, a typical pattern frequently observed in the protein-sugar interactions. The bound ribose molecule fits tightly into the intersubunit cleft and leaves almost no room (Fig. 3b). Binding of the β-Furanose Form of d-Ribose—Interpretation of the fat electron density with the β-furanose form of d-ribose was impossible. The electron density did not show the feature of the –CH2OH group of the furanose form. We determined the binding mode of the β-furanose form indirectly by elucidating the 2.05-Å resolution structure of RbsD in complex with d-ribose 5-phosphate, whose ring form is exclusively the furanose form. As expected, the electron density for the five-membered ring was defined well enough to allow the unambiguous fitting of the sugar ring (Fig. 3c). The phosphorylated sugar that we used was the mixture of the α- and β-anomers. The electron density indicated that RbsD binds selectively the β-anomer of d-ribose 5-phosphate, which is consistent with the NMR data. The result also supports the conclusion that RbsD is not an anomerase. The atomic temperature factors of the –CH2OPO32- group are over 80 Å, and the electron density for this group is missing (methylene part) or diffused (phosphate group). As the phosphate group of the bound sugar barely interacts with the protein, the β-furanose form of d-ribose would bind to the protein in the same mode observed for d-ribose 5-phosphate. Notably, Asn-122 does not interact with the bound ribose 5-phosphate. In order to confirm the correctness of the crystallographically deduced sugar-binding modes, we substituted His-98 with alanine, whose imidazole ring provides a hydrogen bond to the both β-anomeric forms of the sugar (Fig. 3). The NMR spectrum of d-[1-13C]ribose in the presence of the mutant RbsD exhibits significantly less broadening of the two peaks corresponding to the β-anomers of d-ribose (Fig. 2) than in the presence of the wild-type RbsD, indicating that the sugar-binding affinity of the mutant is reduced. This is consistent with the deduced sugar-binding modes. Sugar-binding Residues Are Virtually Invariant—A sequence alignment reveals that Asp-28, His-98, Asn-122, and His-20 are invariant, whereas Lys-102 and Tyr-120 are 100% homologously conserved, among the 40 deposited sequences of RbsD homologues except for three entries. The conservation of the sugar-binding residues is significant in that Pro-32 and Gly-105 are the only two residues that are more than 97% conserved among the RbsD homologues. One of the three exceptions is NP_326431 (annotated as Mycoplasma pulmonis RbsD, GenBank™), which contains two substitutions of His-20 with threonine and His-98 with asparagine (Fig. 4). The other two entries in GenBank™ are NP_407075 and ZP_00060076, which contain a substitution of Lys-102 with histidine and a substitution of Tyr-120 with asparagine, respectively. Interestingly, two of the three genes are not a component of a canonical rbs operon but are associated with genes coding for putative phosphotransferase enzyme II, A and B (NP_326431, GenBank™), or araC family transcriptional regulatory protein (NP_407075, GenBank™), which does not share sequence homology with RbsR. The two genes are likely to be RbsD paralogues whose gene products have binding specificity for sugars different from ribose. The observation raises a possibility that the energy-driven transport of neutral sugars other than ribose and fucose may also require biochemical activity similar to that of RbsD in some organisms. FucU Lacks an Enzyme Activity toward l-Fucose—FucU, a close relative of RbsD, is a highly conserved protein; E. coli FucU shares 50% sequence identity with human FucU (Fig. 4). We cloned and purified E. coli FucU, which shares 21% sequence identity with RbsD. The elution times of the two proteins from a size-exclusion Superdex 200 column were the same, indicating that FucU also adopts a decameric quaternary structure similar to that of RbsD. In FucU, the ribose-binding residues His-20, Asp-28, Tyr-120, and Asn-122 in RbsD are also 100% conserved, whereas His-98 and Lys-102 are substituted with and strictly conserved as arginine and tyrosine, respectively (Fig. 4). l-Fucose is d-ribose containing the 6-methyl group and having a different configuration at the C-2 position. Most likely, these substitutions provide FucU with specificity and affinity for binding l-fucose. We recorded the 1H NMR spectrum of l-fucose in the presence and absence of FucU (Fig. 5). The 1H NMR peaks of l-fucose did not change after a 2-h incubation of the mixture at room temperature, demonstrating that FucU lacks an enzyme activity of converting l-fucose to a product. Weak Sugar-binding Affinity of RbsD and FucU—We analyzed the interactions of RbsD and FucU with sugar molecules by ITC. The isothermal titration curve for ribose 5-phosphate readily indicated that the binding affinity of RbsD for this phosphorylated sugar is quite weak and prevented us from obtaining the dissociation constant by this method (Fig. 6a). However, it was possible to analyze the titration curve obtained for the interaction between RbsD and d-ribose (Fig. 6b). The analysis led to the K D value of 0.93 mm. The data demonstrate that the β-pyranose form binds to RbsD more strongly than the β-furanose form of ribose. In the data analysis, we assumed that the β-pyranose form of d-ribose contributes solely to the heat release in the titration, and we used the equilibrium concentration of this form of the sugar in solution. Considering some contribution by the β-furanose form to the heat release during the titration, the actual K D values for the interaction between the two should be slightly higher than 0.93 mm. FucU binds l-fucose also weakly with the K D value of 1.61 mm (Fig. 6c). In analyzing the data, we assumed that FucU binds α- and β-forms of l-fucose with the same affinity, because the anomeric specificity of FucU is unknown. The binding affinity between RbsD and d-ribose is quite low. The differential gain of free energy in the transfer of ribose from the solvent to the binding cleft of RbsD seems small due to the excellent hydrogen-bonding capacity of the sugar molecule in water. The mode of interaction between RbsD and ribose is uniquely distinguished from that between periplasmic RBP and ribose. Although the ribose of binding to RbsD does not induce a noticeable conformational change of the backbone or a side chain of the protein (data not shown), the binding of ribose to periplasmic RBP triggers a large domain movement that leads to the shielding of the bound ribose from the bulk solvent and the formation of new interactions between protein atoms (23Bjorkman A.J. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Consequently, the binding of ribose to periplasmic RBP is substantially tight, exhibiting the K D value of 0.13 μm (24Bjorkman A.J. Binnie R.A. Zhang H. Cole L.B. Hermodson M.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30206-30211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What Would Be the Biological Role(s) of RbsD and FucU?— We demonstrated that the biochemical function of RbsD and FucU is to bind specific forms of d-ribose and fucose, respectively. The residues at the sugar-binding site in the both proteins are remarkably conserved. Therefore, the functional role(s) of the proteins must be related to this sugar binding activity. We ruled out an effector function, because the ribose-bound structures of RbsD exhibit no noticeable conformational change of the protein compared with the structure of the uncomplexed RbsD, and the oligomerization state of RbsD is not the result of the ribose binding. RbsD does not appear to be an essential enzyme at the downstream of RbsK, because the E. coli ptsG mutant cells lacking RbsD but containing RbsK can grow on ribose as the only carbon source (5Oh H. Park Y. Park C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14006-14011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A 4-fold enhancement of the ribose uptake by expressing RbsD in this mutant (5Oh H. Park Y. Park C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14006-14011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) is presumably because of the action of the protein upstream of RbsK. Noticeably, ribokinase specifically phosphorylates the α-furanose form of d-ribose, the least populated ring form of the sugar (7Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), whereas RbsD selectively binds the β-anomeric forms of d-ribose that account for about 72% equilibrium population of the sugar. Therefore, without directly competing with ribokinase, RbsD would be able to play a role that requires binding of d-ribose. In playing the role, the low affinity of RbsD for ribose may be required for minimal interference with the availability to ribokinase of the α-furanose form of d-ribose, which is generated through the nonenzymatic conversion of the free β-anomers. We do not know how RbsD would exert its cellular function by binding to the β-anomers of d-ribose. The functional role may lie in facilitating the influx of the sugar substrate, the event upstream of RbsK. In prokaryotic cells, fucose permease appears primarily responsible for the energy-driven uptake of l-fucose (25Gunn F.J. Tate C.G. Sansom C.E. Henderson P.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). FucU may play a similar role as RbsD by binding l-fucose. We do not know yet the anomeric specificity of FucU in binding l-fucose due to unavailability of commercial C-13-labeled l-fucose and difficulties in obtaining suitable crystals of the protein. It remains to be determined whether, like RbsD, FucU may bind specifically an anomeric form of l-fucose that is not used by fucose isomerase or fucose kinase, the first enzymes in the utilization the sugar. The membrane-bound fucose permease and ribose permease (RbsC) are unrelated proteins. The mutated ptsG is also unrelated to RbsC, but the overexpression of RbsD enhances the ribose uptake through this transporter (5Oh H. Park Y. Park C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14006-14011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that RbsD and FucU do not interact directly with their respective permease component to exert function. Concluding Remarks—The existence of periplasmic ligand-binding proteins has long been known. The biochemical functions and action modes of these proteins are well characterized. The novel protein fold of RbsD and the sugar binding activity of RbsD and FucU characterized in this study reveal the existence of the cytoplasmic sugar-binding proteins. Although RbsD genes are found only in bacteria, FucU genes are also found in mouse and human genomes, which underscores the functional importance of the protein. The two genes must have been derived from the same ancestral gene and evolved to have different sugar-binding affinities. It remains to be determined whether there are unidentified cytoplasmic sugar-binding proteins with different ligand specificity that act on the transport of other neutral sugars. The two RbsD homologues described above are potential candidates. It is possible that remote homologues of RbsD may play roles in the influx of other sugars. The biochemical function of RbsD and FucU identified in this study is to bind d-ribose and l-fucose, respectively. The sugar binding activity of the proteins should be tightly linked to the utilization of these sugars, because the gene expressions of RbsD and FucU are regulated as a part of the rbs operon or the fucose regulon in prokaryotes. In depth in vivo study should be necessary to elucidate the biological roles of RbsD and FucU. The presented structures and the common biochemical function of the two proteins delineated in this study are a footstep toward gaining a complete picture for the energy-driven transport of the neutral sugars.

This phenomenon is a representative form of immune tolerance to exogenous antigen under physiological conditions. We have previously reported that long term feeding of dietary antigen to ovalbumin-specific T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice induced oral tolerance of peripheral T cells with impairment in their TCR-induced calcium-signaling pathway. In this study, we utilized two-dimensional electrophoresis to compare intracellular protein expression patterns of orally tolerant and unsensitized CD4 T cells. We detected 26 increased and 16 decreased protein spots and identified 35 of these by mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the expression of caspases was up-regulated and that the protein levels of intact proteins susceptible to caspase cleavage, such as Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (GADS), were decreased in orally tolerant CD4 T cells. Western blotting experiments confirmed that expression of the active form of caspase-3 and the antiapoptotic factor, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, were both up-regulated in orally tolerant CD4 T cells, which were found to be nonapoptotic. We further demonstrated that orally tolerant CD4 T cells could not form normal TCR signaling complexes associated with GADS and showed down-regulated phospholipase C-γ1 activation, which is likely to contribute to the impairment of TCR-induced calcium signaling. Our findings indicate that orally tolerant CD4 T cells up-regulate caspase activation and show decreased levels of caspase-targeted proteins, including TCR signaling-associated molecules, while up-regulating antiapoptotic factors, all of which appear to contribute to their unique tolerant characteristics.

This phenomenon is thought to prevent hypersensitivity to ingested antigen (1Strober W. Kelsall B. Marth T. J. Clin. Immunol. 1998; 18: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 2Garside P. Mowat A.M. Semin.

Acad. Sci. 2002; 958: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, it is believed to be an effective therapeutic tool for the treatment of autoimmune diseases (4Faria A.M. Weiner H.L. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 73: 153-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hanninen A. Scand. J. Immunol. 2000; 52: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As in the case of other forms of tolerance, oral tolerance is mediated at the T cell level (6Hirahara K. Hisatsune T. Nishijima K. Kato H. Shiho O. Kaminogawa S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6238-6245PubMed Google Scholar, 7Alpan O. Rudomen G. Matzinger P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4843-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Three mechanisms are well documented for oral tolerance induction: (a) Ag-specific T cell clonal deletion (8Chen Y. Inobe J. Marks R. Gonnella P. Kuchroo V.K. Weiner H.L.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of oral tolerance remain unclear. Previous studies demonstrated that Ag-specific T cell hyporesponsiveness was caused by defects in intracellular signaling events from the T cell receptor (TCR) and co-stimulatory molecules, such as incomplete protein phosphorylation (18Sloan-Lancaster J. Shaw A.S. Rothbard J.B. Allen P.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 913-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 19Dubois P.M. Andris F. Shapiro R.A. Gilliland L.K. Kaufman M. Urbain J.

Furthermore, genetic experiments, such as DNA array methods, have recently been performed to analyze hyporesponsive T cells entirely from multidirectional points (23Lechner O. Lauber J. Franzke A.

Cell. 2002; 109: 719-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). However, to date, there are no detailed studies dealing with tolerant T cells examining total specific protein expression levels. In the postgenomic era, proteome analysis is expected to be the bridge between the genomic sequence and protein characteristics underlying cellular behavior, since translated proteins can be posttranslationally modified (26Anderson N.L. Anderson N.G. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 27Pandey A. Mann M. Nature. 2000; 405: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar, 28Mann M. Hendrickson R.C. Pandey A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 437-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The development of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) provides the high resolution of complex protein mixtures with high reproducibility. In addition, the combination of 2-DE, modern mass spectrometry (MS) technology, and rapidly accumulating genomic sequence data permits accurate and speedy identification of cellular proteins. With these advances, proteome analysis can be utilized in the research of intracellular protein changes in cells following a certain stimulus. We have previously reported that long term feeding of dietary Ag to ovalbumin (OVA)-specific TCR transgenic mice (OVA23-3 mice) induced oral tolerance of peripheral T cells (29Asai K. Hachimura S. Kimura M. Toraya T. Yamashita M. Nakayama T. Kaminogawa S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4723-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this experimental model, orally tolerant T cells showed impaired calcium/NFAT signaling following TCR-mediated activation, despite normal activation of the mitogen-activated kinase pathway. In this study, we used oral tolerance-induced OVA23-3 mice to investigate the expression of intracellular proteins using 2-DE to analyze the specific characteristics of in vivo orally tolerized splenic CD4 T cells compared with unsensitized CD4 T cells. Mice—8–10-week-old BALB/c male mice were purchased from Clea Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Mice homozygous for the OVA peptide323–339/I-Ad-restricted TCR transgene from the T cell clone 7-3-7 on the BALB/c background (OVA23-3 mice) were produced as previously described (30Sato T. Sasahara T. Nakamura Y. Osaki T. Hasegawa T. Tadakuma T. Arata Y. Kumagai Y. Katsuki M. Habu S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). All studies were performed according to the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of the Faculty of Agriculture (University of Tokyo). OVA-specific Oral Tolerance Induction in OVA23-3 Mice—6–8-week-old OVA23-3 mice were orally administered with dietary Ag containing 20% hen egg white (egg white diet; Funabashi Farm, Funabashi, Japan) or a control diet (commercially available CE-2; Clea Inc.), for 28–30 days. Antibodies (Abs) and Reagents—For purification of CD4 T cells and flow cytometric analyses, FITC- or allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 monoclonal Ab (mAb) (H129.19), biotinylated anti-mouse CD45R/B220 mAb (RA3-6B2), and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse TCRβ chain mAb (H57-597) were all purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-mouse major histocompatibility complex class II mAb (M5/114.15.2) and anti-mouse CD11c mAb (N418) were purified from ascites and biotinylated in our laboratory according to standard techniques. Propidium iodide (PI) was purchased from Sigma. For the enrichment of CD4-positive cells, anti-mouse CD4 microbeads (Militenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) were used. For immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments, anti-X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) mAb (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (GADS) polyclonal Ab (pAb) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) mAb mixture (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-linker for activation of T cells (LAT) pAb (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-TCR-ζ chain mAb (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (RC20; BD Transduction Laboratories), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and anti-mouse IgG (New England Biolabs, Boston, MA) were used. Preparation of Splenic CD4 T Lymphocytes—Preparation of splenic CD4 T cells of OVA23-3 mice was performed using an Anti-FITC MultiSort kit (Militenyi Biotec) as follows. Splenocytes were labeled with anti-mouse CD4 mAb conjugated with FITC, biotinylated anti-mouse major histocompatibility complex class II mAb, biotinylated anti-mouse CD11c mAb, and biotinylated anti-mouse CD45R/B220 mAb. After washing and secondary labeling with anti-FITC microbeads, cells were subjected to positive enrichment via the magnetic column. After release of the anti-FITC microbeads, cells were relabeled with streptavidin-conjugated microbeads for negative selection. Isolated cells were both CD4- and TCRβ chain-positive and at greater than 98% purity, as assessed by flow cytometric analyses, and were regarded as CD4 T lymphocytes. Proliferation Assay and Cytokine Assay with Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—1 × 105 purified CD4 T cells were cultured with 0, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/ml OVA in flat bottom 96-well plates and 4 × 105 mitomycin C-treated BALB/c splenocytes as APCs in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma). For cytokine assays, supernatant samples were collected at 24 h for IL-2 and 48 h for IL-4, interferon (IFN)-γ, and IL-10. For the proliferation assays, cultures were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) after 48 h of incubation and harvested 24 h later. Cells were collected on glass fiber, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using paired Abs (BD PharMingen), as described previously (31Yoshida T. Hachimura S. Kaminogawa S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1997; 82: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). IL-10 production was measured using the OptEIA™ mouse IL-10 set (BD PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2-DE and Silver Staining—Purified CD4 T lymphocytes were lysed in 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 μg/ml DNase I, 2.5 μg/ml RNase, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), followed by sonication. Samples were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatants were used as the whole cell lysates. The first dimension of 2-DE was performed with linear pH 4.5–5.5 and 5.5–6.7/18-cm Immobiline DryStrips (Amersham Biosciences). DryStrips were rehydrated overnight at room temperature in 8 m urea, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 2% CHAPS, 2% IPG buffer (Amersham Biosciences) containing 150–250 μg of proteins. The first dimension electrophoresis was run using the following conditions: 100 V for 3 h, 300 V for 1 h, 500 V for 2 h, 700 V for 1 h, 1,000 V for 1 h, 1,500 V for 1 h, 2,000 V for 1 h, 2,500 V for 1 h, and 3,000 V for 20–24 h. After the first run, Immobiline DryStrips were equilibrated according to the manufacturer's recommendations and set on the 12.0% polyacrylamide gels for the second dimensional separation. After 2-DE, gels were silver-stained as previously described (32Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7797) Google Scholar). Stained gels were imaged with Gel dock (Bio-Rad), and spot intensity was measured using ImageGauge software (Fuji Photo Film, Kanagawa, Japan). Normalized spot intensities were calculated from more than 10 spots of each gel. Protein Identification by MALDI-TOF MS—In-gel tryptic digestions of excised protein spots were performed with modified protocols as previously described (33Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Briefly, destained gels were reduced and alkylated, followed by tryptic digestion (Promega, Madison, WI). Digested peptides were eluted with 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile. Peptides were concentrated and desalted using ZipTipC18 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified peptides were mixed with 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 0.2% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, acetonitrile (1:1) as a matrix. The mass spectra were recorded by Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Internal calibration was performed using autoproteolytic trypsin peptide fragments of 842.50 and 2211.1046 Da, and specific peaks were applied to the MS-fit program (available on the World Wide Web at prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0/msfit.htm). Proteins were identified with 50 ppm accuracy and a minimum of four matching peptides and 25% peptide coverage of total amino acids. Stimulation of CD4 T Lymphocytes with Abs—Purified CD4 T cells were stimulated with co-cross-linking of TCR and CD4 molecules with Abs for the indicated times as previously described in Ref. 29Asai K. Hachimura S. Kimura M. Toraya T. Yamashita M. Nakayama T. Kaminogawa S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4723-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For Western blots of the pro form and active form of caspase-3, harvested cells were lysed in CHAPS cell extract buffer (50 mm Pipes/KOH, pH 6.5, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor), and detections were performed using an apoptosis sampler kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Harvested cells were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation of stimulated CD4 T cells and in PLC lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor) for Western blot of whole cell lysate. Western blots of phosphotyrosine were performed as described in Ref. 29Asai K. Hachimura S. Kimura M. Toraya T. Yamashita M. Nakayama T. Kaminogawa S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4723-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. Other Western blots were performed as follows. Immunoblots were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS-Tween for 1 h, followed by probing with primary antibody for1hat room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBS-Tween three times, immunoblots were incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h. Immunoblots were then washed with TBS-Tween three times, and detections were performed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Early Apoptotic and Dead Cell Detection by Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—Splenocytes were enriched for CD4-positive cells with anti-CD4 microbeads and magnetic separation columns, according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Cells were then labeled with FITC-conjugated annexin V (Roche Applied Science), PI, and APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 mAb according to the manufacturer's instructions. Their staining profiles were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting LSR and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). DNA Fragmentation Assay—Triplicate 4 × 106 purified T cells were subjected to a DNA fragmentation assay with diphenylamine reagent as previously described in Ref. 34Kaji T. Kaieda I. Hisatsune T. Kaminogawa S. Nitric Oxide. 2002; 6: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar. Orally Tolerant CD4 T Lymphocytes Are Induced by Long Term Ag Administration—To obtain orally tolerant splenic CD4 T cells, OVA323–339-specific TCR transgenic mice (OVA23-3) were fed with dietary Ag (20% egg white diet) for 4 weeks. As shown in our previous study (29Asai K. Hachimura S. Kimura M. Toraya T. Yamashita M. Nakayama T. Kaminogawa S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4723-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), these CD4 T cells exhibited reduced proliferation and reduced IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ cytokine production when incubated with OVA and APCs in vitro (Fig. 1, A and B). These characteristics of CD4 T cells are evident after 4 consecutive weeks of oral administration of dietary Ag (data not shown). One known mechanism of tolerance induction is through the active suppression of regulatory T lymphocytes that subsequently produces negative regulatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β and IL-10; however, the production of IL-10 was not detected in this experimental system (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that the splenic CD4 T lymphocytes of OVA23-3 mice freely fed the egg white diet for 4 weeks demonstrated a form of oral tolerance that was not induced by active suppression. In Vivo Protein Expression Analysis of Orally Tolerant CD4 T Lymphocytes with 2-DE—To characterize protein expression levels of orally tolerant CD4 T cells, we compared these cells with unsensitized CD4 T cells obtained from control diet-fed OVA23-3 mice by 2-DE. We used whole cell lysates to represent the in vivo state of cellular proteins and to make an accurate comparative study. We also utilized narrow range immobilized pH gradient gels for the first dimension electrophoresis to obtain high resolution separation. Fig. 2A shows silver-stained two-dimensional separated gels from both control and orally tolerant CD4 T cells. The arrowheads show the up-regulated protein spots when the two gels were compared. We also used luminescent staining, which is known to deliver a wide quantitation range (35Berggren K. Chernokalskaya E. Steinberg T.H. Kemper C. Lopez M.F. Diwu Z. Haugland R.P. Patton W.F. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 2509-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), but could not produce the same sensitivity as observed using silver staining (data not shown). In relation to the detected spots, similar results were obtained when comparing spot intensities between gels. We detected 42 changed spots between pH 4.5 and 6.7, of which 26 were increased and 16 decreased for orally tolerant CD4 T cells. Of the differentially expressed spots, we identified 35 by peptide mass fingerprinting. Table I shows the peptide mass fingerprint results, which contain experimental and theoretical pI and molecular weights, NCBI protein accession number, the number of matching peptides, and the amino acid coverage of the obtained peptides. The -fold induction of the protein spots (orally tolerant versus control CD4 T cells) are also shown. There were some unidentified spots that had no matching proteins in the data base to date, although we could identify specific digested peptide peaks, or in some cases, the amount of protein expressed was too little to be precisely identified by this method.Table IUp-regulated and down-regulated proteins in orally tolerant CD4 T cellsSpot numberProtein spot-fold inductionIdentified proteinNCBI accession no.Theor. pITheor.

Open table in a new tab Caspase Activities in Orally Tolerant CD4 T Lymphocytes— Up-regulated proteins in orally tolerant CD4 T cells included both caspase-1 and caspase-3. The caspases are a family of cysteine aspartic acid proteases that play a central role in the regulation of apoptosis (36Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6146) Google Scholar). Activation of members of the caspase family requires their cleavage; for example, the pro form of caspase-3 (32 kDa) is cleaved into its active form (17 or 20 kDa) (37Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T. Yu V.L. et al.Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effector caspases are responsible for the cleavage of target proteins. In our results of 2-DE gels, some of the proteins identified with decreased expression levels in orally tolerant CD4 T cells have been reported to undergo caspase-dependent cleavage: i.e. STE20-like kinase MST-1, which promotes apoptosis after cleavage (38Graves J.D.

Noguchi K. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 43Mashima T. Naito M. Noguchi K. Miller D.K. Nicholson D.W. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and we found that the 31- and 29-kDa cleaved forms of actin were increased in orally tolerant CD4 T cells (Table I). These findings also suggest that active caspase-3 or -1 was up-regulated in orally tolerant CD4 T cells, although we only detected the pro form of caspase-3 or -1 up-regulation in 2-DE gels. Therefore, we next analyzed caspase-3 cleavage by Western blotting. As expected, the pro form and active form of caspase-3 were increased in orally tolerant CD4 T cells (Fig. 3A). These results sug"
https://openalex.org/W2026033091,"Streptomyces reticuli produces a 34.6-kDa surface-anchored protein (AbpS) whose surface-exposed N terminus binds strongly to Avicel, a dominantly crystalline type of cellulose. The generation of a large set of mutated abpS-genes and the subsequent analysis of the corresponding proteins in vitro as well as in vivo in a Streptomyces host allow the assignment of the following characteristics for AbpS. (i) Amino acid residues participating directly in the cellulose-interaction are located at the N terminus. (ii) As ascertained by cross-linking experiments, AbpS forms homotetramers in its soluble as well as cellulose-bound form. (iii) The intermolecular assembly of four AbpS molecules is governed by two domains (including amino acids 60–110 and 161–212). Both domains possess large portions of α-helical regions in which hydrophobic amino acids are located on one side as known from coiled-coil proteins. (iv) The C-terminal part of AbpS comprising 35 amino acids contains a transmembrane domain. Due to the surface-exposed N terminus of AbpS and the presence of transmembrane helix the C terminus has to be situated in the cytoplasm of the S. reticuli hyphae. Thus AbpS connects the interior of the mycelia with the extracellular space and binds cellulose using a unique cellulose-binding module.

Streptomycetes are aerobic Gram-positive soil bacteria, which are adapted optimally to their natural environment (1Alexander M. Introduction to Soil Microbiology, 2 Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1977Google Scholar). They undergo a complex process of morphological differentiation and growth, characterized by the formation of substrate mycelia, followed by a phase of aerial growth. Within the hyphae, chains of spores are formed (2Kelemen G.H. Buttner M.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Horinouchi S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 141: 1-9Crossref Google Scholar, 4Elliott M. Damji F.D. Passantino R. Chater K. Leskiw B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1549-1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their resistance to heat, dryness, or cold ensures survival of the strains in unfavorable periods (5Kutzner H.J. Starr M.P. Stolp H. Trüper H.G. Balows A. Schlegel H. The Prokaryotes: a Handbook on Habitats, Isolation and Identification of Bacteria. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1981: 2028-2090Google Scholar). The production of anti-microbial substances may inhibit growth of competing organisms (6Berdy J. Process Biochem. 1980; 15: 15-30Google Scholar). The utilization of biopolymers (i.e. cellulose, chitin, or xylan) is a typical characteristic of streptomycetes, as they possess a wide variety of the corresponding catabolic enzymes (7Peczynska-Czoch W. Mordarski M. Goodfellow M. Williams S.T. Mordarski M. Actinomycetes in Biotechnology. Academic Press, London1988: 219-283Crossref Google Scholar). Additionally Streptomyces hyphae are surrounded by cell walls, which protect them from osmotic or mechanical disruption and extracellular attacks. Murein (peptidoglycan) is the main cell wall polymer, consisting of glycan strands (β 1–4-linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid) and oligopeptides. These stem peptides are linked to the carboxyl group of N-acetylmuramic acid and interconnect glycan molecules via an interpeptide bridge. Peptidoglycan acts as permeability barrier, which should also be flexible, permitting morphological changes and allowing transport out of and into the mycelia (for reviews see Refs. 8Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 9Dijkstra A.J. Keck W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5555-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, teichoic acids are covalently linked to muramic acid residues in peptidoglycan (cell wall teichoic acids) and may constitute 60% of the cell-wall material. The physiological role of the cell wall teichoic acids is thought to be involved in ion exchange, keeping the peptidoglycan sacculus in an expanded state by charge repulsion and control of the activity of autolytic enzymes. Other functions are related to phage binding and immunogenicity (10Naumova I.B. Kuznetsov V.D. Kudrina K.S. Bezzubenkova A.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 126: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Naumova I.B. Shashkov A.S. Tul'skaya E.M. Streshinskaya G.M. Kozlova Y.I. Potekhina N.V. Evtushenko L.I. Stackebrandt E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 269-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the teichoic acids, proteins have been found to be associated with the cell wall. In Streptomyces species only few surface-exposed proteins have been described up to now. These include a 23-kDa protein from Streptomyces lividans (12Betzler M. Tlolka I. Schrempf H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), a cell-bound esterase synthesized by the cyclophilin A-producing strain Streptomyces chrysomallus X2 (13Berger R. Hoffmann M. Keller U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6396-6399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the mycelia-associated cellulase (14Schlochtermeier A. Niemeyer F. Schrempf H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 3240-3248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), catalase-peroxidase from Streptomyces reticuli (15Zou P. Borovok I. Ortiz de Orué Lucana D. Müller D. Schrempf H. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 549-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the surface-active proteins (i.e. SapB from Streptomyces coelicolor and its homologue from Streptomyces tendae), which are involved in erecting aerial hyphae (16Tillotson R.D. Wosten H.A. Richter M. Willey J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently we identified a 35-kDa protein from S. reticuli, which is very likely covalently anchored to the cell wall (17Walter S. Wellmann E. Schrempf H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its N-terminal part protrudes from the surface of the hyphae, as demonstrated by immunolabelled ultrathin sections and investigations by electron microscopy (18Walter S. Rohde M. Machner M. Schrempf H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 886-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein has no enzymatic activity, but it interacts strongly with crystalline forms of cellulose (Avicel). AbpS 1The abbreviations used are: AbpS, Avicel-binding protein from S. reticuli; MSCRAMM, microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). (for Avicel-binding protein from S. reticuli) recognized other biopolymers merely weakly (chitin and Valonia cellulose) or not at all (xylan, starch, and agar). By comparing the deduced AbpS sequence, no homology was found to any discovered cellulose-binding domain, which were often present within cellulases (19Bayer E.A. Chanzy H. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). AbpS possesses an up to now unique cellulose-binding module. By analysis of the secondary structure of the deduced AbpS sequence, a large centrally located α-helical structure showing a weak homology to the tropomyosin protein family and the streptococcal M-proteins (20Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) was identified. As AbpS has also been found to be associated to protoplasts, it is predicted that a C-terminally located stretch of 18 hydrophobic amino acids anchors the protein to the cytoplasmic membrane. Beside streptomycetes, surface proteins possessing diverse functions were also discovered in several other bacteria (21Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In pathogenic bacteria streptococci and staphylococci (22Flock J.I. Mol. Med.

Chhatwal G.S. Curr. Opin.

Immun. 2001; 69: 4851-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because of their involvement in adherence of the bacteria and concealment of the bacterial surface from the host's defense system, MSCRAMMs were studied intensively. Surface-associated heparin-binding proteins are frequent among pathogenic mycobacteria (27Pethe K. Alonso S. Biet F. Delogu G. Brennan M.J. Locht C. Menozzi F.D.

Various types of cell-wall-anchored proteinases are encountered in different genera of Gram-positive bacteria (29Fernandez-Espla M.D. Garault P. Monnet V. Rul F. Appl. Environ.

In this study we elucidate the detailed characteristics of the up to date unique Avicel-binding protein from S. reticuli. The investigations as to the membrane anchoring and complex formation support the conclusions that AbpS connects the Streptomyces cytoplasm with the extracellular environment and functions as a cellulose-receptor.

Hopwood, John Innes Institute, Norwich, UK) was transformed with bifunctional Streptomyces-Escherichia coli vector pWHM3 (34Vara J. Lewandowska-Skarbek M. Wang Y.G. Donadio S. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5872-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) or its derivatives containing truncated abpS genes by standard protocols (35Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK1985Google Scholar). pUS1, a pUC18 derivative containing a 3.2-kb genomic SalI DNA fragment from S. reticuli, on which the complete abpS gene is located, was described earlier (17Walter S. Wellmann E. Schrempf H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Walter S. Rohde M. Machner M. Schrempf H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 886-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of abpS is available in the EMBL data bank under the accession number Z97071. The E. coli vector pET21a (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used as cloning vector for truncated forms of the abpS gene. The derivatives of pET21a containing the complete abpS gene or truncated genes with 5′ end deletions (resulting in N-terminally shortened AbpS-proteins with molecular weights of 32.3 kDa, 29.1 kDa, and 23.5 kDa) were described earlier (17Walter S. Wellmann E. Schrempf H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli DH5α or the chloramphenicol resistant E. coli BL21 (pLysS) (Novagen) was transformed with plasmid DNA using the CaCl2 method (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Polymerase Chain Reactions and Construction of Plasmids—The PCR reaction mixture contained different primer combinations: 10 ng of pUS1, 0.2 nm of each of the dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4,20mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2 mm MgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100, in a final volume of 30 μl. To reduce misreading, the Vent® DNA polymerase, which has a 3′→5′ proof reading exonuclease activity, was used instead of the Taq polymerase. The primer P1 CAGGAACCATATGAGCGACAC was utilized to replace the ATG start codon of abpS with an NdeI-site. The primers P2 (GAGCATCTCGTCGACGTTCGTCAG) and P3 (TGCGCGGTGTCGACCGTC TGGCGG) were employed to introduce SalI sites at different locations at the 3′ end of the abpS gene. The following cycling conditions were found to be optimal for the primer combinations P1 and P2 or P1 and P3: 95 °C, 90 s; 55 °C, 60 s; and 72 °C, 60 s. After thirty cycles, the PCR products were purified (Qia quick spin PCR purification kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the supplier's instructions. The NdeI- and SalI-digested PCR products were ligated in-frame into the polycloning site of pET21a (linearized with NdeI and XhoI), and transformed in E. coli BL21 (pLysS). Internal deletions of the abpS gene were performed by “inverse” PCR. The pET21a derivative comprising the complete abpS gene served as template. The primers were designed in such a way that the generated PCR products consisted of the vector-sequence and flanking abpS fragments. The space between the primers represented the desired deletion. For self-ligation of the PCR products, in-frame SstI sites were incorporated in the primer sequences. For amplification of DNA with the primers PintA (GGCCTTGAGCTCGCCCGCGTA) and PintB (GGCGGACGAGCTCTTCGAG GAGAG) or PintC (GCCGAGGAGCTCCGCCTGGAGGC), the following cycle conditions were used: 95 °C, 90 s; 50 °C, 90 s; and 72 °C, 450 s. After ten cycles the products were purified (see above) and digested with SstI, self-ligated, and transformed in E. coli BL21 (pLysS). For cloning of abpS genes prolonged with the codons for 6 histidines in S. lividans as host PCR was performed under the above described conditions with primer PXho (CTGCACCTCGAGACGCAG) and PHis6 (AAATGATCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGGAGCCCCGGGACTGCTGCGCCGGGAC) or PΔCHis6 (AAATGATCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGGAGCCCCGG ACGTTCGTCAGCTGGGC) and as template pUS1 (containing the abpS gene from S. reticuli) was used (see above). After purification and digestion with XhoI and BclI, the resulting DNA fragment was used to substitute the abpS 3′ end in pUS1, cleaved before with XhoI and BamHI. Consequently, the corresponding plasmids contained genes encoding a full-length AbpS or an AbpS protein without the hydrophobic segment both prolonged C-terminal with RGSH6. Subsequently, the genes were transferred into the bifuncional Streptomyces-E. coli vector pWHM3 and named pWA1 and pWAΔC, respectively. Both plasmids were propagated in E. coli DH5α and after isolation transformed into S. lividans 66 protoplasts. The presence of the pWHM3-based constructs was guaranteed by selection with thiostrepton (25 μg/ml). General DNA Techniques—Application of restriction enzymes and the T4-ligase were carried out using the standard procedures (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed with the help of the T7 sequencing kit and Cy5-labeled standard primers (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of Truncated His-tagged AbpS Proteins from E. coli or S. lividans—The E. coli BL21 (pLysS) transformants containing the designed constructs (see above) were grown at 37 °C in SOC medium (20 g of Bacto-Trypton, 5 g of yeast extract, 0.5 g of NaCl, 0.18 g of KCl, and 20 ml of 1 m glucose/liter, which had been supplemented with chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml)). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranose (final concentration 1 mm) was added when A 600 had reached 0.6. After further 3 h of cultivation, the E. coli cells were harvested, washed, resuspended in sonification buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 8 m urea), and disrupted using a Branson sonifier B12 for 3 min in 20 s intervals. Having removed the cell debris, Ni2+-NTA (Qiagen) was added to bind the His6 fusion protein. Unspecifically bound proteins were removed by consecutive washings with buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.3), and 8 m urea) containing 25 mm imidazol. The immobilized proteins were renatured by washing with buffers containing decreasing concentrations of urea (8-0 m) in a period of 2–3 h. The fusion protein was subsequently released by the addition of 0.5 m imidazol. S. lividans transformants were grown in pH-stable medium (MM3) supplemented with 1% glucose for 48 h. After harvesting the mycelia by centrifugation, they were disrupted and the His6-tagged proteins were isolated as described above with or without urea-containing buffers. Isolation of Murein-associated AbpS from S. reticuli—Anti-AbpS antibodies had been gained previously (18Walter S. Rohde M. Machner M. Schrempf H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 886-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IgGs were purified using a 1 ml HiTrap protein G column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier's manual. Subsequently, the purified IgGs were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) as described in the corresponding manual. The murein layer was isolated from S. reticuli hyphae grown in 1 liter of minimal media as described earlier (18Walter S. Rohde M. Machner M. Schrempf H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 886-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Murein was treated with buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 20 mm EDTA) comprising 5 mg of lysozyme (Roche Applied Science) per ml and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min, the AbpS-containing supernatant was mixed with immobilized (see above) anti-AbpS antibodies. After incubation for 3–5 h under gentle stirring, the Sepharose was washed 3 times with 50 ml PBS (80 g of NaCl, 2 g of KCl, 2 g of KH2PO4, 11.5 g of Na2HPO4 per liter (pH 7)). The proteins were released from the immobilized IgGs by applying 50 mm phosphate-citrate buffer (pH 2.7). For renaturation the pH was adjusted to 7, and purity and quantity were determined by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Separation of Cell Compartments—S. lividans mycelia were harvested by centrifugation, washed 3 times with 10.3% sucrose, and murein was hydrolyzed by incubation with 3 mg of lysozyme ml–1 mg–1 wet weight of mycelia (35Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK1985Google Scholar). After filtration the protoplasts were resuspended in water supplemented with 5 mm EDTA to destroy them osmotically. The membranes and associated proteins were separated from soluble proteins by ultracentrifugation (250,000 × g for 45 min). SDS Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed with 10% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 0.1% SDS (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). If desired, proteins were transferred onto nylon membranes, which were incubated in PBS containing the primary antiserum (1:100,000 dilution), the anti-His5 antibodies, or the anti-RGSHis6 antibodies (both 1:10,000 dilution) (Qiagen). After three washes, the blot was incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated with the AffinyPure F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-rabbit IgG or mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Color development was performed as described by West et al. (38West S. Schröder J. Kunz W. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Urea-gradient PAGE—The lower polyacrylamide-gel (in a concentration of 6% and without SDS) was poured sidelong into the glass plate in 4 successive stages, containing 6, 3, 1.25 m, or no urea. After polymerization, the standard upper gel was overlaid so that one wide lane was formed. The proteins were loaded with a native loading buffer (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), and the electrophoresis was done at 15 mA to avoid heating above 25 °C. Finally the proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Cellulose-binding Assay—Proteins were incubated with Avicel (15 mg/ml) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7) for 30 min. Avicel recovered by centrifugation was washed 3 times with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 m NaCl. Avicel-bound proteins were released by heating in SDS sample buffer for 5 min at 100 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Staining of proteins was done with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Detection of Protein-Protein Interactions—Total proteins or purified AbpS isolated from S. reticuli were denatured by SDS, separated on an SDS-PAGE, and subsequently transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (because of the cellulose-binding capability of AbpS, nitrocellulose membrane was avoided). The membrane was treated for 1 h with PBS (see above) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The His6-tagged fusion proteins (which were to be tested for the interaction of the immobilized AbpS) were incubated with 8 m urea in small volumes for 1 h. Rapid renaturation was performed by diluting this solution 1:100 in PBS, which contained a piece of the nylon membrane with immobilized AbpS from S. reticuli. After incubation at 25 °C the membrane was washed 3 times with 50 ml of PBS, and the fusion proteins that were trapped by the immobilized AbpS were detected immunologically by applying antibodies specific to a stretch of 5 histidines (for further details see “SDS Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting”). Cross-linking of AbpS Complexes—Because of the absence of cysteine residues in AbpS the reactive bifunctional cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP), which is cleavable by reducing agents, was chosen to interconnect subunits of protein complexes. For this purpose the concentration of each of the His6 fusion proteins (35.7, 27.1ΔC, 23.5ΔN, or 31.4ΔI) was adjusted to 10 mm.3 μl (corresponds to 30 nmol) were diluted in 50 μl of buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7)). The addition of 50 mm NaCl was found to inhibit ionic protein interaction, which increases the cross-linking specificity. To avoid intermolecular cross-linkages the molar ratio between DSP and denaturated proteins (0.5% SDS) was adjusted so that no multimers were found. The molar ratio (DSP/protein) of 3:1 was found to be optimal. Therefore the cross-linking reaction was started by adding 3 μl of 10 mm solution of DSP (dissolved in Me2SO). After 10 min at 30 °C, the proteins were denaturated by SDS at 95 °C and analyzed by PAGE. 0.6 μg of AbpS isolated from S. reticuli were incubated with 10 mg Avicel in a final volume of 100 μl for 1 h. After 3 washes, 50 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7) was added to the Avicel, and subsequently the bound proteins were cross-linked as described above. As control, the same amount of unbound AbpS was used. Circular Dichroic Spectroscopiccal Analysis—To assess the structure of AbpS or its His6 fusion variants (35.7, 27.1ΔC, 23.5, and 31.4ΔI) the concentrations of each of the proteins were adjusted to 0.2 mg ml–1. The spectra (190–260 nm) were recorded at 25 °C using a Jasco 600 spectrophotometer in a 0.1-mm path length cell. Data were recorded 5 times, and an average value was determined. The observed ellipticity [Θ] (degrees) is converted in mean residues ellipticity by: [Θ]mrw,lλ = MRWΘ/10 dc, where MRW is obtained by dividing the molecular mass by n–1(n = number of amino acids in the protein), d is the path length (cm) and c is the protein concentration (g/ml). The calculated ellipticity was further converted to the difference of the molar absorbance ([Θ]mrw = 3298 Δϵ). Subsequently the data were analyzed by CD Spectroscopy Deconvolution program CDNN 2.1 (bioinformatik.biochemtech.uni-halle.de/). Reconstitution of AbpS—Soybean Azolectins (l-α-phosphatidylcholine solution obtained from Sigma) were washed twice with acetone in the presence of butylated hydroxytoluene and once with ether/vitamine E, dissolved in chloroform, and dried under a nitrogen stream. The preparation of liposomes was done according to Jung et al. (51Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 4: 11083-11088Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After solubilization of the liposomes by addition of 3% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, the His6-tagged fusion proteins isolated from S. lividans were added and sonicated for 1 s and repeated 9 times. After removing the detergent by Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) the proteoliposomes were washed and concentrated by centrifugation at 250,000 × g. Creation of Truncated AbpS Variants—A PCR-based approach was followed to produce abpS genes with deletion at the 3′ end (31.0 ΔC and 27.1 ΔC) to complement a series of modified abpS genes that have shortened 5′ ends (18Walter S. Rohde M. Machner M. Schrempf H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 886-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). After cloning of the genes the encoded proteins were predicted to be tagged with a valine, a glutamine, and six histidines at the C terminus. Internal deletions within the abpS gene were generated by inverse PCR with the pET21a derivative containing the complete abpS gene (resulted in the deduced proteins 31.4 ΔIor 25.6 ΔI). Each of the plasmids was introduced into E. coli BL21 (pLysC). Sequence analysis of the plasmids revealed that the designed reading frames were preserved at the religated sites and that no base exchange had occurred. Each E. coli BL21 (pLysS) transformant harboring one of the different constructs was grown to the logarithmic phase, induced with varying concentrations of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranose at different temperatures. Independently of the used conditions, each type of the fusion protein was found dominantly within insoluble inclusion bodies (more than 90%). Therefore the proteins were bound to Ni2+-NTA in the presence of 8 m urea. Removing urea stepwise (see “Materials and Methods”), the proteins were subsequently released by imidazol, and each type was found to have the predicated molecular weight (see Fig. 1D). Identification of α-Helical Structures—To analyze whether the renatured truncated AbpS forms (isolated from E. coli) kept structural characteristics of the S. reticuli wild-type AbpS a circular dichroism spectrum of each of the proteins should be recorded. As requirement a purification method of AbpS from S. reticuli has to be established first. As reported previously (18Walter S. Rohde M. Machner M. Schrempf H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 886-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) AbpS is covalently linked to the peptidoglucan layer of S. reticuli. Therefore, its murein was isolated as previously described (18Walter S. Rohde M. Machner M. Schrempf H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 886-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, AbpS was released by the action of lysozyme and immobilized by Sepharose-coupled anti-AbpS antibodies. After elution, AbpS was obtained in a good degree of purity (Fig. 1C); however, only ∼5 μg AbpS can be gained from 10 g mycelia (wet weight), grown in l liter culture. Additionally the 35.7 His-tagged full-length AbpS fusion protein, the 23.5ΔN, 25.ΔI, and 31.ΔC forms were purified from E. coli as described (see “Material and Methods”). The concentration of each protein was adjusted to 0.2 mg/ml, and its CD spectrum was determined (Fig. 2A). Between 205 and 260 nm the spectra of all proteins were close to identical. Below 205 nm AbpS, isolated from its natural host (S. reticuli), showed a slightly higher difference in"

The enzyme functions as a homodimer with the two active sites at the dimer interface.

Aminolevulinate synthase and circularly permuted variants folded reversibly; the equilibrium unfolding/refolding profiles were biphasic and, in all but one case, protein concentration-independent, indicating a unimolecular process with the presence of at least one stable intermediate. The formation of this intermediate was preceded by the disruption of the dimeric interface or dissociation of the dimer without significant change in the secondary structural content of the subunits. In contrast to the similar stabilities associated with the dimeric interface, the energy for the unfolding of the intermediate as well as the overall conformational stabilities varied among aminolevulinate synthase and variants. The unfolding of one functional permuted variant was protein concentration-dependent and had a potentially different folding mechanism.

In mammals, heme biosynthesis is initiated with the condensation of glycine with succinyl-CoA to form 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), 1The abbreviations used are: ALA, 5-aminolevulinate; ALAS, 5-aminolevulinate synthase; AONS, 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase; Gdm-HCl, guanidinium chloride; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate.

Inorganic Biochemistry and Regulatory Mechanisms of Iron Metabolism. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany1999: 15-34Google Scholar). 5-Aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) (EC 2.3.1.37), the enzyme responsible for this catalytic reaction, has two distinct mammalian isoforms: the housekeeping ALAS, expressed in all cell types; and the erythroid-specific ALAS, only expressed in developing erythrocytes. The two human ALAS-encoding genes were assigned to chromosome 3 (3Bishop D.F. Henderson A.S. Astrin K.H.

Erythroid, ALAS-produced heme accounts for 90% of the total heme synthesized in humans (5Sadlon T.J. Dell'Oso T. Surinya K.H. May B.K. Int. J. Biochem.

Lee G.R. Wintrobe's Clinical Haematology. J. B. Lippincott/Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1999: 1022-1045Google Scholar). ALAS is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent homodimer with 56-kDa subunits and the active site located at the dimer interface (11Tan D. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8934-8941Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetics of the ALAS-catalyzed reaction follows an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism, in which glycine binds first, succinyl-CoA second, and ALA is released last (12Fanica-Gaignier M. Clement-Metral J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 40: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Along the catalytic pathway the PLP forms several intermediates (13Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3711-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the absence of substrates or products, PLP is covalently bound via a Schiff base to the ϵ-amino group of Lys-313 of murine erythroid ALAS, forming an internal aldimine (14Ferreira G.C. Neame P.J. Dailey H.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the roles of specific ALAS amino acids in substrate recognition and binding and catalysis has been accomplished mainly through mutagenesis and structural homology modeling (13Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3711-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Ferreira G.C. Vajapey U. Hafez O. Hunter G.A. Barber M.J.

Specifically in murine erythroid ALAS, Lys-313 appears to play a dual role, i.e. holding the PLP cofactor in the active site as an internal aldimine (14Ferreira G.C. Neame P.J. Dailey H.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and catalysis (13Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3711-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and Arg-439 is crucial in the binding of glycine substrate (18Tan D. Harrison T. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that circular permutation of ALAS, which changed the primary sequence without altering the amino acid composition, led to equally active ALAS variants (19Cheltsov A.V. Barber M.J. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19141-19149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In fact, we concluded that the natural continuity of the ALAS polypeptide chain and the sequential arrangement of the secondary structure elements are not requirements for proper folding, binding of the PLP cofactor, or assembly of the two subunits into a functional enzyme. Moreover, at the primary structure level, the order of the two identified functional elements (i.e. the catalytic and the glycine-binding domains) did not affect the functioning of the enzyme. However, despite the similarity of the predicted overall tertiary structures, ALAS and its circularly permuted variants displayed distinct arrangements of the secondary structure elements (19Cheltsov A.V.

These observations underscore the importance of elucidating the folding mechanism(s) of ALAS and circularly permuted variants to understand its(their) role in attaining a stable dimeric interface, conducive to PLP anchoring and ALAS catalysis. In this study, we analyze and compare the folding mechanism, conformational stability, and predicted structures of the circularly permuted ALAS variants in relation to wild type enzyme. We report that the differences in the folding processes of ALAS and active, circularly permuted ALAS variants are translated in distinct overall conformational stabilities, unique cofactor environments, and identical stabilities associated with the protein domains defining the dimeric interface.

Glycerol, mono and dibasic potassium phosphate, sodium acetate, perchloric acid, acetic acid, and disodium EDTA dihydrate were provided from Fisher. Ultrogel AcA-44 was obtained from IBF Biotechnics. SDS-PAGE reagents were supplied by Bio-Rad. Vent DNA polymerase, BamHI, SalI, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. The Superdex 200 gel filtration resin was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Cybersyn Inc. The Escherichia coli strain LC24 (20Huala E. Moon A.L. Ausubel F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 382-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from the ATCC. Nomenclature Used for the Different Proteins—L25, Q69, N404, and N408 represent circularly permuted ALAS variants with the N-terminal amino acids corresponding to leucine 25, glutamine 69, asparagine 404, and asparagine 408 of wild type murine erythroid ALAS, respectively (19Cheltsov A.V. Barber M.J. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19141-19149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 2X-ALAS is a monomeric protein consisting of two wild type ALAS subunits covalently linked through the N terminus of one subunit to the C terminus of the other subunit. pAC1 Plasmid—The pAC1 plasmid, constructed as described previously (19Cheltsov A.V. Barber M.J. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19141-19149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), contains the cDNA coding for 2X-ALAS, which corresponds to the sequence of two tandem ALAS cDNAs linked through an MfeI site. Purification of Wild Type ALAS, 2X-ALAS, and Selected Circularly Permuted ALAS Variants—Recombinant wild type ALAS, 2X-ALAS, and selected circularly permuted variants were purified from E. coli overproducing cells containing the different ALAS-encoding cDNAs under the control of the alkaline phosphatase (pho A) promoter (19Cheltsov A.V. Barber M.J. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19141-19149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells were used to overexpress 2X-ALAS, whereas wild type ALAS and ALAS circularly permuted variants L25, Q69, N404, and N408 variants were overproduced and purified as described previously (19Cheltsov A.V. Barber M.J. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19141-19149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of 2X-ALAS began with the resuspension of the harvested cells harboring 2X-ALAS in buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm PLP, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, and the following protease inhibitors: 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Upon cell lysis, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation, as described previously (21Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the supernatant was brought to 25% ammonium sulfate. After stirring for 10 min at 4 °C, the solution was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was further fractionated with ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 35% and centrifuged as above. The chromatographic steps using Ultragel AcA and DEAE-Sephacel columns were as described previously (21Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the DEAE-Sephacel resin was washed with buffer A until A 280 was lower than 0.1, and 2X-ALAS was eluted with buffer A containing 60 mm KCl. 2X-ALAS-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon 8050 stirred cell with an YM30 membrane. The purified and concentrated enzyme was stored under liquid nitrogen until use. Molecular Mass Determination of 2X-ALAS by Gel Filtration Chromatography—The native molecular mass of 2X-ALAS was determined by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200 column (1.0 × 50 cm). The Superdex 200 gel filtration column, connected to a PerkinElmer Life Sciences high pressure liquid chromatography system, was equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm PLP, and 5 mm mercaptoethanol. The flow rate was set at 1.0 ml/min. The purified ALAS (10 μm), 2X-ALAS (10 μm), and gel filtration molecular weight markers were prepared in the same buffer and applied onto the column under the same conditions. The molecular mass of 2X-ALAS was calculated from the calibration curve generated using the molecular weight markers. Refolding of Unfolded Wild Type ALAS, 2X-ALAS, and ALAS Circularly Permuted Variants followed by Recovery of Enzymatic Activity— Protein unfolding was achieved by incubating any of the proteins, typically at 5 μm, in buffer B (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2% Tween 20, 100 μm PLP, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm mercaptoethanol) containing 5.0 m Gdm-HCl for 1 h at room temperature (∼25 °C). Refolding was initiated by diluting the unfolded protein in buffer B, to which the 100 μm PLP was freshly added, to 0.01–0.2 μm. Thus, the Gdm-HCl dilution was 25–500-fold. After incubation at 25 °C for 2 h, the recovery of enzymatic activity was monitored by assaying aliquots of the refolded proteins according to the method described previously (22Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The yield of reactivation was expressed relative to the activity of a native control sample (i.e. in the absence of Gdm-HCl) maintained under identical conditions. ALAS Unfolding Monitored by Gel Filtration Chromatography—Analysis of the size of ALAS during unfolding experiments was performed at 4 °C using the same high pressure liquid chromatography system and gel filtration column as for the determination of the molecular mass of 2X-ALAS. For each run, the gel filtration column was equilibrated with buffer B containing the appropriate guanidinium chloride (Gdm-HCl) concentration. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min, and the detection was determined from the protein intrinsic protein fluorescence (see below). As a control for each run, 2X-ALAS was used as a molecular weight marker. Fluorescence and CD Spectroscopies—Fluorescence spectra were collected on a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorophotometer. Intrinsic protein fluorescence was monitored with excitation and emission wavelengths at 280.6 and 334.2 nm, respectively, whereas protein-bound PLP cofactor fluorescence was followed with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 434 and 515 nm, respectively. CD spectra (210–240 nm) were obtained on a Jasco model 710 spectropolarimeter with a cylindrical cell of 0.1-cm path length and a total volume of 300 μl. The observed rotation degrees (θobs) were converted to molar ellipticity. All spectra were obtained at 25 °C and corrected for buffer contribution. Equilibrium Unfolding and Refolding Studies—Stock solutions of either native or 5.0 m Gdm-HCl-denatured proteins were diluted to 0.1 μm in buffer B containing the indicated final concentration of Gdm-HCl and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. Both unfolding and refolding experiments were done in 0.0–5.0 m Gdm-HCl range, because5.0 m Gdm-HCl was sufficient to unfold completely wild type ALAS and its circularly permuted variants (see “Results”). Folding transitions were examined upon determination of catalytic activity (see below), oligomeric size, CD, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and protein-bound PLP fluorescence properties. In experiments where the PLP cofactor fluorescence was used as the spectroscopic probe to monitor the unfolding transitions, PLP was excluded from the buffer composition. All measurements were done in triplicate. Enzymatic Assay—ALAS activity was measured according to the method of Lien and Beattie (23Lien L.F. Beattie D.S. Enzymes. 1982; 28: 120-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with subtle modifications. Briefly, the 2-h equilibrium unfolded samples were incubated in 25.0 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 41.7 mm glycine, 0.14 mm succinyl-CoA, 2.1 mm MgCl2, 2.1 mm EDTA, and 0.017 mm PLP for 1 h at 30 °C. The samples were then placed on ice, and freshly prepared 10% acetylacetone in 1.0 m sodium acetate, pH 4.7, was added to a final concentration of 0.33% acetylacetone and 0.3 m sodium acetate. An incubation for 10 min at 80 °C was followed by the addition, at 25 °C, of modified Ehrlich's reagent (24Mauzerall D. Granick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 219: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to a final concentration of 0.05 m. The colored salt of the pyrrole formed with Ehrlich's reagent was quantitated by reading the absorbance at 552 nm using a Biotek μQuant plate reader. Analysis of the Equilibrium Unfolding Profile Using a Three-state Model—Before data analysis, the raw data were converted into fraction unfolded (F.U.) according to Equation 1, F.U.=xi-xnativexunfolded-xnative(Eq. 1) where x i is the system parameter being monitored during the unfolding reaction and x native and x unfolded are the parameter values corresponding to the native and completely unfolded states of a protein, respectively. A unimolecular, three-state unfolding process of a dimeric protein is described as follows: N ↔ I ↔ U where N, I, and U are native, intermediate, and unfolded states, respectively (25Ghelis C. Yon J. Protein Folding. Molecular Biology. Academic Press, New York1982: 223-295Google Scholar, 26Fan Y.X. Zhou J.M. Kihara H. Tsou C.L. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2631-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As shown in Equation 2, if y represents the experimental variable being used to follow the transition, and y N, y I, and y U are the values of y for N, I, and U, respectively (27Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar), then y=yN+fI(yI-yN)+fU(yU-yN)(Eq. 2) where f I and f U are fractions of I and U species, respectively, and can be expressed through equilibrium constants as shown in Equations 3 and 4, fI=KNI1+KNI+KNIKIU(Eq. 3) fU=KNIKIU1+KNI+KNIKIU(Eq. 4) When F.U. is used as the experimental variable, then y N and y U in Equation 2 are set to 0.0 and 1.0, respectively. The equilibrium constants can be related to the free energy and denaturant concentration using the linear dependence of the unfolding free energy upon denaturant concentration (28Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar) as shown in Equations 5 and 6, KNI=expmNI[D]-ΔGNI0RT(Eq. 5) KIU=expmIU[D]-ΔGIU0RT(Eq. 6) By substituting Equations 6, 5, 4, and 3 into Equation 2, an equation relating y to denaturant concentration can be obtained. ΔGNI0 , ΔGIU0 , m NI, m IU, and y I parameters were obtained by fitting experimental data to the derived equation, using the program DataFit version 7.0 (Oakdale Engineering Inc.). Protein-bound PLP Fluorescence Quenching Studies—Accessibility of the PLP cofactor in the wild type ALAS and variants was assessed by monitoring the PLP fluorescence upon the addition of external quenchers. Cs+, I–, and acrylamide, which are cationic, anionic, and neutral, respectively, were among the quenchers tested. The quenching reactions were performed at 25 °C with 2.0 μm protein samples in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol. While studying quenching by Cs+ and I–, the ionic strength was maintained constant by adding 0.5 m KCl to the same buffer. The fluorescence data were analyzed by fitting to one of the two forms (Equations 7 or 8) of the Stern-Volmer equation (29Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), where K SV is the dynamic quenching constant, V is the static quenching constant, and Q is the quencher, using the program DataFit version 7.0 (Oakdale Engineering Inc.). F0F=1+KSV[Q](Eq. 7) F0F=(1+KSV[Q])exp(V[Q])(Eq. 8) Modeling of Wild Type ALAS and Circularly Permuted Variants and PLP Cofactor Docking—Comparative protein modeling of the three-dimensional structures of wild type ALAS and its circularly permuted variants (i.e. L25, Q69, and N408) was performed using the amino acid sequence and coordinates for E. coli 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (AONS) (30Alexeev D.

Alexeeva M. Sawyer L. Baxter R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 516-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession code 1BS0) as template. AONS and ALAS share 30.2% sequence identity and 31.3% sequence similarity. According to Chothia and Lesk (32Chothia C. Lesk A.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar), the 30% sequence identity threshold guarantees three-dimensional similarity, and thus, AONS appeared to be an acceptable template for homology modeling of ALAS and its variants. The AONS and the target amino acid sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm (33Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55986) Google Scholar). Then the initial three-dimensional structures for wild type ALAS and its circularly permuted variants were obtained using the comparative protein structure modeling method of “satisfaction of spatial restraints” as implemented in Modeler 4.0 (34Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10632) Google Scholar). The obtained protein models were further optimized using MacroModel 7.2 (35Mohamadi F. Richards N. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M. Caulfield C. Chang G. Hendrickson T. Still W.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 440-456Crossref Scopus (3933) Google Scholar) purchased from Schrödinger, Inc. (www.schrodinger.com). The models were also validated using PRO-CHECK (36Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The AMBER* (37Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11637) Google Scholar) force field with all atom S-LP treatment was used for all structure calculations, and the energy optimization of the models was done in several steps, by gradually removing energy constrains from 500.0 kJ/mol·Å2 to 0.0 kJ/mol·Å2. A distance dependent dielectric “constant” further attenuated by a factor of 4 was used for the AMBER* electrostatic treatment. Following optimization, the PLP co-factor was linked to the Schiff base lysine of the wild type ALAS and variants (i.e. L25, Q69, and N408). In order to find the best cofactor conformation for each structure, a truncated model of the protein was employed. A 15-Å radius was used to define a shell of atoms around this lysine. The entire residue was incorporated into the shell if any atom in the residue was at least within 15 Å from any atom in this lysine residue. The resulting polypeptide chains were extended out to the α-carbon in both directions. All of these residues were “frozen” at their starting positions so that only their electrostatic and van der Waals energies were included in the subsequent calculations, whereas the lysine side chain and the PLP cofactor were allowed to move freely. The explicit torsion angles were allowed to vary as well. The cofactor conformations with energies within a 25-kJ energy window were found by applying a multiple-conformation search using Macromodel 7.2. The Low-Mode method was employed for the conformational search (38Kolossvary I. Guida W.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1999; 20: 1671-1684Crossref Google Scholar). The TNCG minimizer was used for energy minimization. The global minima were used to interpret the docking results. The molecular surfaces of the structures were computed using Swiss PDB Viewer (39Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9638) Google Scholar). The secondary structures of the ALAS and circularly permuted variants were predicted using the DSSP program (40Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12413) Google Scholar). Protein topology schematics (TOPS) of the predicted three-dimensional structures were generated using the TOPS program (41Westhead D.R. Hatton D.C. Thornton J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 35-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 42Westhead D.R. Slidel T.W. Flores T.P. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Unfolding/Refolding Transitions of Wild Type ALAS and Circularly Permuted Variants, Defining Experimental Conditions for Reversibility—To assess the impact of circular permutation on the thermodynamic stability and folding mechanism of ALAS, the Gdm-HCl-induced equilibrium unfolding/refolding transitions of ALAS circularly permuted variants, at pH 7.5 and 25 °C, were compared with those of wild type ALAS and 2X-ALAS. The latter protein corresponds to two wild type ALASs in tandem. Although the structural content and molecular mass of 2X-ALAS, as verified by CD and gel filtration chromatography, respectively, are identical to those of the wild type enzyme, the subunit molecular mass is twice that of wild type ALAS. These features confirm the monomeric state of 2X-ALAS and make it an important control in the folding studies. We rationalized that if monomerization were an unfolding stage detectable by any of the spectroscopic probes used, the comparison of the unfolding profiles for ALAS and 2X-ALAS would be instrumental in assigning this transition. The equilibrium unfolding/refolding transitions were monitored by far-UV CD at 222 nm, which probes the secondary structure content, and by intrinsic fluorescence, which measures tertiary structure formation. Unfolding was accompanied by a red shift of the fluorescence emission (from 334 to 360 nm), indicating change of tryptophan residues from the hydrophobic interior of the protein to a more polar environment.

https://openalex.org/W2090198435,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli virulence is dependent on delivery of the translocated intimin receptor protein (Tir) into host cells. Tir phosphorylation on a single tyrosine (Tyr-474) is essential in mediating cytoskeletal rearrangement correlated with disease. Tir is also phosphorylated on other residues, with cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) modification shown to play a role in Tir function. However, the mechanism by which nontyrosine phosphorylation affects Tir function remains unclear. In this study, analytical ultracentrifugation, SDS and native gel electrophoresis revealed that both Tir and its C-terminal domain (residues 385–550 of Tir that include the PKA substrate sites) exist in an equilibrium of monomers, dimers, and in the case of Tir, higher oligomers. PKA phosphorylation (1:300, PKA/C-Tir, mol/mol) shifted the equilibrium of C-Tir, but not Tir, predominantly to the dimeric state, whereas, at 100-fold higher concentrations of PKA the phosphorylated C-Tir was largely monomeric. This monomeric state was also produced at the lower PKA concentration and physiological ionic strength. Phosphorylation-mediated effects were achieved without significant changes in secondary structure as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The data presented indicate that PKA-mediated phosphorylation induces changes in the association properties of the C-terminal domain of Tir that may facilitate Tir-Tir interactions and subsequently C-Tir-host protein interactions in vivo.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8799-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). EPEC virulence is mediated by a number of effector molecules that are delivered into host cells via a type III secretion apparatus (2Kenny B.

These effector molecules interact with, and subvert, cellular processes that include not only actin nucleation, but also signaling pathways that lead to disruption of tight junctions, inhibition of phagocytosis, altered ion secretion, and immune responses (2Kenny B.

Following delivery into host cells Tir is phosphorylated and inserted into the host cell plasma membrane where it acts as a receptor for the bacterial surface protein, intimin, to mediate intimate EPEC adherence (6Kenny B.

Topology analysis indicate that EPEC Tir spans the cell plasma membrane, presumably through the two predicted transmembrane domains (residues 234–259 and 353–382), exposing a large extracellular loop (residues 260–352) that contains the intimin-binding domain (IBD) (8Hartland E.L.

The native EPEC Tir molecule resolves at a higher molecular mass (∼78 kDa) on SDS-PAGE than is predicted from its sequence (∼57 kDa), suggesting that the protein retains some form of residual structure in SDS (7Kenny B. DeVinney R. Stein M. Reinscheid D.J. Frey E.A. Finlay B.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Anomalous SDS gel shifts may therefore act as a probe for Tir conformation. Upon translocation into host cells EPEC Tir undergoes a significant increase in its apparent molecular mass (78–85 kDa). This has been shown to be due to phosphorylation, and proceeds through sequential 5-kDa (designated T′) and 2-kDa (designated T′) shifts (6Kenny B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 7Kenny B. DeVinney R. Stein M. Reinscheid D.J. Frey E.A. Finlay B.B.

More recently, Tir has been shown to be an in vitro and in vivo substrate for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) with the sequential in vitro phosphorylation of Ser-434 and Ser-463 (within the C-terminal domain) mimicking those shifts displayed by Tir isolated from infected mammalian cells (11Warawa J. Kenny B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Tir is also phosphorylated on a single tyrosine residue (Tyr-474), enabling the direct recruitment of the Nck adaptor molecule and the actin nucleation machinery (12Gruenheid S. DeVinney R. Bladt F. Goosney D. Gelkop S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 13Campellone K.G. Giese A. Tipper D.J. Leong J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1227-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, tyrosine phosphorylation does not contribute to shifts in apparent molecular mass on SDS gels (6Kenny B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which non-tyrosine phosphorylation affects Tir function has not been elucidated, it has been postulated that it may induce changes in Tir structure either to aid additional kinase modification and/or promote Tir insertion into the host plasma membrane from a cytoplasmic location (2Kenny B. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1967-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Luo Y. Frey E.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Creagh A.L. Knoechel D.G. Haynes C.A. Finlay B.B. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 2000; 405: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this study biophysical methods have been used to characterize the effects of PKA-mediated phosphorylation on the properties of Tir in order to address the physiological relevance of such modifications. The results presented indicate a mechanism by which PKA modification of Tir may play a role in its function within host cells. DNA Manipulation—A construct expressing a TirHSVHis fusion protein has been described previously (14Kenny B. Warawa J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1444-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The C-terminal TirHSVHis gene (Tir residues 385–550) was amplified using a primer encoding a HindIII restriction site CCGAAGCTTCATAGACGAAATCAGCCGGCAGAAC together with a primer specific to the terminator region of pET27b. In a separate PCR reaction the region upstream of the Tir sequence was amplified using a primer complementary to the promoter region of pET27b together with a primer specific to the start of the Tir sequence CCGAAGCTTCATACATATATCCTTTTATTTAG that encodes a HindIII restriction site followed by an initiation ATG codon. The respective fragments (BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/NheI) were cloned into pET27b (Novagen) and sequence analysis was used to confirm an identical sequence with that of the template. Protein Purification—BL21-DE3 (15Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) E. coli were transformed with pET27b encoding either TirHSVHis or C-TirHSVHis. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) to cell cultures grown at 37 °C to an OD600 nm of 0.6 and incubation for an additional 3 h. Cells pellets were resuspended in sonication/binding buffer (20 mm imidazole, 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) and lysed using a Vibra-Cell probe sonicator, 60% duty cycle (Sonics & Materials, Inc.). Soluble proteins were separated from cell debris and insoluble proteins by centrifugation (18,000 rpm, 30 min) and fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) was used to pass the supernatant through a nickel affinity chromatography column (5-ml Hi Trap™ nickel-chelating column; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in binding buffer. Bound TirHSVHis or C-TirHSVHis proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient (0.05–1 m), and the protein-containing fractions identified via SDS-PAGE. These fractions were combined and dialyzed overnight against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 and subsequently concentrated in a Vivaspin 20-ml concentrator (5000 molecular weight cutoff, Sartorius). Protein concentration (OD280 nm) was estimated with the extinction coefficient values for Tir and C-Tir determined using Expasy web software ProtParam. Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Resolution of monomeric and dimeric protein was achieved on native gels containing 10% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 bis-acrylamide/acrylamide), 400 mm Tris, pH 8.8 in the separating gel and 3% polyacrylamide and 120 mm Tris, pH 6.8 in the stacking gel. Samples were diluted in sample application buffer (400 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) prior to loading onto gels. Gel electrophoresis was performed for 2 h at 150 V and in the presence of electrophoresis buffer containing 0.2 m Tris, 0.1 M glycine. Protein bands were visualized by staining the gels with Coomassie Blue in 10% (v/v) glacial acetic acid and 50% (v/v) ethanol followed by destaining in a 10% (v/v) glacial acetic acid/5% (v/v) ethanol solution. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—C-Tir protein samples (10 μm in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) were diluted in IEF buffer (8 m urea, 2% ampholyte pH 3–10 (Amersham Biosciences), 0.5% (v/v) Tween-20, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2% CHAPS) and used to rehydrate 17 cm IPG strips (pH 4–7, BioRad). These strip were focused for 24 h using a pHaser isoelectric focusing system (V-h 50,000, maximum voltage 5000, duration 24 h, holding voltage 124, maximum current 50 μA, 17 °C) and equilibrated in IPG equilibration buffers I and II (Genomic Solutions) prior to the second dimension on 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained and destained as described for native gel electrophoresis. In Vitro PKA Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation of Tir and C-Tir proteins were carried out at 30 °C in PKA buffer (New England Biolabs) supplemented with 100 μm ATP (Roche Applied Science). Phosphorylation reactions were carried out with low concentrations of PKA (0.05 units per ng of protein equivalent to 1:100, PKA/Tir, or 1:300, PKA/C-Tir, mol/mol, respectively) or at a 100-fold higher concentration. Phosphorylated proteins were purified and concentrated on a 1-ml Hi Trap™ nickel-chelating column, eluting in half the volume applied to column, and dialyzed overnight with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectra were obtained at room temperature using a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter. Spectra of native and phosphorylated samples (1:100, PKA/Tir, or 1:300, PKA/C-Tir, mol/mol, respectively) having protein concentrations in the range of 0.05–0.2 mg/ml were measured in 2-mm pathlength quartz cuvettes. Spectra at high protein concentration (0.5–1 mg/ml) were measured in 0.1-mm quartz cuvettes. All spectra are averages of between 5 and 11 scans with relevant protein-free buffer spectra subtracted and were plotted without smoothing using SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc.). Deconvolution of CD spectra into component secondary structural contributions was done using the CDPro suite of programs (16Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar), which enable calculation of secondary structure using three independent methods (CONTIN, SELCON3, and CDSSTR), allowing an internal check on the consistency of the analyses. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) using an AnTi 60 rotor. Native and phosphorylated samples (1:100, PKA/Tir, or 1:300, PKA/C-Tir, mol/mol, respectively) were exhaustively dialyzed against (20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and loaded into a six-channel centerpiece yielding 2 mm of data per channel. Radial absorbance scans at 230 nm were taken after 12 h and then after every 6 h at 17,000, 22,000, and 28,000 rpm using three different protein concentrations (5, 10, 20 μm). Successive pairs of scans were subtracted from one another, and equilibrium was judged to have been established if there were no systematic deviations across each of the cell channels at each speed. Buffer density and partial specific volume was calculated according to the method of Laue and Stafford (17Laue T.M. Stafford 3rd., W.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Data from each channel was analyzed using the software provided with the centrifuge. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out in two channel centerpieces at 40,000 rpm, and cells were scanned radially every 5 min. Sedimentation coefficient distributions were obtained using the maximum entropy method of Schuck and Rossmanith (18Schuck P. Rossmanith P. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Protein Unfolding—Equilibrium unfolding of C-TirHSVHis was performed using 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) stock solutions prepared in 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. A series of protein samples (30 μm) were denatured in 0–5 m GdnHCl in 0.2 m steps and left to equilibrate for 3 h at 25 °C before fluorescence intensity measurements were taken. GdnHCl unfolding was also carried out by addition of aliquots of GdnHCl to a single protein sample, and the data re-scaled to take into account differences in volume of denaturant at each concentration. Unfolding of unmodified proteins in this manner resulted in similar unfolding curves to those obtained by incubating the protein at each denaturant concentration in the range 0–5 m. Tryptophan Fluorescence—GdnHCl dependent intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was carried out using a Perkin Elmer Luminescence (LS50B) spectrofluorimeter equipped with a thermostatted cell holder. Spectra were recorded using the following parameters: excitation wavelength 290 nm, slit width 10, emission 300–450 nm, and scan speed 60. The Raman spectral contribution was removed by subtraction of a buffer blank. All spectra were plotted using GraFit Data analysis and Graphics software, version 3.01 (Erithacus Software Ltd.). MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Analysis of C-Tir—A mass spectrum of the C-Tir protein was determined using a PE Biosystems Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer with a Nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm. The matrix solution was freshly prepared Sinapinic Acid (Fluka), at a concentration of 1 mg/100 μl in a 50:50 mixture of acetonitrile (Rathburn) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Aldrich). Sample and matrix, 0.5 μl of each, were spotted onto the sample plate. The sample was calibrated against Aldolase (Sigma) run as an external standard. The spectrum was acquired under linear conditions with an accelerating voltage of 25,000 V and an extraction time of 750 ns. PKA Phosphorylation Does Not Induce Significant Changes in the Secondary Structure of Tir or C-Tir—To probe for phosphorylation-mediated structural changes in Tir, the protein was first purified as a C-terminally tagged HSVHis fusion protein and analyzed in both its native and PKA-phosphorylated forms by CD. The addition of HSVHis tags does not inhibit Tir delivery, modification or function within host cells (11Warawa J. Kenny B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As the identified PKA phosphorylation sites (Ser-434, Ser-463) occur within the C terminus of Tir (11Warawa J. Kenny B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), this domain (C-Tir) was also purified for similar analysis. The CD spectra shown in Fig. 1 reveal very similar profiles for both the phosphorylated and native forms of Tir and C-Tir and indicate that phosphorylation (1:100, PKA/Tir, or 1:300, PKA/C-Tir, mol/mol, respectively) has negligible effect on the secondary structure of these proteins. Deconvolution of the data into secondary structural components for both Tir and C-Tir is shown in Table I. Since phosphorylation has little effect on the CD spectra of either protein the secondary structural components listed in Table 1 apply equally to both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms. Tir has secondary structure typical of a soluble protein with a high level of α-helical and β-sheet structure. The high helical content is consistent with the expectation that two hydrophobic (probably helical) transmembrane domains flank the extracellular intimin-binding domain. In contrast, the C-terminal domain contains a large amount of unordered or undefined structure. The accuracy of spectral deconvolution varies among the calculated secondary structural elements; in general, α-helix can be calculated with greatest accuracy, and the “unordered” component is not necessarily equivalent to polypeptide in “random coil” structure (17Laue T.M. Stafford 3rd., W.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the C terminus of Tir has a significant amount of unordered structure with phosphorylation in this region having no significant effect on secondary structure.Table IDeconvolution of circular dichroism spectra into secondary structural components1α-HelixaCalculated values for regular and distorted helix are summed.β-StrandcCalculated values for regular and distorted β-strand are summed.Turn“Unordered”%n bTotal number of residues in secondary structural element based on 550 residues in native Tir, and 165 residues in the C-terminal domain of Tir (C-Tir).%n bTotal number of residues in secondary structural element based on 550 residues in native Tir, and 165 residues in the C-terminal domain of Tir (C-Tir).%n bTotal number of residues in secondary structural element based on 550 residues in native Tir, and 165 residues in the C-terminal domain of Tir (C-Tir).%n bTotal number of residues in secondary structural element based on 550 residues in native Tir, and 165 residues in the C-terminal domain of Tir (C-Tir).Tir25.8dData are average values of separate calculations using CONTIN, CDSSTR, and SELCON3.

Open table in a new tab Attempts were made to obtain near UV data using the Tir protein in order to determine the effects of phosphorylation on the tertiary structure. Near UV data require large amounts of protein to obtain the concentrations (100 μm) necessary for measuring these weak signals and at these concentrations we found that Tir is prone to aggregation. However, the near UV data collected revealed no significant difference between the spectra of native and phosphorylated full-length Tir (not shown). The C-terminal Domain of Tir Exists in a Monomer/Dimer Equilibrium—Given that PKA-phosphorylation induces shifts in the apparent molecular mass of Tir as determined by SDS-PAGE (11Warawa J. Kenny B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), both the native and phosphorylated Tir and C-Tir proteins were subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation to determine their molecular masses under non-denaturing conditions. Sedimentation velocity studies of native and phosphorylated Tir revealed the presence of multiple species of undeterminable mass, possibly indicative of aggregation (not shown). In contrast, the results with C-Tir show that phosphorylation using low PKA concentration (1:300, PKA/C-Tir, mol/mol) induces a shift in the sedimentation coefficient distribution to higher values (Fig. 2A). This is consistent with either a phosphorylation-induced conformational change and/or oligomerization. As each of these may be occurring, we carried out a sedimentation equilibrium experiment in order to assess the degree of oligomerization upon phosphorylation. The results are presented in Fig. 2B, which shows representative sedimentation profiles for unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of C-Tir. Each profile represents a global non-linear least-squares analysis of nine data sets collected at 3 protein concentrations and 3 speeds using the program NONLIN (19Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The molecular mass determined from a single species fit were 27,562 (24,546, 30,553) and 46,601 (45,137, 48,058) for the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms, respectively. The figures in parentheses are confidence limits from the non-linear global fit quoted at the 67% level. Both of these are a non-integral value of the monomer molecular weight. A dissociation constant of 37 μm was calculated for the unphosphorylated C-Tir. The molecular mass of 27,562 kDa for unphosphorylated C-Tir is greater than that expected for a monomer (19,615 kDa), but less than that expected for a dimer (39, 227 kDa), indicative of a system in equilibrium (Table II). The best model to fit our data set was that of a homogenous reversibly associating monomer/dimer equilibrium. The data can also be fitted to other models such as that describing a monomer/trimer. However, chromatography analysis of C-Tir at concentrations (50 μm) above that of the calculated dissociation constant (37 μm) on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 gel-filtration column revealed a single peak with an elution volume corresponding to that of a dimer. In addition, observation of a small amount of C-Tir dimer by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy as well as the presence of dimers observed on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3), both indicate that the model used (monomer/dimer) is the most appropriate. As the molecular mass of phosphorylated C-Tir (46,601 kDa) as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation is higher than expected for a dimer (39,227) it appears that higher order forms are also present at the protein concentrations (5–20 μm) used.Table IIMolecular parameters of the C-terminal domain of TirProteinMolecular massKd (Monomer-dimer)PI valuesCalc.Exp.NativeCalc.Exp.cm3 g-1DaμMC-Tir0.710919,60619,615 (39,227)27,562375.455.54Phosphorylated C-Tir0.710919,686NDaND, not determined.46,6015.26 (5.11)a ND, not determined.

Tir and C-Tir were purified as described in the text and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The anomalous migration of Tir (predicted molecular mass: 57 kDa) on SDS gels is also reproduced by its C-terminal domain (predicted molecular mass: 20 kDa). No differences were detected in the electrophoretic mobility of Tir and C-Tir in the presence or absence of heat treatment. In the absence of SDS in the loading buffer, Tir and C-Tir dimers are detected, and for Tir higher oligomers that are not resolved on this percentage gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stability and Association Properties of Tir and C-Tir on SDS-PAGE—The anomalous migration of Tir (apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa, predicted molecular mass of 57 kDa) on SDS gels was also reproduced by its C-terminal domain, (apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa, with a predicted molecular mass of 20 kDa) (Fig. 3). This indicates that at least some of the structural properties of Tir responsible for anomalous migration reside in the C-terminal domain. Moreover, these observations indicate that the proteins retain some structure on SDS gels with Fig. 3 indicating that this structure is resistant to boiling in SDS application buffer. In fact, the far UV CD spectra of Tir is surprisingly unaffected in SDS even after boiling in 0.1% SDS (not shown). Analytical ultracentrifugation data indicated that C-Tir exists in solution in a monomer/dimer equilibrium. We therefore assessed the possibility that SDS dissociates Tir and C-Tir protein into their monomeric forms under SDS-PAGE conditions. Fig. 3 reveals that both Tir and C-Tir migrate as monomers on SDS gels and as a series of bands that correspond to monomeric, dimeric, and in the case of Tir, higher oligomeric forms when SDS is omitted from the application buffer. The detection of dimers on SDS gels also indicates that non-covalent interactions are involved in the dimerization of Tir and C-Tir. PKA-mediated Phosphorylation Affects the Self-association Properties of the C-terminal Domain of Tir—Figs. 3 and 4A reveal that Tir migrates as monomers, dimers, and higher oligomers on SDS-PAGE gels when SDS is omitted from the sample application buffer.
