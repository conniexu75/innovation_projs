Areas under compression develop negative potentials with respect to other areas. Similar results were obtained both in living and dead bone. Removal of the inorganic fraction from bone abolishes its ability to generate stress potentials. It is probable that these potentials influence the activity of osseous cells directly. Furthermore, it is conceivable that they may direct, in some manner, the aggregation pattern of the macromolecules of the extracellular matrix."

https://openalex.org/W55198851,"SUMMARY A variety of pituitary and other protein hormone preparations exhibited characteristic patterns in starch gel electrophoresis, with the Ferguson and Wallace modification of Poulik’s discon- tinuous buffer system. Five human growth hormone prepara- tions prepared by different methods appeared similar. The four major bands in human growth hormone were inseparable from the four major bands in three different ovine prolactin preparations. Human prolactin shared two major bands in common with both human growth hormone and ovine prolactin. Human, simian, and porcine growth hormone shared three major bands in common, indistinguishable from one another, even with change in pH and prolonged electrophoresis. The simian prepa- ration had one and the porcine preparation four major compo- nents not detected in the human preparation. Purified bovine growth hormone had no bands in common with the other three preparations. Among the melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH) , syn- thetic (r-MSH (Hofmann) had the identical electrophoretic mobility as the major component in Schally’s preparation. The characteristic pattern of corticotropin A1 and AQ and ar-MSH and /I-MSH was established; a variety of corticotropin prepara- tions were examined, and the content of each of these peptides was assessed. Three purified parathyroid hormone preparations and two purified relaxin preparations were found not to be homogeneous"

https://openalex.org/W1546870662,"Norris and Benoit (1) provided ‘good evidence that injected trimethylamine is converted in the rat to its N-oxide and excreted in the urine. Other mammals have been shown to have the ability to effect the same reaction (2, 3). In a preliminary communication (4), we have reported that hog liver microsomes will catalyze the oxidation of trimethylamine in vitro. The additional requirement for reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide and oxygen makes this system analogous to a group of microsomal enzyme systems that also catalyze biological oxidations (5). Thus, a study of the oxidation of trimethylamine may yield information on microsomal oxidations in general. In this paper, evidence is presented that the product of trimethylamine oxidation is trimethylamine-N-oxide. Results of experiments to determine optimal conditions for this reaction and the effects of some potential inhibitors and activators are reported."

When the cats are kept without light for 1 year, the response recovers slowly after intense stimulation. A 2-day exposure to light is sufficient to reverse this diminution in response."

https://openalex.org/W2124854329,"SUBSEQUENT to the publication of Adam's defined medium for the growth of Neff's Acanthamoeba sp.1, I attempted to grow Hartmannella rhysodes in this medium slightly modified in the concentrations of amino-acids2. A further modification of Adam's medium was also tried in which all the amino-acids used were natural isomers (L forms), except threonine, valine and serine which were used as racemic mixtures (DL forms), and the methionine concentration was halved (13.5 mgm./100 ml.). All organic nutrients were obtained from the California Corporation for Biochemical Research (Los Angeles); the amino-acids used were ‘A grade’ except DL- iso-leucine (‘C grade’). The culture methods have been described previously3. Both modifications of Adam's medium failed to support growth of this hartman-nellid amœba past the second or third serial culture using either glucose or sodium acetate as the carbon source. When biotin was added (0.5 µgm./100 ml.), satisfactory growth was obtained in serial cultures. The average maximum yield for duplicate cultures in the defined medium, containing 0.1 M glucose and grown at 30° C. on a rotary shaker, was 5.76 × 106 organisms/ml. and the mean generation time was c. 40 hr. This is comparable to growth in the proteose peptone (Difco, Detroit)–glucose medium3. Identical results have been obtained with Neff's Acanthamoeba sp., Acanthamoeba castellanii, and Mayorella palestinensis in both modifications of Adam's medium with either glucose or sodium acetate as the carbon source. Therefore all four soil amœbae appear to require biotin in addition to the vitamins already present in Adam's medium (thiamine and B12)."

https://openalex.org/W1538877400,"IN several experiments in which arginine uniformly labelled with carbon-14 was fed to various tissues of pines, one unidentified compound was found to contain most of the radioactivity incorporated into alcohol-soluble products. When tissue extracts were cleared for chromatography following the ion-exchange procedure of Plaisted1, the unknown was eluted from ‘Dowex 50’ resin with the acidic and neutral amino-acids. However, the RF of the unidentified compound on paper chromatography did not correspond with the RF of any common amino-acid. Subsequent tests indicated that the radioactive unknown was γ-guanidinobutyric acid, previously found in several species of higher plants, as well as in insects and mammals, by Irreverre et al.2."

https://openalex.org/W2008698098,"DURING investigations on fluorocarbohydrates, it became necessary to examine the purity of small amounts of O-isopropylidene derivatives. Hitherto, for such compounds in the carbohydrate series, there has been no reliable chromatographical method of separation from fully protected or nearly related hydroxylated compounds. We have found, however, that separations can be achieved rapidly and easily by reversed-phase, ascending chromatography on cellulose acetate strips (20 × 4.5 cm., as used for electrophoresis and obtainable from Oxo, Ltd., Queen Street Place, London, E.C.4)."

https://openalex.org/W1995256898,"THE earlier confusion regarding the structure of vitamin A2 was removed by its synthesis1, which conclusively proved it to have the dehydrovitamin A1 formula suggested by Morton, Salah and Stubbs2. In this synthesis an extra double bond was introduced into the β-ionone ring of the methylester of vitamin A1 acid, by bromination with N-bromosuccinimide, followed by dehydrobromination with 4-phenyl morpholine. Reduction with lithium aluminium hydride gave a product which closely agreed with the spectroscopic properties of vitamin A2. Recently, Henbest, Jones and Owen3 carried out an elegant conversion of vitamin A1 to A2 by treating the aldehyde of vitamin A1 (retinene1) with N-bromosuccinimide, to obtain retinene2, which by reduction with lithium aluminium hydride was converted to vitamin A2."

https://openalex.org/W1995585282,"THE method which was developed for measuring small rapid changes in volume occurring in a muscle during a single twitch1 has been applied to the case of a frog sartorius muscle immersed in hypertonic Ringer's solution. As reported by various authors, one of the principal effects of hypertonic Ringer's solution on a muscle is to eliminate the twitch tension on stimulation, but not to interfere with the propagation of the muscle action potential. This provides a method of determining whether or not the previously reported muscle volume changes are a direct consequence of the action potential and are thus not connected with contraction as such."
