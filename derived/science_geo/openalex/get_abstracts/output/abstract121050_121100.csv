In their Perspective, Risch and Merikangas propose that we can best accomplish this goal by combining the power of the human genome project with association studies, a method for determining the basis of a genetic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2043428207,"The relationship between the semantic processing of words and of pictures is a matter of debate among cognitive scientists. We studied the functional anatomy of such processing by using positron-emission tomography (PET). We contrasted activity during two semantic tasks (probing knowledge of associations between concepts, and knowledge of the visual attributes of these concepts) and a baseline task (discrimination of physical stimulus size), performed either with words or with pictures. Modality-specific activations unrelated to semantic processing occurred in the left inferior parietal lobule for words, and the right middle occipital gyrus for pictures. A semantic network common to both words and pictures extended from the left superior occipital gyrus through the middle and inferior temporal cortex to the inferior frontal gyrus. A picture-specific activation related to semantic tasks occurred in the left posterior inferior temporal sulcus, and word-specific activations related to semantic tasks were localized to the left superior temporal sulcus, left anterior middle temporal gyrus, and left inferior frontal sulcus. Thus semantic tasks activate a distributed semantic processing system shared by both words and pictures, with a few specific areas differentially active for either words or pictures."
https://openalex.org/W1993902553,"An osmosensing mechanism in the budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) involves both a two-component signal transducer (Sln1p, Ypd1p and Ssk1p) and a MAP kinase cascade (Ssk2p/Ssk22p, Pbs2p, and Hog1p). The transmembrane protein Sln1p contains an extracellular sensor domain and cytoplasmic histidine kinase and receiver domains, whereas the cytoplasmic protein Ssk1p contains a receiver domain. Ypd1p binds to both Sln1p and Ssk1p and mediates the multistep phosphotransfer reaction (phosphorelay). This phosphorelay system is initiated by the autophosphorylation of Sln1p at His576. This phosphate is then sequentially transferred to Sln1p-Asp1144, then to Ypd1p-His64, and finally to Ssk1p-Asp554. We propose that the multistep phosphorelay mechanism is a universal signal transduction apparatus utilized both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W2117608461,"Retinoic acid (RA) is known to act as a signaling molecule during embryonic development, but little is known about the regulation of RA synthesis from retinol. The rate-limiting step in RA synthesis is the oxidation of retinol, a reaction that can be catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Ethanol is also a substrate for ADH, and high levels of ethanol inhibit ADH-catalyzed retinol oxidation. This has prompted us to hypothesize that ethanol-induced defects observed in fetal alcohol syndrome involve ethanol inhibition of ADH-catalyzed RA synthesis. Here, we have examined the effect of ethanol on RA levels in cultured mouse embryos by using a bioassay. Treatment with 100 mM ethanol, but no 10 mM, led to a significant decrease in RA detection in 7.5-day-old embryos. Using whole-mount in situ hybridization, we detected mRNA for class IV ADH, but not ethanol-active cytochrome P450 2E1, in 7.5- and 8.5-day-old embryos, indicating that an ADH-linked pathway exists at these stages for metabolizing retinol and ethanol. Thus, the observed ethanol-induced reduction in RA may be caused by ethanol inhibition of retinol oxidation catalyzed by class IV ADH. In our postulated mechanism for fetal alcohol syndrome, this enzyme may well play a crucial role."
https://openalex.org/W2015598559,"The E. coli replicase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, contains two polymerases for replication of duplex DNA. The DNA strands are antiparallel requiring different modes of replicating the two strands: one is continuous (leading) while the other is discontinuous (lagging). The two polymerases within holoenzyme are generally thought to have asymmetric functions for replication of these two strands. This report finds that the two polymerases have equal properties, both are capable of replicating the more difficult lagging strand. Asymmetric action is, however, imposed by the helicase that encircles the lagging strand. The helicase contact defines the leading polymerase constraining it to a subset of actions, while leaving the other to cycle on the lagging strand. The symmetric actions of the two polymerases free holoenzyme to assemble into the replisome in either orientation without concern for a correct match to one or the other strand."

https://openalex.org/W1977817878,"The fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are a family of receptor protein tyrosine kinases that have been shown to mediate a variety of cellular processes including angiogenesis, wound healing, tumorigenesis, and embryonic development. Distinct FGFR mutations in individuals with autosomal dominant disorders of bone growth and development provide a unique opportunity to determine the function of FGFRs during embryonic development. To determine the consequences of these mutations on receptor function, we have made mutations in Xenopus FGFR1 (XFGFR1) and FGFR2 (XFGFR2) that correspond to several of the mutations identified in these dysmorphic syndromes. Analysis of mutant receptor proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes indicates that all but one have elevated tyrosine kinase activity relative to their wild-type counterparts. Those mutations that give an unpaired cysteine residue in the extracellular domain result in intermolecular disulfide bond formation and covalent receptor dimerization. Microinjection of Xenopus embryos with RNA encoding mutant receptors with elevated tyrosine kinase activity results in ligand-independent induction of mesoderm in animal pole explants. Wild-type XFGFR1 and XFGFR2 do not induce mesoderm when injected at similar doses. Co-injection of RNA encoding a dominant negative FGF receptor, lacking the tyrosine kinase domain, together with RNA encoding various activated FGFRs inhibits mesoderm induction by a receptor activated by a transmembrane domain mutation or extracellular mutations that introduce an unpaired cysteine residue into the extracellular domain but does not inhibit mesoderm induction by receptors bearing a tyrosine kinase domain mutation. These results indicate that different point mutations may activate FGFRs by distinct mechanisms and that ligand-independent FGFR activation may be a feature in common to many skeletal disorders.

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: RTKreceptor tyrosine kinaseFGFfibroblast growth factorFGFRFGF receptorBSAbovine serum albuminIgimmunoglobulin-like. have been shown to play a key role in developmental processes such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Many RTKs have been shown to be expressed at high levels during embryonic development (1Pawson T. Bernstein A. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 350-356Google Scholar). Evidence also indicates that when normal RTK function is disrupted during embryogenesis, major phenotypic changes and embryonic lethality can occur (2Peters K. Werner S. Liao X. Wert S. Whitsett J. Williams L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3296-3301Google Scholar, 3Stein P.L. Vogel H. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1999-2007Google Scholar, 4Yamaguchi T.P. Harpal K. Henkemeyer M. Rossant J.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 3045-3057Google Scholar). RTK signal transduction pathways are highly conserved in both vertebrates and invertebrates (1Pawson T. Bernstein A. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 350-356Google Scholar, 7Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Google Scholar). RTK signaling is normally initiated by ligand binding followed by receptor dimerization that results in auto/trans-phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues (7Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Google Scholar). Mutations in RTKs have been shown to result in deregulation of tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in ligand-independent activation. Many of the activating mutations identified in RTKs have been shown to be oncogenic (7Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Google Scholar). receptor tyrosine kinase fibroblast growth factor FGF receptor bovine serum albumin immunoglobulin-like. The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) constitute a family of at least nine structurally related but genetically distinct members, all of which have been implicated in a variety of biological processes including mitogenesis, angiogenesis, migration, differentiation, and mesoderm induction (8Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-40Google Scholar). A family of at least four high affinity transmembrane tyrosine kinases comprise the FGF receptor (FGFR) family (8Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-40Google Scholar, 9Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Google Scholar, 10Friesel R.E. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Google Scholar). These receptors share several structural features in common, including three extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and an intracellullar split tyrosine kinase domain with a 14-amino acid insertion (8Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-40Google Scholar, 9Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Google Scholar). Several isoforms of each FGFR have been identified and are the result of alternative splicing of their mRNAs (11Johnson D.E. Lu J. Chen H. Werner S. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4627-4634Google Scholar, 12Chellaiah A.T. McEwen D.G. Werner S. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Google Scholar). Some of the receptor variants that result from this alternative splicing give rise to isoforms with different ligand binding specificities and affinities (13Zimmer Y. Givol D. Yayon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7899-7903Google Scholar, 14Cheon H.-G. LaRochelle W.J. Bottaro D.P. Burgess W.H. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 989-993Google Scholar, 15Miki T. Bottaro D.P.

In several vertebrate species, the spatiotemporal expression patterns of FGFs and FGFRs indicates that these polypeptides may have tissue-specific as well as developmental-specific functions (16Orr-Urtreger A. Givol D. Yayon A. Yarden Y. Lonai P. Development. 1991; 113: 1419-1434Google Scholar, 17Peters K. Ornitz D. Werner S. Williams L. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 423-430Google Scholar, 18Friesel R.

Targeted disruption of fgfr1 and fgf4 have demonstrated that FGF signaling pathways are crucial to vertebrate embryogenesis. Mice homozygous for the fgfr1 null mutation die shortly after gastrulation with defects in mesodermal patterning (4Yamaguchi T.P. Harpal K. Henkemeyer M. Rossant J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 3032-3044Google Scholar, 6Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Shen M.M. Daugherty C. Ornitz D.M. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 3045-3057Google Scholar). Homozygous mutant fgf4 mice die at embryonic day 6.5 presumably due to failure of proliferation of the inner cell mass (20Feldman B. Poueymirou W. Papaioannou V.E. DeChiara T.M. Goldfarb M. Science. 1995; 267: 246-249Google Scholar). More recently, targeted disruption of fgfr3 demonstrates that this receptor is a negative regulator of endochondral ossification (21Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Google Scholar). These and other FGF mutations (9Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Google Scholar) indicate that FGFs and FGFRs play multiple roles in development. Other advances in our understanding of the developmental roles of FGFRs have resulted from the recent identification of mutations in human FGFR genes associated with dysmorphic syndromes of bone growth and development (reviewed in 9Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Google Scholar and 22Park W.-J. Bellus G.A. Jabs E.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 748-754Google Scholar). Mutations in FGFR3 have been shown to be responsible for achondroplasia (23Shiang R. Thompson L.M. Zhu Y. Church D.M. Fielder T.J. Bocian M. Winokur S.T. Wasmuth J.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 335-342Google Scholar, 24Rousseau F. Bonaventure J. Legeal-Mallet L. Pelet A. Rozet J. Maroteaux P. LeMerrer M. Munnich A.

Nature Genet. 1995; 9: 321-328Google Scholar), and hypochondroplasia (26Bellus G.A. McIntosh I. Smith E.A. Aylsworth A.S. Kaitila I. Horton W.A. Greenhaw G.A. Hecht J.T. Francomano C.A. Nature Genet. 1995; 10: 357-359Google Scholar), which are all forms of dwarfism with varying degrees of severity. Mutations in the extracellular domain of FGFR1 have been associated with Pfeiffer syndrome (27Muenke M. Schell U. Hehr A. Robin N.H. Losken H.W. Schinzel A. Pulleyn L.J. Rutland P. Reardon W. Malcolm S. Winter R.M. Nature Genet. 1994; 8: 269-274Google Scholar), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by craniosynostosis, an abnormality in which the cranial sutures fuse prematurely. Individuals with Pfeiffer syndrome also display hand and foot abnormalities (27Muenke M. Schell U. Hehr A. Robin N.H. Losken H.W. Schinzel A. Pulleyn L.J. Rutland P. Reardon W. Malcolm S. Winter R.M. Nature Genet. 1994; 8: 269-274Google Scholar). Mutations in FGFR2 have been identified in Pfeiffer syndrome (28Rutland P. Pulleyn L.J. Reardon W. Baraister M. Hayward R. Jones B. Malcolm S. Winter R.M. Oldridge M. Slaney S.F. Poole M.D. Wilkie A.O.M. Nature Genet. 1995; 9: 173-176Google Scholar) and in three other craniosynostotic syndromes referred to as Crouzon (29Reardon W. Winter R.M. Rutland P. Pulleyn L.J. Jones B.M. Malcolm S. Nature Genet. 1994; 8: 98-103Google Scholar), Apert (30Wilkie A.O.M. Slaney S.F. Oldridge M. Poole M.D. Ashworth G.J. Hockley A.D. Hayward R.D. David D.J. Pulleyn L. Rutland P. Nature Genet. 1995; 9: 165-172Google Scholar), and Jackson-Weiss syndromes (31Jabs E.W. Li X. Scott A.F. Meyers C. Chen W. Eccles M. Mao J. Charnas L.R. Jackson C.E. Jaye M. Nature Genet. 1994; 8: 275-279Google Scholar). Like Pfeiffer syndrome, Apert and Jackson-Weiss syndromes have associated hand and foot abnormalities, whereas individuals with Crouzon syndrome have normal hands and feet (22Park W.-J. Bellus G.A. Jabs E.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 748-754Google Scholar, 29Reardon W. Winter R.M. Rutland P. Pulleyn L.J. Jones B.M. Malcolm S. Nature Genet. 1994; 8: 98-103Google Scholar). The identification of mutations in FGFRs associated with these syndromes provides genetic evidence that FGF signaling may be involved in bone and limb growth and morphogenesis. To determine the functional consequences of the mutations identified in these dysmorphic syndromes, we have introduced analogous missense mutations into Xenopus FGFR1(XFGFR1) and FGFR2 (XFGFR2). Expression of all but one of these mutant receptors in Xenopus oocytes results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity relative to wild-type receptors. In addition, expression of the mutant receptors with elevated tyrosine kinase activity in Xenopus animal caps results in ligand-independent induction of mesoderm as determined by both morphological and molecular criteria. These results indicate that the majority of mutations in FGFRs associated with human disorders of bone growth and development are likely to result in constitutive activation of these mutant receptors; thus, aberrant FGFR signaling is likely to contribute to the etiology of these syndromes. A murine monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine, PY20, was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to FGFR were prepared as described previously (32Brown S.A.N. Friesel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1116-1122Google Scholar). For some experiments, an anti-XFGFR1 monoclonal antibody was used (33Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Google Scholar). C4-Raf cDNA and N17-Ras cDNA were obtained from U. Rapp (National Cancer Institute) and T. Sargent (National Institutes of Health), respectively. XFD, a dominant negative FGFR1, was a gift from E. Amaya (University of California). Recombinant FGF-1 was a gift from W. Burgess (Holland Laboratory) and recombinant FGF-2 was obtained from Bachem. Both FGF-1 and FGF-2 were iodinated according to published procedures (34Friesel R. Burgess W.H. Mehlman T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7581-7584Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel et al. (35Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar) using the Mutagene kit from Bio-Rad. A BamHI fragment encoding the two Ig loop isoform of XFGFR1 (36Friesel R. Dawid I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2481-2488Google Scholar) was subcloned into pTZ18U and pTZ19U (Bio-Rad). Point mutations were introduced with the mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′-GAAATTATCATCTACCGCACGGGGGCTGCTT-3′ (for the FGFR1-C289R mutant), 5′-ACAAAAGTTGCTGTGGCGATGTTGAAGTCTGAT-3′ (for the FGFR1-C289R/K420A mutant using FGFR1-C289R as the template), 5′-AGCAGCCCCCGTCTTGTAGATGAT-3′ (for the FGFR1-C289K mutant), 5′-GTTGAGCGTTCCCGACACCGCCCA-3′ (for the FGFR1-P160R mutant), 5′-ATTTGTCGTTTCCTTATAATAGTC-3′ (for the FGFR1-K562E mutant), and 5′-GTTAGCGGCCAAGTAGGTATACTG-3′ (for the FGFR1-C249Y mutant). A BamHI fragment encoding the entire open reading frame of XFGFR2 was subcloned into pTZ19U and used as template for mutagenesis (18Friesel R. Brown S.A.N. Development. 1992; 116: 1051-1058Google Scholar). The primer 5′-GTACACCTTAAAGACAAACTCTGC-3′ was used to make the FGFR2-C268F mutant. The FGFR2-C268F/C332Y mutant was prepared using the FGFR2-C268F mutant oligonucleotide and the previously described FGFR2-C332Y mutant as the template (37Neilson K.M. Friesel R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26037-26040Google Scholar). The pTZ18U-XFGFR1, pTZ19U-XFGFR1, and pTZ19U-XFGFR2 mutant constructs were digested with BamHI and subcloned into the BglII site of the plasmid pSP64T3 (gift of D. Melton, Harvard University) or the BamHI site of the plasmid pCS2+ (38Rupp R.A.W. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Google Scholar). The identity of each mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme mapping. Stage VI oocytes were obtained from mature female Xenopus laevis (Nasco). Oocytes were defolliculated by mild collagenase treatment and maintained in 1 × MBS (39Peng H.B. Practical Uses in Cell and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, New York1991Google Scholar) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 18°C. Oocytes were injected with the indicated amounts of RNA in a volume of 10-50 nl and incubated for 2 days before immunoblot analysis, in vitro immune complex kinase assays or cross-linking. Injected oocytes were extracted in cold lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl, 1.0 mM EGTA) containing 0.1 mM NaVO4. Lysates were extracted with 1 volume of freon to remove yolk proteins and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Equal amounts of protein were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer, with or without β-mercaptoethanol, and proteins were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-8.5% or 6% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell). Filters were blocked in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% BSA at 37°C for 1 h. Bound primary antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) procedures (DuPont NEN). Oocyte lysates were prepared as described above, and equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FGFR antibodies (32Brown S.A.N. Friesel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1116-1122Google Scholar). Immune complexes were immobilized on protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech), washed extensively with lysis buffer, washed once in kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MnCl2) and finally resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μCi of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (DuPont NEN). Reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 20 min. Reactions were terminated by washing once in lysis buffer followed by solubilization with 2 × SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated on SDS-8.5% polyacrylamide gels, fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography as described previously (32Brown S.A.N. Friesel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1116-1122Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 5 ng of wild-type or mutant receptor RNA and incubated as described above for 2 days prior to cross-linking analysis. Oocytes expressing either wild-type or mutant FGFRs were incubated in 0.5 ml of 1 × MBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 units/ml heparin (Upjohn) (binding buffer) in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml 125I-FGF-1 (6-10 × 104 cpm/ng) or 125I-FGF-2 (8-12 × 104 cpm/ng) for 2 h at 4°C, followed by extensive washing in binding buffer. Receptor-ligand complexes were cross-linked by adding disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) to oocytes at a final concentration of 0.3 mM for 20 min at 4°C. Oocyte lysates were prepared as described above, and ligand-receptor complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Cross-linked complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Eggs were collected from mature Xenopus laevis females and fertilized in vitro as described (40Moon R.T. Christian J.L. Technique. 1989; 1: 76-89Google Scholar). Eggs were dejellied 60 min after fertilization with 2% cysteine, pH 7.8-8.1, and washed extensively in 0.1 × MBS. At the two cell stage, embryos were transferred to 1 × MMR (5 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 5% Ficoll. Each blastomere at the two-cell stage was injected with 5-10 nl containing the indicated amount of RNA. Injected embryos were incubated in 1 × MMR containing 5% Ficoll until stage 7-8 (41Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus Laevis (Daudin). North Holland, Amsterdam1967Google Scholar) at which time they were transferred to 0.5 × MMR for animal cap dissection. Embryos were staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (41Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus Laevis (Daudin). North Holland, Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). Animal caps were dissected from embryos at stages 8-9 and incubated in 0.5 × MMR containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 50 μg/ml gentamicin in the presence or absence of recombinant FGF-1 (50 ng/ml) at 18°C. Induction was scored by morphological evidence of convergent extension of animal cap elongation at neurula stages (37Neilson K.M. Friesel R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26037-26040Google Scholar, 42Green J.B. Howes G. Symes K. Cooke J. Smith J.C. Development. 1990; 108: 173-183Google Scholar). Animal caps were harvested when control embryos reached stage 22-30 for analysis of muscle α-actin mRNA expression. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by RNA gel blot analysis as described previously (43Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Members of the FGFR family possess two or three immunoglobulin-like domains in their extracellular domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain split by a short kinase insert sequence (8Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-40Google Scholar, 10Friesel R.E. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Mutations in each of these three major domains have been identified in several human disorders of bone growth and development (9Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Google Scholar). We have previously described a C332Y mutation in the extracellular domain of XFGFR2 that is analogous to the C342Y mutation most commonly seen in Crouzon syndrome (37Neilson K.M. Friesel R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26037-26040Google Scholar). This mutation results in constitutive activation of the receptor. In order to determine the biochemical consequences of other FGFR mutations associated with dysmorphic syndromes of bone growth and development, we have made mutations in the extracellular, transmembrane, and tyrosine kinase domains of XFGFR1 and in the extracellular domain of XFGFR2 (Fig. 1). Achondroplasia has been shown to associated with a G380R mutation in the transmembrane domain of human FGFR3 (23Shiang R. Thompson L.M. Zhu Y. Church D.M. Fielder T.J. Bocian M. Winokur S.T. Wasmuth J.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 335-342Google Scholar, 24Rousseau F. Bonaventure J. Legeal-Mallet L. Pelet A. Rozet J. Maroteaux P. LeMerrer M. Munnich A. Nature. 1994; 371: 252-254Google Scholar). To determine the functional consequences of this mutation in a FGFR family member, we have made a C289R mutation in the transmembrane domain of the two Ig loop form of XFGFR1 that is identical in position to the FGFR3 G380R mutation as defined by the first basic residue that demarcates the end of transmembrane domains (23Shiang R. Thompson L.M. Zhu Y. Church D.M. Fielder T.J. Bocian M. Winokur S.T. Wasmuth J.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 335-342Google Scholar, 24Rousseau F. Bonaventure J. Legeal-Mallet L. Pelet A. Rozet J. Maroteaux P. LeMerrer M. Munnich A. Nature. 1994; 371: 252-254Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To determine the specificity of this mutation we have also created a C289K mutation as well as a kinase-deficient C289R mutant (XFGFR1-C289R/K420A) (Fig. 1). Thanatophoric dysplasia type II, another form of dwarfism is characterized by mutations in the extracellular and tyrosine kinase domains of FGFR3 (25Tavormina P.L. Shiang R. Thompson L.M. Zhu Y.-Z. Wilkin D.J. Lachman R.S. Wilcox W.R. Rimoin D.L. Cohn D.H. Wasmuth J.J. Nature Genet. 1995; 9: 321-328Google Scholar). One of the most frequently identified mutations in this syndrome is a K650E mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (25Tavormina P.L. Shiang R. Thompson L.M. Zhu Y.-Z. Wilkin D.J. Lachman R.S. Wilcox W.R. Rimoin D.L. Cohn D.H. Wasmuth J.J. Nature Genet. 1995; 9: 321-328Google Scholar). The region of the tyrosine kinase domain in which this mutation occurs is highly conserved among all members of the FGFR family (8Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-40Google Scholar). To determine the consequences of this mutation, we have made a K562E mutation in the two Ig loop form XFGFR1. Many of the mutations associated with these skeletal disorders result in the loss of a cysteine residue that disrupts disulfide bond formation between the two highly conserved cysteines that form the IgIII domain (9Wilkie A.O.M. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Google Scholar, 22Park W.-J. Bellus G.A. Jabs E.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 748-754Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that a C332Y mutation in XFGFR2 which is homologous to a mutation in Crouzon syndrome results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor (37Neilson K.M. Friesel R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26037-26040Google Scholar). To further characterize the nature of these mutations, we have made a C268F mutation in XFGFR2 analogous to another Crouzon syndrome mutation in human FGFR2 (C278F) (22Park W.-J. Bellus G.A. Jabs E.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 748-754Google Scholar). We have also made the double mutant XFGFR2-C268F/C332Y to determine the consequences of perturbing the IgIII domain without creating an unpaired cysteine residue. In addition, we have made a mutation in XFGFR1 (C249Y) which also results in an unpaired cysteine residue, that is also likely to affect ligand binding and may also result in intermolecular disulfide bond formation. This mutation was made to determine whether analogous mutations in two FGFR family members would have similar functional consequences. Pfeiffer syndrome has been characterized by several mutations in FGFR2, most of which have been proposed to result in the disruption of normal folding and disulfide bond formation in the IgIII domain (28Rutland P. Pulleyn L.J. Reardon W. Baraister M. Hayward R. Jones B. Malcolm S. Winter R.M. Oldridge M. Slaney S.F. Poole M.D. Wilkie A.O.M. Nature Genet. 1995; 9: 173-176Google Scholar). In addition, a mutation in FGFR1 has also been associated with Pfeiffer syndrome (27Muenke M. Schell U. Hehr A. Robin N.H. Losken H.W. Schinzel A. Pulleyn L.J. Rutland P. Reardon W. Malcolm S. Winter R.M. Nature Genet. 1994; 8: 269-274Google Scholar). The mutation in FGFR1 (P252R) occurs in the linker region between IgII and IgIII where a homologous mutation in FGFR2 (P253R) has been found in Apert syndrome (30Wilkie A.O.M. Slaney S.F. Oldridge M. Poole M.D. Ashworth G.J. Hockley A.D. Hayward R.D. David D.J. Pulleyn L. Rutland P. Nature Genet. 1995; 9: 165-172Google Scholar). We have made the analogous mutation in XFGFR1 (P160R) (Fig. 1) to determine the effect of this mutation on receptor function. To assess the biochemical consequences of these mutations, in vitro transcribed RNAs encoding wild-type or mutant XFGFR1 or XFGFR2 were injected into Xenopus oocytes. Lysates from uninjected control oocytes or RNA injected oocytes were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine. Oocytes expressing either wild-type XFGFR1 (XFGFR1-WT) or wild-type XFGFR2 (XFGFR2-WT) exhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of several polypeptides including autophosphorylation of the receptors themselves (Fig. 2). Activation of the wild-type receptor tyrosine kinase in the absence of ligand is most likely due to the high density of receptor expression on the surface of the oocyte as described previously (37Neilson K.M. Friesel R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26037-26040Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins was significantly increased in lysates from oocytes expressing XFGFR1 mutants C289R, K562E, and C249Y (Fig. 2A). Noteworthy are the tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides of 240, 160, 120, and 90 kDa that are not evident in XFGFR1-WT lysates. In contrast, XFGFR1-C289K and P160R did not exhibit increases in tyrosine phosphorylation above that seen in XFGFR1-WT lysates (Fig. 2A). Lysates prepared from oocytes injected with XFGFR1-C289R/K420A RNA did not exhibit any tyrosine phosphorylation, and were comparable to lysates prepared from uninjected oocytes (Fig. 2A). Lysates from the XFGFR2-C268F also exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation when compared to XFGFR2-WT lysates, and is similar to the increases seen with XFGFR2-C332Y as previously reported (Fig. 2 C) (37Neilson K.M. Friesel R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26037-26040Google Scholar). Particularly prominent are phosphotyrosine-containing polypeptides of 85-95 kDa seen in XFGFR2-C268F lysates but not in XFGFR2-WT lysates. The XFGFR2-C268F/C332Y mutant exhibited increases in tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides similar to that of XFGFR2-C268F. Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots were stripped and reprobed with anti-FGFR antibodies to demonstrate equivalence of receptor protein expression in each lysate (Fig. 2, B and D). To confirm that increases in tyrosine phosphorylation seen with XFGFR mutants are the result of increased receptor tyrosine kinase activity, we performed immune complex kinase assays (32Brown S.A.N. Friesel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1116-1122Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of receptor protein (as shown in Fig. 2, C and D) were immunoprecipitated from oocyte lysates with anti-FGFR antibodies. Both XFGFR1-WT and XFGFR2-WT exhibit autophosphorylating activity in this assay (Fig. 3). In vitro tyrosine kinase activity was significantly increased for XFGFR1-C289R, K562E, and C249Y consistent with the antiphosphotyrosine immunoblot results. The XFGFR1-C289K and XFGFR1-P160R possess in vitro"

https://openalex.org/W2012299307,"The transfer of methylation between alleles represents a plausible epigenetic mutational mechanism to explain loss of imprinting in mammals and paramutation in plants. Here, we have exploited advantages unique to the fungus Ascobolus immersus to obtain direct experimental evidence that methylation transfer can occur between homologous chromosomes. A methylated allele and an unmethylated allele of the Ascobolus b2 spore color gene were brought together in individual meiotic cells. Frequent transfer of methylation to the unmethylated allele was observed. This transfer was polarized 5′ to 3′ along the b2 gene, as is gene conversion, and always accompanied the latter process when tested in the same cross. These and other observations strongly suggest that methylation transfer and recombination are mechanistically related."
https://openalex.org/W2032187456,"We demonstrate that the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) is specifically, proteolytically cleaved in HL-60 cells treated with staurosporine (STS), a potent inducer of apoptosis. The proteolysis of DNA-PKcs correlated with or preceded apoptotic chromosomal DNA degradation. Cell-free extracts prepared from STS-treated HL-60 cells recapitulated the proteolysis of DNA-PKcs in an in vitro assay using purified DNA-PK as the substrate. Western blot analyses of the apoptotic cell extract showed that the 32-kDa precursor of CPP32 is expressed in HL-60 cells and processed following STS treatment. In addition, whereas the DNA-PKcs protease activity was not inhibitable by many conventional protease inhibitors, it was inhibitable by a highly selective peptide-derived inhibitor of CPP32. These data strongly suggest that CPP32, or a CPP32-like protease, is responsible for DNA-PKcs proteolysis. Finally, our results demonstrated that the cleavage of DNA-PKcs in vitro proceeded in the presence of Bcl-2, indicating that the function provided by Bcl-2 lies upstream the proteolysis of DNA-PKcs.

In addition, dysregulated apoptosis appears to play a causative role in many human pathological states, including cancer, AIDS, and Alzheimer's disease (reviewed in 3Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Google Scholar). The regulation of apoptosis is thought to be mediated by the interplay of various apoptotic suppressor and inducer molecules (for recent reviews, see 4Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Google Scholar and 5Hockenbery D.M. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 631-638Google Scholar). In particular, one gene that is known to play an important role in suppressing apoptosis is bcl-2. bcl-2 encodes a strong apoptotic suppressor (reviewed in 5Hockenbery D.M. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 631-638Google Scholar), and bcl-2 knockout mice suffer massive apoptotic cell deaths in the lymphoid system, confirming that the expression of this gene is biologically important (6Nakayama K.

The mechanism by which apoptotic suppressors such as Bcl-2 exert their biological function(s) is unknown, but it is likely that they may regulate one or more proteolytic processing events mediated by the interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE) 1The abbreviations used are: ICEinterleukin-1β converting enzymePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseDNA-PKDNA-dependent protein kinaseDNA-PKcscatalytic subunit of DNA-PKDSBdouble-strand breakSTSstaurosporineTPCKL-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-4-phenyl-2-butanoneTLCKL-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-7-amino-2-heptanoneIAiodoacetamidePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideNEMN-ethylmaleimide. family of proteases. The identification of ICE as a putative apoptotic protease (7Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Google Scholar) was followed by the isolation of a large number of homologues of ICE, including Ich-1/Nedd2, CPP32, Ich-2, and Mch-2 (for reviews, see 8Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Google Scholar and 9Takahashi A. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 50-55Google Scholar). All the ICE homologues are cytoplasmic cysteine proteases, and it has been shown that their overexpression induces apoptosis (reviewed in 2Hale A.J. Smith C.A. Sutherland L.C. Stoneman V.E.A.

Several targets of the cytoplasmic apoptotic proteases that have been identified so far are, surprisingly, nuclear proteins including but not restricted to lamin B1 (11Neamati N. Fernandez A.

Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Google Scholar), the proteases that degrade the other proteins remain to be identified. In addition, it is unclear how many more proteolytic target proteins there may be that are specifically related to apoptosis. Therefore, the identification of other biologically relevant target proteins and their corresponding apoptotic proteases is one of the critical areas of future investigation. One of the terminal steps of apoptosis is nucleolytic degradation of chromosomes into double-stranded, nucleosome-sized fragments. A complex, which has DNA-dependent serine-threonine protein kinase activity (DNA-PK) and which consists of at least three components, the 460-kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and the heterodimeric Ku protein, has been shown to be intimately involved in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair (reviewed in 19Anderson C.W. Carter T.H. Jessberger R. Lieber M.R. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology: Lymphocyte Neoplasia and DNA Rearrangements in the Immune System.

DNA-PKcs is thought to be the product of the severe combined immune deficiency (scid) gene, and it has long been known that animals homozygously mutated at this locus were defective in DNA DSB repair (22Biedermann K.A.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4061-4065Google Scholar). Ku is a heterodimeric protein of 70- and 86-kDa subunits, which binds tightly to a variety of double-stranded DNA ends (reviewed in 20Jeggo P.A. Taccioli G.E. Jackson S.P. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 949-957Google Scholar and 21Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 19-25Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that members of the fifth x-ray cross-complementation group (XRCC5), which are DNA DSB repair-defective and lack Ku DNA end-binding activity, are mutated in the Ku86 gene (24Errami A. Smider V. Rathmell W.K. He D.M. Hendrickson E.A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1519-1526Google Scholar). Thus, DNA-PK has been unequivocally identified as an important mammalian DNA repair complex, and mutations in either the DNA-PKcs or the 86-kDa subunit of Ku result in DNA DSB repair defects. In this study, we demonstrate that DNA-PKcs is selectively proteolytically cleaved in the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line following apoptotic induction. In addition, we demonstrate that this proteolytic step can be blocked in vivo by the apoptotic protease inhibitors, iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide. Recapitulation of DNA-PKcs proteolysis was achieved in vitro, and inhibitors highly selective for the CPP32 apoptotic protease prevented cleavage. These studies demonstrate that DNA-PK is an apoptotic target and provide important insights into the terminal steps of apoptotic induction.

Cells were treated with 5 μM STS for various lengths of time. At the end of each treatment, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then resuspended in an aliquot of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, and immediately heated at 100°C for 10 min. DNase I (10 μg/107 cells) was added to the lysate, and the sample was incubated at 37°C for 5 min. The sample was then mixed with an equal volume of a 2 × urea/glycerol/SDS solution (7 M urea, 30% glycerol, 3% SDS), and heated at 100°C for 10 min. Protein concentration of the sample was subsequently determined using detergent-compatible protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad). The protein extracts were subjected to electrophoresis in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (6% for DNA-PKcs, 10% for Ku, and Ich-1L, and 12% for Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, and CPP32 analyses). The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose paper by electrophoresis in a Trans-Blot chamber (Bio-Rad), and proteins were identified using antibodies and ECL-Western reagents (Amersham Corp.). HL-60 cells (5 × 108) were either left untreated or were exposed to 5 μM STS for 2 h. Cells were then washed in 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline three times and resuspended in extraction buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 250 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2; 5 mM CaCl2; 1 mM dithiothreitol; 0.5 mM PMSF; 50 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain; 20% glycerol). The cell suspension was subjected to four or five cycles of freezing and thawing in a isopropyl alcohol/dry ice bath until >95% of the cells were lysed as assessed by microscopic observation. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. The 100,000 × g supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C to remove any remaining insoluble material. The clear supernatant was kept at −85°C and assayed for the presence of DNA-PKcs protease activity. Purified DNA-PK (50-200 ng) was incubated with various amounts of cell extract in a final volume of 15 μl and a defined buffer condition (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 50 mM NaCl; 2 mM MgCl2; 2 mM CaCl; 50 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain; 0.5 mM PMSF; 1 mM dithiothreitol; 5% glycerol) for various times at 37°C as indicated in the text (see Fig. 4). When protease inhibitors were studied, the extract was first incubated with an inhibitor for 15 min at room temperature and then mixed with DNA-PK and incubated at 37°C for 45 min. At the end of the incubation, 10 μl of SDS-glycerol (5% SDS and 50% glycerol) was added to the sample, and the reaction was terminated by heating the sample at 100°C for 5 min. Proteolysis of DNA-PKcs was subsequently analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. We have recently demonstrated (30Han Z. Chatterjee D. He D.M. Early J. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5849-5857Google Scholar, 31Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628Google Scholar) and others have also shown (33Martin S.J. Lennon S.V. Bonham A.M. Cotter T.G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1859-1867Google Scholar, 34Kaufmann S.H.

Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Google Scholar) that the human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cell line is hypersensitive to a wide variety of apoptotic inducers including differentiation agents, protein synthesis inhibitors, protein kinase inhibitors, and DNA damage. In addition, we have described the isolation of a stable clonal variant of the HL-60 cell line, HCW-2, which is resistant to many of these apoptotic inducers (30Han Z. Chatterjee D. He D.M. Early J. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5849-5857Google Scholar, 31Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628Google Scholar). Since one of the terminal steps of apoptosis is the induction of chromosomal DNA DSBs and much, if not all, of mammalian DNA DSB repair is mediated by the DNA-PK complex (reviewed in 20Jeggo P.A. Taccioli G.E. Jackson S.P. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 949-957Google Scholar and 21Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 19-25Google Scholar), we investigated the status of this activity in HL-60 and HCW-2 cells. These results are presented below. The protein kinase inhibitor, STS, is an extremely potent inducer of apoptosis in HL-60 cells (31Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628Google Scholar, 36Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Google Scholar). Therefore, HL-60 and HCW-2 cells were either left untreated or were exposed to 5 μM STS for 5 h, and then whole cell extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis. When a monoclonal antibody (42-27; 26Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Google Scholar) that recognizes DNA-PKcs was used, a significant fraction of the DNA-PKcs in HL-60 cells was detected that exhibited a greatly increased gel mobility (Fig. 1A). The rapidly migrating protein fragment (hereafter termed ΔDNA-PKcs) migrated as an approximately 150-kDa polypeptide instead of the intact 460-kDa protein. Two lines of evidence suggested that the presumed proteolysis of DNA-PKcs was specific and related to apoptosis. First, no cleavage of Ku86 or Ku70 proteins was detected when either cell line was exposed to STS (Fig. 1B). Secondly, no cleavage of DNA-PKcs was detected following STS treatment of the apoptotic-resistant HCW-2 cell line (Fig. 1A). From these experiments we conclude that DNA-PKcs is specifically cleaved in HL-60 cells undergoing apoptosis. To investigate the cleavage of DNA-PKcs in more detail we next carried out a time course experiment. HL-60 cells were exposed to 5 μM STS, and at hourly intervals samples were analyzed for the appearance of ΔDNA-PKcs and degradation of DNA into nucleosome-sized fragments, which is a hallmark of cells undergoing apoptosis (1Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1986; 17: 755-785Google Scholar). ΔDNA-PKcs could be detected as early as 1 h after STS treatment but increased dramatically at 2 h (Fig. 2, top). Interestingly, detectable DNA fragmentation was observed in HL-60 cells only after 2 h post-STS exposure, and this increased at later times (Fig. 2, bottom). From this experiment we conclude that the appearance of ΔDNA-PKcs either coincides with or precedes the apoptotic DNA degradation process in HL-60 cells following STS treatment. It has been demonstrated that the cysteine-alkylating agents IA and NEM are potent inhibitors of apoptotic proteolysis (13Casciola-Rosen L. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Google Scholar, 14Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985Google Scholar, 17Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar). This inhibitory profile is consistent with the apoptotic cleavage enzymes being members of the ICE-like family of cysteine proteases (for a recent review, see 9Takahashi A. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 50-55Google Scholar). Importantly, most serine-, metallo-, and aspartate-protease inhibitors and E-64, which can inhibit certain cysteine proteases, in general do not appear to affect apoptotic proteolytic cleavages (13Casciola-Rosen L. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Google Scholar, 17Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar). Thus, we co-treated HL-60 cells with 5 μM STS and a variety of protease inhibitors for 5 h. Cellular extracts were then prepared and subjected to Western analysis. Impressively, IA and NEM completely blocked the appearance of ΔDNA-PKcs, whereas none of the other inhibitors had any effect on the proteolysis (Fig. 3). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the appearance of ΔDNA-PKcs is most likely attributable to an apoptotic cysteine protease. To study the process of STS-induced proteolysis of DNA-PKcs, cytosolic extract was prepared from HL-60 cells, which were treated with 5 μM STS for 2 h, as this appeared to be a minimum treatment required for the induction of proteolysis of DNA-PKcs (see Fig. 2). The presence of a DNA-PKcs protease in the extract was investigated in vitro using purified DNA-PK as the substrate. Extract prepared from STS-treated cells (hereafter referred to as “activated extract”) already contained a basal level of the cleaved endogenous ΔDNA-PKcs (Fig. 4A, lane 2). However, this did not obscure the striking degradation of exogenous DNA-PK in the extract. Typically, incubation of an additional 100 ng of purified DNA-PK with 40 μg of activated extract for 45-60 min induced complete proteolysis of the purified DNA-PKcs and resulted in a cleaved product with an approximate molecular mass of 150 kDa (Fig. 4A, lanes 3-8). In contrast, incubation of purified DNA-PK with the same amount of extract prepared from untreated HL-60 cells had no proteolytic effect on DNA-PKcs (Fig. 4A, lane 1), nor was proteolysis observed upon incubation of purified DNA-PK with buffer alone for 90 min (Fig. 4A, lane 9). These results suggested that the proteolysis of DNA-PKcs during apoptotic induction of HL-60 cells could be faithfully reconstituted in vitro. In vivo, DNA-PKcs, but not the Ku subunits, appeared to be an apoptotic proteolytic target (see Fig. 1). To assess whether this specificity was maintained in our in vitro system we assayed the stability of Ku86 and Ku70 by Western blot analysis following incubation of 40 μg of activated extract with 100 ng of purified DNA-PK at 37°C for 45 min. No evidence of proteolysis of either Ku subunit was observed (Fig. 4B). Thus, the protease activated by STS treatment of HL-60 cells showed the same specificity on exogenous DNA-PK in vitro as had been observed for endogenous DNA-PK in vivo. Since the in vitro proteolysis assay buffer contained 0.5 mM PMSF and 50 μg/ml of leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain, we inferred that proteases sensitive to these inhibitors were not responsible for cleaving DNA-PKcs. Therefore, the effect of other protease inhibitors on the DNA-PKcs proteolysis was investigated. The results showed that among the conventional inhibitors tested, only IA and NEM were able to block the DNA-PKcs protease activity in vitro (Fig. 5). This result recapitulated our in vivo observations (for comparison, see Fig. 3) and again suggested that the DNA-PKcs protease is a cysteine protease. A partial composition of the activated extract was determined to help identify potential critical apoptotic components. Western blot analysis of the cell extracts demonstrated that the 32-kDa precursor peptide of the CPP32 apoptotic protease was expressed in HL-60 cells under normal (nonactivated) conditions (Fig. 6A, lane 1). Upon activation, the amount of precursor CPP32 was reduced (Fig. 6A, lane 2). This most likely represents the conversion of this precursor protein into the two smaller subunits that make up the active CPP32 protease (17Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar, 37Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Google Scholar, 38Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Google Scholar). Unfortunately, our antibody, the only commercial CPP32 monoclonal antibody available, does not recognize either of the processed subunits, so we could not demonstrate this directly. Nevertheless, this result suggested that CPP32 might catalyze the proteolysis of DNA-PKcs. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that the level of another apoptotic protease, Ich-1L (39Wang L. Miura M. Begeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J.-Y. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Google Scholar), which also requires processing for activation, was not altered by STS treatment (Fig. 6B, compare lanes 1 and 2) and by the demonstration, using Northern blot analysis, that HL-60 cells do not even express ICE (data not shown). Thus, the expression pattern of CPP32 was most consistent with it being responsible for DNA-PKcs cleavage. To extend the above results, the effect of Ac-DEVD-CHO peptide, a highly selective inhibitor of CPP32 (17Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar), on DNA-PKcs cleavage in vitro was investigated. The results showed that 1 μM Ac-DEVD-CHO completely blocked proteolysis of DNA-PKcs by the activated extract (Fig. 7). As a control, the effect of Ac-YVAD-CHO peptide, a highly selective inhibitor of the ICE protease (25Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.-T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Google Scholar, 40Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Thornberry N. Ding G.J.F. Limjuco G. Weidner J. Salley J.P. Hogquist K.A. Chaplin D.D. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2964-2969Google Scholar), was examined, and as expected, the presence of up to 50 μM Ac-YVAD-CHO had no effect on the proteolysis of DNA-PKcs (Fig. 7). These results, combined with those from Western analyses (Fig. 6) strongly suggested that CPP32, or a CPP32-like enzyme, is most likely the DNA-PKcs protease. The expression of apoptotic suppressors and effectors is known to profoundly affect the susceptibility of cells to apoptotic signals. Thus, we examined by Western blot analyses the levels of apoptotic suppressor and effector proteins in our in vitro DNA-PK proteolysis assay samples. The activated extract contained the apoptosis suppressor protein Bcl-2, and the amount of Bcl-2 remained unchanged (Fig. 8B) at a time when the majority of DNA-PKcs was cleaved (Fig. 8A). Interestingly, the activated extracts did not contain detectable levels of the cell death effectors Bax and Bak (Fig. 8, C and D), although these proteins are expressed in HL-60 cells (30Han Z. Chatterjee D. He D.M. Early J. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5849-5857Google Scholar, 31Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628Google Scholar, and 49, and data not shown). From these results we conclude two things. First, Bcl-2 in the in vitro assay is not itself an apoptotic protease target, and secondly, and most importantly, neither the presence of Bcl-2 nor the absence of Bax and Bak in the extract prevented the proteolysis of DNA-PKcs by the activated CPP32-like activity. In this study, we have shown that the catalytic subunit of the DNA-PK complex is a proteolytic target in HL-60 cells undergoing apoptosis. In vivo inhibitor studies suggested that the DNA-PKcs protease is a member of the ICE family of apoptotic proteases. Reconstitution of the DNA-PKcs proteolysis reaction in vitro allowed the identification of the ICE homologue, CPP32, or a CPP32-like enzyme, as the protease most likely responsible for the DNA-PKcs proteolysis. The significance of these results is discussed below. The observation that proteolysis of DNA-PKcs was specific to cells undergoing apoptosis and that this cleavage could be abrogated by treating cells with the protease inhibitors IA and NEM in vivo (Fig. 3) and with the CPP32-selective tetrapeptide inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO in vitro (Fig. 7) demonstrated that DNA-PKcs is an apoptotic target. These data confirm and significantly extend previous studies that had suggested that the DNA-PK complex was altered in cells undergoing apoptosis. Ajmani et al. (41Ajmani A.K. Satoh M. Reap E. Cohen P.L. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2049-2058Google Scholar) initially demonstrated that DNA-PKcs protein levels were greatly diminished in mature human neutrophils destined to undergo apoptosis and in apoptotic HL-60 cells. We have shown here that the reduced DNA-PKcs protein levels are probably due directly to proteolysis (Fig. 1A). Second, Casciola-Rosen et al. (42Casciola-Rosen L. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1625-1634Google Scholar) recently reported that DNA-PKcs was proteolytically cleaved in apoptotic HeLa cells after ultraviolet light exposure. Our studies, utilizing a different cell type and a different apoptotic inducer, extend the observations of Rosen et al. and suggest that the proteolysis of DNA-PKcs may be a common event in many cells undergoing apoptosis. The biological implication of the above results is that proteolysis of DNA-PKcs facilitates apoptosis. This seems likely. Proteolytic cleavage of DNA-PKcs almost certainly inactivates DNA-PK activity. Work from a large number of laboratories has shown that mutations that deleteriously affect DNA-PK result in greatly diminished DNA DSB repair activity (reviewed in 19Anderson C.W. Carter T.H. Jessberger R. Lieber M.R. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology: Lymphocyte Neoplasia and DNA Rearrangements in the Immune System. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996Google Scholar, 20Jeggo P.A. Taccioli G.E. Jackson S.P. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 949-957Google Scholar, 21Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 19-25Google Scholar). Since one of the terminal steps of apoptosis is the activation of nucleases that induce DSBs in chromosomal DNA, it clearly would be counterproductive for the cell to simultaneously try to repair the damaged chromosomes. Thus, apoptosis should be facilitated by inactivating the major DNA DSB repair system. A correlate of this would be that apoptosis should be inhibited or abrogated by blocking the proteolysis of DNA-PKcs. Thus, DNA-PKcs may prove to be an important therapeutic target for antiapoptotic drugs. The second important observation that this study provides is that the apoptotic protease, CPP32, is most likely responsible for DNA-PKcs proteolysis. While the identification of apoptotic target proteins (for a review, see 8Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Google Scholar) and apoptotic proteases (for a review, see 9Takahashi A. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 50-55Google Scholar) is rapidly progressing, the identification of which proteases are responsible for cleaving which target proteins has lagged behind. Recently, several studies have shown that CPP32 is also the apoptotic protease responsible for the proteolysis of PARP (15Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar, 17Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar, 18Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Google Scholar). Thus, CPP32 is currently the most biologically relevant mammalian apoptotic protease. This is not to suggest that the other ICE family homologues are irrelevant to apoptosis, but rather that their substrates, tissue specificity, and/or developmental timing may not yet have been identified. ICE family proteases such as CPP32 have an absolute requirement for aspartic acid at the cleavage site, and this residue is frequently adjacent to a small hydrophobic residue (D-↓-X). For example, ICE cleaves the interleukin-1β precursor at FEAD-↓-G and YVHD-↓-A sites (40Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Thornberry N. Ding G.J.F. Limjuco G. Weidner J. Salley J.P. Hogquist K.A. Chaplin D.D. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2964-2969Google Scholar), and CPP32 cleaves PARP at a DEVD-↓-G site (15Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar, 17Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, in vitro ICE does not seem to cleave PARP at this site (15Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar). Therefore, each ICE family member protease may recognize and cleave its target(s) using a very specific amino acid sequence. Based on the size of ΔDNA-PKcs (~150 kDa) the putative proteolytic cleavage site in DNA-PKcs can be approximated, although there are many DX motifs in the DNA-PKcs coding sequence (43Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Google Scholar, 44Poltoratsky V.P. Shi X. York J.D. Lieber M.R. Carter T.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 15: 4529-4533Google Scholar) including two PARP-like motifs at amino acids 2979-2983 (DWVDG) and amino acids 2709-2713 (DEVDN). Cleavage at the DWVD-↓-G or DEVD-↓-N site would generate C-terminal polypeptides of ~125 and ~152 kDa, respectively. Since the latter fragment size is very close to the estimated size (~150 kDa) of ΔDNA-PKcs seen in HL-60 cells undergoing apoptosis it is tempting to speculate that DEVD-↓-N may be the CPP32 cleavage site in DNA-PKcs. Bcl-2 can suppress apoptotic induction by many stimuli in a variety of cell lines (reviewed in 45Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of Bax (46Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar, 47Knudson C.M. Tung K.S.K. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Google Scholar) and Bak (48Chittenden T. Harrington E.A. O'Connor R. Flemington C. Lutz R.J. Evan G.I. Guild B.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 733-736Google Scholar, 49Farrow S.N.

Barr P.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 736-739Google Scholar) can enhance apoptosis. Unfortunately, the biochemical mechanism(s) by which these apoptotic suppressors and effectors regulate apoptosis remains unknown. The only protein involved in apoptosis for which a mechanism of action is known is the baculoviral apoptotic suppressor protein, p35, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of the ICE family proteases (51Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 248-251Google Scholar, 52Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P. Licari P. Mankovich J. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Miller L.K. Wong W.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1885-1888Google Scholar). In our cell-free system, the proteolysis of DNA-PKcs took place in the presence of significant amounts of Bcl-2 protein (Fig. 8, A and B). These results suggest that the apoptotic suppressor protein Bcl-2 does not (or could not) directly inhibit the activated CPP32-like protease and thus is likely to be functioning in a manner distinct from p35. Last, while HL-60 cells express Bax (30Han Z. Chatterjee D. He D.M. Early J. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5849-5857Google Scholar, 31Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628Google Scholar) and Bak (49Farrow S.N. White J.H.M. Martinou I. Raven T. Pun K.-T. Grinham C.J. Martinou J.-C. Brown R. Nature. 1995; 374: 731-733Google Scholar, data not shown), our cell-free system lacked detectable amounts of these proteins (Fig. 8, C and D, respectively) and yet was clearly very apoptotic-competent. Thus, Bax and Bak are not directly involved in the proteolysis of DNA-PKcs. A simple interpretation of these data is that Bcl-2, Bax, and Bak are not needed for the proximal events of apoptosis but instead are more likely to be involved in upstream events such as apoptotic signal transduction. A number of recent reports have suggested that cell-free systems can at least carry out the proteolysis of the apoptotic target, PARP (15Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar, 17Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar). We have extensively characterized the in vivo response of HL-60 and HCW-2 cells to a variety of apoptotic inducers (30Han Z. Chatterjee D. He D.M. Early J. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5849-5857Google Scholar, 31Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that many of our previous observations, including, for example, the stability of Bcl-2 during apoptosis (31Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628Google Scholar), can be recapitulated in vitro. In addition, we also demonstrate that the proteolysis of DNA-PKcs that occurs in vivo (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) can be reproduced in vitro (Figs. 4, 5, and 8). Furthermore, using isolated nuclei from nonactivated HL-60 cells rather than purified DNA-PK as a substrate, we have recently shown that we can still detect specific proteolysis of DNA-PKcs (data not shown). Thus, these results suggest that our activated cell-free extracts faithfully mimic many of the events that occur in vivo. Further purification and characterization of these extracts should allow for a more complete biochemical description of the process of apoptosis. We thank Dr. Anja-Katrin Bielinsky for helpful discussions."

To determine whether partial inactivation of RARβ2 would predispose to lung cancer in mice, we generated three transgenic lines expressing antisense sequences. When killed at 13-3/4-18 months of age, 21/36 animals had a total of 43 pulmonary tumors superficially visible upon necropsy, whereas among 23 nontransgenic mice, only 1 had a single visible lung tumor. A twofold higher incidence of lung tumors was seen in homozygous vs. hemizygous antisense mice. The endogenous RARβ2 message level was reduced in transgenic lung tissue and further reduced in the tumors. RARβ4, a truncated isoform derived from the same transcript as RARβ2, does not carry the sequence identified by the antisense construct and its message was not as strongly affected. Immunofluorescence studies showed that RARβ was virtually undetectable in the tumors, but present in normal tissue. We conclude that RARβ2, but probably not RARβ4, plays an important role in suppression of murine lung tumorigenesis.— Bérard, J., Laboune, F., Mukuna, M., Massé, S., Kothary, R., Bradley, W. E. C.

This protein resembles Xenopus laevis nucleoplasmin, and it has therefore been termed dNLP, for Drosophila nucleoplasmin-like protein. dNLP is a nuclear protein that is present throughout development. Both purified native and recombinant dNLP bind to core histones and can function in the assembly of approximately regularly spaced nucleosomal arrays in a reaction that additionally requires DNA, purified core histones, ATP, and a partially purified fraction (containing at least one other assembly activity). We also analyzed the properties of an N-terminally truncated version of dNLP, termed dNLP-S, and found that the deletion of the N-terminal 31 residues of dNLP results in a loss of the specificity of the interaction of dNLP with core histones. We then compared the abilities of dNLP and Drosophila nucleosome assembly protein-1 (dNAP-1) to promote the decondensation of Xenopus sperm chromatin, a process that can be mediated by nucleoplasmin. We observed that dNAP-1, but not dNLP, was able to promote the decondensation of sperm chromatin. These and other data collectively suggest that dNLP may participate in parallel with other histone-binding proteins such as dNAP-1 in the assembly of chromatin.

Chromatin assembly is a fundamental process that is involved in a broad range of biological phenomena such as gene regulation, recombination, DNA repair, and progression through the cell cycle, and it is therefore important to investigate the factors that participate in the formation of chromatin (for reviews, see 1Dilworth S.M.

The analysis of chromatin assembly has revealed that the deposition of the core histones H3 and H4 precedes the incorporation of H2A and H2B into chromatin, and that both the pre-existing and newly synthesized histones are randomly distributed among the daughter DNA strands. Moreover, the newly synthesized histones, which are more highly acetylated in their lysine-rich N-terminal tails relative to bulk histones, become deacetylated after assembly into chromatin. Chromatin assembly commences immediately after DNA replication, and DNA replication and chromatin assembly appear to be coupled, although possibly by an indirect mechanism, as chromatin assembly appears to occur preferentially, but not obligatorily, with newly replicated DNA (see, for instance, 8Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kaufman P.D. Stillman B. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 810-817Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of chromatin assembly have led to the identification of several core histone-binding factors, which include nucleoplasmin (9Laskey R.A. Honda B.M. Mills A.D. Finch J.T.

These factors may therefore act, at least in part, as histone chaperones that deliver the core histones to the newly replicated DNA. Moreover, because of their related biochemical properties, it is possible that there may be some redundancy in the function of these histone-binding factors in chromatin assembly. nucleosome assembly protein 1 chromatin assembly factor Drosophila chromatin assembly factor 1 a protein fraction derived from Drosophila embryos that contains dCAF-1 a protein fraction derived from Drosophila embryos that contains dNAP-1 and dNLP Drosophila nucleosome assembly protein 1 Drosophila nucleoplasmin-like protein short N-terminally truncated version of the Drosophila nucleoplasmin-like protein phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction. The mechanism of chromatin assembly is likely, however, to be more complex than the random deposition of histones that is mediated by the core histone-binding factors alone. For instance, it is known from studies of chromatin assembly activities in crude extracts derived from Xenopus laevis oocytes (25Glikin G.C. Ruberti I. Worcel A. Cell. 1984; 37: 33-41Google Scholar), HeLa cells (26Banerjee S. Cantor C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2863-2873Google Scholar), or Drosophila melanogaster embryos (27Becker P.B. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2241-2249Google Scholar, 28Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Google Scholar) that the assembly of approximately regularly spaced nucleosomal arrays is an ATP-dependent process. Biochemical fractionation of a chromatin assembly extract from Drosophila embryos led to the identification of two fractions, termed dCAF-1 and dCAF-4, which, when combined, were able to reconstitute the ATP-facilitated assembly of nucleosomal arrays, as was observed with the crude extract (29Bulger M. Ito T. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11726-11730Google Scholar). One component in the dCAF-4 fraction was purified and cloned, and found to be the Drosophila homologue of NAP-1 (dNAP-1) (21Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Google Scholar). Purified recombinant dNAP-1 was observed to function in a cooperative manner with the active component(s) in the dCAF-1 fraction to mediate the ATP-facilitated assembly of nucleosomal arrays. The ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly factor(s) in the dCAF-1 fraction has not yet been identified, although it is known that the Drosophila homologue of CAF-1 (termed dCAF-1 protein, which should not be confused with the dCAF-1 fraction) is present in the partially purified fraction. These and other data collectively suggest a model for chromatin assembly wherein nucleoplasmin and/or NAP-1 function as a carrier for H2A-H2B, N1/N2 and/or CAF-1 function as a carrier for H3-H4, and an additional factor(s) (in the dCAF-1 fraction) mediates the ATP-dependent assembly of nucleosomes by acting in conjunction with the histone chaperones. In this study, we focus upon the further investigation of components in the dCAF-4 fraction, and describe the purification, cloning, and characterization of a second core histone-binding protein. The primary amino acid sequence of this protein resembles that of X. laevis nucleoplasmin, and it has therefore been termed dNLP, for Drosophila nucleoplasmin-like protein. All operations were performed at 4°C. The S-190 chromatin assembly extract (28Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Google Scholar, 30Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar) was sequentially subjected to chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), SP-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia), and Q-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia) resins to give the dCAF-4 fraction (29Bulger M. Ito T. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11726-11730Google Scholar). To this fraction, 4 M ammonium sulfate (adjusted to pH 7 by the addition of NaOH) was added to a final concentration of 2.75 M. The mixture was incubated for 20 min and then subjected to centrifugation (Sorvall SS-34 rotor; 10,000 rpm for 10 min). The supernatant (containing the dNLP) was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) column (column volume = 0.5 ml; column dimensions (diameter × length) = 0.5 × 2.5 cm; flow rate = 0.1 ml/min; fraction size = 0.5 ml). The column was washed with three column volumes of buffer R (10 mM Hepes (K+), pH 7.6, containing 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 2.5 M ammonium sulfate, and protein was eluted with a linear gradient (over 10 column volumes) from 2.5 M to 0 M ammonium sulfate in buffer R. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the peak dNLP-containing fractions were pooled and then dialyzed against buffer R. The purified dNLP was subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the protein was visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G. The dNLP band was excised, and the protein was digested with a lysylendopeptidase (Achromobacter protease I; Wako Chemicals). The resulting peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography with a C-18 column (Vydac) and sequenced by automated Edman degradation (Applied Biosystems model 470, 473, or 477). A fragment of the cDNA was obtained by using reverse transcription-PCR with oligonucleotides corresponding to the coding sequences of the peptides, and six independent cDNAs (four of which were of the dNLP type, and two of which were of the dNLP-S type) were isolated by screening a Drosophila embryo cDNA library (embryos were collected from 0 to 4 h after egg deposition) in λZAPII with the radiolabeled, PCR-amplified fragment. Both the dNLP and dNLP-S cDNAs were sequenced completely from both strands. The dNLP cDNA was directly subcloned into the NcoI and BamHI sites of pET15b (Novagen) to give the bacterial expression plasmid pETdNLP. The dNLP-S cDNA was amplified by PCR and then subcloned into the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET15b to give the plasmid pETdNLP-S, and the coding region of this plasmid was completely resequenced to confirm the absence of mutagenesis during the PCR process. A freshly transformed colony of pETdNLP (or alternatively, pETdNLP-S) in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was grown at 37°C in a volume of 2 liters to A600 nm of approximately 0.6, and synthesis of dNLP (or dNLP-S) was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.4 mM final concentration. The cultures were incubated for an additional 3 h at 37°C. Unless stated otherwise, all subsequent operations were performed at 4°C. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (Sorvall GSA rotor; 5000 rpm for 5 min) and resuspended in 40 ml of Buffer R. The bacteria were lysed by sonication, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (Sorvall SS-34 rotor; 10,000 rpm for 10 min). Then, 4 M ammonium sulfate (pH 7.0) was added to the supernatant to final concentration of 2.25 M (for dNLP; for dNLP-S, the final concentration of ammonium sulfate was 1.75 M). The mixture was incubated for 20 min, and then subjected to centrifugation (Sorvall SS-34 rotor; 10,000 rpm for 10 min). The supernatant was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) column (column volume = 30 ml; column dimensions (diameter × length) = 1.6 × 15 cm; flow rate = 1 ml/min; fraction size = 5 ml). The column was washed with three column volumes of buffer R containing 2.25 M ammonium sulfate (for dNLP; for dNLP-S, the buffer R contained 1.75 M ammonium sulfate), and protein was eluted with a linear gradient (10 column volumes) from 2.25 to 0 M ammonium sulfate (for dNLP; for dNLP-S, the gradient was from 1.75 M to 0 M ammonium sulfate). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the peak dNLP-containing (or dNLP-S-containing) fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer R containing 0.2 M NaCl. The resulting sample was applied onto tandemly linked P-11 (first column; phosphocellulose, Whatman; column volume = 30 ml; column dimensions (diameter × length) = 1.6 × 15 cm; flow rate = 0.2 ml/min) and Mono Q (second column; HR 5/5; Pharmacia) columns. After application of the protein sample, the P-11 column was removed, and the Mono Q resin was washed with four column volumes of buffer R containing 0.2 M NaCl. dNLP (or dNLP-S) was eluted with a linear gradient (10 column volumes) from 0.2 to 1 M NaCl in buffer R. dNLP (or dNLP-S) eluted from the Mono Q resin at roughly 250 mM NaCl. The protein content of the fractions was analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nuclease activity in the fractions was detected by incubation of plasmid DNA with the samples at 37°C for 1 h in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2, followed by analysis of the DNA by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial nucleic acid contamination was monitored by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide. The peak dNLP- or dNLP-S-containing fractions, which were not contaminated with nucleases or bacterial nucleic acids, were dialyzed against buffer R (with no additional salt), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Chromatin assembly reactions were performed under the conditions (at 57 mM KCl) described by Bulger et al. (29Bulger M. Ito T. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11726-11730Google Scholar) by using circular plasmid DNA (470 ng, previously relaxed by incubation with purified, recombinant Drosophila topoisomerase I), dCAF-1 fraction (19 μg of total protein; from the 0.25-0.5 M potassium phosphate fraction of the hydroxylapatite column; 29Bulger M. Ito T. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11726-11730Google Scholar), purified recombinant dNLP, dNLP-S, or dNAP-1 (amounts as indicated in the figure legends), purified Drosophila core histones (410 ng), 3 mM ATP, and an ATP regeneration system (30 mM phosphocreatine and 1 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase). The core histones were purified from Drosophila embryos (collected from 0 to 12 h after egg deposition) by using a nondenaturing procedure, as described by Bulger and Kadonaga (30Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar). Recombinant dNAP-1 was purified as described elsewhere (21Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Google Scholar). DNA supercoiling and micrococcal nuclease digestion assays were carried out as described previously (28Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Google Scholar, 29Bulger M. Ito T. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11726-11730Google Scholar, 30Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar). All experiments were performed a minimum of two times (but typically, several times) to ensure reproducibility of the data. Polyclonal antibodies against purified recombinant dNLP were generated in rabbits. The immunoprecipitation of dNLP and dNAP-1 from a crude Drosophila embryo extract was performed as described previously (21Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Google Scholar). The in vitro co-immunoprecipitation of dNLP and dNLP-S with core histones was carried out as follows. Purified dNLP proteins (native dNLP, 6 μg; recombinant dNLP, 6 μg; recombinant dNLP-S, 5 μg; or no protein, as a control) were incubated with purified core histones (4 μg) at 4°C for 1 h in buffer R in a final volume of 80 μl. Under these conditions, the molar ratio of dNLP:dNLP-S:core histone octamer is 10:10:1 (note that a protein:octamer ratio of 10:1 corresponds to a protein:histone ratio of 1.25:1). Immunoaffinity-purified anti-dNLP (20 μl; these antibodies recognize both dNLP and dNLP-S) was then added to each of the samples, which were incubated at 4°C for 1 h. Then, a 50% (v/v) slurry (20 μl) of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) was added to each sample, each of which was incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed twice with dilution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.14 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), once with TSA (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.14 M NaCl, 0.04% (w/v) sodium azide), and once with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). The beads were suspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. A portion of the supernatant was then subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Schneider cells were grown on round coverslips that were coated with poly-D-lysine and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (1 × PBS) at room temperature. The cells were permeabilized by treatment with methanol at −20°C for 10 min and dried by rinsing with acetone. The coverslips were incubated in buffer B (5% calf serum in 1 × PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20), and then with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-dNLP for 1 h at room temperature in buffer B. The coverslips were washed with 1 × PBS at room temperature; incubated with rhodamine-conjugated, anti-rabbit antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at room temperature in buffer B; and rinsed with 1 × PBS. The samples were then mounted in 80% glycerol and placed on a glass slide. The cells were observed by using a 100× oil immersion objective with a Nikon microscope. Demembranated Xenopus sperm nuclei (5 × 104 nuclei/μl) were prepared by the method of Lohka and Masui (31Lohka M.J. Masui Y. Science. 1983; 220: 719-721Google Scholar) and were the generous gift of Drs. H. Yan and J. Newport (University of California, San Diego). The demembranated sperm nuclei (final concentration of 5 × 103 nuclei/μl) were incubated with purified native dNLP, purified recombinant dNLP, or purified recombinant dNAP-1 (at a final concentration of 700 μg/ml for each protein) in a final volume of 10 μl in 50 mM Hepes (K+), pH 7.6, buffer containing 75 mM potassium acetate, 0.5 mM spermidine, and 0.15 mM spermine. The samples were mixed gently, and at each time point, a 2-μl aliquot was removed and mixed with an equal volume of 50% glycerol in 1 × PBS containing 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 and 1% formaldehyde. The slides were examined by using a Nikon microscope. Further analysis of the dCAF-4 fraction (29Bulger M. Ito T. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11726-11730Google Scholar), from which we had purified and cloned dNAP-1 (21Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Google Scholar), led to the identification of a second, less abundant protein with an apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa that appeared to bind to core histones. To investigate the function of this histone-binding protein in chromatin assembly, we purified the 22-kDa protein from the dCAF-4 fraction to greater than 90% homogeneity, generated and purified peptides, obtained partial amino acid sequence of the peptides, and isolated six independent cDNAs that encoded the protein (Fig. 1A). Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of this histone-binding protein with those of known proteins (Fig. 1B) revealed a similarity (31% identity) to another core histone-binding protein, nucleoplasmin, which has been cloned from X. laevis (12Bürglin T.R. Mattaj I.W. Newmeyer D.D. Zeller R. De Robertis E.M. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 97-107Google Scholar, 13Dingwall C. Dilworth S.M. Black S.J. Kearsey S.E. Cox L.S. Laskey R.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 69-74Google Scholar). Therefore, the 22-kDa protein from the dCAF-4 fraction was termed Drosophila nucleoplasmin-like protein (dNLP). Examination of dNLP, nucleoplasmin, and dNAP-1 reveals that all three factors have a C-terminal stretch of 24-28 amino acid residues that contains a high proportion (71-81%) of acidic residues (Fig. 1, B and C), which may be important for the binding of histones. Among the six independent cDNAs that were obtained, there were two different types. Four of the cDNAs correspond to the protein that we have denoted as dNLP, while two of the cDNAs encode an N-terminally truncated version of dNLP that we have designated as dNLP-Short (dNLP-S). The calculated molecular mass of dNLP is 16,985 daltons (which is significantly less than its apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa; see, for instance, Fig. 2A), while the calculated mass of dNLP-S is 13,522 daltons (which has an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa; Fig. 2A). Both of the independently isolated dNLP-S cDNAs differ from the dNLP cDNAs only upstream of nucleotide 112, as in the nomenclature depicted in Fig. 1A; thus, the dNLP-S cDNAs may have been generated from alternately spliced mRNA species. Northern blot analysis with a probe that is complementary to both dNLP and dNLP-S mRNAs revealed an apparent single band at approximately 1.2 kilobases. Southern blot analysis indicated that there is a single gene encoding dNLP/dNLP-S, but unfortunately, we were not able to determine the cytogenetic location of the dNLP gene in Drosophila polytene chromosomes. 2T. Laverty and G. Rubin, unpublished data. Next, we tested the ability of dNLP and dNLP-S to function in the ATP-facilitated assembly of nucleosomal arrays in conjunction with the assembly factor(s) in the dCAF-1 fraction. First, we purified native dNLP, recombinant E. coli-synthesized dNLP, and recombinant E. coli-synthesized dNLP-S to greater than 90% homogeneity (Fig. 2A). (The preparation of native dNLP did not contain any detectable amount of dNLP-S.) Then, we compared the relative activities of native dNLP, recombinant dNLP, recombinant dNLP-S, and purified recombinant dNAP-1 (synthesized in E. coli; 21Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Google Scholar) in assembly reactions that contained dCAF-1 fraction, DNA, purified core histones, and ATP. With the DNA supercoiling assay (Fig. 2B), dNAP-1 exhibited the highest assembly activity, whereas native and recombinant dNLP possessed assembly activity that was consistently lower than that of dNAP-1. In contrast, dNLP-S was inactive. We further characterized the assembly of chromatin with dNLP by using DNA supercoiling and micrococcal nuclease digestion assays. As depicted in Fig. 2 (C and D), the efficient assembly of nucleosomal arrays requires dNLP, dCAF-1 fraction, and ATP. In addition, when both dNAP-1 and dNLP were used simultaneously, there was no apparent synergism between the factors (data not shown). Therefore, both dNAP-1 and dNLP are able to function with the dCAF-1 fraction in the ATP-facilitated assembly of nucleosomal arrays, although dNAP-1 appears to mediate chromatin assembly more efficiently than dNLP. Because dNLP was initially identified as a histone-binding protein in the dCAF-4 fraction, we examined the binding of dNLP and dNLP-S to core histones. First, we tested whether core histones will co-immunoprecipitate with dNLP or dNLP-S when either protein is combined with core histones in an in vitro binding assay. In this experiment, native dNLP, recombinant dNLP, or recombinant dNLP-S were combined with purified core histones at a 10:1 molar ratio of protein:octamer (which is identical to a 1.25:1 ratio of protein:histone, at which dNLP functions in chromatin assembly; Fig. 2B), and then the dNLP species were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies that recognize both dNLP and dNLP-S (or with preimmune serum, as a control). As shown in Fig. 3A, all four core histones co-immunoprecipitated in the presence, but not in the absence of either dNLP or dNLP-S. It thus appears that both dNLP and dNLP-S can bind to the core histones. We then investigated whether core histones will co-immunoprecipitate with dNLP from a whole Drosophila embryo extract. A crude extract (prepared from embryos collected from 0 to 2 h after egg deposition) was therefore subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies that recognize dNLP (or with preimmune serum as a control). Because it is known that the core histones H2A-H2B will co-immunoprecipitate with dNAP-1 from a whole embryo extract (21Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Google Scholar), we had also used antibodies against dNAP-1 as a positive control. The resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies that recognize H2A, H2B, H3 (but not H4), dNLP, and dNAP-1. As seen in Fig. 3B, there was no detectable co-immunoprecipitation of core histones with dNLP, while under the same conditions, the core histones H2A-H2B co-immunoprecipitated with dNAP-1, as observed previously (21Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Google Scholar). Moreover, we had performed additional experiments with embryos at later stages of development, and did not observe any co-immunoprecipitation of histones with dNLP (data not shown). Hence, as reported previously for X. laevis nucleoplasmin in oocytes (32Krohne G. Franke W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1034-1038Google Scholar and 33Krohne G. Franke W.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 129: 167-189Google Scholar, but see also 15Kleinschmidt J.A. Fortkamp E. Krohne G. Zentgraf H. Franke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1166-1176Google Scholar and 17Dilworth S.M. Black S.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 1009-1018Google Scholar), there is no detectable co-immunoprecipitation of core histones with dNLP in Drosophila embryos. It is, in addition, unlikely that the antibodies against dNLP inhibit binding of core histones to dNLP because the histones are able to co-immunoprecipitate with dNLP when the purified proteins are combined (Fig. 3A). These results therefore suggest that the majority of dNLP in embryos is not stably associated with core histones. To characterize further the binding of dNLP to core histones, we carried out glycerol gradient sedimentation analyses (Fig. 4). In these experiments, we were particularly interested in the relative affinities of the binding of dNLP, dNLP-S, and dNAP-1 to the core histones. For instance, when dNLP-S was incubated with core histones for 30 min (at a protein:histone ratio of 1.25:1) and then combined with dNLP (at a dNLP-S:dNLP ratio of 1:1) and subjected to glycerol gradient sedimentation, the cor"

https://openalex.org/W1561848337,"Because the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation and differentiation, inactivation of genes integral to the pathway represents a potential mechanism of carcinogenesis. We have studied in human breast cancer cells (T47D, MCF-7, ZR75-1, MDA-MB-231, and BT20) the expression of a subset of retinoid signaling genes that are themselves transcriptionally up-regulated by RA, the cellular retinol binding protein type I (CRBPI) and the RA receptors (RARs) (α2, β2, and ǵ2. We find that constitutive expression of these genes is low or undetectable, and that expression levels are seldom responsive to 24 h treatment with 1 μM all-trans or 9-cis RA (Northern blot analysis). This is in contrast to breast fibroblasts, which show RA-de- pendent expression of all four genes under the same conditions. Moreover, normal human breast epi-thelial cells express CRBPI and RARβ2 at the mRNA level, suggesting that loss of expression of these genes is tied to malignant transformation. RARβ2, but not CRBPI, was also expressed in RA-treated MTSV1-7 cells, an immortalized but nontumorigenic luminal epithelial cell line. Lack of CRBPI and RARβ2 expression in cancer cells was not due to general impairment of RA signaling, as shown by RA activation of a RARE3-tk-CAT reporter in a subclone of MDA-MB-231 cells that did not express either CRBPI or RARβ2. These results suggest that at least two independent defects in the expression of proteins that function in retinoid signaling may be involved in breast carcinogenesis.—Jing, Y., Zhang, J., Blei- weiss, I.

The data obtained support the notion that the extent of kdp expression is modulated by the N-terminal part of KdpD. The maintenance of turgor in bacterial cells is one of the most important functions served by K+ ions (Epstein, 11Epstein W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 39: 73-78Google Scholar; Epstein, 12Epstein W. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 193-199Google Scholar). Therefore, bacteria have established several types of K+ uptake and efflux systems as well as secondary porters and stretch-activated channels to regulate the internal K+ concentration in response to changes in the osmolarity of the medium (for an overview, see Bakker (6Bakker E.P. Bakker E.P. Alkali Cation Transport Systems in Prokaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 205Google Scholar) and Stumpe et al. (41Stumpe S. Schlösser A. Schleyer M. Bakker E.P. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. Vol 2. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam1996: 473Google Scholar)). At low K+ concentrations (0.1 mM) the Kdp system is synthesized as an emergency system (Epstein, 10Epstein W. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1985; 23: 153-175Google Scholar; Laimins et al., 20Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Altendorf K. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3216-3219Google Scholar), which transports K+ with high affinity into the cell (Km for K+ uptake is about 2 μM; Rhoads et al. (34Rhoads D.B. Waters F.B. Epstein W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 325-341Google Scholar)) and which belongs to the class of P-type ion-translocating ATPases (Siebers and Altendorf, 39Siebers A. Altendorf K. Bakker E.P. Alkali Cation Transport Systems in Prokaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 225Google Scholar). The structural genes are organized in the kdpFABC operon (Hesse et al., 18Hesse J.E. Wieczorek L. Altendorf K. Reicin A.S. Dorus E. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4746-4750Google Scholar; Altendorf et al., 1Altendorf K. Siebers A. Epstein W. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2145-2151Google Scholar). The two regulatory proteins belong to the family of sensor kinase/response regulator systems. KdpD is a membrane-bound protein (98.7 kDa), whereas KdpE is a smaller, cytoplasmic protein (25.2 kDa) (Walderhaug et al., 44Walderhaug M.O. Polarek J.W. Voelkner P. Daniel J.M. Hesse J.E. Altendorf K. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2152-2159Google Scholar). As described for other two component systems, the regulation of the kinase or the phosphatase activities, or both, is affected by an environmental stimulus (Parkinson and Kofoid, 30Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Google Scholar; Parkinson, 29Parkinson J.S. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction.

American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 25Google Scholar). For KdpD, the stimulus seems to be a decrease in turgor (Epstein, 12Epstein W. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 193-199Google Scholar; Laimins et al., 21Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Google Scholar). However, this view has been questioned by others (Asha and Gowrishankar, 4Asha H. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4528-4537Google Scholar; Csonka and Hanson, 8Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of mutant forms of KdpD that result in constitutive expression of kdp led Sugiura et al. (42Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Google Scholar) to suggest that KdpD senses two signals, turgor and K+. The phosphorylation of the KdpD protein in vitro as well as the subsequent transfer of the phosphoryl group to the response regulator KdpE was shown (Nakashima et al., 25Nakashima K. Sugiura A. Momoi M. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1777-1784Google Scholar; Voelkner et al., 43Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Google Scholar). Topological studies revealed that KdpD has extended hydrophilic domains at the C-terminal as well as at the N-terminal region connected by four membrane-spanning segments near the middle of the protein (Zimmann et al., 46Zimmann P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28282-28288Google Scholar). Whereas the C-terminal domain, which contains the predicted residue His673 (Voelkner et al., 43Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Google Scholar) that becomes phosphorylated and the kinase domain that must interact with ATP and with KdpE, exhibits extended homology to other sensor kinases, the N-terminal domain does not. In order to investigate the function of the N-terminal part of KdpD, which composes almost half of the protein mass, different truncated forms of the KdpD protein were constructed and analyzed in vitro and in vivo.

LB0 media (1% casein hydrolysate, 0.5% yeast extract) contain a residual amount of 9.1 mM potassium, which was determined by flame photometry. To vary osmolarity and the potassium concentration in these media, different concentrations of sucrose, NaCl, and/or KCl were added as indicated. Minimal media were designated K0.02 up to K115, corresponding to the millimolar concentration of potassium ions added, while osmolarity in this medium did not change due to the addition of corresponding amounts of sodium chloride.

Treatment of DNA with restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and calf intestinal phosphatase was performed following the protocols of the suppliers. DNA fragments were recovered from agarose gels using the Geneclean kit from Bio 101. Sequencing of DNA was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (Sanger et al., 37Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using the T7 sequencing system from Pharmacia. As template, double-stranded plasmid DNA denatured with NaOH was used as described in the protocol of the sequencing kit. The 17-mer sequencing primers hybridizing with different parts of the kdpD gene were synthesized by Dr. Holger Lill (University of Osnabrück). Plasmid pWP1-92 with an EcoRV deletion within the kdpD gene was constructed by digestion of plasmid pPV5 with EcoRV (see Fig. 1 and Walderhaug et al. (44Walderhaug M.O. Polarek J.W. Voelkner P.

Plasmid pWP2-92 was constructed by digestion of pPV5 with PvuI. This enzyme has two restriction sites within the kdpD gene and an additional site within the bla gene of the vector. The resulting 3.8- and 3.1-kb fragments were ligated. Construction of pWP3-92 was performed with two different digestions of pPV5. From a DraI/PstI digestion, which produced several fragments due to several DraI sites in the vector part of pPV5, the PstI-DraI fragment (1.4 kb) carrying the 5′ end of the kdpD gene was isolated. From a second digestion of pPV5 with EcoRV and PstI the large fragment (5.9 kb) was isolated, which comprises the 3′ part of the kdpD gene at the EcoRV site at 5.9 kb up to the PstI site from the vector DNA. Both fragments were ligated with T4 DNA ligase. Plasmid pWP4-92 was obtained by cloning the 0.4-kb DraI/EcoRV fragment of pPV5 into vector pWP1-92, which was linearized with EcoRV and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. Plasmid pWP6-92 was constructed by introducing a PvuI restriction site at bp 5504. Therefore, a 842-bp fragment containing the StuI recognition site at bp 6062 was amplified using Vent polymerase and the following primers. Primer 1 was 5′-CCGATCGTGTACAAATTCAGGG-3′ (underlined nucleotides correspond to the introduced PvuI recognition site, and the rest of the sequence is identical to bp 5505-5519 in kdpD). The second primer used is complementary to the kdpD sequence from bp 6325 to 6346. The amplified fragment was digested with StuI, and the shortened 558-bp PvuI-StuI fragment was used to exchange the PvuI-StuI fragment (bp 4350-6062) of wild-type kdpD gene in plasmid pPV5. In each case strain TK2281 (ΔkdpFABCDE) was transformed with the ligation mixtures. Plasmids were isolated from transformants and tested by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing of the junctions of the deletions, and in the case of polymerase chain reaction products, of the amplified sequence. Plasmid-bearing cells of strain TKR2000 were grown in KML medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-KdpD antiserum. Construction of plasmid pWPA1lacZ was performed using synthetic linkers composed of two oligonucleotides. The sequence corresponds to the upstream sequence of kdpA up to the BclI site (at bp −22 in the kdp sequence), which is underlined. The start codon of kdpA is double underlined, and the newly introduced BamHI recognition site is printed in boldface type. This linker was introduced into the plasmid pSR4, which contains the kdpFABC operon under control of the kdp promoter. Therefore the BclI fragment of pSR4 (from bp −22 to bp 2943) was substituted by the linker. The resulting vector was restricted with BamHI and ligated with the lacZ gene containing BamHI fragment of plasmid pZ19 (Haardt, 15Haardt M. Topology of the Integral Cytoplasmic Membrane Protein ProW and Substrate Specificity of the Osmotically Regulated ProU Transport System of Escherichia coli, Ph.D. thesis. University of Konstanz, 1993Google Scholar). The constructed plasmid was designated pWPA1lacZ and contains an in frame kdpA-lacZ fusion under the control of the kdp promotor. Transfer of in vitro constructed, plasmid-encoded kdpD deletions to the chromosome was carried out using the polA technique based on the method described by Gutterson and Koshland (14Gutterson N.I. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4894-4898Google Scholar). To avoid negative effects of the polA mutation the kdp genes of chromosome-encoded kdpD deletions of the polA strains TKW22851-92, TKW22852-92, TKW22853-92, TKW22854-92, and TKW22856-92 were transferred to a strain that has no defect in the polA gene by P1 transduction (Arber, 3Arber W. Virology. 1960; 11: 273-288Google Scholar). The clones obtained were designated TKW22192, TKW22292, TKW22392, TKW22492, and TKW22692. All strains described were tested by Southern hybridization as described by Ausubel et al. (5Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley Interscience, New York1991: 2.4.1Google Scholar), and the expression of the chromosome-encoded, truncated KdpD protein was characterized by immunoblotting using antibodies raised against the entire KdpD protein (Voelkner et al., 43Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Google Scholar). Strain TKW2295 rpoS::Tn10 kdp + was constructed by P1 transduction (Arber, 3Arber W. Virology. 1960; 11: 273-288Google Scholar) of the rpoS::Tn10 gene from strain RH90 (Hengge-Aronis et al., 17Hengge-Aronis R. Lange R. Henneberg N. Fischer D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 259-265Google Scholar) into strain TK2240. Strain RH90 was kindly provided by Dr. Hengge-Aronis. E. coli strain TKR2000 (ΔkdpFABCDE atp-706) was transformed with the plasmids pWP1-92, pWP2-92, pWP3-92, pWP4-92, pWP6-92, pPV5, and pKK223-3, respectively, and cells were grown in KML media containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Everted membrane vesicles were prepared from about 5 g of cells by passage through a Ribi Press fractionator, and the vesicles were washed twice in EDTA-containing buffer of low ionic strength according to Siebers and Altendorf (38Siebers A. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 131-140Google Scholar) with the following modification: Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 was used in the same concentration instead of HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5. Solubilization of KdpD1-92 and KdpD3-92 from the “low speed pellet” (obtained by centrifugation at 7000 × g of the solution after the passage of cells through the Ribi press fractionater) was performed with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, which was then removed by stepwise dilution in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.005% Tween 80. Overproduction of KdpE was achieved using strain TK2102, which was transformed with plasmid pJD154. Cytoplasmic fractions containing KdpE were prepared as described by Voelkner et al. (43Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Google Scholar). KdpE was precipitated by ammonium sulfate (42% saturation). The precipitated protein was dissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerin, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and dialyzed against the same buffer. The sample was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column, and proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (60-200 mM). KdpE-containing fractions, eluting at 130 mM NaCl, were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mMβ-mercaptoethanol. The final purification step was performed by fast protein liquid chromatography. The dialyzed sample was applied to a Resource Q column, and proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (50-200 mM). KdpE-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mMβ-mercaptoethanol. Protein phosphorylation of KdpD and KdpE was performed as described by Voelkner et al. (43Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Google Scholar). As standard phosphorylation buffer, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.35 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl (buffer B) was used. In addition, the same buffer lacking NaCl (buffer A) was applied. In general, phosphorylation was performed for 10 min at 20°C in the presence of 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and compared with the phosphorylation capacity of wild-type KdpD encoded by pPV5. To detect even very low phosphorylation capacity the KdpD-containing membrane vesicles and resolubilized proteins (KdpD1-92 and KdpD3-92) were phosphorylated for up to 120 min in buffer A and buffer B as well as in buffer A containing 50 mM KCl in the presence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. For the dephosphorylation assay, purified KdpE was phosphorylated in the following manner. First, everted membrane vesicles containing wild-type KdpD were incubated with 20 μM [γ-32P]ATP (2.38 Ci/mmol) in phosphorylation buffer B, except that MgCl2 was replaced with 5 mM CaCl2. After 10 min, purified KdpE (0.1 mg/ml) was added, and the incubation was continued for 5 min. KdpD-containing membrane vesicles were removed by filtration through 0.22-μm centrifugal filter units at 5000 × g. Dephosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 20 mM MgCl2 and everted membrane vesicles (1 mg/ml) containing KdpD, KdpD2-92, KdpD4-92, KdpD6-92, or, as a control, membrane vesicles that lack KdpD to the KdpE(P)-containing filtrate. At the time indicated, aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Binding of [α-32P]2-azido-ATP was studied with membranes containing KdpD, KdpD2-92, KdpD3-92, KdpD4-92, KdpD6-92, and, in case of KdpD1-92, with the “low speed pellet.” The samples were preincubated for 3 min in buffer A in the presence of 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]2-azido-ATP. Cross-linking was achieved by irradiation of the samples with UV light at 302 nm for 2.5 min. Determination of protein concentrations was carried out as described (Hartree, 16Hartree E.F. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 422-427Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Lugtenberg et al. (23Lugtenberg B. Meijers J. Peters R. van der Hoek P. van Alphen L. FEBS Lett. 1975; 58: 254-258Google Scholar) using 7.5, 9, or 11% acrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 as described (Weber and Osborn, 45Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Google Scholar) with a staining solution containing 10% trichloroacetic acid. Autoradiography of dried gels was performed with the Kodak film X-Omat AR5 for 10-16 h. The electrophoretic transfer of proteins from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm) and immunodetection of KdpD proteins with the anti-KdpD antiserum (dilution 1:100,000) was carried out as described by Voelkner et al. (43Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Google Scholar). The activity of β-galactosidase was determined from three different experiments and is given in Miller units calculated as described (Miller, 24Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352Google Scholar). Three units of β-galactosidase will hydrolyze 1 nmol of 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside/min/mg of protein. Five in-frame partial deletions of the kdpD gene were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and diagrammed in Fig. 1. The junctions of the deletions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The product of each deletion construct was readily expressed (Fig. 2), reacted well with anti-KdpD antibodies, is of a size consistent with that expected, and seems stable, since no fragments reacting with the antibody were seen. In order to investigate the in vitro phosphorylation capacity of the truncated KdpD proteins, everted membrane vesicles (see “Experimental Procedures”) of strain TKR2000 carrying the KdpD wild-type or deletion plasmids were used. Phosphorylation of truncated KdpD2-92, KdpD4-92, and KdpD6-92 could clearly be detected after 10 min, when buffer B (0.5 M NaCl) was used (Fig. 3, lanes 5, 10, and 14). No significant phosphorylation occurs in the absence of NaCl (buffer A) (data not shown). The phosphorylation level of truncated KdpD proteins was comparable with that observed with intact KdpD, whereas that of KdpD4-92 and KdpD6-92 (Fig. 3) was somewhat lower. The truncated KdpD proteins, KdpD2-92, KdpD4-92, and KdpD6-92, also retained the ability to transfer the phosphoryl group to KdpE (Fig. 3). For comparison, the phosphotransfer from wild-type KdpD to KdpE is shown. No decrease in the phosphorylation intensity of truncated KdpD and wild-type KdpD could be detected if cytoplasmic fractions lacking KdpE were added (data not shown). In contrast, no phosphorylation could be detected with KdpD1-92 and KdpD3-92, in which the membrane-spanning segments are deleted (see Fig. 4). The truncated KdpD-containing “low speed pellet” and the solubilized proteins were also used, but phosphorylation could not be detected under all conditions tested (data not shown). Interestingly, the KdpD3-92 protein lacking the membrane-spanning segments was still associated with the membrane fraction, possibly due to hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions of N-terminal parts of KdpD with the membrane. But even the membrane-associated protein was not phosphorylated. Nakashima et al. (26Nakashima K. Sugiura A. Kanamaru K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 109-116Google Scholar) have recently reported that a truncated KdpD protein, KdpD*, missing the same region within the protein as KdpD3-92, still gets phosphorylated in vitro. In an attempt to solve the discrepancy, we have included in our studies the plasmid pRUN-SD producing KdpD*, kindly provided by Dr. Mizuno. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the membrane-associated KdpD3-92 and the membrane-associated KdpD* were not phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, even when the incubation time was extended to 120 min. To test whether the ATP binding site of KdpD and its truncated forms was still intact, binding of [α-32P]2-azido-ATP was studied. Therefore, everted membrane vesicles and, in case of KdpD1-92 the “low speed pellet,” were treated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 5, KdpD and the truncated forms were clearly labeled with [α-32P]2-azido-ATP. This finding lends support to the notion that binding of ATP to KdpD is not affected in the truncated proteins. The different intensities in background are based on various amounts of other labeled proteins in the membrane fractions and in the “low speed pellet.” Using the purified response regulator KdpE, the influence of wild-type KdpD and its truncated forms on the dephosphorylation of KdpE(P) was tested (Fig. 6). KdpE was phosphorylated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” KdpE(P) was not dephosphorylated by a preparation of control vesicles that lack KdpD. In contrast, KdpE(P) was dephosphorylated by the addition of wild-type KdpD. As shown in Fig. 6, dephosphorylation activity could also be observed for the truncated proteins KdpD2-92, KdpD4-92, and KdpD6-92. Whereas the activity of the KdpD2-92 protein was essentially identical to that of wild-type KdpD, dephosphorylation of KdpE(P) by KdpD4-92 and KdpD6-92 seemed to be faster. Whether dephosphorylation of KdpE(P) is catalyzed by KdpD or whether the intrinsic dephosphorylation activity of KdpE is enhanced by KdpD still needs to be examined. Regulatory proteins are only present in low amounts in bacterial cells. To avoid artifacts caused by overexpression, it was therefore necessary to transfer the truncated kdpD genes from the plasmid to the chromosome (see “Experimental Procedures”). Furthermore, we had realized previously that the extent of kdp expression is affected by the presence of other K+ uptake systems. Therefore, the strains used in this study are deleted for the other K+ uptake systems, leaving only Kdp for K+ transport. The resulting strains were designated TKW22192, TKW22292, TKW22392, TKW22492, and TKW22692, and the successful replacement of wild-type kdpD gene by the corresponding kdpD deletions was confirmed by Southern hybridization (data not shown). The strains constructed were tested for their ability to grow on minimal medium containing different K+ concentrations, since the Kdp system can be turned on by reducing the K+ concentration of the medium. Strains TKW22292, TKW22492, TKW22692, and TK2240 (wild type) were able to grow on minimal medium containing 20 μM K+ (see below). However, strains TKW22192 and TKW22392 exhibit no growth on media containing less than 15 mM K+. It is worth mentioning that growth"

https://openalex.org/W1887274233,"Earlier studies have shown that hepatic vitamin A stores increase with age and that rats subjected to life-long dietary restriction (DR) have greater hepatic retinoid concentrations than ad libitum-fed rats. It was suggested that these changes may be attributed to altered intestinal absorption, and so we measured retinol absorption in 3, 12, and 22 month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats fed ad libitum (AL) or a restricted diet (40%) enriched (DR+) or not (DR) with vitamins and minerals. An in vivo model was used and lymph collected from the mesenteric duct while rats were infused a micellar solution containing [3H]retinol into the proximal duodenum. Aging significantly decreased lymph flow, and at all ages DR and DR+ rats exhibited a higher flow than age-matched AL rats. Absorption of retinol was not significantly modified by age in AL and DR+ rats. However, in the DR group, there was a marked decrease in absorption between 3 and 12 months of age. Retinol absorption was significantly higher in 12 and 22 month-old DR+ rats than in age-matched AL rats, a finding that may be explained by both higher lymph flow rate and higher long-term vitamin A intake per body weight. In conclusion, the increased content of vitamin A in the livers of older AL rats is not associated with changes in intestinal absorption. In DR rats, however, retinoid accumulation in the liver may be explained by increased intestinal absorption of the vitamin, though other mechanisms may be involved. A possible explanation may be a decreased output of retinol from the liver as a result of lower metabolic needs. The lower serum vitamin A concentrations observed in DR rats would tend to support this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1971329998,"Many protein tyrosine phosphorylation events that occur as a result of T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation are enhanced when CD4 is co-cross-linked with the TCR, and this increased phosphorylation is thought to be a mechanism by which T cell functions are augmented by CD4. Such enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation was originally attributed to the kinase activity of the CD4-associated tyrosine kinase Lck. However, it has been shown that CD4-associated Lck lacking the catalytic domain can enhance T cell functions, suggesting that the noncatalytic domains of Lck are also important in CD4 signaling. Using T cells expressing various CD4-Lck chimeric molecules, we assessed the role of different Lck domains in early T cell signaling. Following TCR-CD4 co-cross-linking, cells expressing a CD4-Lck full-length chimera showed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of many cellular proteins in a CD4-dependent manner. Surprisingly, cells expressing a CD4-Lck chimera lacking the catalytic domain (termed CD4-N32) also showed enhanced phosphorylation. This enhancement of phosphorylation required both the Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains of Lck. Lck has been postulated to dimerize through the SH2 and SH3 domains. In this way CD4-N32 may interact with endogenous Lck, and although it lacks intrinsic kinase activity, it may be capable of enhancing phosphorylation through the associated full-length Lck. Consistent with this model, when CD4-Lck chimeric molecules were expressed in J.CaM1.6 cells lacking endogenous Lck, CD4-N32 failed to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, a Lck SH2 and SH3 domain fragment expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein associated with Lck when incubated with activated Jurkat T cell lysates, suggesting that the SH2 and SH3 domains of Lck can associate with endogenous full-length Lck upon activation. Thus, our data suggest that dimerization is an important mechanism of Lck function in T cell activation.

A member of the Src kinase family, it has a unique N-terminal region followed by Src homology (SH)3, 1The abbreviations used are: SHSrc homologyAbantibodyGSTglutathione S-transferaseRAMrabbit anti-mouse IgG + IgM antibodyTCRT cell receptor. SH2, and catalytic domains (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar). Lck is an important protein tyrosine kinase in lymphocytes; its overexpression renders T cells hypersensitive to antigen stimulation (2Abraham N. Miceli M.C. Parnes J.R. Veillette A. Nature. 1991; 350: 62-66Google Scholar), and an Lck-deficient T cell line, J.CaM1, exhibits dramatically reduced protein tyrosine phosphorylation following T cell receptor (TCR) cross-linking (3Straus D.B.

Furthermore, genetic experiments have shown that mice deficient in Lck or expressing a dominant-negative mutant form of Lck exhibit a severe defect in T cell maturation (4Molina T.J. Kishihara K.

CD4 binds to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules on antigen-presenting cells, and this interaction between CD4 and major histocompatibility complex activates Lck, perhaps through conformational changes. The Lck associated with CD4 propagates key biochemical signals in CD4 co-receptor function (21Glaichenhaus N. Shastri N. Littman D.R. Turner J.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 511-520Google Scholar, 22Collins T.L.

In T cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins is one of the earliest events that occur following activation (23Hsi E.D. Siegel J.N. Minami Y. Luong E.T. Klausner R.D. Samelson L.E.

Science. 1990; 247: 1584-1587Google Scholar), and Lck is one of the crucial kinases involved in this early tyrosine phosphorylation (3Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Google Scholar). Although many substrates become tyrosine phosphorylated in T cells following TCR triggering alone, co-activating CD4 with the TCR results in the augmented phosphorylation of many of these proteins (27Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 727-732Google Scholar). This enhanced phosphorylation is thought to be one biochemical mechanism by which T cell functions are augmented by co-receptors such as CD4. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation results in the enhancement of phosphotyrosine-dependent protein interactions, which results in the augmentation of signaling cascades. Since its association with Lck has been shown to be crucial for the co-receptor functions of CD4 (21Glaichenhaus N. Shastri N. Littman D.R. Turner J.M.

Immunol. 1992; 148: 2159-2162Google Scholar), this CD4-dependent enhancement of protein tyrosine phosphorylation has been assumed to be due to the kinase activity of Lck. However, Xu and Littman (28Xu H. Littman D.R. Cell. 1993; 74: 633-643Google Scholar) have shown that a chimeric molecule, composed of the CD4 extracellular and transmembrane domains ligated to a catalytic domain-deleted form of Lck, functions as well as wild type CD4 associated with endogenous Lck in enhancing interleukin 2 production in an antigen-specific, CD4-dependent manner. Consistent with this observation, we (29Collins T.L. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11885-11889Google Scholar) have shown that T cell hybridomas overexpressing a kinase-deleted Lck exhibit normal CD4-dependent function despite a greater than 90% diminution of CD4-associated Lck kinase activity. These data suggest that other components of Lck besides its catalytic domain are important for mediating CD4 co-receptor activity. We have used CD4-Lck chimeric molecules to study the role of noncatalytic domains of Lck in the biochemical events that occur during early T cell activation. Using T cells expressing chimeric molecules with the CD4 extracellular and transmembrane domains fused to various domains of Lck, we examined protein tyrosine phosphorylation following TCR and CD4-Lck chimera co-activation. We present data showing that a CD4-Lck chimera lacking the catalytic domain (CD4-N32) can enhance tyrosine phosphorylation upon TCR-CD4 co-cross-linking. We also show that endogenous, full-length Lck can associate with the SH2 and SH3 domains of Lck and is required for enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation by CD4-N32. These findings suggest that dimerization may be an important part of the mechanism for Lck function in CD4 co-receptor activity. CD4-Lck chimeric constructs were generated by ligating a CD4 cDNA fragment containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of human CD4 to different fragments of murine Lck cDNA. The CD4 fragment was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′-primer (spanning nucleotides −45 to −31 relative to the ATG start codon) containing a SalI site and a 3′-primer (nucleotides 1245-1256) containing an EcoRI site. The Lck portions of the CD4-FL, CD4-N32, CD4-N3, and CD4-N constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction using Lck 5′-primer (nucleotides −12 to −1 relative to the start codon) containing an EcoRI site, Lck FL 3′-primer (nucleotides 1552-1569) with an XbaI site, Lck N32 3′-primer (nucleotides 727-744) with an XbaI site, Lck N3 3′-primer (nucleotides 288-308) with a BamHI site, and Lck N 3′-primer (nucleotides 180-198) with a BamHI site. The CD4 fragment was subcloned into pBluescript at SalI and EcoRI sites, and Lck fragments were introduced into pBluescript via EcoRI and XbaI (for CD4-FL and CD4-N32) or EcoRI and BamHI (for CD4-N and CD4-N3) sites in pBluescript. CD4 and Lck portions were ligated together at the EcoRI site in pBluescript. The CD4-N2 construct was generated by ligating a polymerase chain reaction-generated Lck SH2 fragment to the 3′-end of the CD4-N construct via BamHI (3′-end of CD4-N) and XbaI sites. The Lck SH2 fragment was generated using a 5′-primer with a BglII site (nucleotides 331-345) and the Lck N32 3′-primer (nucleotides 727-744). The final CD4-Lck constructs were moved to the pFneo mammalian expression vector using the 5′-SalI and 3′-XbaI or -BamHI sites for expression of the chimeric proteins in BY155.16 cells. For expression of the chimeric molecules in J.CaM1.6 cells, the pSR-α mammalian expression vector was used. At the junction of CD4 and Lck, two amino acids in Lck were substituted; instead of the starting Met and Gly at the beginning of Lck, it is Glu and Phe. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were verified by sequencing. BY155.16, a CD4− murine T cell hybridoma line (14Sleckman B.P. Peterson A. Jones W.K. Foran J.A. Greenstein J.L. Seed B. Burakoff S.J. Nature. 1987; 328: 351-353Google Scholar), was transfected with the chimeric constructs by electroporation (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) at 213 V and 1200 microfarads for 11 ms. J.CaM1.6, a Jurkat T cell line derivative lacking endogenous Lck (3Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Google Scholar), was transfected with the chimeric constructs by electroporation (Bio-Rad) at 250 V and 800 microfarads. The cells were allowed to recuperate for 2 days and then plated in G418 selection medium (2 mg/ml) 104 cells/well in 48-well plates (Nunc). Neomycin-resistant clones were screened for surface expression of CD4 by flow cytometric analysis using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). 16T4 is a BY155.16 cell line stably transfected with wild type human CD4, which has been previously described (14Sleckman B.P. Peterson A. Jones W.K. Foran J.A. Greenstein J.L. Seed B. Burakoff S.J. Nature. 1987; 328: 351-353Google Scholar). F23.1 anti-mouse TCR Vβ8.2 antibody (Ab), OKT3 anti-human CD3ϵ Ab, and OKT4D anti-human CD4 Ab were purified from ascites. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG + IgM Ab was purchased from Fisher. 4G10 antiphosphotyrosine Ab and anti-Lck polyclonal Ab against the N-terminal region of Lck were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. G3 anti-ζ Ab culture supernatant was a kind gift from Dr. H. S. Teh (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). The anti-Shc rabbit polyclonal Ab, anti-Crk mouse monoclonal Ab, and anti-Lck monoclonal Ab were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Grb2 rabbit polyclonal Ab was obtained from Santa Cruz. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of Lck SH3 and SH2 domains (GST-SH3SH2) was purchased from Santa Cruz. The sequence for the phosphorylated Src family SH2 domain binding peptide is EPQpYEEIPIYL, and that for thenonphosphorylated control peptide is AEEEEIYEEIEAKKKK, and these were kind gifts from Dr. L. C. Cantley (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Approximately 3 × 105 cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with 50 μl fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD3ϵ Ab (Boehringer Mannheim), diluted 1:1000, or with 50 μl (1 μg/ml) Leu-3a-PE, an anti-CD4 Ab conjugated with phycoerythrin (Becton Dickinson). The control cells were incubated without Ab or with mouse IgG-phycoerythrin control Ab (Becton Dickinson). The cells were washed, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cells (107) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and incubated at 4°C in 1 mg/ml N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexonoate (NHS-LC-biotin) (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline with constant rocking for 45 min. The cells were washed with 0.15% glycine solution in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysis, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were carried out as described below. The cells (107) were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium in microfuge tubes with mouse anti-TCR Ab (1 μg/ml) and/or OKT4D mouse anti-CD4 Ab (1 μg/ml) for 10 min on ice with intermittent mixing, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-mouse IgG + IgM Ab (RAM) (10 μg/ml) for 10 min on ice. The cells were then activated by incubating at 37°C for 2 min. They were quickly centrifuged, washed once with RPMI 1640 medium, centrifuged, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mM NaF). These lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of the indicated purified antibody or 200 μl of culture supernatant along with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 4°C for 1-2 h. In cases in which preclearing of stimulating antibodies was required, the lysates were first incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C, and the supernatant was used for subsequent immunoprecipitation. The beads were washed four times with immunoprecipitation wash buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol), boiled in 50 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In assays in which GST fusion proteins were used, the lysates were incubated with 2 μg of the protein-conjugated glutathione beads for 1-2 h, and 40 μl of glutathione beads were added at the end of incubation before washes. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and the membranes were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (Boehringer Mannheim). For antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting, membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated recombinant antiphosphotyrosine antibody, RC20H (Transduction Laboratories). For anti-Lck immunoblotting, anti-Lck monoclonal Ab (Transduction Laboratories) was used. In surface biotinylation experiments, membranes were incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham). The blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham). BY155.16 cells (14Sleckman B.P. Peterson A. Jones W.K. Foran J.A. Greenstein J.L. Seed B. Burakoff S.J. Nature. 1987; 328: 351-353Google Scholar), a murine T cell hybridoma line that lacks CD4, was transfected with chimeric CD4-Lck molecules containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD4 ligated to the full-length Lck (CD4-FL); the N, SH3, and SH2 domains of Lck (CD4-N32); the N and SH3 domains (CD4-N3); the N and SH2 domains (CD4-N2); or the N domain of Lck (CD4-N) (Fig. 1A). After screening for surface expression of CD4-Lck chimeric molecules by anti-CD4 antibody staining, several clones expressing each chimeric molecule with similar amounts of expression were used for the studies (Fig. 1B). Expressing chimeric CD4-Lck in CD4-negative cells ensured that, upon manipulation of CD4, only the Lck fused to CD4 was directly recruited to the TCR complex in a CD4-dependent manner. Cell surface biotinylation followed by anti-CD4 antibody immunoprecipitation and blotting with streptavidin showed that proteins of the expected size were expressed in these cell lines (Fig. 1C). Protein tyrosine kinase activity was observed when CD4-FL was immunoprecipitated from cells and an in vitro kinase assay was performed, whereas the CD4-Lck chimeras lacking the catalytic domain did not demonstrate kinase activity as measured by autophosphorylation (data not shown). Wild type CD4, when co-cross-linked with the TCR, enhances phosphorylation of several cellular proteins (Fig. 2). We assessed the role of various domains of Lck in CD4-dependent phosphorylation by studying the tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. Cells were activated by cross-linking the TCR alone or by co-cross-linking the TCR with wild type CD4 or CD4-Lck chimeras, and either whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates of tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular substrates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Comparison of tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing wild type CD4 (16T4) and CD4-FL showed that the CD4-FL chimeric molecule was capable of functioning in the same manner as wild type CD4 in stimulating early tyrosine phosphorylation events (Fig. 2). Like 16T4 cells (Fig. 2) and untransfected BY155.16 parent cells (data not shown), cross-linking of the TCR alone in cells expressing CD4-Lck chimeras resulted in phosphorylation of several proteins, notably of molecular masses of approximately 140, 110, 85, 60, 50-55, and 36 kDa (Fig. 3A). This indicated that the cellular machinery for TCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation remained intact and was not affected by expression of CD4-Lck chimeras. Co-cross-linking of the CD4-FL chimera with the TCR complex enhanced the level of phosphorylation of these proteins (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of p140, p110, p50-55, and p36 was observed when CD4-FL was cross-linked without the TCR, indicating that TCR-independent phosphorylation of these proteins can occur. Following co-cross-linking of the TCR with CD4 in cells expressing CD4-N32, enhanced phosphorylation of p140, p110, p85, p70, p50-55, and p36 was also seen (Fig. 3A), although the degree of enhancement was less than in cells expressing CD4-FL. Thus, CD4-N32 was capable of enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates in early T cell activation even though it lacked the catalytic domain.Fig. 3Enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation following TCR and CD4-Lck chimera co-cross-linking is seen in cells expressing CD4-FL or CD4-N32 but not in cells expressing CD4-N, CD4-N3, or CD4-N2. Cells expressing various CD4-Lck chimeras were stimulated as indicated, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with antiphosphotyrosine Ab (4G10) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Antiphosphotyrosine blots using RC20H for cells expressing CD4-FL or CD4-N32 (A), CD4-N3 (B), CD4-N2 (C), or CD4-N (D) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further assess the structural requirements for this enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation, we examined CD4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing CD4-Lck chimeras lacking the SH3 and/or SH2 domains. None of the cell lines expressing CD4-N, CD4-N3, or CD4-N2 showed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of any of the cellular substrates upon TCR and CD4-Lck chimera co-cross-linking (Fig. 3, B-D). Several clones expressing varying levels of TCR and each of the CD4-N, -N3, and -N2 chimeras were tested, and none of the clones showed enhanced phosphorylation after TCR and CD4-Lck chimera co-cross-linking (data not shown), indicating that the inability of these CD4-Lck chimeras to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation was not due to insufficient expression of the receptors. These results suggest that both the SH3 and the SH2 domains of Lck are necessary for enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by CD4-N32. To identify the individual proteins with phosphorylation that is enhanced in a CD4/Lck-dependent manner, proteins that are known to be phosphorylated following T cell activation and are involved in early T cell signaling were immunoprecipitated, and their phosphorylation states were assessed. Shc is one candidate phosphoprotein that migrates near 50-55 kDa. Rapidly phosphorylated on T cell activation, Shc associates with Grb2 and mSos-Ras nucleotide exchange factor and therefore may link TCR activation to the Ras pathway (31Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu J. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Google Scholar, 32Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Google Scholar, 33Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Google Scholar, 34Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Shc associates with the phosphorylated ζ chain upon T cell activation (35Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Burn P. Burakoff S.J. Science. 1993; 262: 902-905Google Scholar). To examine the phosphorylation of Shc, cells expressing various CD4-Lck chimeras were stimulated in the same manner as described above, and Shc was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 4). Shc was phosphorylated after TCR cross-linking alone in all cell lines, but its phosphorylation was markedly enhanced by TCR and CD4 co-cross-linking in cells expressing CD4-FL as well as in cells expressing CD4-N32 (Fig. 4A). Cells expressing CD4-N, CD4-N3, or CD4-N2 did not show enhanced Shc phosphorylation (Fig. 4, B-D). This suggests that upon TCR and CD4 co-cross-linking the SH2 and SH3 domains of the CD4-Lck chimeric molecule can mediate CD4-dependent enhancement of Shc phosphorylation. The 36-kDa protein that becomes prominently phosphorylated upon T cell activation may be the recently cloned Lnk protein (36Huang X.M. Li Y.J. Tanaka K. Moore K.G. Hayashi J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11618-11622Google Scholar), which, like Shc, associates with Grb2 following activation (37Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Google Scholar). Although it is a major phosphorylation target in early T cell activation, the function of p36 in T cell signaling has yet to be determined. Grb2 was immunoprecipitated following activation from cells expressing various chimeras, and phosphoproteins associated with Grb2 were examined by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 5). In all cell lines both p36 and Shc were precipitated with Grb2 following TCR cross-linking, but only in cells expressing CD4-FL or CD4-N32 did co-cross-linking of the TCR with the CD4 chimera enhance phosphorylation of p36 and Shc and, therefore, their association with Grb2 (37Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Google Scholar, 38Ravichandran K.S. Lorenz U. Shoelson S.E. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 593-600Google Scholar). The phosphorylation levels of Shc and p36 (Figs. 4A and 5A) following TCR cross-linking alone in cells expressing CD4-FL were lower than those in cells expressing CD4-N32 due to the lower expression level of TCR in CD4-FL+ cells. In cells expressing CD4-N, CD4-N3, or CD4-N2, no enhancement of p36 or Shc phosphorylation was observed. This indicates that noncatalytic regions of Lck can mediate the increase in phosphorylation of p36 and Shc in a CD4-dependent manner. In antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots, proteins migrating in the region of 110-120 kDa are heavily phosphorylated following TCR cross-linking. Although the precise identities of all the proteins in this region have not been determined, experiments have suggested that p110 may contain Cbl (39Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Google Scholar, 40Sawasdikosol S. Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Chang J.-H. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2893-2896Google Scholar) and/or a p130cas isoform (41da Silva A. Janssen O. Rudd C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2107-2113Google Scholar, 42Tsygankov A.Y. Spana C. Rowley B. Penhallow R.C. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7792-7800Google Scholar). We have found that Cbl is a significant component of phosphorylated p110 in T cells (43Sawasdikosol S. Chang J.H. Pratt J.C. Wolf G. Shoelson S.E. Burakoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 110-116Google Scholar). It has also been observed that phosphorylated Cbl associates with Crk upon T cell activation, via the SH2 domain of Crk (40Sawasdikosol S. Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Chang J.-H. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2893-2896Google Scholar, 44Ribon V. Hubbell S. Herrera R. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 45-52Google Scholar). Crk may be involved in Ras functions, since it also associates with C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras and/or Ras-related molecules (45Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Google Scholar, 46Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the phosphorylation state of Cbl and its association with Crk following TCR and CD4-Lck chimera co-cross-linking. Crk immunoprecipitation, using an antibody against all three known isoforms of Crk (Crk-I, Crk-II, and Crk-L), showed that Cbl became phosphorylated and associated with Crk following TCR stimulation (Fig. 6). This phosphorylation and association with Crk was enhanced following cross-linking of CD4-Lck chimeras with the TCR in cells expressing CD4-FL. Such enhancement was not seen in cells expressing CD4-N3, CD4-N2, or CD4-N and was minimal in CD4-N32 cells, suggesting that the catalytic domain of CD4-Lck is required for the optimal enhanced phosphorylation of Cbl. The ζ chain of the TCR-CD3 complex is phosphorylated on T cell activation (47Samelson L.E. Patel M.D. Weissman A.M. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1986; 46: 1083-1090Google Scholar, 48Klausner R.D.

https://openalex.org/W2165887919,"Down-regulation of microsomal androgen-dependent CYP2C11 is produced in male rat liver by dietary vitamin A deficiency. Decreased circulating androgen concentrations also occur in vitamin A-deficient male rats. Both effects are prevented by addition of all-trans-retinoic acid to the diet. The present study evaluated directly whether androgen deficiency may be responsible for the down-regulation of 2C11 in vitamin A-deficient male rats. The major finding was that subcutaneous administration of the androgen methyltrienolone (MT) during the final week of the study restored CYP2C11 protein and its associated steroid 16alpha-hydroxylation activities to control levels; CYP2C11 mRNA was also restored. Despite the efficient restoration of CYP2C11 at a pretranslational level, no alteration in vitamin A status was apparent and animals remained vitamin A deficient after MT treatment. The possibility was assessed that vitamin A can maintain the microsomal content of CYP2C11 in normal liver. However, in contrast to MT, administration of ATRA to gonadectomized male rats did not restore 2C11 in liver. These findings establish that the major effect of vitamin A deficiency on CYP2C11 in male rat liver is mediated indirectly by androgen deficiency."
