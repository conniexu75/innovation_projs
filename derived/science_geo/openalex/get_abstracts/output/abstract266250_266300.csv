https://openalex.org/W2036002050,"The general applicability of two models used in predicting evolutionary directions from asymmetry in reproductive isolation was tested in the laboratory. In mate preference tests with strains of Drosophila melanogaster whose ancestral and derived relationships were known, no correspondence was found between sexual isolation and direction of evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2088534425,"The stratospheric inventory of the plutonium-238 resulting from the disintegration of a nuclear auxiliary power generator (SNAP-9A) in early 1966 accounts for essentially all the plutonium present in the original generator that reentered the atmosphere. Consequently, the pyrophoric (238)Pu must have completely burned up during reentry and ablated into small particles. The arithmetic mean of the distribution of the (238)Pu particle size was estimated to be 10 millimicrons, which confirms this conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2043871975,"Isolation of the C(9) and C(10) isoprenoid carboxylic acids, the C(12) to C(18)alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acids, and the 2-methyl 1,n-dicarboxylic acids (n is 13, 15, and 16) from organic extract of the Colorado Green River shale (Eocene) is reported. Separation was achieved by column and gas-liquid chromatographic techniques and structural identification of individual components, by mass spectrometry."

https://openalex.org/W1964809764,"A graphic and statistical comparison of major trends in tree ring indices representative of interior Alaska, northern Urals, northern Scandinavia, and Labrador indicates a highly significant correlation for most 50-year intervals between 1650 and the present. This is suggestive of similarities in trends of summer temperature on a circumpolar scale."

https://openalex.org/W2047266313,"Squalene, 2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl-2,6,10,14,18,22-tetracosahexaene, a new biological marker, has been detected in various petroleum asphaltenes and their pyrolysis products. Since squalene is the most common triterpenoid in nature and the biological precursor of the important tetra- and pentacyclic triterpane markers, its detection in asphaltene suggests new ways for marker correlations."
https://openalex.org/W2001113153,"The performance of ablation thermal protection systems is intimately related to the mass transfer, heat transfer, and chemical reactions which occur within the gas boundary layer. Production of a liquid layer and phase change or chemical reaction heat sinks greatly improve materials performance. Materials are available which achieve many goals for thermal protection. However, advanced materials which are now being developed provide hope of further reductions in the weight of heat-shielding structures."
