For many nonstick coatings, this involves procedures to ensure good adhesion to the underlying surface though the use of surface roughening or intermediary layers. Deng et al. (p. 67 , published online 1 December; see the cover) found a very simple route using little more than candle soot as a temporary sublayer that is coated with a silica shell and subsequently removed via calcination. Once top-coated with a semifluorinated silane, the resulting material possessed a low surface energy for water and also repelled oils, alchohols, and alkanes. While the coating could be damaged through mechanical wear, the remaining material continued to show superhydrophobic and superoleophobic behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1992780204,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder of aging. The pathological hallmark of PD is neuronal inclusions termed Lewy bodies whose main component is alpha-synuclein protein. The finding of these Lewy bodies in the intestinal enteric nerves led to the hypothesis that the intestine might be an early site of PD disease in response to an environmental toxin or pathogen. One potential mechanism for environmental toxin(s) and proinflammatory luminal products to gain access to mucosal neuronal tissue and promote oxidative stress is compromised intestinal barrier integrity. However, the role of intestinal permeability in PD has never been tested. We hypothesized that PD subjects might exhibit increased intestinal permeability to proinflammatory bacterial products in the intestine. To test our hypothesis we evaluated intestinal permeability in subjects newly diagnosed with PD and compared their values to healthy subjects. In addition, we obtained intestinal biopsies from both groups and used immunohistochemistry to assess bacterial translocation, nitrotyrosine (oxidative stress), and alpha-synuclein. We also evaluated serum markers of endotoxin exposure including LPS binding protein (LBP). Our data show that our PD subjects exhibit significantly greater intestinal permeability (gut leakiness) than controls. In addition, this intestinal hyperpermeability significantly correlated with increased intestinal mucosa staining for E. coli bacteria, nitrotyrosine, and alpha-synuclein as well as serum LBP levels in PD subjects. These data represent not only the first demonstration of abnormal intestinal permeability in PD subjects but also the first correlation of increased intestinal permeability in PD with intestinal alpha–synuclein (the hallmark of PD), as well as staining for gram negative bacteria and tissue oxidative stress. Our study may thus shed new light on PD pathogenesis as well as provide a new method for earlier diagnosis of PD and suggests potential therapeutic targets in PD subjects.

Constitutive heterochromatin is found, for example, at centromeres and the subtelomeric regions. Working with Schizosaccharomyces pombe , Zofall et al. (p. 96 , published online 1 December) examined the heterochromatin islands often found near meiotic genes, which are maintained in a silenced state during vegetative growth. Heterochromatin formation at these loci did not generally involve the RNA interference machinery, as is observed at centromeres, but did require transcription. The exosome, an RNA-degrading machine, was involved in the formation of the heterochromatin islands, which could be remodeled in response to sexual differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1992516918,"Bile acids facilitate postprandial absorption of nutrients. Bile acids also activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5 and play a major role in regulating lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism. Transgenic expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) prevented high fat diet-induced diabetes and obesity in mice. In this study, we investigated the nutrient effects on bile acid synthesis. Refeeding of a chow diet to fasted mice increased CYP7A1 expression, bile acid pool size, and serum bile acids in wild type and humanized CYP7A1-transgenic mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that glucose increased histone acetylation and decreased histone methylation on the CYP7A1 gene promoter. Refeeding also induced CYP7A1 in fxr-deficient mice, indicating that FXR signaling did not play a role in postprandial regulation of bile acid synthesis. In streptozocin-induced type I diabetic mice and genetically obese type II diabetic ob/ob mice, hyperglycemia increased histone acetylation status on the CYP7A1 gene promoter, leading to elevated basal Cyp7a1 expression and an enlarged bile acid pool with altered bile acid composition. However, refeeding did not further increase CYP7A1 expression in diabetic mice. In summary, this study demonstrates that glucose and insulin are major postprandial factors that induce CYP7A1 gene expression and bile acid synthesis. Glucose induces CYP7A1 gene expression mainly by epigenetic mechanisms. In diabetic mice, CYP7A1 chromatin is hyperacetylated, and fasting to refeeding response is impaired and may exacerbate metabolic disorders in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2151636046,"Background The use of prescription drugs to improve cognitive functioning in normal persons –“neuroenhancement” – has gained recent attention from bioethicists and neuroscientists. Enthusiasts claim that the practice is widespread and increasing, and has many potential benefits; however recent evidence provides weak support for these claims. In this study we explored how the newsprint media portrays neuroenhancement. Aims We conducted an empirical study of media reporting of neuroenhancement to explore: media portrayals of the prevalence of neuroenhancement; the types of evidence used by the media to support claims about its prevalence; and, the possible benefits and risks of neuroenhancement mentioned in these media articles. Methods Using the Factiva database, we found 142 newspaper articles about the non-medical use prescription drugs for neuroenhancement for the period 2008-2010. We conducted a thematic content analysis of how articles portrayed the prevalence of neuroenhancement; what type of evidence they used in support; and, the potential benefits and risks/side-effects of neuroenhancement that were mentioned. Results 87% of media articles mentioned the prevalence of neuroenhancement, and 94% portrayed it as common, increasing or both. 66% referred to the academic literature to support these claims and 44% either named an author or a journal. 95% of articles mentioned at least one possible benefit of using prescription drugs for neuroenhancement, but only 58% mentioned any risks/side effects. 15% questioned the evidence for efficacy of prescription drugs to produce benefits to users. Conclusions News media articles mentioned the possible benefits of using drugs for neuroenhancement more than the potential risks/side effects, and the main source for media claims that neuroenhancement is common and increasingly widespread has been reports from the academic literature that provide weak support for this claim. We urge journalists and researchers to be cautious in their portrayal of the non-medical use of drugs for neuroenhancement."
https://openalex.org/W2088306169,"Previously, we discovered that ZFP57 is a maternal-zygotic effect gene, and it maintains DNA methylation genomic imprint at multiple imprinted regions in mouse embryos. Despite these findings, it remains elusive how DNA methyltransferases are targeted to the imprinting control regions to initiate and maintain DNA methylation imprint. To gain insights into these essential processes in genomic imprinting, we examined how ZFP57 maintains genomic DNA methylation imprint in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we demonstrate that the loss of ZFP57 in mouse ES cells led to a complete loss of genomic DNA methylation imprint at multiple imprinted regions, similar to its role in mouse embryos. However, reintroduction of ZFP57 into Zfp57-null ES cells did not result in reacquisition of DNA methylation imprint, suggesting that the memory for genomic imprinting had been lost or altered in Zfp57-null ES cells in culture. Interestingly, ZFP57 and DNA methyltransferases could form complexes in the presence of KAP1/TRIM28/TIF1β when co-expressed in COS cells. We also found that the wild-type exogenous ZFP57 but not the mutant ZFP57 lacking the KRAB box that interacts with its co-factor KAP1/TRIM28/TIF1β could substitute for the endogenous ZFP57 in maintaining the DNA methylation imprint in ES cells. These results suggest that ZFP57 may recruit DNA methyltransferases to its target regions to maintain DNA methylation imprint, and this interaction is likely facilitated by KAP1/TRIM28/TIF1β."

https://openalex.org/W2078346396,"Background India carries one quarter of the global burden of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and has an estimated 2.5 million people living with HIV. Despite this reality, provision of treatment for MDR-TB is extremely limited, particularly for HIV-infected individuals. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been treating HIV-infected MDR-TB patients in Mumbai since May 2007. This is the first report of treatment outcomes among HIV-infected MDR-TB patients in India. Methods HIV-infected patients with suspected MDR-TB were referred to the MSF-clinic by public Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Centers or by a network of community non-governmental organizations. Patients were initiated on either empiric or individualized second-line TB-treatment as per WHO recommendations. MDR-TB treatment was given on an ambulatory basis and under directly observed therapy using a decentralized network of providers. Patients not already receiving ART were started on treatment within two months of initiating MDR-TB treatment. Results Between May 2007 and May 2011, 71 HIV-infected patients were suspected to have MDR-TB, and 58 were initiated on treatment. MDR-TB was confirmed in 45 (78%), of which 18 (40%) were resistant to ofloxacin. Final treatment outcomes were available for 23 patients; 11 (48%) were successfully treated, 4 (17%) died, 6 (26%) defaulted, and 2 (9%) failed treatment. Overall, among 58 patients on treatment, 13 (22%) were successfully treated, 13 (22%) died, 7 (12%) defaulted, two (3%) failed treatment, and 23 (40%) were alive and still on treatment at the end of the observation period. Twenty-six patients (45%) experienced moderate to severe adverse events, requiring modification of the regimen in 12 (20%). Overall, 20 (28%) of the 71 patients with MDR-TB died, including 7 not initiated on treatment. Conclusions Despite high fluoroquinolone resistance and extensive prior second-line treatment, encouraging results are being achieved in an ambulatory MDR-T- program in a slum setting in India. Rapid scale-up of both ART and second-line treatment for MDR-TB is needed to ensure survival of co-infected patients and mitigate this growing epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2170803314,"Candida parapsilosis is a pathogenic fungus that is major cause of hospital-acquired infection, predominantly due to growth as biofilms on indwelling medical devices. It is related to Candida albicans, which remains the most common cause of candidiasis disease in humans. The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis. Our data suggest that the role of the CFEM family in iron acquisition is conserved between C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, but their role in biofilm formation is not."
https://openalex.org/W2003391115,"APP processing and amyloid-β production play a central role in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. APP has been considered a ubiquitously expressed protein. In addition to amyloid-β, α- or β-secretase-dependent cleavage of APP also generates soluble secreted APP (APPsα or APPsβ, respectively). Interestingly, APPsβ has been shown to be subject to further cleavage to create an N-APP fragment that binds to the DR6 death receptor and mediates axon pruning and degeneration under trophic factor withdrawal conditions. By performing APP immunocytochemical staining, we found that, unexpectedly, many antibodies yielded nonspecific staining in APP-null samples. Screening of a series of antibodies allowed us to identify a rabbit monoclonal antibody Y188 that is highly specific for APP and prompted us to re-examine the expression, localization, and stability of endogenous APP and APPsβ in wild-type and in APPsβ knock-in mice, respectively. In contrast to earlier studies, we found that APP is specifically expressed in neurons and that its expression cannot be detected in major types of glial cells under basal or neuroinflammatory conditions. Both APPsα and APPsβ are highly stable in the central nervous system (CNS) and do not undergo further cleavage with or without trophic factor support. Our results clarify several key questions with regard to the fundamental properties of APP and offer critical cellular insights into the pathophysiology of APP."
https://openalex.org/W2061988426,"Precise balance between phosphorylation, catalyzed by protein kinases, and dephosphorylation, catalyzed by protein phosphatases, is essential for cellular homeostasis. Deregulation of this balance leads to pathophysiological states that drive diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. The recent discovery of the PHLPP (pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase) family of Ser/Thr phosphatases adds a new player to the cast of phosphate-controlling enzymes in cell signaling. PHLPP isozymes catalyze the dephosphorylation of a conserved regulatory motif, the hydrophobic motif, on the AGC kinases Akt, PKC, and S6 kinase, as well as an inhibitory site on the kinase Mst1, to inhibit cellular proliferation and induce apoptosis. The frequent deletion of PHLPP in cancer, coupled with the development of prostate tumors in mice lacking PHLPP1, identifies PHLPP as a novel tumor suppressor. This minireview discusses the structure, function, and regulation of PHLPP, with particular focus on its role in disease."

https://openalex.org/W2050704037,"In mammals, ceramides are synthesized by a family of six ceramide synthases (CerS), transmembrane proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where each use fatty acyl-CoAs of defined chain length for ceramide synthesis. Little is known about the molecular features of the CerS that determine acyl-CoA selectivity. We now explore CerS structure-function relationships by constructing chimeric proteins combining sequences from CerS2, which uses C22-CoA for ceramide synthesis, and CerS5, which uses C16-CoA. CerS2 and -5 are 41% identical and 63% similar. Chimeras containing approximately half of CerS5 (from the N terminus) and half of CerS2 (from the C terminus) were catalytically inactive. However, the first 158 residues of CerS5 could be replaced with the equivalent region of CerS2 without affecting specificity of CerS5 toward C16-CoA; likewise, the putative sixth transmembrane domain (at the C terminus) of CerS5 could be replaced with the corresponding sequence of CerS2 without affecting CerS5 specificity. Remarkably, a chimeric CerS5/2 protein containing the first 158 residues and the last 83 residues of CerS2 displayed specificity toward C16-CoA, and a chimeric CerS2/5 protein containing the first 150 residues and the last 79 residues of CerS5 displayed specificity toward C22-CoA, demonstrating that a minimal region of 150 residues is sufficient for retaining CerS specificity."

https://openalex.org/W2056231127,"Islets of Langerhans are a pancreatic endocrine compartment consisting of insulin-producing β cells together with several other hormone-producing cells. While some insulin-producing cells or immature pancreatic cells have been generated in vitro from ES and iPS cells, islets with proper functions and a three-dimensional (3D) structure have never been successfully produced. To test whether islets can be formed in vitro, we first examined the potential of mouse fetal pancreatic cells. We found that E16.5 pancreatic cells, just before forming islets, were able to develop cell aggregates consisting of β cells surrounded by glucagon-producing α cells, a structure similar to murine adult islets. Moreover, the transplantation of these cells improved blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic mice. These results indicate that functional islets are formed in vitro from fetal pancreatic cells at a specific developmental stage. By adopting these culture conditions to the differentiation of mouse iPS cells, we developed a two-step system to generate islets, i.e. immature pancreatic cells were first produced from iPS cells, and then transferred to culture conditions that allowed the formation of islets from fetal pancreatic cells. The islets exhibited distinct 3D structural features similar to adult pancreatic islets and secreted insulin in response to glucose concentrations. Transplantation of the islets improved blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic mice. In conclusion, the two-step culture system allows the generation of functional islets with a 3D structure from iPS cells."

In two families showing partial NDI, characterized by an apparently normal response to diagnostic tests and an increase in the basal ADH levels suggesting AVP resistance, we have identified two V2R mutations, Ser-333del and Y128S. Both mutant V2Rs, when expressed in COS-7 cells, show partial defects in vasopressin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and intracellular localization. The inhibition of internalization does not rescue their localization. In contrast, the non-peptide V2R antagonists OPC41061 and OPC31260 partially rescue the membrane localization and basal function of these V2R mutants, whereas they inhibit the basal activity of the wild-type V2R. These results indicate that a partial loss of function of Ser-333del and Y128S mutant V2Rs results from defective membrane trafficking. These findings further indicate that V2R antagonists can act as protean agonists, serving as pharmacological chaperones for inactivating V2R mutants and also as inverse agonists of wild-type receptors.

Although many mutations cause the complete loss of expression of GPCR proteins, some mutations cause loss of function because of defects in protein localization, protein-protein interactions, and so on, and may therefore provide new insights into the physiological operations of the GPCRs. Partial loss of function mutations are good candidates in this regard because they show at least some protein expression.Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is caused by renal resistance to the antidiuretic effects of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and is associated with elevated levels of this hormone (3Robben J.H.

Strikingly, some β2 adrenergic receptor ligands, such as ICI 118551 and propranolol, are inverse agonists of G protein-mediated signaling and thereby decrease cAMP levels while at the same time functioning as partial agonists of the MAPK cascade (17Azzi M. Charest P.G. Angers S. Rousseau G. Kohout T. Bouvier M. Piñeyro G. β-arrestin-mediated activation of MAPK by inverse agonists reveals distinct active conformations for G protein-coupled receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Furthermore, our recent identification of a unique autoantibody against calcium-sensing receptor in an acquired hypocalciuric hypercalcemia patient (18Makita N. Sato J. Manaka K. Shoji Y. Oishi A.

AfCS Nature Molecule Pages. 2008; 10.1038/mp.a004000.01Google Scholar) suggests that the allosteric modulation and functional selectivity of GPCRs are a pathophysiological mode of operation and may possibly, therefore, be physiological processes also.A special form of GPCR-based functional selectivity is “protean” agonism, in which certain agonists may change or even reverse their effects depending on the states or systems adopted (13Kenakin T. Functional selectivity through protean and biased agonism. Who steers the ship?.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 15Hill S.J. G-protein-coupled receptors. Past, present and future.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: S27-S37Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These agonists are thus termed protean agonists. Kenakin (20Kenakin T. Inverse, protean, and ligand-selective agonism: matters of receptor conformation.FASEB J. 2001; 15: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) was the first to describe this phenomenon, in which it was demonstrated that although some β2-adrenergic receptor ligands produce positive agonism in whole cells, the same ligands produce inverse agonism when the cAMP assay is performed for cell membranes. In this model, a partial agonist of a GPCR that is mildly activating a GPCR in a quiescent system, may operate as an inverse agonist in a constitutively active system, for example in the presence of a constitutive mutant of the same GPCR (13Kenakin T. Functional selectivity through protean and biased agonism. Who steers the ship?.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 15Hill S.J. G-protein-coupled receptors. Past, present and future.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: S27-S37Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, the agonist, inverse agonist, or neutral antagonist activities of each GPCR ligand do not seem to be intrinsically decided by the characteristic of each ligand but by the system adopted.In this study, we have identified two mutations in the V2R gene (AVPR2) in patients with partial NDI who had both been initially diagnosed with psychogenic polydipsia. One is a novel mutation, Ser-333del, which causes a serine deletion at the 333 position of the C terminus of the V2R. The other is a previously reported mutation Y128S (21Bichet D.G. Arthus M.F.

Briefly, 1 day after transfection, cells were reseeded into 12-well plates. 16 h before performing the assay, cells were pretreated with OPC3 or OPC4 at the indicated concentrations. After 24 h, the cells were then washed twice with ice-cold 1% BSA/PBS twice, placed on ice for 5 min, and incubated in an anti-myc antibody solution (1:4000) diluted in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. This was followed by two further washes in 1% BSA/PBS.

After written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the patients, genomic DNA was prepared from the peripheral blood leukocytes with the use of a DNA isolation kit, and all exons and exon-intron boundaries of AVPR2 were analyzed using a PCR direct sequencing method.Water Deprivation Test and DDAVP Administration TestWater deprivation tests were performed as follows. Patients were allowed to drink water freely prior to commencing the test. After the final urination, the test was started. Urine samples were collected at hourly intervals until 6 h, accompanied by the measurement of body weight, serum osmolarity, plasma concentration of ADH, and urine volume. One day after the fluid deprivation test, DDAVP (5 units/m2) was administered subcutaneously. Samples were collected before the test and at 30, 60, and 120 min after DDAVP administration. The urine volume, gradation, osmolarity, and concentration of cAMP with serum osmolarity were then measured.Statistical Method and AnalysisThe statistical method used was the Dunnett's multiple comparison procedure. To evaluate the dose response, Williams multiple comparison was used. Averaged data of three independent experiments are shown, and error bars represent mean ± S.D. These analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel software. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have identified two mutations in the V2R gene in patients who had been initially diagnosed with psychogenic polydipsia but were finally diagnosed with partial NDI. On the basis of the clinical phenotypes associated with the partial NDI in these cases, we suspected that the receptor mutant proteins must be expressed and that an analysis of their functional properties may provide further clues to the mechanisms underlying normal V2R functions. Our intact cell experiments showed that both mutant proteins were indeed expressed but did not localize at the cell surface. Pr"

https://openalex.org/W1997520211,"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) play various roles in transcriptional and post-transcriptional modulation of gene expression. However, it remains unclear if hnRNPs are associated with smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation from stem cells and embryonic arteriogenesis. In this study, mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were cultivated on collagen IV-coated plates and smooth muscle differentiation medium. We found that hnRNPA2/B1 gene and protein expression was significantly up-regulated following 3-7 days of cell differentiation. hnRNPA2/B1 knockdown resulted in down-regulation of specific smooth muscle markers and transcription factors, whereas enforced expression of hnRNPA2/B1 enhanced the expression of these genes. Moreover, we demonstrated by using luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that hnRNPA2/B1 could transcriptionally regulate SMC gene expression through direct binding to promoters of Smαa and Sm22α genes. We further demonstrated that chromobox protein homolog gene 3, a previously identified SMC differentiation regulatory nuclear protein, is required for hnRNPA2/B1-mediated SMC differentiation gene expression. Importantly, specifically designed Hnrnpa2/b1 morpholinos for in vivo knockdown could inhibit the migration and differentiation of neural crest cells into SMCs in chick embryos. This resulted in the maldevelopment of branchial arch arteries and increased embryo lethality at a later developmental stage. Our findings demonstrated that hnRNPA2/B1 plays a functional role in SMC differentiation from stem cells in vitro and embryonic branchial arch artery development. This indicates that hnRNPA2/B1 is a potential modulating target for deriving SMCs from stem cells and cardiovascular regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1974842738,"NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2)/gp91phox and p47phox deficient mice are prone to hyper-inflammatory responses suggesting a paradoxical role for Nox2-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) as anti-inflammatory mediators. The molecular basis for this mode of control remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that IFNγ/LPS matured p47phox−/−-ROS deficient mouse dendritic cells (DC) secrete more IL-12p70 than similarly treated wild type DC, and in an in vitro co-culture model IFNγ/LPS matured p47phox−/− DC bias more ovalbumin-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes toward a Th1 phenotype than wild type (WT) DC through a ROS-dependent mechanism linking IL-12p70 expression to regulation of p38-MAPK activation. The Nox2-dependent ROS production in DC negatively regulates proinflammatory IL-12 expression in DC by constraining p38-MAPK activity. Increasing endogenous H2O2 attenuates p38-MAPK activity in IFNγ/LPS stimulated WT and p47phox−/− DC, which suggests that endogenous Nox 2-derived ROS functions as a secondary messenger in the activated p38-MAPK signaling pathway during IL-12 expression. These findings indicate that ROS, generated endogenously by innate and adaptive immune cells, can function as important secondary messengers that can regulate cytokine production and immune cell cross-talk to control during the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1998071245,"The BMP/SMAD4 pathway has major effects on liver hepcidin levels. Bone morphogenetic protein-binding endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (Bmper), a known regulator of BMP signaling, was found to be overexpressed at the mRNA and protein levels in liver of genetically hypotransferrinemic mice (Trf(hpx/hpx)). Soluble BMPER peptide inhibited BMP2- and BMP6-dependent hepcidin promoter activity in both HepG2 and HuH7 cells. These effects correlated with reduced cellular levels of pSMAD1/5/8. Addition of BMPER peptide to primary human hepatocytes abolished the BMP2-dependent increase in hepcidin mRNA, whereas injection of Bmper peptide into mice resulted in reduced liver hepcidin and increased serum iron levels. Thus Bmper may play an important role in suppressing hepcidin production in hypotransferrinemic mice."

We tested the hypothesis that the five basic tastes also elicit unique responses in facial skin blood flow. Facial skin blood flow was measured using laser speckle flowgraphy in 16 healthy subjects before and during the application of basic taste stimuli in the oral cavity for 20 s. The skin blood flow in the eyelid increased in response to sweet and umami taste stimuli, while that in the nose decreased in response to a bitter stimulus. There was a significant correlation between the subjective hedonic scores accompanying these taste stimuli and the above changes in skin blood flow. These results demonstrate that sweet, umami, and bitter tastes induce unique changes in facial skin blood flow that reflect subjective hedonic scores."
https://openalex.org/W2170345470,"This study reports the identification and characterization of a novel gene, Dic61B, required for male fertility in Drosophila. Complementation mapping of a novel male sterile mutation, ms21, isolated in our lab revealed it to be allelic to CG7051 at 61B1 cytogenetic region, since two piggyBac insertion alleles, CG7051c05439 and CG7051f07138 failed to complement. CG7051 putatively encodes a Dynein intermediate chain. All three mutants, ms21, CG7051c05439 and CG7051f07138, exhibited absolute recessive male sterility with abnormally coiled sperm axonemes causing faulty sperm individualization as revealed by Phalloidin staining in Don Juan-GFP background. Sequencing of PCR amplicons uncovered two point mutations in ms21 allele and confirmed the piggyBac insertions in CG7051c05439 and CG7051f07138 alleles to be in 5′UTR and 4th exon of CG7051 respectively, excision of which reverted the male sterility. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes demonstrated CG7051 to be a single copy gene. RT-PCR of testis RNA revealed defective splicing of the CG7051 transcripts in mutants. Interestingly, expression of cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain, α, β, γ tubulins and α-spectrin was normal in mutants while ultra structural studies revealed defects in the assembly of sperm axonemes. Bioinformatics further highlighted the homology of CG7051 to axonemal dynein intermediate chain of various organisms, including DNAI1 of humans, mutations in which lead to male sterility due to immotile sperms. Based on these observations we conclude that CG7051 encodes a novel axonemal dynein intermediate chain essential for male fertility in Drosophila and rename it as Dic61B.

https://openalex.org/W2011018608,"Simultaneous limitation of plant growth by two or more nutrients is increasingly acknowledged as a common phenomenon in nature, but its cellular mechanisms are far from understood. We investigated the uptake kinetics of CO(2) and phosphorus of the algae Chlamydomonas acidophila in response to growth at limiting conditions of CO(2) and phosphorus. In addition, we fitted the data to four different Monod-type models: one assuming Liebigs Law of the minimum, one assuming that the affinity for the uptake of one nutrient is not influenced by the supply of the other (independent colimitation) and two where the uptake affinity for one nutrient depends on the supply of the other (dependent colimitation). In addition we asked whether the physiological response under colimitation differs from that under single nutrient limitation.We found no negative correlation between the affinities for uptake of the two nutrients, thereby rejecting a dependent colimitation. Kinetic data were supported by a better model fit assuming independent uptake of colimiting nutrients than when assuming Liebigs Law of the minimum or a dependent colimitation. Results show that cell nutrient homeostasis regulated nutrient acquisition which resulted in a trade-off in the maximum uptake rates of CO(2) and phosphorus, possibly driven by space limitation on the cell membrane for porters for the different nutrients. Hence, the response to colimitation deviated from that to a single nutrient limitation. In conclusion, responses to single nutrient limitation cannot be extrapolated to situations where multiple nutrients are limiting, which calls for colimitation experiments and models to properly predict growth responses to a changing natural environment. These deviations from single nutrient limitation response under colimiting conditions and independent colimitation may also hold for other nutrients in algae and in higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W1982456314,"TRESK (TWIK-related spinal cord K(+) channel, KCNK18) is a major background K(+) channel of sensory neurons. Dominant-negative mutation of TRESK is linked to familial migraine. This important two-pore domain K(+) channel is uniquely activated by calcineurin. The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase directly binds to the channel and activates TRESK current several-fold in Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells. We have recently shown that the kinase, which is responsible for the basal inhibition of the K(+) current, is sensitive to the adaptor protein 14-3-3. Therefore we have examined the effect of the 14-3-3-inhibited PAR-1/MARK, microtubule-associated-protein/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase on TRESK in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. MARK1, MARK2 and MARK3 accelerated the return of TRESK current to the resting state after the calcium-dependent activation. Several other serine-threonine kinase types, generally involved in the modulation of other ion channels, failed to influence TRESK current recovery. MARK2 phosphorylated the primary determinant of regulation, the cluster of three adjacent serine residues (S274, 276 and 279) in the intracellular loop of mouse TRESK. In contrast, serine 264, the 14-3-3-binding site of TRESK, was not phosphorylated by the kinase. Thus MARK2 selectively inhibits TRESK activity via the S274/276/279 cluster, but does not affect the direct recruitment of 14-3-3 to the channel. TRESK is the first example of an ion channel phosphorylated by the dynamically membrane-localized MARK kinases, also known as general determinants of cellular polarity. These results raise the possibility that microtubule dynamics is coupled to the regulation of excitability in the neurons, which express TRESK background potassium channel."

https://openalex.org/W2012289755,"Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) is an essential process in T cell activation. SOCE is controlled by the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel encoded by the gene Orai1 that is expressed on the plasma membrane and activated by STIM1 when ER Ca(2+) stores are depleted. Our earlier work showed that a somatic T-cell line Jurkat mutant H123 bearing a defect in Ca(2+) signaling was susceptible to the apoptotic effects of type I interferons (IFN-α/β). The nature of the mutation and whether this mutation was linked to IFN-α/β apoptotic susceptibility was unknown. Here we show that H123 cells lacked Orai1 and exhibit reduced STIM1 protein. Reconstitution of both Orai1 and STIM1 in H123 cells rescued SOCE in response to thapsigargin and ionomycin and abrogated IFN-α/β-induced apoptosis. Reciprocally, overexpression of the dominant negative Orai1-E106A in either parental Jurkat cells or an unrelated human T cell line (CEM391) inhibited SOCE and led to sensitization to IFN-α/β-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we showed that the Ca(2+) response pathway antagonized the IFN-α/β -induced transcriptional responses; in the absence of SOCE, this negative regulatory effect was lost. However, the inhibitory effect of Ca(2+) on type I IFN-induced gene transcription was diminished by pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB in cells with intact SOCE. Our findings reveal an unexpected and novel regulatory crosstalk mechanism between type I IFNs and store-operated Ca(2+) signaling pathways mediated at least in part by NF-κB activity with significant clinical implications to both viral and tumor immunology."
https://openalex.org/W1973311759,"These studies explore the effects of statins on cyclic AMP-modulated signaling pathways in vascular endothelial cells. We previously observed (Kou, R., Sartoretto, J., and Michel, T. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 14734–14743) that simvastatin treatment of endothelial cells leads to a marked decrease in PKA-modulated phosphorylation of the protein VASP. Here we show that long-term treatment of mice with simvastatin attenuates the vasorelaxation response to the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, without affecting endothelin-induced vasoconstriction or carbachol-induced vasorelaxation. We found that statin treatment of endothelial cells dose-dependently inhibits PKA activation as assessed by analyses of serine 157 VASP phosphorylation as well as Epac-mediated Rap1 activation. These effects of simvastatin are completely reversed by mevalonate and by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, implicating geranylgeranylation as a critical determinant of the stain response. We used biochemical approaches as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methods with a cAMP biosensor to show that simvastatin treatment of endothelial cells markedly inhibits cAMP accumulation in response to epinephrine. Importantly, simvastatin treatment significantly decreases Gαs abundance, without affecting other Gα subunits. Simvastatin treatment does not influence Gαs protein stability, and paradoxically increases the abundance of Gαs mRNA. Finally, we found that simvastatin treatment inhibits Gαs translation mediated by Akt/mTOR/eIF4/4EBP.

It is clear that many of the salutary clinical effects of statins are independent of their effects on lowering serum lipoproteins, and appear to be mediated by other molecular mechanisms (1Ponsioen B.

Many patients being treated with beta blockers also take statins, yet the effects of statins on adrenergic signaling have not been explored in detail.

BAEC were plated onto gelatin-coated culture dishes and studied prior to cell confluence between passage 5 and 9. Human aortic smooth muscle cells were from Lonza, Inc (Walkersville, MD), maintained in SmGM-2 media supplemented with growth factors as recommended by the manufacturer, and were studied in passage 5 or 6. Cells were passaged at 80% confluency at a 1:4 ratio. Control siRNA and Akt siRNA sequences and transfection conditions have been described previously (4Kou R. Sartoretto J. Michel T.

Treated cells were washed with PBS, and cell lysates were collected in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.025% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor). Protein determinations were made with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. 30 μg protein of each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.

Quantitative analyses of immunoblots were determined using a ChemiImager HD4000 (Alpha-Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Protein half-life was determined by analysis of immunoblots after treatment of cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, as well as by pulse-chase analyses. For experiments with cycloheximide, confluent BAEC were treated with 10 μm simvastatin for 22 h plus 10 ng/ml cycloheximide for indicated times, followed by cell lysis. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed in immunoblots. For pulse-chase experiments, BAEC were cultured to 90% confluency, incubated for 2 h with Cys/Met-free DMEM plus 10% dialyzed FBS, and the “pulse” was initiated by replacing media with Cys−/Met− DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS plus 100 μCi/ml [35S] methionine/cysteine (TRAN35S-LABEL) for 2 h. The “chase” was initiated by washing the cells three times with DMEM, followed by incubation with DMEM/10% FBS containing 4 mm methionine and 4 mm cysteine; cells were treated with PBS or 10 μm simvastatin for indicated times, followed by lysis in 600 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The lysates were immunoprecipitated by incubation 1 h to overnight with 4 μg/ml polyclonal Gαs antibody followed by 1 h with 60 μl/ml protein A/G-agarose beads at 4 °C. After washing three times with lysis buffer and boiling for 5 min, immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were then air-dried and analyzed with a Cyclone PhosphorImaging System (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT). Labeled proteins were quantified using software provided by the manufacturer. A portion of the cell lysates was used for immunoblot analysis for β-actin. To explore effects of simvastatin on Gαs mRNA abundance, mRNA from treated cells was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and reverse transcribed into cDNA using an AMV cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. 2 μl of cDNA was subjected to real-time PCR using 2× Premix (AB Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and primer pairs 5′-GCTGGCTGAGAAAGTCCTTG-3′ and 5′-GCAGGTGAAGTGAGGGTAGC-3′ for Gαs and 5′-CTGGGCAAGTTAGGTTTTGTC-3′ and 5′-CAAGTACTCCGTGTGGATTGG-3′ for control β-actin under the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s and final elongation at 60 °C for 5 min using 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Authenticity of the reaction was confirmed by melting analysis, using the manufacturer's protocol. Relative Gαs to β-actin mRNA level was calculated by 2−ΔΔCt (9Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

Rap1 activity was measured in cultured endothelial cells using a pull-down assay following the manufacturer's protocols (Millipore, Billerica, MA). In brief, endothelial cells in 100-mm dishes were incubated with either control or 10 μm simvastatin for 22 h, and then treated with 1 μm epinephrine for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor according to the manufacturer's protocol. The GTP-bound active form of Rap1 was pulled down by incubating cell lysates with Ral-GDS RBD-agarose beads. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer, eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed in immunoblots probed with a Rap1 antibody provided by the manufacturer. Cellular cAMP content was measured using a cyclic AMP EIA Kit from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). Treated BAEC in P60 dishes were washed once with PBS, extracted twice with 65% ethanol, and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Pellets were dissolved in 120 μl assay buffer provided by the manufacturer, and supernatants were collected by centrifugation and assayed according to the protocols provided. Cells in one separate plate were lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer and used to measure protein concentration using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. BAEC were split in glass-bottom microwell dishes (MatTeK Co., Ashland, MA) at ratio of 1:8, and transfected with 1 μg per dish CFP-Epac(ΔDEP)-YFP (1Ponsioen B. Zhao J. Riedl J.

The transfected cells were excited at 425 nm; emission of CFP and YFP was detected simultaneously using a 475 ± 10 and 540 ± 10 nm Semrock FRET-CFP/YFP-B four-filter, single band set, respectively. Data were digitized using Metamorph software and FRET was expressed as ratio of YFP to CFP signals, which was set to 1.0 at the onset of the experiments. FRET values between treatments were normalized as the ratio of the absolute values of FRET slopes measured in vehicle- and agonist-treated cells. A decrease in CFP-Epac(ΔDEP)-YFP FRET indicates an increase in the level of cAMP. Male wild-type C57BL/6J mice from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) were studied at age 8–9 weeks. All procedures were performed according to protocols approved by the Harvard Medical School Standing Committee for Animal Experimentation. For these studies, mice received simvastatin (10 mg/kg) or PBS by intraperitoneal (ip) injection daily for 2 weeks, during which time the animals were provided standard chow and water ad libitum. Mice were euthanized with a lethal dose of pentobarbital sodium (120 mg/kg intraperitoneal). After euthanasia, the aorta was removed, homogenized, and analyzed in immunoblots probed with antibodies as described previously (4Kou R. Sartoretto J. Michel T.

Chem. 2009; 284: 14734-14743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), while the femoral vascular bed was removed and placed in a dish containing ice-cold PBS. Intact segments of dissected femoral arteries (300–400 μm) were mounted between glass cannulae in an arteriograph (Living Systems Instrumentation; Burlington, VT) at room temperature (∼25 °C) and pressurized to 60 mm Hg under conditions of no luminal flow. Constant pressure was maintained via a pressure servo-control system (model PS200; Living Systems Instrumentation). Pressure transducers at both ends of the artery allowed continual monitoring of intraluminal pressure. Vessel diameter was quantitated by video microscopy on a Nikon inverted microscope; a measurement of the external diameter was determined by using the Ionoptix SoftEdge system (Ionoptix; Milton, MA). The preparation was continually superfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (in mm: 113 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 1.1 MgSO4, 1.1 KH2PO4, 0.03 EDTA, 0.01 l-arginine, and 11 glucose, pH 7.4) and oxygenated with a mixture of 95% O2-5% CO2 at a rate of 10 ml/min. The superfusing solution was warmed to 37 °C by passage through a heat-exchange coil before entering the monitoring apparatus. After a 60 min stabilization period, vessels were pre-constricted with 100 nm endothelin-1 in Krebs buffer containing 50 μm phentolamine prior to treatments with isoproterenol or carbachol at indicated dosages. Endothelial integrity was confirmed by verifying the vasorelaxation response to 100 μm carbachol. Vessel relaxation was normalized as the fractional reversal of endothelin-induced vessel contraction. All experiments were performed at least three times. EC50 values were determined by analysis of Eadie-Hofstee plots. Mean values for individual experiments were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical differences were assessed by ANOVA or t test, as appropriate. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To extend our prior observations on the effects of simvastatin on signaling responses in cultured endothelial cells, we investigated β-adrenergic signaling in arterial preparations that we isolated following statin treatment in vivo. Mice were injected with simvastatin (10 mg/kg) or vehicle daily for 2 weeks, and the vasomotor responses to isoproterenol and other agonists were analyzed in femoral artery preparations. As shown in Fig. 1A, in both control and statin-injected mice, there was a clear dose-dependent vasorelaxation response to the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. However, the isoproterenol dose curve was significantly shifted to the right in arteries from statin-injected mice (p < 0.001), as determined from analysis of Eadie-Hofstee plots. In addition, the maximal relaxation in statin-treated mice was significantly decreased, from 36.3 ± 3.7% in PBS-injected mice to 24.1 ± 6.2% (p < 0.001, n = 9). In contrast, we found that the vasorelaxation response to the muscarinic cholinergic carbachol was unaffected by statin treatment, as was endothelin-dependent vasoconstriction (Fig. 1, B and C). Immunoblot analysis of aorta preparations showed that phosphorylation of VASP is decreased following in vivo simvastatin treatment (4Kou R. Sartoretto J. Michel T.

Chem. 2009; 284: 14734-14743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), while Gαs abundance is unchanged (Fig. 1D). To further explore the mechanisms underlying the attenuated vasorelaxation response to β-adrenergic agonists following in vivo statin treatment, we studied β-adrenergic signaling pathways in cultured endothelial cells. Previous work has established that β3-adrenergic receptors in vascular endothelial cells are coupled to adenylate cyclase via Gαs (10Moens A.L. Yang R. Watts V.L.

As shown in Fig. 2, treatment of endothelial cells with simvastatin (10 μm, 22 h) significantly attenuated epinephrine-stimulated VASP phosphorylation at Ser157, with the EC50 for epinephrine-stimulated VASP phosphorylation increasing from 0.9 ± 0.1 nm to 9.0 ± 0.2 nm (p < 0.05, n = 3). The decrease in total VASP abundance following epinephrine treatment is more apparent than real: VASP phosphorylation leads to a change in Mr and to decreased antigenicity for the VASP antibody (5Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. Sphingosine 1-phosphate and activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase. differential regulation of Akt and MAP kinase pathways by EDG and bradykinin receptors in vascular endothelial cells.J.

While these findings implicate the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), yet not all cyclic AMP-dependent signaling responses involve PKA activation (11Gloerich M. Bos J.L. Epac: defining a new mechanism for cAMP action.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2010; 50: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Perhaps the best-characterized cAMP-modulated signaling response that is independent of PKA is the cAMP-dependent but PKA-independent activation of the small G protein Rap1. As shown in Fig. 3, pretreatment of endothelial cells with simvastatin completely blocked epinephrine-induced Rap1 activation, indicating that simvastatin treatment appears to affect cAMP responses upstream of PKA.FIGURE 3Simvastatin inhibits epinephrine-stimulated Rap1 activation in endothelial cells. Panel A shows the results of Rap1 activity assays in BAEC treated with simvastatin (10 μm) for 22 h; epinephrine was added for 5 min, and then Rap1 activation was measured using a pull-down assay. Active Rap1 and total Rap1 as well as phosphorylated VASP were detected in immunoblots probed with Rap1 and pVASP157 antibodies, respectively. This experiment was repeated three times with equivalent results. Panel B shows pooled data from three experiments identical in design to the experiment shown in panel A, normalizing the signals of active Rap1 to total Rap1; the normalized Rap1 activity in vehicle-treated cells was defined as 1.0; the asterisk indicates p < 0.05 (ANOVA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next pursued cellular imaging approaches using the CFP-Epac(ΔDEP)-YFP FRET biosensor, which specifically detects intracellular cAMP (1Ponsioen B.

Detecting cAMP-induced Epac activation by fluorescence resonance energy transfer: Epac as a novel cAMP indicator.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar); this biosensor yields a decrease in FRET following cAMP binding. We transfected endothelial cells with the biosensor for cAMP, and then analyzed FRET signals in real time following various drug treatments. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, when endothelial cells transfected with the cAMP biosensor are treated with epinephrine, there is a striking decrease in FRET, indicating an increase in intracellular cAMP; a similar FRET decrease is seen following treatments with the G protein-sensitizing drug forskolin or with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, indicating a ∼2-fold increase in cAMP abundance, consistent with previous reports (12Namiecinska M. Wiktorowska-Owczarek A. Loboda A. Dulak J. Nowak J.Z. Cyclic AMP generating system in human microvascular endothelium is highly responsive to adrenaline.Pharmacol. Rep. 2006; 58: 884-889PubMed Google Scholar); these agonists yielded similar increases in cellular cAMP levels. We used cAMP biosensor-transfected endothelial cells to determine the effect of simvastatin on epinephrine-induced cAMP accumulation. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, simvastatin treatment significantly attenuated cAMP accumulation by epinephrine (p < 0.05, n = 6). We complemented these FRET-based cellular imaging approaches with standard biochemical assays of cAMP abundance. As shown in Fig. 4E, treatment of endothelial cells with simvastatin significantly attenuated the epinephrine-promoted increase in cAMP accumulation by ∼2-fold (p < 0.05, n = 4). Importantly, the statin-promoted decrease in intracellular cAMP is reversed by addition of mevalonate, which is the immediate substrate of HMG CoA reductase; the isoprenoid compound GGpp also blocked the effects of simvastatin (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these findings provide evidence that implicates upstream statin-sensitive geranylgeranylation pathways in modulating the suppression of cAMP responses seen after simvastatin treatment of endothelial cells. We therefore turned our attention to the analysis of G proteins that influence intracellular cAMP metabolism. We performed immunoblot analyses to investigate the effects of simvastatin on G protein abundance in endothelial cells. Fig. 5 shows that simvastatin treatment of endothelial cells leads to a marked decrease in the abundance of Gαs (80 ± 10% decrease compared with untreated cells, p < 0.05, n = 3). Importantly, the simvastatin-promoted decrease in Gαs was entirely reversed by treatment with mevalonate or GGpp, but not by Fpp (Fig. 5). When added alone, mevalonate had no effect on these responses (supplemental Fig. S1). Simvastatin treatment led to a more subtle ∼40% decrease in Gβ1, and Gγ2, (not shown), while the abundance of Gαi and Gαo were not significantly affected (Fig. 5, A and B). The abundance of Gαs was not affected by simvastatin treatment of human aortic smooth muscle cells (Fig. 5, C and D). As shown in Fig. 6, simvastatin time- and dose-dependently attenuated Gαs abundance. The EC50 for the statin-promoted decrease in abundance is ∼8 μm, which is within the therapeutic concentration range for patients taking standard doses of simvastatin (13Lilja J.J. Kivistö K.T.

We first determined the effects of simvastatin on Gαs protein half-life following treatment of endothelial cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 7, A and B); these experiments showed no change in the stability of the Gαs protein following simvastatin treatment (t1/2 7.8 versus 8.2 h, p = NS). We then performed pulse-chase experiments to measure the half-life of Gαs protein with and without simvastatin treatment, and again found no substantive change in Gαs protein stability (Fig. 7, C and D).

https://openalex.org/W2066777484,"Background MSP3 has been shown to induce protection against malaria in African children. The characterization of a family of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3) antigens sharing a similar structural organization, simultaneously expressed on the merozoite surface and targeted by a cross-reactive network of protective antibodies, is intriguing and offers new perspectives for the development of subunit vaccines against malaria. Methods Eight recombinant polyproteins containing carefully selected regions of this family covalently linked in different combinations were all efficiently produced in Escherichia coli. The polyproteins consisted of one monovalent, one bivalent, one trivalent, two tetravalents, one hexavalent construct, and two tetravalents incorporating coiled-coil repeats regions from LSA3 and p27 vaccine candidates. Results All eight polyproteins induced a strong and homogeneous antibody response in mice of three distinct genotypes, with a dominance of cytophilic IgG subclasses, lasting up to six months after the last immunization. Vaccine-induced antibodies exerted a strong monocyte-mediated in vitro inhibition of P. falciparum growth. Naturally acquired antibodies from individuals living in an endemic area of Senegal recognized the polyproteins with a reactivity mainly constituted of cytophilic IgG subclasses. Conclusions Combination of genetically conserved and antigenically related MSP3 proteins provides promising subunit vaccine constructs, with improved features as compared to the first generation construct employed in clinical trials (MSP3-LSP). These multivalent MSP3 vaccine constructs expand the epitope display of MSP3 family proteins, and lead to the efficient induction of a wider range of antibody subclasses, even in genetically different mice. These findings are promising for future immunization of genetically diverse human populations."
https://openalex.org/W2050474162,"To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the QuickVue® Influenza A+B rapid test we conducted a prospective observational study in which this rapid test was compared with a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for pandemic influenza A H1N1 (2009) infection in Austrian adults. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the QuickVue test compared with the RT-PCR were 26% (95% CI 18–35), 98% (95% CI 92–100), 94% (95% CI 80–99) and 50% (95% CI 42–58), respectively. The prevalence of pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus infection among the 209 patients included in the study was 57%. Our data suggest that a positive QuickVue test provides considerable information for the diagnosis of pandemic influenza A H1N1 (2009) virus infection in young adults but that a negative QuickVue test result should, if relevant for patient management or public health measures, be verified using PCR."

https://openalex.org/W2077095206,"We applied crosslinking techniques as a first step in preparation of stable avian sarcoma virus (ASV) integrase (IN)-DNA complexes for crystallographic investigations. These results were then compared with the crystal structures of the prototype foamy virus (PFV) intasome and with published data for other retroviral IN proteins.Photoaffinity crosslinking and site-directed chemical crosslinking were used to localize the sites of contacts with DNA substrates on the surface of ASV IN. Sulfhydryl groups of cysteines engineered into ASV IN and amino-modified nucleotides in DNA substrates were used for attachment of photocrosslinkers. Analysis of photocrosslinking data revealed several specific DNA-protein contacts. To confirm contact sites, thiol-modified nucleotides were introduced into oligo-DNA substrates at suggested points of contact and chemically crosslinked to the cysteines via formation of disulfide bridges. Cysteines incorporated in positions 124 and 146 in the ASV IN core domain were shown to interact directly with host and viral portions of the Y-mer DNA substrate, respectively. Crosslinking of an R244C ASV IN derivative identified contacts at positions 11 and 12 on both strands of viral DNA. The most efficient disulfide crosslinking was observed for complexes of the ASV IN E157C and D64C derivatives with linear viral DNA substrate carrying a thiol-modified scissile phosphate.Analysis of our crosslinking results as well as published results of retroviral IN protein from other laboratories shows good agreement with the structure of PFV IN and derived ASV, HIV, and MuLV models for the core domain, but only partial agreement for the N- and C-terminal domains. These differences might be explained by structural variations and evolutionary selection for residues at alternate positions to perform analogous functions, and by methodological differences: i.e., a static picture of a particular assembly from crystallography vs. a variety of interactions that might occur during formation of functional IN complexes in solution."
https://openalex.org/W2042418414,"Multicellular tumour spheroid (MCTS) cultures are excellent model systems for simulating the development and microenvironmental conditions of in vivo tumour growth. Many documented cell lines can generate differentiated MCTS when cultured in suspension or in a non-adhesive environment. While physiological and biochemical properties of MCTS have been extensively characterized, insight into the events and conditions responsible for initiation of these structures is lacking. MCTS are formed by only a small subpopulation of cells during surface-associated growth but the processes responsible for this differentiation are poorly understood and have not been previously studied experimentally. Analysis of gene expression within spheroids has provided clues but to date it is not known if the observed differences are a cause or consequence of MCTS growth. One mechanism linked to tumourigenesis in a number of cancers is genetic instability arising from impaired DNA mismatch repair (MMR). This study aimed to determine the role of MMR in MCTS initiation and development. Using surface-associated N2a and CHLA-02-ATRT culture systems we have investigated the impact of impaired MMR on MCTS growth. Analysis of the DNA MMR genes MLH1 and PMS2 revealed both to be significantly down-regulated at the mRNA level compared with non-spheroid-forming cells. By using small interfering RNA (siRNA) against these genes we show that silencing of MLH1 and PMS2 enhances both MCTS initiation and subsequent expansion. This effect was prolonged over several passages following siRNA transfection. Down-regulation of DNA MMR can contribute to tumour initiation and progression in N2a and CHLA-02-ATRT MCTS models. Studies of surface-associated MCTS differentiation may have broader applications in studying events in the initiation of cancer foci."
https://openalex.org/W2019904704,"Germinal centers (GCs) are complex dynamic structures that form within lymph nodes as an essential process in the humoral immune response. They represent a paradigm for studying the regulation of cell movement in the development of complex anatomical structures. We have developed a simulation of a modified cyclic re-entry model of GC dynamics which successfully employs chemotaxis to recapitulate the anatomy of the primary follicle and the development of a mature GC, including correctly structured mantle, dark and light zones. We then show that correct single cell movement dynamics (including persistent random walk and inter-zonal crossing) arise from this simulation as purely emergent properties. The major insight of our study is that chemotaxis can only achieve this when constrained by the known biological properties that cells are incompressible, exist in a densely packed environment, and must therefore compete for space. It is this interplay of chemotaxis and competition for limited space that generates all the complex and biologically accurate behaviors described here. Thus, from a single simple mechanism that is well documented in the biological literature, we can explain both higher level structure and single cell movement behaviors. To our knowledge this is the first GC model that is able to recapitulate both correctly detailed anatomy and single cell movement. This mechanism may have wide application for modeling other biological systems where cells undergo complex patterns of movement to produce defined anatomical structures with sharp tissue boundaries."
