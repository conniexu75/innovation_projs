https://openalex.org/W2005640704,"The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a newly-identified member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, mediates interactions of advanced glycation end product (AGE)-modified proteins with endothelium and other cell types. Survey of normal tissues demonstrated RAGE expression in situations in which accumulation of AGEs would be unexpected, leading to the hypothesis that under physiologic circumstances, RAGE might mediate interaction with ligands distinct from AGEs. Sequential chromatography of bovine lung extract identified polypeptides with Mr values of ≈12,000 (p12) and ≈23,000 (p23) which bound RAGE. NH2-terminal and internal protein sequence data for p23 matched that reported previously for amphoterin. Amphoterin purified from rat brain or recombinant rat amphoterin bound to purified sRAGE in a saturable and dose-dependent manner, blocked by anti-RAGE IgG or a soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE). Cultured embryonic rat neurons, which express RAGE, displayed dose-dependent binding of 125I-amphoterin which was prevented by blockade of RAGE using antibody to the receptor or excess soluble receptor (sRAGE). A functional correlate of RAGE-amphoterin interaction was inhibition by anti-RAGE F(ab′)2 and sRAGE of neurite formation by cortical neurons specifically on amphoterin-coated substrates. Consistent with a potential role for RAGE-amphoterin interaction in development, amphoterin and RAGE mRNA/antigen were co-localized in developing rat brain. These data indicate that RAGE has physiologically relevant ligands distinct from AGEs which are likely, via their interaction with the receptor, to participate in physiologic processes outside of the context of diabetes and accumulation of AGEs.

Incubation of proteins or lipids with aldose sugars results in nonenzymatic glycation and oxidation(1Ruderman N. Williamson J. Brownlee M.

Factors favoring nonenzymatic glycation include delayed protein turnover, as in amyloidoses, accumulation of macromolecules with high lysine content, and situations with elevated glucose levels, as in diabetes. AGE formation occurs during normal aging, and at an accelerated rate in diabetes, in which their accumulation in the plasma and vessel wall has been speculated to underlie the pathogenesis of vasculopathy (1Ruderman N.

One of the principal means through which AGEs impact on cellular elements is through interaction with cellular binding proteins. Although there are several possible cell-associated polypeptides with which AGEs might interact(8Yang Z. Makita J. Horii Y. Brunelle S. Cerami A. Sehajpal P. Suthanthiran M. Vlassara H. J. Exp.

The potential pathophysiologic relevance of AGE-RAGE interaction was emphasized by studies demonstrating that blockade of RAGE prevented multiple AGE-induced perturbations of cellular functions. For example, AGE-stimulated mononuclear phagocyte migration and activation, endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and increased monolayer permeability were prevented by blocking AGE interaction with RAGE(12Schmidt A.M. Zhang J.H. Crandall J. Cao R. Yan S.D. Brett J. Stern D. FASEB J. 1994; 8 (3841): A662Google Scholar, 13Schmidt A.M. Hori O. Chen J.X. Crandall J. Zhang J. Cao R. Brett J. Stern D. J. Clin.

Consistent with the latter data in cell culture, in vivo studies have shown RAGE to mediate the early and rapid removal of AGEs from the intravascular space, AGE induction of vascular oxidant stress and vascular hyperpermeability in diabetic animals and rodents infused with AGEs (14Yan S.D.

Cao, O. Hori, D. Stern, and A. M. Schmidt, manuscript submitted for publication. These data emphasize a potential role for AGE-RAGE interactions in pathologic states, and have led us to assess RAGE expression in vasculopathies, especially that associated with diabetes. During the course of tissue surveys to assess RAGE distribution, it became evident that expression of the receptor occurred in early development, especially in the central nervous system; i.e. in situations distinct from those in which AGEs might be present. RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules (19Neeper M. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14998-15004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the extracellular domain consists of one putative “V” type followed by two putative “C” type domains, bearing closest homology to neural cell adhesion molecule(19Neeper M. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14998-15004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of previous studies with other immunoglobulin-like receptors, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1, in which one receptor has several pathophysiologically relevant ligands(20Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar), we considered the hypothesis that AGEs might be accidental ligands for a receptor which had other functions. By analogy with other immunoglobulin superfamily members, we speculated that RAGE might participate in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions, or, perhaps, might function as a cytokine or growth factor receptor. Toward this end, we sought to define putative natural ligands for RAGE which were not AGEs. In this study we report the identification of amphoterin as a ligand for RAGE: amphoterin binds RAGE with higher affinity than AGEs; RAGE serves as the binding site for amphoterin on rat embryonic cortical neurons; amphoterin-RAGE interaction promotes neurite outgrowth in cell culture; and, RAGE and amphoterin are co-expressed in developing rat neuroepithelium. Although future in vivo studies will be required to determine the contribution of amphoterin-RAGE interaction in neuronal development, these studies provide a first step in identifying novel functions for RAGE distinct from its role as a receptor for AGEs in the vasculature. Bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Sigma) was glycated by incubation with glucose (0.5 M) for 6 weeks at 37°C. Glycated protein was characterized based on fluorescence and binding to cultured endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes, as described previously(10Schmidt A.M. Vianna M. Gerlach M. Brett J. Ryan J. Kao J. Esposito C. Hegarty H. Hurley W. Clauss M. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Tsang T Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14987-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control, nonglycated albumin consisted of the same initial preparations of albumin incubated at 37°C in the same manner, except that no aldose was present. Bovine lung powder (100 g; Sigma) was extracted with buffer containing Tris (0.02 M; final pH 7.4), NaCl (0.1 M), octyl-β-glucoside (1.0%), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.001 M) over 16 h at 4°C, followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 11,000 × g. Supernatant was filtered (0.45 μm) and applied to heparin-Sepharose (bed volume, 25 ml; Sepracor, Marlborough, MA) equilibrated with Tris (0.02 M; final pH 7.4)/NaCl (0.1 M) containing octyl-β-glucoside (0.1%). The column was washed extensively with the same buffer until the OD280 was <0.01, and step-eluted sequentially with increasing NaCl in the equilibration buffer (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 M). One-milliliter fractions were collected and protein content determined by adsorption at OD280 (Corning, Oberlin, OH). Fractions from the heparin column were screened for RAGE binding activity following their adsorption to MaxiSorp microtiter wells (Nunc, Naperville, IL) in bicarbonate/carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) for 16 h at 4°C. After blocking excess binding sites in the wells with phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin (1%), a binding assay with 125I-RAGE was performed. For these studies, RAGE was purified to homogeneity from bovine lung, as described(10Schmidt A.M. Vianna M. Gerlach M. Brett J. Ryan J. Kao J. Esposito C. Hegarty H. Hurley W. Clauss M. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Tsang T Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14987-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and radioiodinated by the lactoperoxidase method using Enzymobeads (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final specific radioactivity of the tracer was 1,000 cpm/ng, and 125I-RAGE was >95% precipitable in trichloroacetic acid (20%), migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE (comigrating with the unlabeled protein), and bound AGEs. 125I-RAGE was added to wells previously coated with fractions from the heparin column for 3 h at 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin (0.2%). At the end of the incubation period, wells were washed rapidly (10 s/wash and 0.3 ml/wash) with Hank's balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). Bound radioactivity was eluted with NaCl (2 M) and counted in a γ-counter (Pharmacia LKB, Gaithersburg, MD). Fractions containing RAGE binding activity, identified in the 0.5 M NaCl eluate, were dialyzed versus phosphate-buffered saline containing octyl-β-glucoside (0.1%; final pH 7.4) and applied to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad), to which had been bound purified bovine RAGE (2 mg/ml resin), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 16 h of incubation at 4°C, the resin was washed with 10 bed volumes of buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing octyl-β-glucoside, 0.1%), and eluted by high salt (NaCl, 2 M). Fractions containing binding activity for 125I-RAGE, based on the competitive binding assay above, were dialyzed versus phosphate-buffered saline containing octyl-β-glucoside (0.1%) and subjected to nonreduced SDS-PAGE (10%). Protein on the gel was either visualized by silver staining (Bio-Rad), or gels were sliced (2 mm each) and individual slices were eluted by incubation in acetate buffer (pH 8.0) for 4 h at 4°C. The mixture was then centrifuged to pellet debris, and supernatants were tested for RAGE binding activity. Two positive fractions were identified, eluted from the gel, and subjected to nonreduced SDS-PAGE (12%). Protein on the gel was visualized by either silver or Coomassie Blue staining to identify bands. Two protein bands with Mr≈ 23,000 and ≈ 12,000 were visualized and sequence analysis performed as follows. The gel bands were eluted from the SDS-PAGE gels using previously described methods(21Slattery T.K. Harkins R.N. Angeletti R.H. Techniques in Protein Chemistry IV. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). This method was modified by increasing buffer volumes to accommodate the larger gel volume, and adding a final wash with two 0.1-ml aliquots of guanidine (5.0 M), urea (5.0 M), trifluoroacetic acid (0.2%), acetonitrile (10%), and Zwittergent 3-08 (1.0%) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) to insure that protein was completely washed from the filter. Automated Edman degradation was carried out using either an HP-G1005A sequencer (Hewlett Packard Analytical Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) or a 477A sequencer (Perkin Elmer-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To obtain internal sequence, the gel bands were treated as above for elution, except that the extraction buffer had half the usual amount of SDS(21Slattery T.K. Harkins R.N. Angeletti R.H. Techniques in Protein Chemistry IV. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). One microgram of endoproteinase Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim) was added and the sample incubated overnight. Separation of the fragments was carried out by HPLC on a Vydac C18 column. A linear gradient of 10-40% acetonitrile in trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%) over 35 min was used to elute the fragments. Fractions were collected at 2-min intervals and absorbance monitored at 214 nm. Fractions that corresponded to chromatographic peaks were then subjected to sequence analysis. In order to obtain additional internal sequence, the eluate from the RAGE-Affi-Gel 10 column was purified by HPLC using a 1% per minute gradient from 10 to 60% acetonitrile in trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%) to elute the material from a Vydac C4 column. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. Initially, one-fourth of the available sample was run and peaks identified by NH2-terminal sequence analysis. The remainder of the material was then run and the 23-kDa containing fraction digested with cyanogen bromide to obtain the internal sequence. To digest with cyanogen bromide (Pierce) the 23-kDa containing fraction was diluted 1:1 with 100 mg/ml cyanogen bromide in HCl (0.2 N) and incubated overnight. The digest was fractionated by microbore HPLC (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) on a 1 mm × 50-mm PLRP-S column (Polymer Laboratories, Ltd., Church Stretton, UK). The gradient utilized was 2% per minute from acetonitrile (5-75%) in trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%) and fractions were collected at half-minute intervals. Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm and fractions that corresponded to chromatographic peaks were then subjected to sequence analysis. The NH2-terminal sequence was used to query the PIR and SWIS-PROT protein data bases using the Genetics Computer Group Sequence Analysis Software package (22Devereux J. Heberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). Amphoterin was purified from the brains of 10-day-old Wistar rats as described (23Rauvala H. Pihlaskari R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16625-16635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by sequential chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad). A single band, Mr≈ 30,000, was identified on nonreduced SDS-PAGE (12%), eluted and subjected to NH2-terminal sequence analysis and identified as amphoterin. Rat RAGE was purified to homogeneity from lung powder (Sigma) using similar methods described for bovine RAGE(10Schmidt A.M. Vianna M. Gerlach M. Brett J. Ryan J. Kao J. Esposito C. Hegarty H. Hurley W. Clauss M. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Tsang T Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14987-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity with anti-RAGE IgG (see below) and NH2-terminal and internal sequencing indicated identity to the predicted sequence for rat RAGE based on that deduced from the rat cDNA. 3A. M. Schmidt, O. Hori, and D. Stern, unpublished observation. Based on Mr≈ 32,000 and comparison with RAGE purified from bovine lung, rat lung RAGE also most likely represents the amino-terminal two-thirds of the molecule (i.e. the extracellular domain; (19Neeper M. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14998-15004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and is identified as soluble RAGE or sRAGE. Rat sRAGE bound AGE albumin in a dose-dependent and specific manner analogous to bovine sRAGE (data not shown). Polyclonal antiserum to rat RAGE was prepared in rabbits by standard procedures (24Vaitukatis J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and monospecific immune IgG was purified by chromatography on Protein A (Schleicher and Schuell) according to the manufacturer's instructions. F(ab′)2 fragments were prepared from IgG using a kit from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nonimmune IgG and F(ab′)2 fragments were similarly made from sera derived from rabbits not immunized with RAGE. Polyclonal antiserum to rat amphoterin was prepared in chickens and immune IgG was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation(25Mohanty J.G. Elazhary Y. Comp. Immunol. Microbiol. Inf. Dis. 1989; 12: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for AGE antigen was performed with affinity purified anti-AGE antibody as described previously(14Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A baculovirus expression plasmid coding for rat amphoterin was prepared as follows. A DNA fragment coding for amphoterin was obtained from rat lung cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (GeneAmp, Perkin-Elmer); primers used were 5′-CTAAACATGGGCAAAGGAGAT-3′ and 5′-CGTAGAACCAACTTATTCATC-3′. Sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction product by the dideoxy chain termination method (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) revealed the same sequence as that published for rat brain amphoterin(27Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Laitinen J. Wartiovasara J. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16722-16729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the pCR™II vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and the EcoRI fragment of the resultant plasmid was cloned into the pBacPAK8 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, Ca) under control of AcMNPV polyhedrin promoter. Baculovirus expression of recombinant rat amphoterin was performed by co-transfecting the plasmid pBacPAK8/amphoterin with a linearized BacPAK6 viral DNA (Clontech) into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant plaques were identified and purified by their β-galactosidase-negative phenotype. Recombinant amphoterin was then purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and Affi-Gel blue. Recombinant amphoterin was identified by immunoblotting with monospecific anti-rat amphoterin IgG and mobility on SDS-PAGE. Rat RAGE (2.5 μg) dissolved in bicarbonate/carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) was incubated for 16 h at 4°C in MaxiSorp (Nunc) microtiter wells, wells were washed four times with washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween 20, 0.02%), and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin (1%). Purified rat brain amphoterin and purified recombinant amphoterin were radiolabeled with Na125I by the lactoperoxidase method, as above, to final specific activities of 4 × 104 and 5 × 104 cpm/ng of protein, respectively. Tracers were >95% precipitable in trichloroacetic acid (20%) and migrated on SDS-PAGE as single bands with Mr≈ 30,000. Wells with adsorbed RAGE were incubated for 2 h at 37°C with the indicated concentration of 125I-amphoterin, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin (1%), either alone or in the presence of an 100-fold excess of unlabeled material. Following the incubation period, wells were washed four times rapidly in washing buffer, as above, and eluted with NaCl (2 M) for 10 min. Specific binding was defined as the total binding minus binding in the presence of excess unlabeled material (i.e. nonspecific binding) and analyzed by the methods of Klotz and Hunston(28Klotz I. Hunston D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 258: 11442-11445Google Scholar). Where indicated, wells were preincubated with anti-RAGE IgG or nonimmune IgG prior to incubation with 125I-amphoterin (2-3 nM) or 125I-amphoterin was preincubated with various concentrations of rat sRAGE for 2 h at 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin (1%) prior to incubation with RAGE adsorbed to the wells. In certain experiments, wells were preincubated with AGE albumin or native albumin for 2 h at 37°C prior to the addition of 125I-amphoterin. Cortical neurons were isolated from the brains of 17-day-old embryonic Wistar rats according to established methods(23Rauvala H. Pihlaskari R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16625-16635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (105 cells/well) in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing fetal bovine serum (10%; Gemini, Calabasas, CA) were plated in 96-well plates (Corning) previously coated with poly-L-lysine (50 μg/well, Sigma). The cell population was >90% neuronal based on immunostaining with anti-neurofilament antibody (Sigma). Two days later, cells were washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in paraformaldehyde (2%; fixation was required to prevent detachment of cells during the binding assay), and again washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed cultures were then placed in phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin (1%) and incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 125I-amphoterin either alone or in the presence of an 100-fold excess of unlabeled amphoterin. Wells were then washed 4 times with phosphate-buffered saline and cell-associated 125I-amphoterin was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing Nonidet P-40 (1%). Where indicated, cultured neurons were preincubated with anti-RAGE IgG, nonimmune IgG, AGE albumin, or native albumin, or 125I-amphoterin was preincubated with sRAGE, as above. Nonspecific binding was ≈25% of total binding, and binding data were analyzed as above. In order to approximate equilibrium binding conditions, the incubation time was chosen to allow 125I-amphoterin binding to cultured neurons to reach an apparent maximum, and the washing time was sufficiently short so that <5-10% of bound ligand would dissociate. Amphoterin produced endogenously was removed from the cell surface during the extensive washing procedure prior to fixation of neurons and performance of the binding assay. Eight-chamber slides (Nunc Lab-Tek) were coated with either purified brain amphoterin (20 μg/ml), recombinant amphoterin (10 μg/ml), or poly-L-lysine (50 μg/ml) for 18 h at 37°C. Cortical neurons were isolated from the cerebral hemispheres of day 17 rat embryos, plated on the latter precoated slides, and incubated for 18 h at 37°C in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing bovine serum albumin (0.5%). Slides were subsequently fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) containing Nonidet P-40 (0.1%) and stained with anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where indicated, isolated neuronal cells in medium containing bovine serum albumin (0.5%) were preincubated for 1 h at 4°C with anti-RAGE F(ab′)2 or nonimmune F(ab′)2, or amphoterin-coated wells were pretreated for 1 h at 37°C with sRAGE in medium containing bovine serum albumin (0.5%) prior to the addition of the cortical neurons. In situ hybridization for RAGE was performed according to previously published methods(11Brett J. Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Zou Y.S. Weidman E. Pinsky D. Nowygrod R. Neeper M. Przysiecki C. Shaw A. Migheli A. Stern D. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1699-1712PubMed Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were prepared as described above, fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) containing Nonidet P-40 (1%), or rat brains were harvested, fixed in formalin (10%), and thin sagittal sections were prepared. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were transcribed from the plasmid B379-2A containing a 1406-base pair fragment of bovine RAGE (nucleotides 1-1406) cloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II SK. Antisense probe was transcribed from the T3 promoter with the plasmid linearized by XhoI. Control sense probe was transcribed from the T7 promoter with the plasmid linearized by XbaI. Transcription was performed using an RNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) with digoxigenin-UTP by in vitro transcription with either T3 or T7 polymerase. The digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe was hybridized to cellular mRNA for 16 h at 55°C and detected with anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody over 16 h at 4°C. Antibody was visualized after 6 h incubation with X-phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium salt. In situ hybridization for rat amphoterin was performed using a plasmid containing 936 base pairs of rat amphoterin spanning nucleotides 32-967. The antisense probe was transcribed from the SP6 promoter with the plasmid linearized by XbaI. The sense probe was transcribed from the T7 promoter with the plasmid linearized by HindIII. Transcription, labeling, and detection were carried out as above and the antibody visualized for 10 h with X-phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium salt. Cortical neurons, prepared as described above, were fixed with paraformaldehyde (2%) or rat brains, harvested and prepared as above, were fixed in formalin (10%). Immunohistochemistry for RAGE was performed using rabbit anti-RAGE IgG and nonimmune rabbit IgG as above and immunohistochemistry for amphoterin was performed using chicken anti-amphoterin IgG and nonimmune chicken IgG. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and rabbit anti-chicken IgG (Sigma) were used, respectively, as secondary antibodies, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detergent extract of bovine lung acetone powder was applied to heparin-Sepharose and the column was step-eluted with ascending concentrations of salt (Fig. 1A). Fractions were evaluated for the presence of RAGE binding activity following adsorption to microtiter wells using a competitive binding assay measuring specific binding of bovine 125I-RAGE. Only material eluting from the heparin column at an NaCl concentration of 0.5 M bound RAGE, and the latter fractions(50-100) were pooled, dialyzed, and applied to a column with immobilized RAGE (Fig. 1B).

We show that expression of the endogenous FAS gene is repressed when regulatory sterols are included in the culture medium of HepG2 cells and that the FAS promoter is subject to similar regulation when fused to the luciferase reporter gene. Mutational studies demonstrate that sterol regulation is mediated by binding sites for the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and transcription factor Sp1, making it mechanistically similar to sterol regulation of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene. It is also demonstrated that SREBP and Sp1 synergistically activate the FAS promoter in Drosophila tissue culture cells, which lack endogenous Sp1.

These experiments provide key molecular evidence that directly links the metabolism of fatty acids and cholesterol together. Coordinate regulation of fatty acid and cholesterol accumulation is essential for balanced membrane biosynthesis and turnover to accommodate metabolic fluctuations that occur during normal cellular growth. Also, these two important lipids are simultaneously required in the liver for regular-ordered assembly of very low density lipoprotein particles, which deliver their lipid load of cholesterol and fatty acids from the liver to other sites in the body to maintain lipid homeostasis(1Glickman R.M.

Co-regulation of genes that encode important enzymes of both fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism would be an ideal way to coordinate lipid regulation, and recent work has identified a family of transcriptional regulatory proteins that could link the two pathways together(3Yokoyama C.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP 1 and 2)1 are highly related proteins that bind to the same cis-acting elements in the LDL receptor and HMG-CoA synthase promoters and activate expression only when cellular sterol stores are depleted(3Yokoyama C.

Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The rat mRNA was expressed at very high levels in brown fat and was also abundant in white fat and liver. The rat SREBP-1 mRNA was also induced during adipocyte differentiation in cell culture, so it was named the adipocyte determination- and differentiation-dependent factor 1 (ADD1). These observations suggested that SREBP-1/ADD1 is a regulator of genes that are important for lipid accumulation in the adipocyte. The above studies indicate that the activity of SREBP-1/ADD1 may provide a direct link between the regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. In the present paper we demonstrate that expression of the mRNA for fatty acid synthase (FAS), an essential enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis, is regulated by sterols in a manner similar to genes that encode important proteins of cholesterol metabolism. Moreover, in the region of the FAS promoter that is required for sterol regulation there are two binding sites for SREBP-1. One of them is located close to a binding site for the generic factor Sp1, and we show this site is crucial for sterol regulation. The involvement of SREBP-1 and Sp1 in activation of the FAS promoter is reminiscent of the LDL receptor promoter where both proteins are essential for sterol regulation as well. These experiments provide strong evidence for a direct molecular connection between the regulation of two different classes of cellular lipids that are both required for cellular growth and normal lipoprotein metabolism. CV-1 cells were obtained from Dr. K. Cho (University of California, Irvine). HepG2 cells were obtained from the ATCC. All cell culture materials were obtained from Life Technologies Inc. Lipoprotein-deficient serum was prepared by ultracentrifugation as described(7Goldstein J. Basu S. Brown M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Cholesterol and 25-OH cholesterol were purchased from Steraloids Inc., and stock solutions were dissolved in absolute ethanol. HepG2 cells were plated at 225,000 cells/100-mm dish on day 0. Two days later the dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and split into two groups. One set of dishes were refed induced medium (DMEM containing 10% lipoprotein-depleted serum) and one set was fed suppressed medium (same but containing 10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-OH cholesterol) media. Following a 24-h incubation the cells were harvested for RNA by the guanidine lysis procedure, followed by cesium chloride gradient sedimentation(8Chirgwin J.M. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). cDNA was prepared from HepG2 RNA with the aid of a kit from Invitrogen. The cDNA was used as a template with PCR primers designed to two highly conserved regions of the fatty acid synthase mRNA that were chosen by aligning the rat and chicken FAS cDNA sequences. The 5′ primer (5′-GACACAGCCTGCTCCTC(C/T)AG-3′) was designed to hybridized to a 20-base pair region beginning at nucleotide number 249 of the rat cDNA (where the A of the ATG start codon is base number 1). The 3′ primer (5′-AGCATGCC(C/T)AGCTTCATGAACTGCACAGA-3′) was designed to hybridize to 29 bases of the opposite strand beginning at nucleotide number 395. The resulting 147-base pair PCR product was cloned directly into the PCR II vector (Invitrogen), and the DNA sequence of the entire clone was shown to encode the correct portion of the human FAS mRNA. The insert was excised from PCR II and inserted into the EcoRI site of m13mp18. A clone containing the DNA strand equal to the mRNA was used to generate a probe for S1 nuclease analysis of FAS mRNA. S1 nuclease mapping was performed with 10-μg aliquots of total RNA prepared from HepG2 cells that were cultured as described above. The details of the S1 nuclease protocol have been described previously(9Osborne T.F. Gil G. Brown M.S. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Expression of HMG-CoA synthase and ribosomal protein S17 were analyzed by a primer extension assay with aliquots of the same samples used for FAS RNA analyses. The identity of the primers and the protocol have been described previously(10Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15634-15641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rat FAS promoter FAS(−1594) CAT (11Moustaid N. Sakamoto K. Clarke S. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Steve Clarke (then of Colorado State University; present address University of Texas at Austin). The FAS promoter fragment from −1594 to +65 was excised and inserted upstream of the luciferase gene in pGL2 basic (Promega). To generate −250, −150, and −135 derivatives, PCR primers were designed to hybridize at the corresponding positions and coupled with the common downstream primer at +65. The PCR fragments were re-cloned into the pGL2 basic vector. To generate plasmids D and E (containing the FAS sequence from −150 to −43 or −150 to −73, respectively, linked to a generic TATA sequence), the same PCR primer used to generate −150 was used in combination with a primer designed to hybridize and delete sequences 3′ to position −43 or −73. These fragments were then inserted just upstream of a generic TATA box sequence positioned upstream of the luciferase coding sequence. This minimal “TATA only” plasmid has been described previously(12Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated on day 0 in 60-mm dishes at 125,000 cells/dish. On day 1 the cells were refed the same medium and transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Precipitates contained 20 μg each of test plasmid and CMV2 β-galactosidase plus 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA in 2 ml of solution. 0.5 ml were added to each of four dishes, which were incubated for 12-16 h at 37°C and 7% CO2. The dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and duplicate dishes were refed either induced (DMEM containing 10% lipoprotein-depleted serum) or suppressed (same but containing 10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-OH cholesterol) media. Following a 24-h incubation, the cells were harvested by scrapping, cells from duplicate dishes were pooled, and extracts were prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles. For activation studies with overexpressed SREBP-1, the cDNA sequence encoding amino acids 1-490 of SREBP-1 was cloned by the polymerase chain reaction from HepG2 cell mRNA as described previously (12Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and inserted downstream from the cytomegalovirus early promoter in the pCMV5 vector (a gift of Dr. David Russell of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). The indicated amount of this plasmid was included along with the individual FAS-luciferase reporter construct and the CMV2 β-galactosidase in the transfection procedure as described above, except the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Drosophila SL2 cells were obtained from Dr. Al Courey (UCLA) and cultured at 25°C in Shields and Sang Drosophila media (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. They were seeded at 1.2 × 106 cells/60-mm dish and transfected by a standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (13Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Plasmid pPACSp1 containing the Sp1 coding sequence under the control of the Drosophila actin 5C promoter was also obtained from Al Courey. The SREBP-1 represents amino acids 1-490 of the full-length protein, and the cloning of the appropriate Drosophila expression plasmid has been described previously(12Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were measured in a luminometer with a luciferin reagent from Promega Biotech. β-Galactosidase assays were performed by a standard colorimetric procedure with 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside as substrate(14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 545Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase activity in relative light units was divided by the β-galactosidase activity (activity/h) for each extract. The data presented here represent the data from several independent transfections performed in duplicate for each plasmid in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 (see figure legends for the number of individual experiments).Figure 4Activation of FAS promoter by SREBP-1 and Sp1 in Drosophila SL2 cells. Extracts from cells transfected with the FAS promoter mutants D (lanes 1-4), and E (lanes 5-8) were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. Drosophila expression vectors for SREBP-1 or Sp1 were included as indicated. DNA transfections and analyses were described previously(12Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The purity and concentration of the purified proteins were assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis performed with marker proteins followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. [32P]DNA probes were prepared from the indicated plasmids, incubated with Sp1, SREBP-1, or both proteins together and digested with DNase I as described(9Osborne T.F. Gil G. Brown M.S. Kowal R.C.

SREBP-1 was independently identified as a bHLHzip protein involved in activation of sterol-regulated genes and for adipocyte cell differentiation. This suggests that it may link the regulation of sterol and fatty acid metabolism. Therefore, we are interested in characterizing SREBP target genes that are critical proteins of sterol and fatty acid metabolism. The sterol-regulated LDL receptor promoter contains an SRE-1 element, which binds SREBP and is required for sterol regulation. We found an identical match to the LDL receptor 10-base pair SRE-1 in the promoter for rat FAS and we determined that recombinant SREBP-1 binds avidly to this site (see below). The mammalian FAS is a multi-functional enzyme, which contains all of the enzymatic activities required for each cycle of fatty acid chain elongation in one polypeptide chain(16Amy C.M. Witkowski A. Naggert J. Williams B. Randhawa Z. Smith S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3114-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FAS gene and its promoter have been isolated and partially characterized previously(18Amy C.M. Williams-Ahlf B. Naggert J. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the SRE homology, there are three “E-box” sites in the FAS promoter. The E-box is a consensus recognition site for the bHLHzip proteins such as SREBP, and the one at −500 was identified previously as a potential target of SREBP-1/ADD1 activation(4Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). If SREBP binding to the FAS promoter were physiologically relevant, then the FAS mRNA should be regulated by sterols in a manner similar to other SREBP activated promoters such as those for the LDL receptor and HMG-CoA synthase. Therefore, we prepared mRNA from human HepG2 cells that were cultured in the presence or absence of regulatory sterols and analyzed FAS mRNA expression by a S1 nuclease protection assay (Fig. 1, top). The results demonstrated FAS mRNA expression was higher when cells were cultured in the absence of regulatory sterols compared to when cells are fed sterols. The expression of HMG-CoA synthase, an important regulated enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, was similarly regulated (Fig. 1, bottom); however, expression of the mRNA for the non-sterol-regulated ribosomal protein S17 was present at equal levels in both RNA samples (Fig. 1, middle). Therefore, FAS mRNA expression is regulated by cellular sterol levels similar to that observed for important genes of cholesterol homeostasis. Next, the sequence of the rat FAS promoter was fused to the luciferase reporter gene and analyzed by a standard transient expression assay for sterol regulation (Fig. 2a). The ratio of luciferase activity obtained for the wild-type promoter from transfected cells cultured in the absence and presence of regulatory sterols provided a measure of sterol regulation. The full-length promoter exhibited 2.1-fold higher activity in cells that were cultured in the absence of lipoproteins. A deletion of all of the sequence down to −150 resulted in an increase in the degree of regulation to 4.8-fold. This magnitude of regulation is similar to that observed for the endogenous FAS mRNA (Fig. 1) and for the wild-type HMG-CoA synthase and LDL receptor promoters (see the legend to Fig. 2). These results indicated the sequence required for sterol regulation of the FAS promoter is located within the proximal 150 base pairs of the promoter. Thus, the E-box consensus sites upstream of −150 are dispensable for sterol regulation. In addition, the normalized data (Fig. 2b) show that deletion of all sequence upstream of −150 does not drastically affect the absolute level of expression. Similar results were obtained by Moustaid et al.(19Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence remaining in the sterol-regulated −150 construct included the SRE-1 element consensus, an Sp1 binding site, and the remaining proximal E-box motif (Fig. 2a). Next, we made several more promoter constructs to further define the sequence elements responsible for sterol regulation. The most significant ones are shown in Fig. 2. When we deleted 15 bases from the 5′ side of the −150 construct sterol regulation was reduced from 4.8- to 3-fold (plasmid C). This suggests the SRE-1 site is important for maximal sterol regulation. This plasmid also exhibited a significant drop in basal promoter activity (Fig. 2b), suggesting the SRE homology is required for maximal expression. To evaluate the role of the remaining E-box site, we constructed two additional plasmids. First, the sequence from −150 to −43 was fused to a generic TATA element to provide a basal promoter. This removed the normal FAS TATA box region but retained both the proximal E-box and the SRE-1 element. This plasmid was regulated efficiently by sterols (Fig. 2, plasmid D). However, when we deleted the sequence between −75 and −43 from the 3′ end of this construct, sterol regulation was totally lost (plasmid E). To determine if the region of the FAS promoter that was required for sterol regulation was directly responsive to SREBP-1, we performed co-transfection studies with plasmid D or E along with a plasmid that encoded amino acids 1-490 of the SREBP-1 protein. This portion of SREBP-1 contains all of the information required for transcriptional activation(6Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 12Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The results showed the activity of plasmid D was significantly stimulated by co-transfected SREBP-1, however, plasmid E was not stimulated (Fig. 2c). Thus, deletion of the proximal E-box abolished both sterol regulation and activation by SREBP-1. Importantly, when the activation of the FAS promoter (plasmid D) by varying amounts of co-transfected SREBP-1 plasmid was directly compared to activation of the LDL receptor, a very similar dose response was obtained (Fig. 2d). Taken together, all of the above data indicate that the E-box region at −60 is critical for sterol regulation and activation by SREBP-1, the magnitude of sterol regulation and activation by SREBP-1 are similar to that of the LDL receptor, and that the SRE-1 element at −150 is required for maximal regulation and maximal expression. A DNA probe end-labeled at −250 and extending past the mRNA cap site was used to evaluate SREBP-1 binding in this region by a DNase I footprinting technique. Recombinant SREBP-1 protein bound to both the SRE-1 site at −150 and the proximal E-box motif (Fig. 3a, lane 2), confirming that SREBP-1 binds to both sites that are important for sterol regulation of the FAS promoter. SREBP cannot activate expression efficiently by itself even when its binding site is present in multiple copies(12Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 20Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the LDL receptor promoter, there is an Sp1 site close to the SREBP binding site that is also important for sterol regulation. Interestingly, we noted a potential Sp1 binding site at −90 of the FAS promoter, which is close to the proximal SREBP-1 binding site E-box (Fig. 2a and Fig. 3b), and we determined that purified Sp1 bound to this site (Fig. 3a, lane 4). When both SREBP-1 and Sp1 were incubated with the DNA probe, both binding patterns were observed (Fig. 3a, lane 3). The recognition sites for SREBP-1 and Sp1 that are included within the footprint regions are indicated on the FAS promoter sequence in Fig. 3b. Based on these studies, it is likely that SREBP and Sp1 function together to mediate sterol-dependent activation of the FAS promoter similar to the LDL receptor promoter. To specifically evaluate whether the FAS promoter was directly activated by SREBP-1 and Sp1 together, we performed co-transfection studies with SREBP-1 and Sp1 expression plasmids in Drosophila SL2 cells. These cells lack endogenous Sp1, yet they retain all of the accessory regulatory proteins required to respond to exogenously expressed Sp1(13Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). We have used this system previously to demonstrate that SREBP-1 and Sp1 synergistically activate the LDL receptor promoter(12Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 21Yieh L. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6102-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). When plasmid D was transfected into SL2 cells alone, a basal level of promoter activity was observed (Fig. 4, lane 1). The addition of plasmids that express either Sp1 or SREBP alone slightly stimulated promoter activity (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). When both expression constructs were included, the activity of the FAS promoter was stimulated 35-fold (lane 4). However, plasmid E, which removes the proximal SREBP binding E-box site, was not activated (lanes 5-8). These experiments confirm that SREBP and Sp1 activate the FAS promoter synergistically and that SREBP-1 and Sp1 are both required for activation. These experiments demonstrate that the gene encoding the important multi-functional enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid synthase, is regulated by cellular sterols in a manner similar to important genes of cholesterol homeostasis (Fig. 1). The promoter for the FAS gene contains two recognition sites for SREBP that are essential for maximal activity and sterol regulation (Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Fig. 4). One of these important SREBP sites is close to a binding site for the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1. This is similar to the LDL receptor promoter, where it was previously shown that Sp1 and SREBP are both essential for sterol regulation and promoter activation(12Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22Sudhof T. Van der Westhuyzen D. Goldstein J. Brown M. Russell D. J. Biol.

The present studies demonstrate that SREBP and Sp1 synergistically activate the FAS promoter (Fig. 4) similar to our previous studies for the LDL receptor promoter(12Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). One of the SREBP-1 sites is a classic SRE-1 site, which is identical to the SREBP-1 site of the human LDL receptor promoter. The other important SREBP-1 site contains an E-box motif, which is the typical recognition site for basic helix-loop-helix proteins like SREBP-1. Kim et al.(24Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.-D. Shih H.-M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell.

This dual specificity is mediated in part by the substitution of a tyrosine residue in a position that in most other bHLH proteins is occupied by an arginine. The experiments reported here provide the first example of a classic E-box imparting sterol regulation onto a specific promoter. In fact, in the sterol regulatory region of the FAS promoter there is a archetypal SRE-1 element and the E-box, which both bind SREBP-1. An important question, therefore, is why the E-box is more important for sterol regulation in the FAS promoter than the SRE-1 element? The answer to this question is probably due to some basic properties of the SREBP-1 protein. SREBP-1 apparently cannot activate expression by itself (see Fig. 4), even when synthetic promoters are constructed that contain multiple tandem SRE-1 elements(12Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 20Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A binding site for a neighboring ubiquitous transcription factor is required. As mentioned above, this ubiquitous factor is Sp1 for the LDL receptor and ACC promoters where the two proteins activate expression synergistically. Since the Sp1 site is closer to the E-box in the FAS promoter, it would probably be easier for Sp1 and SREBP-1 to communicate together when bound at these sites. Interestingly, Moustaid et al.(19Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have identified an insulin-responsive cis-acting site in the FAS promoter, which is in the same region as the E-box recognition sequence identified here as being essential for sterol regulation by SREBP-1. It is possible that SREBP-1 or another bHLHzip protein is responsible for the insulin response, and further studies should clarify this issue. The involvement of SREBP-1 in the expression of key fatty acid synthetic enzymes as well as for important proteins of cholesterol homeostasis would ensure coordinated levels of cholesteryl ester and triglyceride for proper assembly of very low density lipoprotein particles in the liver(1Glickman R.M. Sabesin S.M. Arias I.M. Jakoby W.B. Popper H. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver Biology and Pathology. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 331-354Google Scholar). The fact that SREBP-1 was independently identified as a protein expressed in differentiating adipocytes and involved in sterol regulation suggested it might perform this bridging function, and the present studies have identified a key target gene to link the two important lipid pathways together. The co-regulation would also be important in growth regulation of all mammalian cells to provide proper amounts of fatty acids and cholesterol for membrane synthesis and assembly. Studies in both experimental animals and humans have demonstrated that the quantity and quality of fatty acids in the diet have profound effects on very low density lipoprotein secretion, LDL receptor mRNA expression, and plasma cholesterol concentrations that are seemingly independent of the amount of cholesterol in the diet (25Horton J.D.

This dramatic stabilization has led to the suggestion that native inhibitory serpins may be metastable structures, kinetically trapped in a state of higher free energy than their most stable thermodynamic state. Such an energetically unfavorable structure would almost certainly be subject to negative selection, and thus its retention in all inhibitory serpins implies that it has been conserved for functional reasons. reactive center loop α1-antitrypsin plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 N-((2-(iodoacetoxy)ethyl)-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxal, 3-diazole urokinase plasminogen activator tissue-type plasminogen activator N-hyroxysuccinimide acetic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

In the late 1970s, it was reported that serpins were unlike other tight binding protease inhibitors and formed covalent ester linkages with enzymes(15Cohen A.B. Gruenke L.D. Craig J.C. Geczy D. Proc.

However, these conclusions were based on SDS-PAGE analysis of denatured complexes leaving the nature of the native complex open to question. Later investigations suggested that the native serpin-protease complex may be reversible and therefore could not be covalent but instead might form a Michaelis-like complex similar to the tight binding inhibitors of the Kunitz and Kazal families(16Shieh B.H.

To distinguish between these alternative structural models, we developed methods to monitor the position of the RCL in the inhibitor-enzyme complex and to determine the chemical nature of the association between serpins and their target proteases.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) at a concentration of 1 μM was incubated ± 1 μM uPA or tPA in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl at 23°C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent to 100 nM. The samples were incubated an additional 30 min followed by the addition of 1/10 volume of stop solution (1 M glycine, 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.75) and incubation continued for an additional 30 min. The labeled proteins were then separated from free 125I-Bolton-Hunter by precipitation with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate for 30 min at 4°C followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant, containing free 125I-Bolton-Hunter, was discarded, and the pellets were washed twice with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate. The pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of 1% SDS, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and ~250,000 cpm of each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 20% homogeneous gel (PhastGel, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and autoradiography. Inhibitor (1 μM) was incubated with enzyme (1 μM) for 30 min at 23°C in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, after which NHS was added to either 100 μM or 1 mM. The samples were incubated an additional 30 min followed by the addition of 1/10 volume of 1 M Tris, pH 7.5, and continued incubation for 30 min. The Tris was then removed by ultrafiltration and washing with distilled water in a Prospin column (Applied Biosystems) prior to automated amino-terminal sequence analysis using Edman chemistry (Applied Biosystems model 473A). Pretreatment of PAI-1 or tPA with NHS at both NHS concentrations tested did not significantly affect the activity of either protein, indicating that, under these conditions, NHS treatment alone does not result in protein denaturation. The model for active PAI-1 has been described previously(23Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The model for cleaved PAI-1 was generated using Quanta (Burlington, MA) from the coordinates of latent PAI-1 (generously provided by Dr. E. Goldsmith) and from the coordinates of cleaved α1AT obtained from the Brookhaven data base. The root mean square difference of the Cα trace with latent PAI-1 is <0.04 Å and 2.2 Å with cleaved α1AT. In the first series of experiments, site-directed mutants of the serpin PAI-1 were constructed with Cys residues at either the P9 or the P1′ position of the RCL. Each mutant was then labeled with the fluorescent probe NBD. This probe shows a large enhancement in fluorescence when moved from an aqueous environment to a hydrophobic milieu. Both mutants were then reacted with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in a stopped-flow fluorimeter, and these results are shown in Fig. 1. Reaction of the P9-NBD PAI-1 with tPA resulted in a large and rapid enhancement of the relative fluorescence (Fig. 1) together with a 13 nm blue spectral shift (data not shown), consistent with our previous data (21Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The extent of this change is nearly identical with that observed during the transition to the latent conformation (21Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and is consistent with insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A and the resultant burying of the P9 residue beneath α-helix F. The observed rates of loop insertion over a range of tPA concentrations are shown in the inset of Fig. 1. These data yield a limiting rate constant for this reaction of ~4 s-1 (t1/2 for insertion of ~250 ms). In contrast, reaction of the P1′-NBD PAI-1 with tPA resulted in a 30% decrease in relative fluorescence occurring at approximately the same rate (Fig. 1). This quench indicates that, unlike the P9 position of the RCL, the P1′ side chain is exposed to a more hydrophilic environment upon reaction with tPA. Although such a shift in position could result from a minor conformational change in the RCL, this explanation seems unlikely given the close association of the serpin and protease via the directly adjacent P1 Arg residue of PAI-1 and the S1 subsite of tPA. Alternatively, cleavage of the PAI-1 RCL by tPA between the P1 and P1′ residues could permit the NBD reporter group to move away from the enzyme into a more aqueous environment. In either case, the limiting rate of the reaction, calculated from the data in the inset to Fig. 1 is similar to that observed with the P9-NBD mutant (~8 s-1versus 4 s-1), indicating that changes at the P1′ site must occur either immediately preceding or concurrent with loop insertion. Since the maximum changes in fluorescence are stable over time (data not shown), the reaction being monitored in the stopped flow is proceeding to completion and thus represents formation of the stable inhibitor-enzyme complex and not a transient or intermediate reaction. To distinguish between cleavage of the P1-P1′ peptide bond versus solely a conformational change in the intact RCL, the PAI-1•PA complex was reacted with the amino-specific 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent(22Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). Two different plasminogen activators were used, tPA and uPA. These experiments were conducted with trace amounts of 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent under nondenaturing conditions, followed by treatment of the unreacted label with glycine and removal prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. This procedure should report the presence of a cleaved RCL in the complex by the appearance of a novel labeled peptide fragment of the correct size. Furthermore, since the unreacted Bolton-Hunter reagent was blocked with glycine and removed before the samples were denatured by exposure to SDS, any labeled peptide must have been formed while the complexes were in their native state. Although all accessible amines could potentially be labeled, including ∈-NH3+ groups of internal Lys residues, the only position that can incorporate label in the PAI-1 RCL carboxyl-terminal peptide would be its amino terminus, since PAI-1 contains no Lys residues in the 33-residue peptide produced by cleavage of the P1-P1′ bond. SDS-PAGE analysis of the labeled complexes shown in Fig. 2 demonstrated a unique ~3.0-kDa band with both PAI-1•PA complexes which was not present with PAI-1 or either PA alone (B). The observed mobility of this novel peptide is consistent with the predicted molecular mass (3.8 kDa) of the PAI-1 carboxyl-terminal peptide. As a positive control for cleavage of the RCL and the labeling efficiency of the C-terminal peptide, we also tested a mutant PAI-1 that we have previously shown is a pure substrate for plasminogen activators and is completely cleaved at its RCL P1-P1′ peptide bond(7Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations, the mutant PAI-1 fails to form stable complexes with either PA and is instead completely cleaved (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 7 and 8). Furthermore, a labeled peptide identical with that observed with wild type PAI-1•PA complexes is also seen (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 7 and 8). This similar efficiency of peptide labeling for the mutant PAI-1 cleaved by either uPA or tPA compared to wild type PAI-1 in association with each enzyme indicates that the RCL within the stable serpin-protease complex is cleaved and suggests that this cleavage is complete. To confirm complete cleavage of the PAI-1•PA complex and exclude substrate behavior by a subset of the inhibitor molecules, the extent of RCL cleavage was directly quantitated by microsequencing of the PAI-1•uPA complex. Since complex denaturation during the sequencing reaction could potentially induce cleavage, the extent of cleavage in native complexes was determined by a subtractive method. PAI-1•uPA complexes were first reacted with the amino-specific reagent NHS under nondenaturing, physiological conditions. This compound is similar to Bolton-Hunter reagent in its reactivity and covalently binds to free amines. Treatment of PAI-1•uPA complexes with NHS should therefore block available amino termini in a dose-dependent manner. The excess NHS was then reacted with Tris and removed by ultrafiltration prior to direct amino-terminal sequence analysis of remaining unreacted amino termini. This analysis is quantitative, and the relative reactivity of natural amino termini from both the inhibitor and protease serve as internal controls for NHS reactivity and sequencing efficiency. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1. The yield of RCL peptide amino terminus at each dose of NHS is very similar to those of the natural PAI-1 and uPA amino termini. Thus, the RCL peptide amino terminus generated upon complex formation is as reactive as the natural amino termini and therefore is very likely to be fully cleaved and exposed, consistent with the quenched fluorescence of the P1′-NBD PAI-1 and the 125I labeling results. Interestingly, the least NHS-reactive amino terminus tested is that of the uPA heavy chain (uPAhc, Table 1), a relatively hydrophobic sequence Ile-Ile-Gly-Gly which is likely to be oriented toward the interior of the molecule (24Freer S.T. Kraut J. Robertus J.D. Wright H.T. Xuong H.H. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1997-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The latter observation suggests that this approach is quite sensitive to amino termini solvent accessibility, further supporting the conclusion that the PAI-1 RCL must be completely cleaved when in complex with uPA. Similar results were also obtained with PAI-1•tPA complexes (data not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To test the general relevance of these observations for other serpin-protease complexes, the α1AT•elastase complex was also treated with NHS and subjected to microsequencing. The results shown in Table 2 are similar to the data obtained with the PAI-1•uPA complexes (Table 1), demonstrating that α1AT is also cleaved in its RCL when in complex with elastase. Taken together with the known stability of these complexes to SDS-PAGE, these observations strongly suggest that the serpin-protease complex is trapped in the form of a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. Serpin inhibition appears to be a two-step process with an initial reversible encounter complex followed by formation of an apparently irreversible stable complex(21Shore J.D. Day D.E.

Peptide bond cleavage by serine proteases is known to proceed through two tetrahedral intermediates(26Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Although our data rule out a complex frozen at the point of the first tetrahedral intermediate(19Matheson N.R. van Halbeek H. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13489-13491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prior to RCL cleavage, it is possible that the serpin-protease complex is frozen at the point of the second tetrahedral, following RCL cleavage, or that it is trapped in a distorted conformation intermediate between these two forms.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Based on these data, we propose that upon encountering a target protease, serpins bind to the enzyme forming a Michaelis-like encounter complex. This relationship is similar to a protease's interaction with its substrate, progressing to the point of cleavage of the P1-P1′ peptide bond and formation of the first covalent acyl-intermediate. Cleavage is coupled to a rapid insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A, with exposure of the P1′ residue to solvent and burying of the P9 residue. Fig. 3 shows the relative position of the RCL and the P1′ and P9 residues in molecular models of active and cleaved PAI-1. Since the inserting RCL is covalently linked to the enzyme via the active site Ser, this transition should also affect the protease and significantly change its position relative to the inhibitor. Such a rapid shift in the relative positions of the two molecules, centered at the enzyme's active site, might sufficiently distort the active site geometry to prevent efficient deacylation and thus trap the complex. Alternatively, the new position of the acylated protease's active site may prevent the water necessary for deacylation from entering the active site. This model is consistent with our previous results demonstrating that RCL insertion is not required for protease binding but is necessary for stable inhibition (7Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the observation that only an active enzyme can induce RCL insertion.3 We suggest that native serpin structures are kinetically trapped in a conformation which is not their most stable structure, and that the stored drive toward a lower energy structure results in trapping of the protease-inhibitor complex in the acyl-enzyme intermediate form.

First, we show that under conditions when protein kinase C is bound with equal affinity to membranes containing either DG or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), increasing ionic strength causes a similar reduction in membrane binding. The similar sensitivity to ionic strength indicates that the forces mediating the binding of protein kinase C to PMA are not significantly different from those mediating the binding to DG. At sufficiently high concentrations of PMA and relatively low concentrations of phosphatidylserine, the binding of protein kinase C to membranes became markedly less sensitive to ionic strength, suggesting that under these conditions direct non-electrostatic interactions with PMA dominate over electrostatic interactions with the lipid headgroups. Importantly, regardless of the strength of the interaction with PMA, protein kinase C exchanges between vesicle surfaces: protein kinase C bound first to phorbol ester-containing multilamellar vesicles exchanged to large unilamellar vesicles upon addition of an excess surface area of the latter. Lastly, the enzyme's intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was not quenched by bromines located at various positions in the hydrophobic core of the membrane.

Bird A.C. Heckenlivelys J.R. Retinitis Pigmentosa. J. B. Lippincott Co., New York1988: 176-187Google Scholar). Affected hemizygous males develop slowly progressive retinal degeneration leading to night blindness in their teens, loss of peripheral vision, and complete blindness by middle age. Carrier females generally retain retinal function but exhibit characteristic focal areas of degeneration and pigmentation upon fundoscopic examination, which likely represent clonal areas of disease due to random X inactivation. Pathologic examination of choroideremic eyes show profound atrophy of three adjacent retinal layers, the photoreceptors, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the choriocapillaris. Studies of carriers and early diseased eyes suggest that the RPE and/or the choriocapillaris are the primary site of degeneration, with secondary involvement of photoreceptors(1Heckenlively J.R. Bird A.C. Heckenlivelys J.R. Retinitis Pigmentosa. J. B. Lippincott Co., New York1988: 176-187Google Scholar). The gene responsible for CHM was localized to chromosomal band Xq21 and isolated by positional cloning techniques(2Cremers F.P. van de Pol D.J. van Kerkhoff L.P. Wieringa B. Ropers H.H.

An insight into the function of the CHM protein came with the finding that it encodes a subunit of Rab geranylgeranyl transferase, an enzyme that modifies Rab proteins with the covalent attachment of a lipid moiety(4Seabra M.C.

Rab proteins are low molecular weight GTPases of the Ras superfamily involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicular traffic in exocytic and endocytic pathways(6Simons K. Zerial M.

More than 30 different Rabs have been identified, each with a characteristic intracellular distribution suggesting that each Rab functions in a distinct transport event, e.g. Rab1 functions in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport while Rab5 functions in plasma membrane to endosome transport. A current model for the function of Rab proteins in vesicular transport is based on studies in yeast and mammalian cells. It predicts that Rabs cycle between a cytosolic, inactive, GDP-bound state and a membrane-bound, active, GTP-bound state. The cytosolic form is recruited to the cytoplasmic leaflet of a donor organelle membrane and activated by exchange of the bound GDP for GTP. Once on a transport vesicle, Rabs regulate docking and fusion events that lead to the release of lumenal contents from the transport vesicle into the lumen of the appropriate acceptor organelle. After fusion has occurred, GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP and Rabs are resolubilized by Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (Rab GDI), which delivers Rabs back to the donor organelle membrane, completing the cycle. In order for Rabs to interact with intracellular membranes, they must bear C20 geranylgeranyl (GG) groups attached to cysteines at or near the carboxyl terminus of the proteins. Rab proteins that cannot undergo GG modification remain cytosolic and are inactive(10Walworth N.C. Goud B. Kabcenell A.K. Novick P.J.

Rab GG transferase (Rab GGTase, previously designated Component B) or GGTase-II is an α/β heterodimer with structural homology to another prenyl transferase, Ras farnesyl transferase(17Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Sudhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12221-12229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike farnesyl transferase, Rab GGTase is inactive by itself and requires an accessory protein, designated Rab escort protein (REP, previously designated Component A) that binds to unprenylated Rab, presents it to Rab GGTase, and thereby facilitates GG transfer. After geranylgeranylation, REP remains bound to Rab in a stable complex that can be released in vitro by detergents(18Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P.M. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In vivo, REP delivers geranylgeranylated Rab to its target donor membrane(19Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele M.O. Seabra M.C. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The structural and functional homology between REP and RabGDI suggests that both use similar mechanisms to deliver Rabs to membranes. It was hypothesized that whereas REP delivers newly synthesized Rabs to target membranes, RabGDI acts in the recycling of Rabs(19Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele M.O. Seabra M.C. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences derived from purified rat REP-1 and later cDNA cloning revealed that it is the counterpart of the human protein encoded by the CHM gene(4Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Slaughter C.A.

A partial deficiency of Rab GGTase activity was demonstrated in extracts of CHM-derived lymphoblasts(5Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1993; 259: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The loss of Rab GGTase activity could be restored by addition of purified REP-1, but not Rab GGTase(5Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1993; 259: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), consistent with a defective REP-1 gene in CHM. In yeast, both Rab GGTase (encoded by the BET2 and BET4 genes) and REP (encoded by the MRS6/MSI4 gene) activities are essential for cell viability(20Waldherr M. Ragnini A. Schweyer R.J. Boguski M.S. Nature Genet. 1993; 3: 193-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Fujimura K. Tanaka K. Nakano A. Toh-e A. J. Biol.

Ferro-Novick S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4377-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and a complete deficiency of REP activity would likely be lethal in humans. The fact that CHM patients have no detectable defect other than the retinal lesion and that CHM cells retain partial Rab GGTase activity suggests that the deficiency of REP-1 is compensated in most tissues of CHM patients. The identification of REP-2 (or CHM-like protein)(24Cremers F.P. Molloy C.M. van de Pol D.J. van den Hurk J.A. Bach I. Geurts van Kessel A.H. Ropers H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a protein that is 75% identical to REP-1 (or CHM protein) raised the possibility that REP-2 could compensate for the loss of REP-1 function in CHM. Indeed, recombinant REP-2 can assist in the geranylgeranylation in vitro of different Rabs(25Cremers F.P. Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2111-2117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In search of the molecular mechanisms underlying retinal degeneration in CHM, we hypothesized that the reason why REP-2 is only partially effective in compensating for the loss of REP-1 in CHM retinal cells might be due to the existence of one or more Rabs that depend preferentially on REP-1 for prenylation. In this study, we demonstrate that one Rab protein selectively accumulates unprenylated in the cytosol of CHM lymphoblasts. This protein was purified, sequenced, and identified as the human homolog of a previously identified rat Rab protein, designated Ram(26Nagata K. Satoh T. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Okano Y. Doi T. Kaziro Y. Nozawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which we rename Rab27. Ram/Rab27 is predominantly membrane bound in normal lymphoblasts, whereas it is predominantly cytosolic in CHM lymphoblasts, suggesting that its function is compromised. Furthermore, rat Ram/Rab27 is expressed in normal retinas, specifically in the two cell layers that characteristically degenerate in CHM, the RPE and the choriocapillaris. These results raise the possibility that the retinal degeneration in CHM is due to the defective function of Ram/Rab27 (or a closely related protein) in the RPE and choriocapillaris. Stock cultures of permanent lymphoblast cell lines were grown as described in Seabra et al.(5Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1993; 259: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in suspension cultures for 72 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Where indicated, 20 μM compactin in the same medium was added to cells for 6 h before harvesting. Seven of the nine cell lines used in this study were described previously(5Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1993; 259: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The cell lines are designated as follows: control cell lines, control-1 (culture designation L389, male, age 38), control-2 (culture L430, male, age 26), control-3 (culture L423, male, age 30), control-4 (culture L429, female, age 24), and control-5 (culture L411, male, age 33); Choroideremia cell lines, CHM-1 (culture L659, male, age 26), CHM-2 (culture L660, male, age 45), CHM-3 (culture L665, male, age 54), and CHM-4 (culture L669, male, age 35). All CHM cell lines contained no detectable REP-1 by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Large scale production of CHM-1 cells was achieved by growth at 37°C in 1-liter plastic roller bottles (Falcon) containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with glutamax-I (Life Technologies, Inc.), 25 mM sodium HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Initial cultures at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml were aerated with 10% CO2, 90% air, and fed every other day with the same medium. Cells at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml were collected by centrifugation at 1,500 revolutions/min for 15 min at 4°C, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, recentrifuged as before, and stored frozen at −80°C. Rab GGTase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]GG pyrophosphate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) to Rab proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, as described previously(5Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1993; 259: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained the following components in a final volume of 50 μl: 50 mM sodium HEPES (pH 7.2), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM Nonidet P-40, 5.5 μM [3H] GG pyrophosphate (3,000 disintegrations/min/pmol), and the indicated amounts of recombinant Rab proteins, Rab GGTase and REP-1 or REP-2. After incubation for 15 min at 37°C, the amount of ethanol/HCl precipitable radioactivity was measured by filtration on a glass fiber filter. The assay to detect unprenylated Rab proteins present in lymphoblasts used the same principle, with the following modifications. Samples to be assayed in a volume of 45 μl were added to reaction mixtures containing 500 mM sodium HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM Nonidet P-40, 10 μM [3H]GG pyrophosphate (33,000 disintegrations/min/pmol), and 200-800 ng each of Rab GGTase and REP-1 or REP-2 prepared in a volume of 5 μl and incubated for 15 min at 37°C. The reactions were stopped with the addition of 15 μl of 4 × SDS-sample buffer(27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), and aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following SDS-PAGE, the gel was either treated with Entensify (DuPont NEN), dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR film at −70°C or transfered to a nitrocellulose filter and exposed on a PhosphorImager (Fuji). For purification of p27, the same assay containing REP-1, not REP-2, was used. All steps were carried out at 4°C. Frozen cell pellets (30 ml of packed cells) were thawed and resuspended in 3 volumes of buffer 1 (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM GDP, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin), and lysed by nitrogen cavitation in a Parr disruption bomb. The lysate was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was brought to 40% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate, stirred for 30 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min to remove precipitated proteins. The resulting supernatant was adjusted to 60% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate, and the precipitated material (300 mg of protein) was disolved in one-fifth the initial supernatant volume of buffer 2 (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM GDP). The resuspended material was incubated for 30 min with 10 μg/ml of His-tagged Rab GDI, a generous gift from M. Zerial (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) (28Huber L.A. Ullrich O. Takai Y. Lutcke A. Dupree P.

For each run, 3 ml of 40-60% ammonium sulfate fraction (45 mg of protein) was applied onto a Superdex 75 16/60 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that had been equilibrated in buffer 2. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the material eluting between 40 and 100 ml was collected in 1-ml fractions. The active fractions were screened by the assay described above and pooled, usually those between 62 and 68 ml of elution. Triton X-114 partitioning was based on the method of Bordier(29Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active fractions from four gel filtration runs (6 mg of protein) were pooled, adjusted to 1% Triton X-114 (Calbiochem), and incubated for 5 min at 30°C. The phases were separated by centrifugation at 4,000 revolutions/min for 5 min at 24°C, the aqueous (upper) phase was collected, adjusted to 2% Triton X-114, and the procedure repeated. The resulting aqueous phase was diluted 1:1 (v/v) in buffer 3 (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM Nonidet P-40, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM GDP). The sample (4 mg of protein) was concentrated to 10 ml in Centriprep 10 microconcentrators (Amicon) and loaded onto a Mono Q 5/5 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer. After loading, the column was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer, and the proteins were eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from 0 to 250 mM NaCl in the same buffer. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and 2-ml fractions were collected. The peak fractions from 10 to 15 Mono Q runs were pooled (0.4-0.6 mg of protein) and concentrated to 1 ml in Centriprep 10 microconcentrators. For in vitro prenylation, 150 μl of a reaction mixture containing 333 mM sodium HEPES (pH 7.2), 33.3 mM MgCl2, 6.6 mM DTT, 6.6 mM Nonidet P-40, 5 nmol of [3H]GG pyrophosphate (1,650 distintegrations/min/pmol), 20 μg of Rab GG transferase, and 20 μg of REP-1 was added to the concentrated pool and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. An aliquot (5%) was taken for determination of the incorporation of [3H]GG into proteins by filter assay, as described above. The remainder was adjusted consecutively to 1% and 4% Triton X-114 and the phases separated as described above. The detergent (bottom) phases were pooled (final volume 200 μl), adjusted to 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2 1 mM EDTA, and 1.2 ml of ice-cold acetone was added. The mixture was vortexed, incubated for 15 h at −20°C, and centrifuged in a microfuge for 30 min at 4°C. The resulting pellet was designated acetone pellet. Two strategies were employed to obtain peptides from p27. Method One was designed to isolate and sequence the radiolabeled geranylgeranylated peptide. An estimated 600-700 pmol of [3H]GG groups were incorporated into protein after in vitro prenylation, and approximately 90% was recovered in the acetone pellet following Triton X-114 partitioning (see above). The acetone pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4% CHAPS, 1 mM EDTA, after which 15 μg of endoproteinase Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim) was added and incubated for 18-20 h at 37°C. When endoproteinase Arg-C (Boehringer Mannheim) was used, the incubation buffer was 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 4% CHAPS, 10 mM CaCl2, 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 5 μg of enzyme was added and incubated as above. The resulting peptides were isolated on a reverse-phase μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column (Pharmacia) using a SMART System chromatography instrument (Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated in MilliQ water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 24°C at a flow rate of 200 μl/min, the samples were injected, and the column eluted with acetonitrile as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Fractions of 100 μl were collected, and an aliquot was counted in a scintillation counter. The peak radioactive fractions were applied directly onto an Applied Biosystems model 470A or 477A Sequencers. Method Two used a conventional method(30Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The sample was subjected to in vitro prenylation, Triton X-114 partitioning, and acetone precipitation (approximately 500 pmol of [3H]GG groups incorporated), and then was subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose filter was stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) and exposed to a PhosphoImager. The fluorograph was aligned with the nitrocellulose filter, and the corresponding protein band was excised and subjected to solid phase digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C. Peptides released from the filter were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and sequenced as described previously(4Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1992; 70: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA encoding rat Ram/Rab27 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′ oligonucleotide primer, 5′-GCTCTAGACATATGTCGGATGGAGATTATGACTACCTC-3′, and a 3′ oligonucleotide primer, 5′-TTAAGCTTGGATCCTCAACAGCCGCATAACCCCTTCTC-3′ which were designed on the basis of the rat cDNA sequence(26Nagata K. Satoh T. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Okano Y. Doi T. Kaziro Y. Nozawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An aliquot (1 ng) of rat spleen double-stranded cDNA (QUICK-Clone, Clontech) was used as template for polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and the resulting 700-base pair fragment was subcloned into pCR script SK(+) vector (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid was designated pCRS-rRam. A NdeI-BamHI fragment from pCRS-rRam, which contained the coding region for rat Ram/Rab27, was ligated into pET14b vector, resulting in the plasmid pET14b-rRab27. Both plasmids were sequenced. The plasmid pET14b-rRab27 encodes a fusion protein that contains six histidine residues at the NH2 terminus (His-Ram/Rab27). E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were used for protein expression, and the recombinant protein was produced and purified on Ni2+-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously(25Cremers F.P. Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2111-2117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody N103 is a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against purified rat His-Ram/Rab27. Rabbits were immunized with 150 μg of His-Ram/Rab27 and immune bleeds collected, as described previously (31Reiss Y. Seabra M.C. Armstrong S.A. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10672-10677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ten ml of N103 immune serum was applied to 2 ml of a Ram/Rab27 affinity column, prepared by cross-linking 3.5 mg of His-Ram/Rab27 to AminoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce Chemical Co.) as directed by the manufacturer. The column was washed with 20 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), followed by 20 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 0.5 M NaCl. Bound IgG was eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.9) and collected in 1-ml fractions containing 0.1 ml 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). N103 antibody was used at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 μg/ml for immunoblot and immunohistochemical analysis. Anti-Rab7 immune sera (a generous gift from M. Zerial, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) was diluted 1/1000 for immunoblot and 1/2000 for immunohistochemical analysis. Anti-Rab1 immune sera (a generous gift from B. Goud, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) was diluted 1/500 for immunoblot analysis. Anti-cellular retinaldehyde binding protein (CRALBP) and anti-opsin immune sera (generous gifts from D. Bok, UCLA) were both diluted 1/2000 for immunohistochemical analysis. For immunoblot analysis, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and stained with 0.2% Ponceau S in 5% acetic acid. The nitrocellulose filters were incubated in solution A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Tween-20, and 5% nonfat dry milk) for 30 min at room temperature with agitation, followed by incubation in solution 1 containing the primary antibody for 1 h. The blots were washed for 2 × 10 min in solution B (solution A + 1% Nonidet P-40), followed by incubation for 30 min in solution B containing donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.). The blots were then washed for 2 × 10 min with solution C (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% SDS, 0.5% cholic acid, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Bound IgG was visualized by the ECL method (Amersham). All blots were calibrated with prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad). For immunohistochemistry, Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) prior to dissection of the eye cup, which included the retina, pigment epithelium, choroid, and sclera. The tissue was immediately placed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 12 h at 4°C. The tissue was infiltrated with 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS (pH 7.4) at 4°C, embedded in O.C.T compound (Tissue-Tek), and frozen in this media on dry ice. Longitudinal frozen sections (10-12 μm) of the eye cup were placed on Superfrost/Plus microscope slides (Fisher). Immunohistochemical staining of these sections was performed using the Vectastain ABC Elite kit following the instructions of the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories). Normal goat serum (1.5%) was added to the incubation solution (PBS (pH 7.4) and 0.3% Triton X-100) during incubation of tissue sections with IgG and avidin-biotin complexes. Bound antibodies were detected using an alkaline phosphatase substrate (Vector Laboratories Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate Kit III), resulting in a blue colorimetric reaction. Competition of N103 antibody immunostaining was performed by incubation of diluted N103 antibody (0.5 μg/ml) with AminoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce) beads cross-linked with 10 × molar excess of either His-Ram/Rab27 or His-Rab1a prepared as described above, at 22°C with agitation for 1 h. The beads were then sedimented by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was utilized for immunohistochemistry. Cytosolic and membrane fractions from cultured lymphoblast cell lines and rat tissues were prepared as follows. The cells or tissues were homogenized thoroughly in 3 volumes of buffer 1. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g at 4°C to sediment unbroken cells and cell nuclei. The postnuclear supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, resulting in the separation of cytosolic (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) fractions. The pellet was resuspended in buffer 1 adjusted to 1% Nonidet P-40. The protein content of cytosolic and 1% Nonidet P-40-solubilized membrane fractions was determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). To determine if CHM lymphoblasts efficiently prenylate all their cellular Rabs in vivo, we prepared cytosolic extracts from CHM and normal lymphoblasts and subjected them to in vitro prenylation using [3H]GG pyrophosphate as the lipid donor, Rab GGTase, and either REP-1 or REP-2. Under these conditions, any unprenylated Rab present in the cytosolic extract will be covalently modified by [3H]GG groups and may be detected upon SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. When five different normal extracts were analyzed in this manner, virtually no radiolabeled proteins were detected (Fig. 1, lanes C-L), suggesting that newly synthesized Rabs are rapidly and efficiently prenylated in normal cells. When the same cells were grown in the presence of compactin, an inhibitor of the synthesis of mevalonate, the precursor of prenyl groups, a large number of cytosolic proteins with apparent m"

In addition, we sought to learn whether this dissociation is a negative feedback mechanism resulting in the desensitization of p21rasto prolonged activation by growth factor stimulation. Rat1 cells expressing wild type human insulin receptors (HIRc) were maintained as described previously(27McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin was kindly provided by Lilly. Polyclonal antibodies used for immunoprecipitations were from sources as follows: anti-Sos1, Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); anti-Grb2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Shc, Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal antibodies anti-Sos1, anti-Grb2 and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) used for immunoblotting were all from Transduction Laboratories. The rat anti-p21ras antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the rabbit anti-rat antiserum was from Cappell (Durham, NC). Carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (40 mCi/ml) was from DuPont NEN. Polyethyleneimine cellulose TLC plates were from J.T.Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). Electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were from Amersham Corp. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. HIRcB cells were serum-starved for 16 h, and then treated for 60 min with 20 μM PD098059 in 1% Me2SO, or 1% Me2SO alone. Cells were then stimulated with 17 nM insulin or 160 nM EGF for the indicated times. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected in lysis buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 800 KIU/ml aprotinin, 8 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bacitracin, 2 mM dichloroacetic acid, 15 mM benzamidine, 160 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM Na4P2O7•10 H2O. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were divided for immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies to Sos, Grb2, or Shc. Immunoprecipitations were performed for 4 h at 4°C with the addition of protein A-agarose for the final hour, and the pellets were washed three times and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved on 5-15% SDS-PAGE gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. After blocking in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, NaCl 150 mM, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2.5% bovine serum albumin, membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibody, washed, incubated with 1/1000 dilution of Amersham sheep anti-mouse Fc horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody, washed, and developed by ECL (Amersham). Confluent 60-mm dishes of HIRcB cells were serum-starved for 24 h and labeled with 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate/dish for 4 h. During the final hour of labeling, 20 μM PD098059 with 1% Me2SO, or 1% Me2SO alone, was added. After labeling, cells were stimulated with 17 nM insulin for the indicated times, and quantitation of p21ras-bound GTP and GDP was performed essentially as described(20Gibbs J.B. Marshall M.S.

Medium was aspirated, and cells were washed twice in ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM Na3VO4. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, excess free nucleotides were removed by incubation with activated charcoal, and samples were frozen in a dry ice/methanol bath. After thawing at 37°C for 3 min, anti-Ras monoclonal rat antibody Y13-259 and protein A-agarose precoupled to rabbit anti-rat IgG were added for 1 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with lysis buffer lacking Nonidet P-40, and nucleotides were eluted in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.5 mM GTP, and 0.5 mM GDP by heating at 65°C for 5 min. Thin layer chromatography was performed on polyethyleneimine cellulose in 0.75 M KH2PO4, pH 3.4. Results were quantitated directly using a PhosphorImager. Growth factor-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of Sos is mediated by kinases downstream of Raf1 in the Raf1/MEK/MAP kinase cascade activated by p21ras(28Burgering B.M.T. Pronk G.J. van Weeren P.C. Chardin P. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To examine the role of Sos phosphorylation in insulin signaling, an inhibitor of MEK activity, PD098059, was used. This compound is relatively specific for MEK with no inhibitory activity against a number of other serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases(29Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation of HIRcB cells, a Rat1 fibroblast line expressing the human insulin receptor, resulted in a significant retardation of mobility of Sos on SDS-PAGE, reflecting Sos phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-6). This occurred first between 1 and 5 min of stimulation and was maximal by 10 min, decreasing somewhat by 120 min. The breadth of the Sos signal at 5 and 120 min may reflect a mix of more and less highly phosphorylated Sos phosphoprotein species, as Sos has at least two phosphorylation sites(30Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Grb2 has two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which bind to proline-rich regions in the C terminus of Sos(11Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 12Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation studies of Grb2 and Sos showed that Grb2/Sos complexes were present in the basal state, but after insulin treatment these complexes rapidly dissociated such that they were undetectable (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-6). Some reassociation was seen at the later time points as Sos became dephosphorylated. Pretreatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor prevented Sos phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, lanes 7-12) and Grb2/Sos dissociation (Fig. 1B, lanes 7-12). This strongly suggests that Sos phosphorylation causes dissociation of Sos from Grb2. This is further supported by the observation that the Sos which was complexed with Grb2 at 5 and 40 min showed only minimal mobility shift compared to total cellular Sos, suggesting that the Sos which remained bound to Grb2 represented a subpopulation of Sos that was less heavily phosphorylated. MAP kinase has been shown to phosphorylate Sos in vitro(30Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and there are several MAP kinase consensus phosphorylation sequences in the C terminus of Sos(31Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of Sos by MAP kinase may disrupt binding of Sos to the SH3 domains of Grb2. Insulin stimulation leads to binding of the Grb2 SH2 domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc, which plays a key role in insulin-stimulated mitogenesis, presumably by targeting Sos to the plasma membrane where it activates p21ras(19, 33, 34). Thus, the importance of Grb2/Sos dissociation may be that it decreases linkage of Sos to Shc. Consistent with this notion, Shc/Sos coprecipitation studies showed only a transient association, seen at 1 and 5 min and gone by 10 min (Fig. 1C, lanes 1-6), while in cells treated with PD098059, the Sos/Shc interaction persisted for 120 min (Fig. 1C, lanes 7-12). Shc/Grb2 coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed minimal or no basal coprecipitation; insulin treatment induced significant Shc/Grb2 association by 1 min, which was maximal by 5 min and unchanged thereafter, and was unaffected by the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 1D). As expected, Shc/Grb2 association correlated closely with the time course of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1E), which was also unaffected by the inhibitor. Thus, initial formation of the Shc/Grb2/Sos complex is caused by binding of preformed Grb2/Sos complexes to tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc. However, disassembly of the Shc/Grb2/Sos trimer is caused by rapid phosphorylation of Sos and dissociation of Sos from Grb2, leaving the Shc/Grb2 complex intact, while Sos becomes free (and presumably unable to activate p21ras). As Shc remains bound to Grb2, it is unavailable to bind to any residual free Grb2/Sos complexes, which might otherwise contribute to p21ras activation. MEK inhibition blocks Sos phosphorylation and Grb2/Sos dissociation, resulting in Shc/Grb2/Sos complexes persisting throughout insulin treatment. p21ras activation, as reflected by the percentage of the protein in the GTP-bound state, is transient, despite ongoing growth factor stimulation(10Chardin P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). p21ras activation by insulin in HIRcB cells was transient, with peak p21ras-GTP levels by 7 min and a subsequent rapid decline (Fig. 2). This correlates closely with the time course of Shc/Grb2/SOS association (Fig. 1C), which peaked at 5 min and fell by 10 min. In contrast, MEK inhibition resulted in prolonged stimulation of p21ras-GTP, with peak levels not seen until 15 min, and only a gradual decline thereafter. Taken together, the data strongly suggest that dissociation of SOS from Grb2 plays a key role in limiting the duration of activation of p21ras in response to ongoing insulin stimulation. This would be analogous to a negative feedback loop described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which glucose induced elevated levels of cAMP via a Ras/adenylyl cyclase pathway activated by the GEF Cdc25. The resultant rapid activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase then caused phosphorylation of Cdc25 and caused it to dissociate from Ras, resulting in Ras deactivation(35Gross E. Goldberg D. Levitzki A. Nature. 1992; 360: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Rat1 fibroblasts express ~105 EGF receptors/cell, and a similar analysis of the association patterns of Shc, Grb2, and Sos upon EGF stimulation was performed. EGF also caused Sos phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), and this was correlated with dissociation from Grb2 and from Shc (Fig. 3, B and C). The MEK inhibitor PD098059 prevented Sos phosphorylation, as well as dissociation of Sos from Grb2 and Shc ((Fig. 3, A-C). Interestingly, the association of Grb2 with Shc, illustrated in Fig. 3D, occurred rapidly but was not as sustained as it was with insulin stimulation (Fig. 1D). This may reflect down-regulation of the low number of endogenous EGFRs, and could explain why at 60 and 120 min there was only a minimal Sos mobility shift (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6), and significant Grb2/Sos reassociation (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). Furthermore, it explains why, in the presence of PD098059, Sos coprecipitation with Shc declines by 30 min (i.e. although Sos and Grb2 remain in a complex, much of Grb2 has dissociated from Shc). Interestingly, while some Grb2/Sos reassociation was seen at 40 and 120 min, there was no concomitant coprecipitation of Sos with Shc (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that only Grb2 already dissociated from Shc reassociated with Sos. Thus, the phenomenon of Sos phosphorylation, with Grb2/Sos complex dissociation reducing the duration of existence of the active Shc/Grb2/Sos complex, is also observed with signaling through the EGF receptor. Prolonged p21ras activation, either by oncogenic forms of p21ras(36Stacey D.M. Kung H.F. Nature. 1984; 310: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) or by activation of endogenous p21ras by the introduction of upstream activators such as membrane-targeted Sos (34Aronhein A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), is a transforming event that plays a significant role in many malignancies(37Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, tight control of p21ras activation is important in growth regulation. Growth factors typically cause a transient rise in p21ras-GTP formation and the subsequent fall back to base-line values serves to attenuate the hormonal signal, and may make cells refractory to subsequent growth factor stimulation. The current studies indicate that the mechanism underlying this attenuation process involves hyperphosphorylation of Sos on serine/threonine residues with subsequent dissociation of Grb2/Sos complexes; p21ras activates the MAP kinase pathway, and this feedback signal is generated from MEK or a serine/threonine kinase downstream of MEK. We thank L. Collins for assistance with the p21ras-GTP assay."

We demonstrate in this report that Vpr specifically activates HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-directed transcription. This effect is most pronounced on a minimal promoter from HIV-1 LTR containing the TATA box and binding motifs for the ubiquitous cellular transcription factor Sp1. Evidence is presented that Vpr interacts with Sp1 when Sp1 is bound to the Sp1 motifs within the HIV-1 LTR. Both Vpr-Sp1 interaction and Vpr trans-activation require a central Leu/Ile-rich domain in Vpr. Our findings suggest that Vpr trans-activation through Sp1 is most critical for the immediate early transcription of HIV-1 when other positive regulators, such as NF-κB, are limited or inactive, a condition presumably present in vivo. By interacting with Sp1, Vpr also has the potential to influence cellular gene expression and cellular functions.

The hallmark of AIDS is the slow but progressive depletion of CD4+-T cells, a class of T cells crucial for immune functions. Depletion of CD4+-T cell results in immunodeficiency and AIDS-related disorders, including encephalopathy, dementia, and malignancies(1Levy J.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 189-289Crossref Google Scholar). Despite tremendous efforts in the past, the mechanism of these AIDS-related disorders has remained unclear. However, it is clear that these are a consequence of function of HIV-1 encoded gene products. For example, the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein was implicated to be involved in toxic effects on neuronal cells(2Giulian D. Wendt E. Vaca K. Noonan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2769-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently, the HIV-1 Vpr protein in peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected people was shown to activate HIV-1 replication in latently infected cells(3Levy D.N. Refaeli Y. MacGregor R.R. Weiner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10873-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 4Levy D.N. Refaeli Y. Weiner D.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect of Vpr was suggested to contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis in vivo.The HIV-1 genome encodes structural as well as regulatory gene products(5Greene W.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 453-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Cullen B. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 375-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, great efforts have been made toward understanding the function of the so-called accessory regulatory genes, namely vif, vpr, vpu and nef. These genes are generally non-essential for HIV-1 to replicate in activated T cells. Yet, animal model studies with two of these genes, vpr and nef, suggested that they are required for in vivo replication and pathogenesis of the simian immunodeficiency virus(7Lang S.M. Weeger M. Stahl-Hennig C. Coulibaly C. Hunsmann G. Muller J. Muller-Hermelink H. Fuchs D. Wachter H. Daniel M.M. Desrosiers R.C. Fleckenstein B. J.

Cell. 1991; 65: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). The paradox between HIV-1 replication in vitro and that in vivo suggests that HIV-1 replication may be subjected to different modes of regulation in vivo compared to in vitro. For example, in vitro studies have shown that HIV-1 replication is highly dependent on cellular activation and availability of activated NF-κB transcription factor(5Greene W.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 453-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Cullen B. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 375-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Virelizier J.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1990; 2: 409-413Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, in vivo, the majority of the susceptible cells are immunologically quiescent and do not have a high level of NF-κB activity to support a productive HIV-1 replication. Nevertheless, HIV-1 replication in vivo has been demonstrated to be relatively rapid(10Ho D.D. Neumann A.U. Perelson A.S. Chen W. Leonard J.M. Markowitz M. Nature. 1995; 373: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar).To understand the role of HIV-1 accessory regulatory genes during HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis, we focused on the vpr gene product, which is a 96-aa protein produced late in the virus life cycle and assembled into the virion through binding to Gag(11Wong-Staal F. Chanda P.K. Ghrayeb J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1987; 3: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12Yuan X. Matsuda Z. Matsuda M. Essex M. Lee T.H. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Cohen E.A. Dehni G. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3097-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Function of Vpr appears to be critical for HIV-1 to replicate in macrophages(14Balotta C. Lusso P. Crowley R. Gallo R.C. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4409-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, the effect of Vpr on HIV-1 replication is difficult to detect(15Dedera D. Hu W. Vander-Heyden N. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3205-3208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our earlier studies and results from others showed that Vpr has a tendency to localize in the nucleus (16Zhao L.-J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lu Y.-L. Spearman P. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6542-6550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without utilizing a classical nuclear localization signal(16Zhao L.-J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the notion that Vpr may play a role during the nuclear migration of the pre-integration complex (18Heinzinger N.K. Bukrinsky M.I. Haggerty S.A. Ragland A.M. Kewalramani V. Lee M.-A. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. Stevenson M. Emerman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7311-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). However, they were also consistent with the hypothesis that Vpr can function in the nucleus to trans-activate HIV-1(19Cohen E.A. Terwilliger E.F. Jalinoos Y. Proulx J. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 1990; 3: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that Vpr trans-activates HIV-1 LTR through interaction with the cellular transcription factor Sp1. Sp1 is an O-glycosylated transcription factor which binds to decanucleotide Sp1 motifs (consensus core sequence: GGGCGG) through three zinc finger domains (20Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R.

It is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in transcription of a variety of cellular genes including the proto-oncogenes Ha-ras-1 (23Ishii S. Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Brady J.N. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Science. 1986; 232: 1410-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and pim-1(24Meeker T.C. Loeb J. Ayres M. Sellers W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purified Sp1 protein was shown to bind to all three Sp1 motifs within the HIV-1 LTR(25Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). We found that Vpr trans-activation was more dramatic when the transcriptional activity of HIV-1 LTR was lower. Our results are consistent with the notion that Vpr function is most critical for the immediate early transcription of HIV-1 when other positive regulators, such as NF-κB, are limited or inactive, a condition presumably present in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Constructs and Transcription TemplatesThe EcoRI/HindIII fragment of the plasmid pU3RCATIII, 2C.-Z. Giam, unpublished data. containing the HIV-1 LTR plus 500-base pair cellular sequence, was cloned into pUC18 vector to generate pUC-HIV-1-LTR, which was digested with EcoRI/NdeI and used as the LTR transcription template (Fig. 1A). To obtain the NF-κB+Sp1 template (Fig. 1A), the pUC-HIV-1-LTR was digested with ScaI (immediately upstream of the NF-κB motifs) and PvuI (in the pUC18 vector). The three Sp1 motifs together with the first 82-base pair transcribed region of the HIV-1 LTR was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned at the EcoRI/HindIII sites of pUC18 to generate plasmid pUC-Sp1-LTR, which was digested with EcoRI/PvuI to generate the Sp1 template. Sequence from the TATA box to position +82 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned the same way as pUC-Sp1-LTR to generate pUC-TATA-LTR, which was digested with EcoRI/PvuI to serve as the TATA template. Plasmid pDN-AdML (26Conaway J.W. Travis E. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the TATA box basal promoter region of the adenovirus major late promoter was digested with EcoRI and NdeI to generate a 270-base transcript.The p3×Sp1-CAT plasmid was obtained by insertion of the EcoRI-HindIII region of pUC-Sp1-LTR plasmid into a vector containing the CAT reporter gene. The vpr(wt) gene in pET-vpr(wt) was transferred to the RSV-HnefPFH plasmid (16Zhao L.-J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate RSV-vpr(wt) plasmid. The construction of RSV-vpr-LR-mu and RSV-S-vpr-T has been described(16Zhao L.-J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Cell Culture, Preparation of Nuclear Extracts, and TransfectionHeLa cells were grown in suspension medium (Joklik's modified minimal essential medium, Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 5% horse serum. CEM×174 and U937 cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 and 20% fetal bovine serum, respectively. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cell lines according to established procedures (32Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar) except KCl was used to replace NaCl. CEM×174 cells were transfected with 3 μg of the p3×Sp1-CAT plasmid in the presence or absence of activator plasmids by using the DEAE-dextran method, and CAT assay was performed at 48 h post-transfection with a reaction time of 8 h following established protocols(29Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).In Vitro Transcription ReactionIn vitro transcription reaction was carried out as described (22Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) using 1 μg of template DNA and radiolabeled UTP. All Vpr related proteins were purified as described before(16Zhao L.-J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription reaction was carried out in a 50-μl volume with 20 μl of the crude nuclear extract (approximately 200 μg of total protein) at 30°C for 45 min. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of a buffer containing 0.6 M sodium acetate, 2 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 20 mM EDTA, and then extracted with phenol twice and precipitated with ethanol. The precipitated RNA was dissolved in a formamide loading buffer, electrophoresed on a sequencing gel, and transcription activity was quantitated with the help of a PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics).Gel Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Co-precipitation AssayConditions for gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay was essentially as described(29Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins and radiolabeled probes were incubated in a 10-μl volume for 30 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μM zinc sulfate, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and then loaded to a 6% polyacrylamide gel prepared with a Tris glycine buffer(29Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). PolydI•polydC was used at 500 ng/ml as a nonspecific competitor. The Sp1 protein was purified by Promega following established protocols (20Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), involving wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography followed by a Sp1-specific DNA column chromatography. For co-precipitation assay, Sp1-DNA complexes were assembled as per gel shift assay. Then the volume was diluted to 100 μl with the incubation buffer containing 20 μl of the Flag IgG-Affi-Gel (16Zhao L.-J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which recognizes the Flag tag at the C terminus of Vpr-T. After shaking at 4°C for 30 min, the Affi-Gel beads were washed and bound probe eluted with a TE buffer containing 1 M NaCl. The probe was analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Alternatively, Sp1-DNA complex was assembled with 100 ng of unlabeled 3×Sp1 oligo (Fig. 1B), and the co-precipitated proteins examined by Western blot with the Flag antibody (16Zhao L.-J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the Sp1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, CA) following conditions as described(29Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad.

To examine this possibility, we performed in vitro transcription experiments with the HIV-1 LTR template and purified Vpr-T which carries a C-terminal tag (14Balotta C. Lusso P. Crowley R. Gallo R.C. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4409-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The LTR template was prepared by digestion of the plasmid pUC-HIV-1-LTR with restriction enzymes such that a 293-base run-off transcript could be generated. With nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa, CEM×174, and U937 cell lines, Vpr-T increased HIV-1 LTR-directed transcription by more than 100% (Fig. 2, A and B). The transcript was RNA-polymerase II-derived since it was specifically inhibited by α-amanitin (data not shown). In addition, as described next, progressive deletion of HIV-1 LTR also progressively reduced this transcriptional activity.Figure 2In vitro trans-activation of the HIV-1 LTR by Vpr. A, in vitro transcription with nuclear extracts prepared from different cell lines. Where indicated, HIV-1 Vpr-T protein (16Zhao L.-J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol.

B quantitation of transcripts by PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Values were graphed as when the activity in lane 1 of A was normalized to 100. C, in vitro transcription with templates (Fig. 1A) indicated on the right-hand side. Upper panel, transcription with 0.5 μg each of the LTR template and the NF-κB+Sp1 template. Lower panel, transcription with 0.5 μg each of the LTR template and the Sp1 template. Both the Sp1+NF-κB template and the Sp1 template yielded a 202-base transcript. Lanes 2-5 contained 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 μg of Vpr-T, respectively. D quantitation of transcripts in C the same way as in B. Activation index was expressed as the gain in transcription in the presence of Vpr-T divided by the control transcription without Vpr-T.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The HIV-1 LTR contains as positive regulatory elements two binding motifs for the transcription factor NF-κB followed by three binding motifs for the Sp1 transcription factor(5Greene W.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 453-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Cullen B. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 375-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To decipher which region of the HIV-1 LTR mediated response to Vpr-T, three templates containing: (a) NF-κB and Sp1 motifs (NF-κB+Sp1 template), (b) Sp1 motifs (Sp1 template), or (c) neither NF-κB nor Sp1 motifs (TATA template), were prepared (Fig. 1A). These templates produced a shorter mRNA transcript than the full-length LTR template, and were individually mixed with the LTR template in equal molar amounts for in vitro transcription with different amounts of Vpr-T. It was clear that the NF-κB+Sp1 template and the Sp1 template were both responsive to Vpr-T (Fig. 2, C and D) while the TATA template had no detectable basal activity and no Vpr response (data not shown). Among the three templates shown (Fig. 1A), the Sp1 template had the lowest level of basal activity (Fig. 2C, lane 1). However, it was activated by Vpr the most: the maximum gain in transcription reached 400% (Fig. 2D). Thus, it seemed that the Sp1 motifs in HIV-1 LTR were sufficient to confer Vpr response. Comparison between the results from the NF-κB+Sp1 template and the Sp1 template suggested that presence of NF-κB in the promoter reduced Vpr trans-activation. Thus, the NF-κB activation pathway appears not to be targeted by Vpr. Consistent with this analysis, when the two NF-κB motifs in HIV-1 LTR were cloned immediately upstream of the TATA box, at position −40 of the HIV-1 LTR (refer to Fig. 1), the resulting template did not respond to Vpr (data not shown).Control experiments were carried out with two other Vpr-related proteins: the authentic Vpr (Vpr(wt)), and the Vpr-T mutant: Vpr-LR-mu which contains a mutation of 8 aa residues in the Leu/Ile-rich domain (LR-domain, aa numbers 60-81) of Vpr(16Zhao L.-J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this experiment, the Sp1 template was used alone. It was clear that the authentic Vpr(wt) activated transcription of the Sp1 template to the same extent as Vpr-T while the ability of the Vpr-LR-mu protein to trans-activate was impaired (Fig. 3, A and B). We noticed that under this condition the maximum Vpr trans-activation was lower than when the Sp1 template and the LTR template were used together (Fig. 2C, lower panel). Thus, it seemed that the LTR template competed for the basal transcription machinery much more efficiently than the Sp1 template when Vpr was absent. However, when Vpr was present, the Sp1 template gained a competitive advantage.Figure 3Specificity of Vpr trans-activation. A transcription reaction was carried out with 0.25, 0.5, and 1 μg of Vpr-T (lanes 2-4), Vpr(wt) (lanes 5-7), and Vpr-LR-mu (lanes 8-10) using 1 μg of the Sp1 template. B the highest activation indices observed for the three Vpr proteins were plotted for comparison. C transcription reaction with 0.5 μg each of the Sp1 template and the AdML template. D activation indices for both templates at different Vpr-T concentrations were plotted for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A template containing the TATA box basal promoter of adenovirus major late promoter (AdML) was also mixed with the Sp1 template in equal molar amounts and tested for potential activation by Vpr-T. As Fig. 3C shows, the Sp1 template gave a much higher level response to Vpr-T than the AdML template, although the latter template was also significantly activated by Vpr-T. Inspection of the AdML sequence revealed two blocks of GC-rich sequences surrounding the TATA box(26Conaway J.W. Travis E. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary studies suggested that Sp1 could bind to these sequences (data not shown). Thus, it may be possible that the observed activation of AdML promoter by Vpr also involved Sp1 binding to AdML. This may be in contrast to an earlier report which showed that Sp1 significantly activated a promoter in the absence of an identifiable Sp1 motif (27Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).Protein-Protein Interaction between Vpr and the Ubiquitous Transcription Factor Sp1Many transcription activators, such as the herpes simplex virus Vp16 (28Triezenberg S.J. LaMarco K.L. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 730-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and the HTLV-I Tax(29Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), function by targeting specific transcription factors bound to upstream promoter elements. Since the Sp1 motifs were sufficient to confer Vpr response, we examined if Vpr can directly target the cellular transcription factor Sp1. Sp1 is an O-glycosylated transcription factor which binds to decanucleotide Sp1 motifs (consensus core sequence: GGGCGG) through three zinc finger domains(20Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R.

It is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in transcription of a variety of cellular genes including the proto-oncogenes Ha-ras-1 (23Ishii S. Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Brady J.N. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Science. 1986; 232: 1410-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and pim-1(24Meeker T.C. Loeb J. Ayres M. Sellers W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purified Sp1 protein was shown to bind to all three Sp1 motifs within the HIV-1 LTR(25Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). These Sp1 motifs were synthesized as a double-stranded oligonucleotide (3×Sp1, Fig. 1B), radiolabeled, and used in a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay with purified Sp1 protein and Vpr-T (Fig. 4A). Under the limiting concentration of purified Sp1 protein, Sp1 bound to the probe and generated a predominant Sp1-probe complex which was most likely due to Sp1 binding to one Sp1 motif in the probe (lane 1). In addition, a weak band corresponding to Sp1 binding to two motifs was also visible. The Sp1-probe complex was recognized by a monoclonal Sp1 antibody (lane 7). Interestingly, inclusion of Vpr-T also caused a mobility shift of the Sp1-probe complex (lane 2). Since Vpr-T itself did not bind to DNA (lane 8), it seemed possible that Vpr-T physically incorporated into the Sp1-probe complex. Alternatively, Vpr-T induced Sp1 binding to more Sp1 motifs in the probe. Incubation of the Vpr-T-induced complex with the Flag IgG-Affi-Gel for the tag in Vpr-T (16Zhao L.-J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) depleted this complex (data not shown), suggesting that the first possibility was correct. This interpretation was also supported by the co-precipitation results (see next).Figure 4Vpr-Sp1 interaction. A gel mobility shift assay with Sp1 protein (25 ng, Promega) for lanes 1-7 and 9-14, and ATF-1 protein19 (25 ng) for lanes 15 and 16. Sp1 Ab is a mouse monoclonal for Sp1 (1 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The assay (10 μl) contained 0.1 ng of labeled probe and 5 ng of polydI•polydC under a condition as described earlier(29Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Human Sp1 protein was purified from HeLa cells by Promega following an established protocol(20Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The probe sequences are listed in Fig. 1B. B co-precipitation of the 3×Sp1 probe, but not the Sp1(I) probe, with Sp1 and Vpr-T by the Flag antibody Affi-Gel (IBI) that recognizes the C-terminal tag in Vpr-T. Lane 1 shows 20% of the input probe mixture without precipitation. Radioactive bands in between the two probes and below the Sp1(I) probe are single-stranded oligos. C co-precipitation as in B except unlabeled 3×Sp1 oligo (100 ng) was used and the precipitated proteins examined by Western blot with Sp1 antibody and the Flag antibody. Lane 1 was 100% of the input proteins directly examined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the same assay, the authentic Vpr(wt) protein also induced a mobility shift of the Sp1-probe complex (Fig. 4A, lane 5). The apparently higher efficiency of Vpr(wt) was most likely due to the higher amount of Vpr(wt) used as compared to Vpr-T, since doubling the amount of Vpr-T also generated the same pattern. The Vpr-LR-mu protein, which failed to trans-activate the Sp1 template (Fig. 3A), had a severely reduced activity (lane 3) and VprΔ43-96 had no significant activity (lane 4). Interestingly, the SIVmac Vpr protein (S-Vpr-T) expressed and purified the same way as HIV-1 Vpr-T(16Zhao L.-J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not active (lane 6), suggesting that there is a host specificity in the Sp1 protein or a viral specificity in the Vpr protein. The potential existence of host specificity in Sp1 was consistent with the observation that with a HeLa nuclear extract S-Vpr-T did not trans-activate either HIV-1 LTR or SIVmac LTR, while HIV-1 Vpr trans-activated both templates (data not shown). With a control system, the ATF-1 (29Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) bound to the cyclic AMP-responsive element (Fig. 4A, lane 15), but was not affected by Vpr-T (lane 16).The Vpr-Sp1 interaction was further examined by co-immunoprecipitation assays. First, the DNA-protein complex formed as per the gel shift assay was co-precipitated by the Flag IgG-Affi-Gel which recognizes the C-terminal tag in Vpr-T(16Zhao L.-J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitated DNA probe was examined by gel analysis and autoradiography. It was clear that the probe was co-precipitated only with Vpr-T (Fig. 4B, lane 3), but not with Vpr-LR-mu (lane 4) or S-Vpr-T (lane 5). Second, the Sp1 protein and Vpr-T protein were directly mixed and then co-precipitated with the Flag IgG-Affi-Gel. The precipitated proteins were examined for the presence of Vpr-T and Sp1 proteins by Western blot. Under this condition, Sp1 and Vpr-T did not co-precipitate (data not shown). However, when during the co-precipitation an excess of unlabeled 3×Sp1 oligo was included, Sp1-Vpr-T co-precipitation was observed (Fig. 4C, lane 3). Under this condition, Sp1 did not co-preci"

Cardiac Na+ channels are responsible for the rapid, depolarizing upstroke in the cardiac action potential. Their function is critical for the rapid spread of depolarization through the heart and, ultimately, for cardiac contractility. Cardiac Na+ channels have properties that distinguish them from other well characterized voltage-dependent Na+ channels. They are less sensitive to tetrodotoxin (Baer et al., 1976), and their kinetics of activation and inactivation are slower and more complex (Brown et al., 1981). A Na+ channel α subunit cDNA encoding this channel has been isolated from newborn rat heart (rH1) 1The abbreviation used is: rH1α subunit of rat cardiac Na+ channels. (Rogart et al., 1989) and denervated rat skeletal muscle (Skm2, Kallen et al.(1990)) and a closely related Na+ channel has been isolated from human cardiac muscle (Gellens et al., 1992). Expression of these α subunit cDNAs in Xenopus oocytes (Cribbs et al., 1990; White et al., 1991; Gellens et al., 1992) and mammalian cells (Qu et al., 1994; O'Leary and Horn, 1994) yields Na+ currents with functional properties and tetradotoxin sensitivity characteristic of the native cardiac Na+ channel. α subunit of rat cardiac Na+ channels. In electric eel electroplax, Na+ channels are composed of a single large α subunit with a molecular mass of 230-270 kDa (Agnew et al., 1980; Miller et al., 1983; Norman et al., 1983). The major form of the Na+ channel in rat brain is a heterotrimeric complex of an α subunit (260 kDa), a noncovalently bound β1 subunit (36 kDa), and a disulfide-linked β2 subunit (33 kDa) (Catterall, 1992). Na+ channels in rat skeletal muscle are heterodimeric, composed of an α subunit and only one β subunit (Barchi, 1983; Kraner et al., 1985) which is encoded by the same gene as the brain β1 subunit (Makita et al., 1994). Currents due to brain or skeletal muscle Na+ channel α subunits expressed alone by injection of mRNA in Xenopus oocytes are small and have abnormally slow kinetics (Auld et al., 1988; Krafte et al., 1988; Joho et al., 1990; Krafte et al., 1990). Coexpression of the β1 subunit increases channel expression, shifts the gating mode from slow to fast, speeds activation and inactivation kinetics, and causes a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation (Isom et al., 1992; Cannon et al., 1993; Makita et al., 1994; Patton et al., 1994; Isom et al., 1995). Thus, β1 subunits both modify the functional properties of brain and skeletal muscle Na+ channels and increase the efficiency of their expression. The role of the β1 subunit in the heart has been less clear. Initial studies using subunit-specific antibodies identified the β1 subunit polypeptide in the heart (Sutkowski and Catterall, 1990). β1 subunit mRNA also has been identified in heart (Isom et al., 1992; Tong et al., 1993; Yang et al., 1993; Makita et al., 1994) and cDNAs homologous to the rat brain β1 transcript have been cloned from rat cardiac muscle (Bennett et al., 1993; McClatchey et al., 1993; Yang et al., 1993). The human and rat cardiac β1 cDNAs are identical in sequence to their brain counterparts (Makita et al., 1994). 2L. Isom, unpublished results. However, purified preparations of cardiac Na+ channels from chicken and rat do not have associated β1 subunits (Lombet and Lazdunski, 1984; Cohen and Levitt, 1993), and there have been conflicting reports concerning the functional significance of β1 subunits in the heart. Yang et al.(1993) reported no effect of β1 expression, while Kyle et al.(1993) observed a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation as a result of β1 coexpression. In these experiments, we have investigated whether β1 subunit mRNA is expressed in cardiac muscle cells using in situ hybridization, and we have examined the functional role of β1 subunits in modulating cardiac Na+ channel expression and kinetics by coexpression of mRNA for α and β1 subunits in Xenopus oocytes. We report that β1 subunit mRNA is expressed in cardiac muscle cells in vivo. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes in conjunction with the rH1 α subunit, β1 subunits substantially increase Na+ channel expression, but have no detectable effects on physiological properties. Thus, β1 subunits are likely to be important determinants of the level of functional expression of Na+ channels in cardiac cells, but do not alter their physiological properties significantly. A full-length cDNA encoding the rH1 Na+ channel α subunit was assembled in pBluescript SK+ by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of cDNA fragments using primers designed from the rH1 sequence (Rogart et al., 1989; Qu et al., 1994). 3J. Rogers, T. Tanada, and W. A. Catterall, unpublished results. The full-length α subunit cDNA was then cloned into the BglII site of pSP64T. The oocyte expression vector pβ1.SP64T was constructed as described previously (Patton et al., 1994). Both vectors contained only the coding sequence of the cDNAs. The deletion mutant β1 ΔVal138-Ser159 was constructed by first removing a portion of the 5′-untranslated region of pβ1.C1Aa (Isom et al. 1992) by deletion of nucleotides 1 through 175. This region is predicted to contain stem-loop structures which may decrease the efficiency of β1 expression (Patton et al., 1994). Single stranded DNA was prepared by interference helper phage VCS-M13 infection of XL1-blue transformants (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and served as template for oligonucleotide-directed “loop out” deletion mutagenesis. A 36-base “clamp” oligonucleotide was designed to anneal to two segments of the sense strand template which flanked the region to be deleted. In vitro mutagenesis reactions were performed as described for the Sculptor™ IVM system (Amersham Corp.). The resulting mutant phagemid contained a 66-base pair deletion of the nucleotides encoding Val138 through Ser159. The deleted amino acids are located in the extracellular domain of the β1 polypeptide, adjacent to the proposed transmembrane segment, and do not contain a putative glycosylation site. pSP64T.rH1.2 was linearized with NotI and pβ1.C1Aa was linearized with EcoRI and transcription was performed using the Ambion SP6 mMessage mMachine kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of the RNA from each transcription reaction was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the RNA dissolved in nuclease-free water for oocyte injection. Ovarian lobes were removed from adult female Xenopus laevis and the follicular layers were digested using collagenase (2.3 mg/ml, Sigma, Type I) dissolved in OR-2 (82.5 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5). After digestion, healthy oocytes were manually selected based upon size and uniformity of color and incubated at 18°C in Barth's medium (88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 0.82 mM MgSO4, 0.33 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mM CaCl2, 2.4 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 5% fetal bovine serum). Twenty-four h after collagenase digestion, oocytes were again selected and injected with the mRNA mentioned above. The oocytes were studied 3 days after injection. For two-microelectrode voltage-clamp experiments, the oocytes were continuously perfused at room temperature (23-25°C) with Ringer's solution (115 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2). Whole cell Na+ currents were studied using the conventional two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique (Patton and Goldin, 1991) with a CA-1 amplifier (DAGAN). For cell-attached macropatch recordings, oocytes were first manually stripped with fine forceps under a dissecting microscope after shrinking with a hypertonic solution (200 mM potassium aspartate, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4-7.5; Methfessel et al.(1986)). During recordings, the oocytes were bathed in a high K+ solution (110 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) to bring the membrane potential to approximately 0 mV. The electrode tip was coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning) and filled with 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (tip resistance 0.5-1 mΩ). Macropatch current was recorded in the cell-attached configuration (Hamill et al., 1981) using an AxoPatch-1C amplifier (Axon Instruments). The voltage-clamp protocols are described in figure legends or corresponding text. Conductance-voltage (g-V) relationships were calculated from current-voltage (I-V) relationships according to g = I/(V-Vr), where I is the peak current measured at voltage V and Vr is the measured reversal potential. Normalized conductance-voltage relationships and inactivation curves were fit with a Boltzmann distribution, 1/(1 + exp[(V-V1/2)/k]), where V1/2 is the voltage of half-activation or half-inactivation and k is a slope factor. Pooled data are reported as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test, with p < 0.05 taken as the critierion of significance. A probe for in situ hybridization analysis of cardiac β1 subunit mRNA expression was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the following conditions: 1 ng of human genomic DNA template, 4 mM each primer (forward: GGGCTGCGTGGAGGTGG, reverse: TCTTGTGCAGCAGCTTC), 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 200 mM each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Cetus). The amplification was performed as follows: 1 min at 90°C; 1 min 15 s at 50°C; 2 min at 72°C for 40 cycles followed by 10 min at 72°C and stopping of the reaction at 4°C. The resulting 527-nucleotide polymerase chain reaction product was sequenced using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), subcloned into pBluescript SK+, and linearized with the appropriate restriction endonucleases to generate sense and antisense probe templates, respectively. This sequence was identical to that reported previously for rat brain β1 (Isom et al., 1992) except for the following changes: A for G at residue 312, T for A at residue 484, T for C at residue 629, and T for G at residue 753. Transcription reactions were carried out with either T3 or T7 RNA polymerase incorporating digoxigenin-11-UTP and quantitated according to the Genius System product literature (Boehringer Mannheim). In situ hybridization of free-floating sections was carried out using modifications of methods described previously (Miller et al., 1989; Black et al., 1994). Briefly, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized using sodium pentabarbitol, the heart was removed, immediately frozen in powdered dry ice, and stored at −70°C. Sagittal sections (40 μm) through the long axis of the heart were cut on a sliding microtome and then placed into 4% paraformaldehyde fixative for 45 min. Tissue sections were then rinsed in 0.05 M phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, water for 2 min, 0.1 M triethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 2 min and then in 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine for 10 min to reduce nonspecific binding. The tissue sections were then rinsed in 2 × SSC for 10 min, 70% ethanol for 2 min, 95% ethanol for 2 min, 100% ethanol for 2 min, 70% ethanol for 2 min, and finally in water for 2 min. Sections were prehybridized for 3 h at 42°C in a buffer containing 44.6% formamide, 8.9% dextran sulfate, 0.27 M NaCl, 7 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.7 mM EDTA, 0.9 × Denhardt's, 16 mM dithiothreitol, 0.45 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 4.6 × Genius Northern blocking solution (Boehringer Mannheim). The tissue was then transferred to hybridization solution containing 41% formamide, 8.2% dextran sulfate, 0.25 M NaCl, 6.5 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.66 mM EDTA. 0.82 × Denhardts, 14.8 mM dithiothreitol, 1.2 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 4.1 × Genius Northern blocking solution, and 7.5 μg/ml of the digoxigenin-labeled probe and incubated overnight at 42°C. Tissue sections were rinsed in 1 × standard sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC; Miller et al. 1989) for 30 min, treated with 25 μg/ml RNase A in RNase buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA) for 30 min, rinsed in 1 × SSC for 30 min, rinsed in 0.1 × SSC at 45°C for 40 min, rinsed in 0.1 × SSC at room temperature for 15 min, and then in 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 30 min. The tissue was then blocked using 10% normal sheep serum in 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature before being placed in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin F(ab) antibody (diluted 1:400 in 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline containing 10% normal sheep serum and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 24 h at room temperature. The tissue was then washed in 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline for 1 h followed by 1 h of rinsing in a solution containing 100 mM Tris, 50 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM NaCl, pH 9.5. The tissue was then reacted with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (0.45 mg/ml), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.175 mg/ml), and levamisole (0.24 mg/ml) in the reaction buffer, rinsed in stop buffer (10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 30 min and the free floating sections were finally mounted on gelatin-subbed slides, air dried, coverslipped using Biomeda gel mount (Fischer), and viewed using a Leitz Dialux microscope. Control experiments included omitting probes from hybridization solution and substituting sense probes for antisense probes. In addition, β1 antisense probe was hybridized to liver tissue to test for nonspecific labeling with the probe. No specific labeling was observed in the controls. β1 subunit mRNA and protein have been detected in the heart using immunoblotting and Northern blotting methods (Sutkowski and Catterall, 1990; Isom et al., 1992; Tong et al., 1993; Yang et al., 1993; Makita et al., 1994), but it is not known whether this β1 mRNA is in the neurons resident in the heart or in the cardiac myocytes themselves. The cellular distribution of sodium channel β1 subunit mRNA was examined in heart using non-isotopic in situ hybridization methods. At high magnification there is positive staining of muscle cells in regions of the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus (Fig. 1, A-C). No staining was observed when the sense probe was used or when no probe was added to the hybridization solution (Fig. 1D). As a further control, liver tissue was also stained with the β1 probe and, as expected, there was no staining. Lower magnification views show that β1 is expressed in myocytes throughout the heart with the most prominent staining located in the papillary muscles of the ventricles. These results demonstrate the presence of β1 mRNA within most cardiac muscle cells. To investigate the functional consequences of coexpression of β1 subunits with cardiac rH1 α subunits, we injected mRNAs encoding the two subunits into Xenopus oocytes. Na+ currents in the oocytes were measured 72 h after mRNA injection using two-microelectrode voltage clamp. At a single concentration of α subunit, Na+ currents were dramatically larger at all test potentials in oocytes coinjected with β1 subunit mRNA (Fig. 2). To examine the concentration dependence of this increase in Na+ current amplitude, β1 RNA was injected at concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 ng/μl with a constant 25 ng/μl of α subunit RNA. The amplitude of the expressed Na+ current increased as the amount of β1 RNA injected was increased (Fig. 3A). No current was observed when β1 subunits were injected in the absence of the α subunit. These results were obtained in one series of oocytes injected simultaneously and studied at times ranging from 62 to 78 h after injection. Similar results were obtained in two other experimental series of this kind. Significant increases in Na+ channel current amplitude were observed at a β1:α RNA molar ratio of 5:3. The observed increase in current amplitude saturated at a β1:α RNA molar ratio of 50:1, with a half-maximal increase at a β1:α molar ratio of 10:1 (equivalent to a weight ratio of 2:1). The maximal increase in current induced by β1 subunit RNA coinjection was 3-6-fold, depending on the batch of oocytes (mean = 5.2 ± 1.4-fold, n = 22 oocytes). This is comparable to the increase observed when rat brain type IIA Na+ channel α subunits were coinjected with β1 subunit mRNA in Xenopus oocytes (Isom et al., 1992) and to the increase in [3H]saxitoxin binding observed as a result of type IIA α subunit and β1 subunit coexpression in transfected mammalian cells (Isom et al., 1994). An alternative explanation for the observed increase in Na+ current amplitude is that β1 subunit mRNA may exert nonspecific effects on Na+ channel expression or mRNA expression in general. To examine that possibility, a deletion mutant of rat brain β1 (β1ΔVal138-Ser159) was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The functional effects of this mutant β1 subunit were tested by coinjecting it with the rat brain type IIA α subunit (β1:α molar ratio of 100:1). The macroscopic Na+ current time courses from oocytes injected with transcripts encoding the rat brain type IIA α subunit alone and in conjunction with β1ΔVal138-Ser159 were very similar. Current-voltage relationships, steady-state inactivation curves, and the time course of recovery from inactivation also were unaffected (data not shown). This indicates that β1ΔVal138-Ser159 is inactive, probably because it does not associate with the α subunit. Coinjection of β1ΔVal138-Ser159 with rH1 α subunit mRNA (10:1 molar ratio) caused no increase in current amplitude (Fig. 3B). Wild-type β1 subunits caused the normal increase in current amplitude in the same batch of oocytes (Fig. 3B). Similar results were observed in two other experiments. Thus, an active β1 subunit is necessary to observe the increase in current with β1 subunit RNA coinjection. Electrophysiological effects of the β1 subunit were examined by recording currents in Xenopus oocytes due to injection of the rH1 α subunit RNA alone or in combination with β1 subunit mRNA. To insure adequate time and voltage control, recordings were made of macroscopic currents in small membrane patches (macropatches) that allow excellent time and spatial control of membrane potential. The effect of β1 subunits on expression of functional Na+ channels was verified by contemporaneous two-microelectrode voltage clamp recordings from oocytes in the same batch used for kinetic comparisons. An average increase in current amplitude of 3-4-fold was observed in these β1-coinjected oocytes. Fig. 4A shows macropatch recordings from oocytes injected with α subunit RNA alone (500 ng, left panel) or in conjunction with β1 subunit RNA (100 ng of α, 200 ng of β1, right panel). Little overall difference in Na+ current kinetics was observed. To detect quantitative effects on current time course, normalized and averaged currents measured during test pulses to −60, −40, −20, or +20 mV were compared (Fig. 4B). Average time courses obtained with (dotted line) and without (solid line) coinjection of β1 subunit mRNA were virtually superimposable. Inactivation time courses at +20 mV with and without β1 were also compared by fitting the decaying phase of the current with 2 exponentials. In oocytes injected with α subunit RNA alone, the time constant of the fast component (τ1) was 0.42 ± 0.12 ms with an amplitude of 93% and the time constant of the slow component (τ2) was 3.4 ± 1.6 ms (n = 7). In oocytes coinjected with β1 subunit mRNA, τ1 was 0.48 ± 0.08 ms with an amplitude of 94% and τ2 was 2.9 ± 1.5 ms (n = 8). An unpaired Student's t test showed no significant difference with all three parameters (p > 0.05). Despite having large effects on Na+ current amplitude, coinjection of β1 subunits had little effect on current time course. Effects of β1 subunits on the voltage dependence of Na+ channel activation and inactivation were determined using both two-microelectrode and cell-attached patch recording configurations. Mean voltage dependence of Na+ current activation was unaffected by coexpression of the β1 subunit with the α subunit in cell-attached patches or in two-microelectrode recordings (Fig. 5, A and B). The voltage dependence of Na+ channel inactivation was determined using conditioning prepulses (98 ms long in cell-attached experiments, 500 ms long in two-microelectrode experiments) followed by a test depolarization. The mean voltage dependences of Na+ channel activation and inactivation were not significantly affected in either recording configuration due to coinjection of β1 subunit RNA (Fig. 5, A and B). The voltage dependences of activation and inactivation determined in the cell-attached configuration with or without β1 subunits were shifted negatively compared to two-microelectrode recordings as has been previously observed for the native cardiac channel (Kimitsuki et al., 1990). Recovery from inactivation was also studied in both the cell-attached and two-microelectrode recording configurations using double-pulse protocols. In the cell-attached configuration, Na+ channels were inactivated using a 16-ms conditioning pulse to −30 mV. The membrane potential was then returned to −120 mV to allow channels to recover from inactivation. The degree of recovery was assessed at various recovery times with a test pulse to −30 mV. Recovery time courses at −120 mV determined by plotting normalized peak test pulse current versus recovery time were well fit with single exponentials (Fig. 5C). In oocytes injected with α subunit RNA alone, τ = 6.9 ± 1.8 ms, and in oocytes coinjected with β1 subunit mRNA, τ = 7.3 ± 1.4 ms (n = 4). For recovery experiments in the two-microelectrode configuration, the conditioning pulse was 5 s long and recovery was studied at −100 mV. Such a long prepulse is expected to generate both fast and slow inactivation of the Na+ channel. After such prepulses, fits of the recovery time course required two exponential components (Fig. 5D). In oocytes injected with α alone, the time constant of the fast component (τ1) was 5.5 ± 3.1 ms, and the time constant of the slow component (τ2) was 1010 ± 174 ms, with initial amplitudes, A1 and A2, of 52 and 48% respectively (n = 3). In oocytes coinjected with β1 subunit mRNA, τ1 was 6.0 ± 0.9, τ2 was 868 ± 163, with A1 and A2 each equaling 50% (n = 3). Differences between results with α alone and with β1 coinjection were insignificant (unpaired Student's t test, p > 0.05). Consistent with the lack of effect on recovery from inactivation, after a 10 Hz train of 20 15-ms long pulses to −10 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV, current was reduced to 92.4 ± 1.8% of its initial value with rH1 α alone and to 91.9 ± 1.9% with coinjection of β1 (n = 7). Again, these values were not significantly different from each other (p > 0.05). Thus, in oocytes where effects of β1 subunit RNA coinjection have been verified by recordings of significantly increased Na+ current levels, there was no significant difference in Na+ current time course, voltage dependence of activation, voltage dependence of inactivation, or recovery from inactivation when comparing Na+ currents due to injection of rH1 Na+ channel α subunit RNA alone or when coinjected with β1 subunit RNA. Our results show that β1 subunit mRNA is expressed in cardiac muscle cells as assessed by high resolution in situ hybridization. Thus, β1 subunits are available to modulate rH1 Na+ channels in vivo. These studies complement previous work showing that β1 subunit mRNA and protein are present in the heart without defining the cell-type expressing them (Sutkowski and Catterall, 1990; Isom et al., 1992; Tong et al., 1993; Yang et al., 1993; Makita et al., 1994). Coexpression of rH1 α subunits and β1 subunits in Xenopus oocytes substantially increases the level of Na+ currents. Since both β1 subunits and α subunits are present in cardiac myocytes, it is likely that β1 subunits associate with α subunits and increase the expression of functional Na+ channels in cardiac cells as well. Purified Na+ channels from chicken and rat heart do not have associated β1 subunits (Lombet and Lazdunski, 1984; Cohen and Levitt, 1993). However, β1 subunits dissociate easily from detergent-solubilized Na+ channels (Messner and Catterall, 1986) and therefore may have been lost in purification. Since the purified preparations of Na+ channels from heart have not been functionally reconstituted, it remains to be determined whether these preparations which appear to lack β1 subunits can function in voltage-activated ion conductance. Little effect of β1 subunits was observed on the kinetics and voltage dependence of expressed current. The lack of kinetic effects was consistent with effects of human heart β1 subunits on human heart Na+ channel α subunit (Makita et al., 1994). It differs from reports that coinjection of the rat brain β1 subunit RNA with the rat heart Na+ channel α subunit RNA causes a 3 or 6 mV depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation (Kyle et al., 1993; Makielski et al. 1995) and from a report that β1 subunits cause a 3-mV hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation (Nuss et al. 1995). These small differences in results may reflect differences in the details of the experimental procedures used in the different studies. Injection of cardiac (rH1) α subunit mRNA into oocytes gave currents with comparable kinetics and voltage dependence to Na+ currents in native cardiac myocytes (Satin et al., 1992). Recordings from our laboratory in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (Qu et al., 1994) gave half-activation values of −34 mV and half-inactivation values of −58 mV. Currents expressed in oocytes after injection of rH1 α subunit RNA were half-activated at −28 mV and half-inactivated at −52 mV (see Fig. 5B), only 6 mV more positive than Na+ currents in ventricular myocytes. These small differences contrast sharply with injection of brain or muscle Na+ channel α subunit RNA alone into Xenopus oocytes. Those currents exhibit abnormally slow kinetics and positively shifted voltage dependences of activation and inactivation which were normalized by coinjection of β1 subunits (Isom et al., 1992; Makita et al., 1994). Thus, β1 subunits have much more striking functional effects on brain and skeletal muscle Na+ channels than on cardiac Na+ channels. During development of both rat retinal ganglion cells and rat forebrain neurons in vivo, expression of β subunits and their assembly with α subunits is concurrent with a 5- to 10-fold increase in the number of Na+ channels (Wollner et al., 1988; Scheinman et al., 1989; Sutkowski and Catterall, 1990). Thus, expression and assembly of β subunits may be a rate-limiting step in Na+ channel expression. In addition, β1 subunits stabilize purified and reconstituted brain Na+ channels. Channel function was completely lost upon selective removal of β1 subunits (Messner and Catterall, 1986; Messner et al., 1986). Our results showing that coinjection of β1 subunit mRNA significantly increases heart Na+ channel expression in Xenopus oocytes are consistent with the hypothesis that β1 subunits are important for the biosynthesis, assembly, and stabilization of the cardiac Na+ channel in vivo.

Connective tissues are dominated by an extensive extracellular matrix. In cartilage, the matrix has an abundance of collagen II and aggrecan, the large aggregating proteoglycan. The extracellular matrix is also rich in smaller proteoglycans and other non-collagenous proteins. A few years ago, it was shown that one of the first sequenced smaller proteoglycans, decorin(1Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 2Patthy L. J. Mol.

Since then, the number of identified primary sequences for LRR proteins in connective tissues has increased.

Intra- and extracellular LRR-containing proteins are found in almost any system studied, e.g. in mammalian and plant cells, yeast, and prokaryotes(12Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The number of residues in a given LRR is between 20 and 29, and the consensus sequence derived from all known LRR proteins contains leucine or other aliphatic residues at positions 2, 5, 7, 12, 16, 21, and 24 and asparagine (B-type repeat), cysteine (A-type repeat), or threonine at position 10. Recently, the three dimensional structure of the LRR-containing porcine ribonuclease inhibitor was determined first for the protein and then for its complex with ribonuclease(13Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). It is likely that other LRR proteins may have a similar structure in their repeat region. The three-dimensional structure shows that each LRR is composed of a β-sheet and an α-helix. In the ribonuclease inhibitor, the β-sheets that form the consensus part of the LRR are arrayed on one face of the protein, while the less conserved helices are arrayed on the opposite face. LRR-containing proteins are known to participate in protein-protein interactions. The specificity and the diversity of the protein-protein interactions probably arise from the non-consensus residues. The protein described here was originally purified as a prominent component of bovine articular cartilage with a molecular mass of 58 kDa (14Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzén A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid composition of the 58-kDa protein was similar to that of fibromodulin, with a high content of leucine and aspartic acid/asparagine residues. The 58-kDa protein was also rich in proline. The proteins showed different ionic properties, with only fibromodulin binding to DEAE-cellulose. Studies of the distribution among tissues by radioimmunoassays showed that the protein was present in many types of cartilage and also in non-cartilage connective tissues such as aorta, sclera, cornea, kidney, liver, skin, and tendon. It was not detected in bone extracts. To further characterize the 58-kDa protein, we have determined its primary structure. This reveals that the protein belongs to the LRR family of connective tissue proteins with four potential N-linked glycosylation sites and, in contrast to those previously described, a rather basic N-terminal extension rich in arginine and proline. We therefore propose to refer to the protein as PRELP (proline arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein). PRELP was isolated from bovine articular cartilage according to the method described by Heinegård et al.(14Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzén A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of PRELP indicated that the N terminus was blocked. Several attempts were made to remove the putative N-terminal pyroglutamic acid by digestion with pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.19.3) using methods described by the supplier (Boehringer Mannheim). In no case were clear sequence data obtained, although there were indications that some cleavage had occurred in the N-terminal region, probably due to contamination with minor proteases. The possibility exists, therefore, that the protein is blocked in some other way, such as acylation. Peptides were isolated by digestion of purified protein with endoprotease Lys-C or endoprotease Glu-C (Boehringer Mannheim) at enzyme/substrate ratios of 1:25. Peptides were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described previously (6Neame P.J. Sommarin Y. Boynton R.E. Heinegård D. J. Biol.

Peptides were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 477A automated sequencer with on-line analysis of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives on an Applied Biosystems 120A microbore HPLC apparatus. Two-dimensional chromatography was performed on an endoprotease Lys-C digest by preceding the reversed-phase separation of peptides with a gel filtration step on Superdex 75 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 4 M guanidine HCl, 25 mM phosphate, pH 6.5. Peptides were isolated from individual fractions by reversed-phase HPLC. Chondrocytes from bovine tracheal cartilage were isolated by collagenase digestion(15Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from freshly isolated cells with guanidine isothiocyanate essentially according to Adams et al.(16Adams M.E. Huang D.Q. Yao L.Y. Sandell L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Primary bovine osteoblasts were prepared according to Robey and Termine(17Robey P.G. Termine J.D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Rat chondrosarcoma cells were provided by Dr. James Kimura (Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI). Total RNAs from these cells were extracted by the same method. Various tissues from an ˜2-trimester-old bovine fetus and calvariae from 5-day-old rats were homogenized, and total RNA was extracted similarly. Total RNA from isolated human articular chondrocytes was provided by Dr. Michael Bayliss (Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, London). cDNA synthesis on total RNA isolated from bovine tracheal chondrocytes with both oligo(dT) and random hexamers as primers and the first PCR amplification with degenerate primers were performed essentially as described by Lee and Caskey(18Lee C.C. Caskey C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The resulting mixture was diluted 100 times and run in a second PCR with nested degenerate primers under the same conditions. The PCR was run on a 1% agarose gel and isolated with a QIAEX gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.). The isolated cDNA was ligated into the pCR-Script SK(+) vector (Stratagene). The DNA sequence of the fragment was determined, and the resulting primary sequence was compared with the peptide sequences to verify that the amplified fragment represented a cDNA for PRELP. The PCR fragment corresponding to bovine PRELP was used as a probe for screening of cDNA libraries. Approximately 700,000 plaque-forming recombinants were screened from a bovine articular (19Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and 250,000 from a bovine tracheal (20Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol.

Approximately 250,000 plaque-forming recombinants were screened from a human articular chondrocyte λZAPII cDNA library (obtained through Dr. Michael Bayliss) (21Charles I.G. Palmer R.M.J. Hickery M.S. Bayliss M.T. Chubb A.P. Hall V.S. Moss D.W. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11419-11423Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) with several positive clones found. The pBluescript SK(+) plasmid containing the cDNA insert was rescued from the ZAP vector by the use of in vivo excision as described in the ZAP-cDNA® synthesis kit (Stratagene). The cDNA sizes were estimated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel after digestion with EcoRI or XhoI/XbaI. The longest clone (1.6 kbp) was purified with a Plasmid Midi kit (QIAGEN Inc.). The cDNA was digested to various lengths by the use of the Erase-a-Base® system (Promega). DNA sequencing was performed in full on both strands by standard double-stranded dideoxy termination sequencing using T3, T7, and synthetic internal specific primers. Keratanase digestion was performed with 4 milliunits of endo-β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.103; Boehringer Mannheim) in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.8, at 37°C for 1 h. N-Glycosidase (Boehringer Mannheim) digestion was performed by first denaturing the protein in 0.5% SDS, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol at 100°C for 3 min and then incubating with 0.24 unit of enzyme in 0.3 M NaH2PO2, pH 8.6, 15 mM 1,10-phenanthroline (monohydrate) in methanol and 1.9% Nonidet P-40 at 37°C overnight. Neuraminidase (from Vibrio cholerae; Boehringer Mannheim) digestion was performed in 50 mM sodium acetate, 4 mM CaCl2, pH 5.5, at 37°C for 30 min with 3 milliunits of enzyme. The protein was precipitated with 10 volumes of 95.5% ethanol at −20°C overnight. O-Glycosidase digestion was performed with 0.5 milliunit of O-glycosidase (glycopeptide α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, EC 3.2.1.97; bovine serum albumin-free, Boehringer Mannheim) in 20 mM Tris-H3PO4, pH 7.6, at 37°C for 3 h. The amount of protein was 10 μg in all digestions. After digestion, the samples were run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions using the procedure of Laemmli(22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250(23Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNAs from various tissues and species were run on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel. Northern blots were applied to a nitrocellulose filter (NitroPure, Micron Separations). The PCR-generated bovine cDNA fragment was random primer-labeled (Random Primed DNA Labeling kit, Boehringer Mannheim) with [α-32P]dCTP (Redivue™, Amersham Corp.). This probe was used for filters with bovine total RNA. A StyI fragment from the human cDNA of ˜0.6 kbp was used as probe for filters with rat or human total RNA. The Northern blot of human chondrocytes was washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. The Northern blot with various bovine fetus tissues was washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55°C. The other blots were washed in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55°C prior to detection of radiolabel with the FUJIX Bio-Imaging BAS2000 analyzer. The protein isolated from bovine articular cartilage was cleaved with endoprotease Lys-C. The resulting peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and the amino acid sequences were determined (Table 1). A data base search with the peptide sequences showed similarity to fibromodulin and biglycan. A number of the peptides could be aligned with similar regions of fibromodulin (data not shown). On the basis of the alignment of the peptides with fibromodulin, a set of nested degenerate PCR primers was designed (Table 2).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Total RNA from bovine tracheal chondrocytes was prepared and used for cDNA synthesis with both oligo(dT) and random hexamers as primers. The cDNA mixture was used for PCR amplification with degenerate primers, designed from the amino acid sequences. The resulting fragment (0.39 kbp) was isolated, ligated into pCR-Script, and sequenced. The translated primary structure of the fragment corresponded to peptide sequences and contained five LRRs with one potential N-linked glycosylation site (data not shown). Screening of cDNA libraries from bovine tracheal and articular chondrocytes with the bovine cDNA fragment gave no positive results. Therefore, a λZAP-cDNA library from human articular chondrocytes was screened with the same probe. Three clones with ˜1.6-kbp inserts and two containing 0.9-kbp inserts were isolated. One of the longer clones was chosen for sequencing. The resulting DNA sequence and the translated primary structure are shown in Fig. 1 and represent 382 amino acid residues, including a 20-residue signal peptide. This gives a calculated molecular mass of 41,646 Da for the mature protein. A polyadenylation signal is not present, which indicates that it is not a full-length clone and that the mRNA is further extended with noncoding sequence at the 3′-end. A prediction of the eukaryotic secretory signal sequence by the PC/GENE program indicated a putative cleavage site between amino acid residues 20 and 21 (Fig. 1). This site is in good agreement with the predicting rules proposed by Kozak (24Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4164) Google Scholar) and von Heijne(25von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3692) Google Scholar). The translated sequence of PRELP contains 10 well conserved LRRs (Table 3). These are ordered in a pattern with two longer repeats (24-26 amino acids) followed by a shorter repeat (20-21 amino acids), with some uncertainty regarding the length of the last repeat. The consensus sequences for the repeats are shown in Table 3. All the LRRs are B-type, with an asparagine residue at position 10.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequence contains four potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 1). After digestion with endoprotease Lys-C, three peptides (58-11, 58-12, and 58-13) (Table 1) were found that contained putative N-glycosylation sites. All of these gave blanks on sequence analysis that were consistent with N-glycosylation sites. A peptide obtained by digestion with endoprotease Glu-C (V8) that contained a putative N-glycosylation site (HLYLNNNSI) did not have a blank cycle on the second Asn, indicating that Asn300 is not substituted. There is some evidence for a substituent, possibly an O-linked oligosaccharide, on Thr23. A relatively high molecular mass peptide (10-15 kDa) could be isolated after digestion with endoprotease Lys-C. This peptide included the Thr residue and gave a blank on Edman degradation at this position. However, the background in the sequence data was high, and this peptide probably represented the blocked N-terminal peptide. A more detailed description of the N-terminal region of this protein will require further analysis. Removal of N-linked oligosaccharides by N-glycosidase digestion resulted in a band of ˜48 kDa in mobility (Fig. 2). Digestion with keratanase resulted in a small, but clearly visible shift on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, thus indicating the possible existence of keratan sulfate or polylactosamine on the protein (Fig. 2). O-Glycosidase digestion with and without prior digestion with neuraminidase resulted in no shift (data not shown), indicating the absence of O-glycosidically linked sugars. A comparison of the primary structures of PRELP and other LRR-containing connective tissue proteins was made. A dendrogram constructed using the pair group maximum averages method (26Wilbur W.J. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 27Sneath P.H.A. Sokal R.R. Numerical Taxonomy. Freeman Publications, New York1973Google Scholar) shows that PRELP has the highest similarity to fibromodulin and lumican (Fig. 3). The identity to human fibromodulin is 36% and to bovine lumican 33%. An alignment of human PRELP, human fibromodulin (SWISS-PROT accession no. Q06828), and bovine lumican (PIR accession no. A46743) by the method of Myers and Miller (28Myers E.W. Miller W. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 4. The proteins show a perfectly conserved cysteine pattern in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains. The proteins all contain 10 LRRs, with an Asn residue at position 10 in all the LRRs.Figure 4Alignment of PRELP (human origin), fibromodulin (human origin), and lumican (bovine origin). The conserved cysteine residues are indicated (⤉), and the potential N-glycosylation sites at identical sites in the three proteins are shown (). The lengths and numbers of the LRRs are indicated. Identical residues are shown by shaded boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern blotting of total RNA from bovine tracheal chondrocytes was performed, showing a single mRNA species of ˜3.8 kilobases (Fig. 5A). Since the isolated human cDNA did not correspond to this size, Northern blots from other species and tissues were tried. Hybridization to human articular chondrocytes in total RNA blots indicated two mRNA sizes, one of ˜1.8 kilobases and a fainter band slightly larger than the mRNA from bovine tracheal chondrocytes (Fig. 5A). Hybridization to total RNA isolated from rat chondrosarcoma cells resulted also in two sizes of mRNA, one of ˜1.6 kilobases and one slightly smaller than the mRNA from bovine tracheal chondrocytes (Fig. 5A), with the larger band produced in the highest amount. Total RNAs isolated from different tissues from a second trimester bovine fetus were probed in Northern blots. RNAs from articular and epiphyseal cartilage, trabecular bone, skin, kidney, liver, spleen, and thymus were included. mRNA for PRELP was only detected in articular and epiphyseal cartilage (Fig. 5B). A signal for PRELP message was also detected in total RNA isolated from primary cultures of bovine osteoblasts (Fig. 5A). No signal was detected in total RNA from calvariae of 5-day-old rats (Fig. 5A). The primary structure of mature human PRELP connective tissue protein represents 362 amino acid residues, which correspond to a calculated molecular mass of 41,646 Da. Laser desorption mass spectrometry indicates that the mass of the intact protein falls into a broad range of 52,000 ± 2500 Da. This difference in size compared with the protein isolated from articular cartilage is at least partly due to N-linked oligosaccharide modifications since N-glycosidase digestion of the protein resulted in an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa. The discrepancy in size of the protein after N-glycosidase digestion compared with the translated amino acid sequence is likely to be caused by the presence of other post-translational modifications of the protein. An indication of other modifications was obtained from a Lys-C digest that showed that the threonine at position 23 could not be detected by Edman degradation, indicating the presence of an O-glycosidically linked carbohydrate moiety. Direct analysis for O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides by enzyme digestion was, however, negative. The main part of PRELP consists of 10 LRRs. The β-sheet forming part of the repeats is highly conserved, whereas residues from position 15 in the repeats to the end of the repeats are less well conserved. The length of the repeats ranges from 20 to 26 residues. They show a periodicity beginning with two 24-26-residue-long repeats followed by a shorter 20-21-residue-long repeat. The end of the last repeat is, however, difficult to predict. This periodicity of the last is also present in fibromodulin, lumican, decorin, and biglycan. In analogy with the other related proteins(6Neame P.J. Sommarin Y. Boynton R.E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21547-21554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Neame P.J. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8653-8661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), disulfide bridges are likely in the amino-terminal part between cysteine residues at positions 53 and 69 and in the carboxyl-terminal part between cysteine residues at positions 312 and 353. Several other LRR-containing proteins show a similar pattern, with PRELP being most homologous to fibromodulin and lumican. Proteoglycan-Lb (7Shinomura T. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and osteoinductive factor (8Madisen L. Neubauer M. Plowman G. Rosen D. Segarini P. Dasch J. Thompson A. Ziman J. Bentz H. Purchio A.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) are shorter proteins with fewer LRRs, but with the same conserved cysteine residues in the amino-terminal part and a pair of cysteines in the carboxyl-terminal part. Chondroadherin diverges partly from this pattern of cysteines at its carboxyl-terminal end, with four cysteines forming two disulfide bridges(6Neame P.J. Sommarin Y. Boynton R.E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21547-21554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The post-translational modifications of the LRR-containing connective tissue proteins differ. All of them, except for chondroadherin, appear to have oligosaccharide substitutions, but with different content and in different numbers. Biglycan and decorin have two and one chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains, respectively, close to the amino terminus(30Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1993: 189-209Google Scholar). Fibromodulin and lumican have at least one and at the most four keratan sulfate chains positioned at the N-linked oligosaccharide substitutions(31Plaas A.H.K. Neame P.J. Nivens C.M. Reiss L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20634-20640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The four N-glycosylation sequences are located at conserved positions in LRR-1, −3, −5, and −8 in both fibromodulin and lumican. In fibromodulin, the four sites are identified as hexosamine-rich, but whether they all contain keratan sulfate is uncertain. The sulfate substitutions show variations in different tissues(32Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24773-24777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arterial lumican appears to be unsulfated, whereas corneal lumican is highly sulfated. Fibromodulin contains sulfated tyrosine residues in the amino-terminal part(30Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1993: 189-209Google Scholar), and lumican contains consensus sites for tyrosine sulfation. The sulfate substitutions of fibromodulin and lumican contribute acidic properties to the proteins. However, in addition, the primary sequences show low pI values. PRELP differs considerably from lumican and fibromodulin in that its basic amino-terminal region lacks consensus sites (33Huttner W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Rosenquist G.L. Nicholas Jr., H.B. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) for tyrosine sulfation. Whether PRELP is a proteoglycan with keratan sulfate chains is not clear. Four potential N-linked glycosylation sites are present according to the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr. In three of the sites, post-translational modifications are likely to be present as amino acid sequence analysis gave blank cycles at these positions. Two of the N-linked oligosaccharide sites are situated in the same position in the LRRs as in fibromodulin and lumican (LRR-1 and −8), whereas the last substituted glycosylation site is positioned in the last repeat. The behavior on DEAE-cellulose chromatography shows that PRELP has basic properties. However, due to basic residues in the amino-terminal part, which give the protein's primary structure a higher pI than without (9.7 versus 8.3), a shorter keratan sulfate chain might be present. Keratanase digestion showed a small shift on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which might indicate either a keratan sulfate chain or a non-sulfated polylactosamine. Carbohydrate analysis (14Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzén A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) does not exclude keratan sulfate/polylactosamine substitutions. Attempts to identify keratan sulfate chains on the intact protein and on peptide fragments of the protein by the use of several monoclonal antibodies to keratan sulfate were not conclusive. Residues 4-47 contain an arginine- and proline-rich segment followed by a proline-rich segment. Inserted between these is a short acidic segment. The proline-rich segment is reminiscent of three turns of an extended collagen-type helix and is therefore likely to form an extended structure. The arginine- and proline-rich segment is also likely to form an extended structure due to steric occlusion and/or charge repulsion of the side chains. The N terminus may, therefore, form an extended structure or loop back on itself in a hairpin, depending on whether the basic and acidic residues interact with each other. The basic region of the amino-terminal part in PRELP contains two T/GRRPRP sequences. This sequence corresponds to the proposed sequence for protein-glycosaminoglycan interactions: X-B-B-X-B-X, where B denotes a basic residue(35Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The consensus sequence was derived from 12 known heparin-binding sequences in vitronectin, apolipoproteins E and B-100, and platelet factor 4. It has also been suggested that the non-collagenous NC4 domain of collagen type IX, which is basic and has one consensus sequence at the N-terminal end, may interact with polyanionic glycosaminoglycan in cartilage(36Vasios G. Nishimura I. Konomi H. van der Rest M. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2324-2329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of an interaction between PRELP and glycosaminoglycans, however, has to be experimentally verified. Most of the LRR-containing proteins have been shown to participate in protein-protein interactions probably mediated through the LRR structure. Chondroadherin is cell binding(11Sommarin Y. Larsson T. Heinegård D. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fibromodulin and decorin bind to collagens I and II and affect fibril formation(9Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 38Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and biglycan binds to collagen VI. 2E. Hedbom and D. Heinegård, unpublished data. Biglycan, decorin, and fibromodulin have all been shown to bind to transforming growth factor-β(10Hildebrand A. Romarís M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegård D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Rouslahti E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Whether PRELP has any of these properties has yet to been determined. In Northern blot analysis, PRELP seems to be synthesized in high amounts only in cartilage since in RNA isolated from tissues of a bovine fetus (liver, kidney, skin, spleen, and thymus), no mRNA corresponding to PRELP was detected. The detection of PRELP mRNA in cultured bovine osteoblasts may be the effect of up-regulated PRELP expression under culture conditions since the bovine trabecular bone and rat calvarial RNAs gave no positive signal. In the radioimmunoanalysis carried out by Heinegård et al.(14Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzén A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no PRELP was detected in bone extracts. However, the radioimmunoanalysis indicated the presence of PRELP in bovine kidney, liver, and skin extracts. One possible explanation could be the age of the tissues. In the literature, a 55-kDa protein with similar properties to PRELP has been described(39Melching L.I. Roughley P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1036: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This protein appears to be identical to PRELP as partial peptide sequences of the 55-kDa protein are identical to PRELP at positions 138-149 and 217-228. The 55-kDa protein seems to be deficient in newborns and accumulates in cartilage with age rather than being destroyed and resynthesized by the chondrocytes. We are grateful to Dr. Michael Bayliss for providing the human articular chondrocyte cDNA library and the total RNA from human articular chondrocytes, to Dr. Bruce Caterson and Dr. Clare Hughes (Division of Orthopedic Surgery, Chapel Hill, North Carolina) for providing different monoclonal antibodies against keratan sulfate, and to Dr. James Kimura for providing the rat chondrosarco-ma cell line. We are also grateful to Ros-Mari Sandfalk for skillful technical work in the protein purification process."
https://openalex.org/W2065750990,"We recently cloned a partial cDNA (35H) for a protein kinase C (PKC) binding protein from a rat kidney cDNA library and demonstrated that it is a PKC substrate in vitro (Chapline, C., Ramsay, K., Klauck, T., and Jaken, S.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 6858-6861). Additional library screening and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends were used to obtain the complete open reading frame. Amino acid sequence analysis, DNA sequence analysis, and Northern analysis indicate that 35H is a unique cDNA related to α- and β-adducins. Antisera prepared to the 35H bacterial fusion protein recognized two polypeptides of 80 and 90 kDa on immunoblots of kidney homogenates and cultured renal proximal tubule epithelial cell extracts. The 35H-related proteins were similar to α- and β-adducins in that they were preferentially recovered in the Triton X-100-insoluble (cytoskeletal, CSK) fraction of cell extracts and were predominantly localized to cell borders. Phorbol esters stimulated phosphorylation of CSK 35H proteins, thus emphasizing that sequences isolated according to PKC binding activity in vitro are also PKC substrates in vivo. The phosphorylated forms of the 35H proteins were preferentially recovered in the soluble fraction, thus demonstrating that phosphorylation regulates their CSK association and, thereby, their function in regulating cytoskeletal assemblies. We have isolated another PKC binding protein partial cDNA (clone 45) from a rat fibroblast library with substantial homology to α-adducin. Antisera raised against this expressed sequence recognized a protein of 120 kDa, the reported size of α-adducin, on immunoblots of renal proximal tubule epithelial cell extracts. A 120-kDa protein that cross-reacts with the clone 45 (α-adducin) antisera coprecipitated with 35H immunecomplexes, indicating that α-adducin associates with 35H proteins in vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that 35H is a new, widely expressed form of adducin capable of forming heterodimers with α-adducin. We propose naming this adducin homologue γ-adducin.

The novel or Group B PKCs are calcium-independent but still diacylglycerol-stimulatable. The atypical or Group C PKCs are calcium- and diacylglycerol-independent. Most cells express more than one type of PKC, which implies that PKCs have unique rather than overlapping functions. protein kinase C cytoskeleton or cytoskeletal myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate microtubule stabilization buffer phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate renal proximal tubule epithelial cells 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid kilobase pair(s) phosphatidylserine. Activation of Group A and B PKCs is regulated by receptor-mediated production of diacylglycerol through phospholipase C or D pathways(1Stabel S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 277-284PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases, activation correlates with PKC redistribution from soluble to particulate fractions. However, in other cases, evidence for activation in the absence of measurable translocation has been noted (2Chakravarthy B.R. Whitfield J.F. Durkin J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3Grabarek J. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5543-5549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Bosca L. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 5Trilivas I. McDonough P.M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8431-8438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The correlation between translocation and activation is further confused by the fact that PKC inhibitors such as staurosporine can also cause PKC redistribution(6Wolf M. Baggiolini M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 1273-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. Fabbro D. Jaken S. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1997-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, redistribution does not necessarily reflect PKC activation under all conditions. An alternative method for studying PKC activation is to monitor the phosphorylation state of PKC substrates. For example, phosphorylation of MARCKS, a major PKC substrate in many cells, has been useful for demonstrating PKC activation in response to a variety of physiological agonists(8Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Our goal has been to identify a panel of high affinity substrates for PKCs that can be used as reporter systems to monitor PKC activity in response to external stimuli and in pathological processes. To this end, we developed a blot overlay assay to identify PKC binding proteins. In subsequent studies, we demonstrated that MARCKS and other PKC substrates interact with PKCs in this in vitro assay (9Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and suggested that, in general, binding proteins are also substrates. The overlay assay is based on a phospholipid-dependent, high affinity interaction between PKCs and recognition sites on other proteins (substrates)(11Liao L. Hyatt S.L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). With slight modifications, the assay can also be used in an interaction cloning strategy to isolate expressed cDNAs for PKC substrates (12Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our original report on interaction cloning of PKC substrates(12Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we identified two PKC binding sequences: MARCKS-related protein (clone 35A) and a unique partial cDNA sequence with homology to adducins (clone 35H). Both were shown to be PKC substrates in vitro. In the present study, we report the complete coding sequence for 35H, identify it as a novel form of adducin, and establish that it is also a PKC substrate in vivo. These results underscore the utility of the PKC interaction cloning approach for identifying novel PKC substrates. Male Fisher 344 rats weighing 150-175 g were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). Collagen type I was purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). Phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), insulin, and cholera toxin were from Sigma. Epidermal growth factor was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Immunoprecipitin (Formalin-fixed Staph A cells), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham's F12 medium, and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [32P]orthophosphate (8500-9120 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. In vitro transcription kit was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Restriction enzymes and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Aqua-Poly/Mount was from Polysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA). Primary RPTE cultures were prepared from rat kidney proximal tubules and were grown on collagen type I coated plastic culture dishes as described(13Wallin A. Zhang G. Jones T.W. Jaken S. Stevens J.L. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 474-484PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zhang G. Ichimura T. Wallin A. Kan M. Stevens J.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A partial cDNA containing the 3′ end of the 35H sequence was originally isolated from a rat kidney oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library by PKC interaction cloning (12Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since Northern analysis indicated substantial message expressed in brain, a rat brain random primed cDNA library (Clontech) was screened with the 35H partial cDNA clone in order to isolate more 5′ regions of the open reading frame. This screen produced a clone that overlapped the original kidney clone but included no additional 5′ sequence. The sequence of the brain clone was identical to that of the kidney clone. Two rounds of 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends from rat kidney mRNA produced 800 base pairs of additional 5′ sequence. These sequences were also isolated from a REF52 cell library using two rounds of 5′ polymerase chain reaction. A third round of 5′ polymerase chain reactions from either the kidney or the REF52 library or 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA end reactions with kidney or REF52 mRNA did not yield products with additional 35H 5′ sequence. However, 5′ polymerase chain reaction from the rat brain library (Clontech) did produce an overlapping product, which included the 5′ end of the 35H sequence. 35H cDNA was inserted in frame into a pQE bacterial expression vector (QIAGEN; Chatsworth, CA) to produce a recombinant protein containing 6 histidine residues at the N terminus. The fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on a nickel-agarose column (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified fusion protein was used for production of rabbit antiserum. Anti-35H antiserum was affinity-purified against the corresponding bacterially expressed fusion protein. Clone 45 is another partial cDNA isolated from a REF52 cell library on the basis of PKC binding activity as described(12Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clone 45 is a 935-base pair fragment with 80% homology to human α-adducin, suggesting that clone 45 is the rat homologue of human α-adducin. Clone 45 cDNA was inserted into the pQE vector and expressed as the 6X His-tagged fusion protein as described above. Antisera were prepared to clone 45 fusion protein and immunopurified against the bacterially expressed fusion protein. Cell lysates were prepared as described(24Dong L. Stevens J.L. Fabbro D. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 881-890PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated rat kidneys were homogenized in homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) using reagents from Bio-Rad. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described(24Dong L. Stevens J.L. Fabbro D. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 881-890PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with microtubule stabilization buffer (MSB; 0.1 M PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.9, 2 M glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM magnesium acetate)(16Osborn M. Weber K. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 97-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Soluble proteins were extracted with 0.2% Triton X-100 in MSB containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin for 4 min at room temperature. Triton X-100 insoluble proteins, referred to as the CSK fraction, were washed with MSB. For immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation, CSKs were scraped into MSB containing leupeptin and aprotinin and sonicated. Cells grown on 35-mm dishes were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium three times, labeled with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Pi) in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with supplements as described under “Cell Culture” for 4 h at 37°C. During the final labeling period, cells were treated with PDBu for the indicated times. When PDBu treatment was longer than 4 h, the 32Pi was added during the final 4 h. After labeling, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, which was 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mM sodium fluoride, and 1 mM sodium vanadate. For soluble and CSK preparations, cells were washed twice with MSB after labeling, and the soluble and CSK fractions were prepared in 0.8 ml of MSB as described above. Samples were adjusted to 1 × radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer for immunoprecipitation. 32P-labeled samples (1 ml), prepared as described above, were precleared by incubating with 150 μl of formalin-fixed Staph A cells (10%, w/v) for 1 h. Precleared supernatants were collected and incubated with 10 μl of anti-35H antiserum or preimmune serum for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose (40 μl, 50%, v/v) was added, and the incubation continued for another hour. All incubations were performed at 4°C on a shaker. Immunecomplexes were collected by centrifugation and washed by centrifugation and resuspension twice in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, once in low salt buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), once in high salt buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and once in low salt buffer again. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from protein A-Sepharose by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) and then separated on 7.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. In some experiments, immunoprecipitates from nonradioactive cells were collected in parallel and blotted to nitrocellulose. Cells were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips as described under “Cell Culture.” Whole cell and CSK preparations were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (whole cell) or in MSB (CSK) for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized with absolute methanol for 6 min at −20°C(18Jaken S. Leach K. Klauck T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The coverslips were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and stained sequentially with 10 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-35H antibody for 1 h and with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. The coverslips were mounted with Aqua-Poly/Mount onto slides and observed under a Nikon fluorescence microscope with a 60 × objective lens. Blots containing 2.5 μg of poly(A) mRNA from multiple tissues were purchased from Clontech. Random labeled cDNA probes were prepared with [32P]dCTP. Prehybridization conditions were 3 h at 42°C in 5 × SSPE and 2 × Denhardt's in the presence of 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 2% SDS, and 50% formamide. Blots were hybridized for 48 h at 42°C in the prehybridization solution, washed three times in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and washed three more times in 0.1 SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50°C. Films shown were exposed for 6-7 days. The original clone 35H, which is a partial cDNA from a rat kidney library, had substantial homology to the 3′ end of human brain β-adducin in defined areas (12Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, since the sequences diverged significantly in other areas, the extent of the relationship to β-adducin could not be determined. Both library screening and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends were used to obtain the entire 35H coding sequence. Alignments of the full-length 35H translated sequence with human α- and β-adducins demonstrate that although 35H shares substantial homology with α- and β-adducins, it is a unique sequence (Fig. 1). Overall, rat 35H is 50-60% homologous to human α- and β-adducins. In contrast, rat and human β-adducin sequences are nearly identical (90% homology with conservative substitutions except for the highly variable C terminus, which is truncated in the reported rat sequence(19Tripodi G. Piscone A. Borsani G. Tisminetzky S. Salardi S. Sidoli A. James P. Pongor S. Bianchi S. Baralle F.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). The high degree of homology between the rat and human β-adducin sequences indicates that species differences alone do not account for the the difference between 35H and the human adducin sequences. In previous studies, alignments of human α-adducin with human and rat β-adducins revealed that the adducins share a homologous N-terminal domain followed by a highly divergent region near the C terminus and a highly conserved polybasic region at the extreme C terminus (residues 696-726 in β-adducin)(19Tripodi G. Piscone A. Borsani G. Tisminetzky S. Salardi S. Sidoli A. James P. Pongor S. Bianchi S. Baralle F.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This overall pattern is also apparent in the 35H alignment. Within the relatively conserved N-terminal domains, divergent regions are separated by stretches with near identity and conservative substitutions (Fig. 1, shaded regions). In general, there is a good correlation in spacing of the variable and conserved domains within α-adducin, β-adducin, and 35H sequences. This alignment suggests that adducins are a family of proteins with constant domains separated at defined intervals by isoform-specific sequences, and furthermore that 35H is a newly identified member of the adducin family. 35H shares homology to β- but not α-adducin in two of the variable regions (437-447 and 472-484; numbers refer to β-adducin residues shaded in Fig. 1). On the other hand, 35H shares homology to α-adducin in other variable regions (8-15, 19-27, 85-92; numbers refer to α-adducin residues shaded in Fig. 1). These results emphasize that 35H is a unique sequence distinct from previously identified forms of adducin. Both α-adducin and 35H diverge significantly from the β-adducin putative calmodulin binding domain(446-454)(21Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3398-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Diversity in this sequence suggests a potentially significant difference in calmodulin regulation of 35H and β-adducin functions. The conserved high positive charge density domains in the extreme C termini are identical with the exception of the change of a potential phosphorylatable Ser to Asn in 35H. 35H does not contain Tyr316 of α-adducin or Arg529 of β-adducin, which have been identified as a potential tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site or a determinant of cAMP-dependent kinase phosphorylation, respectively(22Bianchi G. Tripodi G. Casari G. Salardi S. Barber B.R. Garcia R. Leoni P. Torielli L. Cusi D. Ferrandi M. Pinna L.A. Ferrari P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3999-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Mutations in these sites have been linked to hypertension. Northern analysis was used to compare the tissue distribution of 35H with α- and β-adducins. Previous studies have shown that α-adducin probes hybridized to a 4.0-kb mRNA with wide tissue distribution, whereas β-adducin probes hybridized to an 8.1-kb mRNA in brain, which was not detectable in liver and kidney (20Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Three smaller messages (3.0-4.2 kb) were detected in spleen, kidney, and heart(19Tripodi G. Piscone A. Borsani G. Tisminetzky S. Salardi S. Sidoli A. James P. Pongor S. Bianchi S. Baralle F.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, 35H probes hybridized to a 4.5-kb message in all rat and human tissues examined (Fig. 2), although message was less abundant in lung and liver. A second, less prominent band at 7.5 kb was also detected in spleen, kidney, and testis. In summary, differences in the primary amino acid sequence, message size, and tissue distribution clearly distinguish 35H from α- and β-adducins. Antiserum raised against the bacterially expressed 35H fusion protein was used to study 35H-related proteins in cultured RPTE and kidney extracts. Affinity-purified anti-35H antibody reacted strongly with an 80-kDa protein in cell lysates of primary growing RPTE (Fig. 3A). A weaker band at 90 kDa was also apparent. The 80- and 90-kDa immunoreactive proteins were also detected in kidney homogenates, although the 90-kDa band was more intense relative to RPTE. Neither the 80- nor the 90-kDa proteins were detected by preimmune serum (data not shown). The reason for the relative increase in 90-kDa 35H in whole kidney homogenates versus RPTE is not known; however, since kidney contains many cell types in addition to proximal tubules, it is possible that different kidney cell types express different forms of 35H. Thus, two immunoreactive forms of 35H are expressed in kidney, and the 80-kDa form is preferentially expressed in the cultured RPTE. Because of their cross-reactivity with affinity-purified antisera to the 35H fusion protein, they will be referred to as 35H proteins. The interaction cloning strategy was also used to screen a rat fibroblast λgt11 library for PKC binding proteins. One product of this screen is a partial cDNA (clone 45) with a predicted translated sequence 77% identical to the carboxyl terminus of human α-adducin (Fig. 4). The sequences diverge significantly only in the C terminus, the region where rat and human β-adducin sequences diverge from each other(19Tripodi G. Piscone A. Borsani G. Tisminetzky S. Salardi S. Sidoli A. James P. Pongor S. Bianchi S. Baralle F.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Antisera prepared to the expressed bacterial fusion protein and immunopurified against the cognate protein recognized a protein of 120 kDa, the reported size of α-adducin, in homogenates of cultured renal cells or tissue (Fig. 3B). The sequence identity and size similarity indicate that clone 45 is the rat homologue of human α-adducin. Previous studies demonstrated that the bacterially expressed 35H protein could be phosphorylated by purified PKC in vitro(12Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if 35H proteins were PKC substrates in intact cells, primary growing RPTEs were prelabeled with orthophosphate, and the effect of PDBu on stimulating phosphate incorporation into proteins precipitated by 35H antiserum was determined (Fig. 5). In the absence of PDBu-treatment, three phosphoproteins of approximately 80, 90, and 120 kDa were specifically immunoprecipitated. PDBu increased phosphate incorporation into the 80- and 120-kDa bands approximately 6-fold (as quantitated by scanning densitometry), and into the 90-kDa band to a lesser extent (2-3-fold). The 80- and 90-kDa bands correspond to immunoreactive proteins detected on blots as shown in Fig. 3. The 120-kDa band was not detected on blots and represents a co-immunoprecipitating protein (see below). Since β-adducin is known to form heterocomplexes with 120-kDa α-adducin(23Waseem A. Palfrey H.C. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 93-98PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the 120-kDa protein coprecipitating with 35H antibodies may be α-adducin (our clone 45). To determine if α-adducin was present in the 35H immunecomplexes, 35H immunoprecipitates of cell lysates were prepared and blotted to nitrocellulose. Antibodies to 35H recognized the 80- and 90-kDa 35H in the immunoprecipitates but did not recognize the 120-kDa phosphoprotein apparent on the autorads (Fig. 6A). In contrast, affinity-purified antibodies to clone 45 (α-adducin) fusion protein recognized a 120-kDa band in the 35H immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6B). Since antibody to recombinant clone 45 protein does not recognize recombinant clone 35H protein and vice versa (Fig. 7), these results strongly suggest that α-adducin is not directly precipitated with 35H antisera but that it coprecipitates with the 35H proteins.Figure 7Specificity of anti-35H antibodies. Aliquots of affinity-purified 35H and 45 protein were dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose at the concentrations shown. Blots were stained with affinity-purified anti-35H antisera (A) or anti-45 antisera (B) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The distribution of 35H proteins between Triton X-100-soluble and insoluble (CSK) fractions in resting and PDBu-stimulated cultures was analyzed by immunoblotting. Densitometric analysis indicated that in resting cultures, approximately 80% of the total 80- and 90-kDa proteins were recovered in the CSK fraction (Fig. 8). Activation of PKC by PDBu treatment increased soluble 35H proteins approximately 2-fold. It is likely that the increase in soluble 35H is due to redistribution from the CSK pool, although a corresponding decrease in the CSK 80- and 90-kDa proteins was more difficult to detect. These results suggest that only a small fraction of the total CSK 35H is redistributed to the soluble fraction with PDBu stimulation. After 16 h of PDBu treatment, which partially down-modulates PKC in these cells(24Dong L. Stevens J.L. Fabbro D. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 881-890PubMed Google Scholar), the distributions of both 80- and 90-kDa proteins between soluble and CSK fractions were similar to resting cultures. PDBu-mediated changes in CSK 35H were more apparent by immunocytofluorescence than by immunoblot. In resting primary RPTE, 35H staining was concentrated in cell-cell junctions in detergent-extracted (CSK) preparations (Fig. 9). PDBu rapidly caused a decline in 35H staining concentrated at cell borders and an increase in staining in cytoplasmic dots (Fig. 9, B and C). The effect of PDBu was attenuated with prolonged PDBu treatment, which down-modulates PKC (Fig. 9D). Parallel studies with whole cell preparations indicated that the intensity and distribution of 35H staining were similar in CSK and whole cell preparations of resting cells (data not shown), consistent with the nearly quantitative recovery of 35H in the CSK fraction on immunoblots (Fig. 8). In whole cells, PDBu caused an increase in diffuse cytosolic staining and a decrease in cell border staining (data not shown) indicative of a redistribution from CSK to soluble fractions. The increase in soluble 35H (Fig. 8) and the decrease and reorganization of CSK 35H (Fig. 9) observed after PDBu treatment suggested that phosphorylation may regulate the distribution of 35H proteins between soluble and CSK compartments. To test the hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated 35H proteins from soluble and CSK fractions of 32P-labeled primary growing RPTE (Fig. 10). Basal phosphorylation levels of 35H proteins in both soluble and CSK fractions were low. PDBu stimulated phosphorylation of 80- and 90-kDa 35H proteins; these phosphoproteins were preferentially recovered in the soluble fraction. Increased phosphorylation of the coprecipitating 120-kDa protein was also limited to the soluble pool. PDBu did not stimulate phosphate incorporation into the CSK pool of these proteins. Thus, although 35H protein mass was preferentially recovered in the CSK fraction as demonstrated by immunoblots (Fig. 8), phosphorylated forms were preferentially recovered in the soluble fraction (Fig. 10). Phosphorylation of 80- and 90-kDa 35H was attenuated after 4-14 h of PDBu treatment, which correlates with the time course for PKC down-modulation in these cells(25Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure proper quantitation of blots, we compared antibody recognition of native and phosphorylated 35H. 35H bacterial fusion protein was phosphorylated with purified PKC in vitro(12Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 35H antibody detected both native and phosphorylated forms with the same intensity on immunoblots (data not shown). Thus, the increase in soluble 35H proteins in response to PDBu treatment cannot be attributed to increased antibody recognition of the phosphorylated form. Furthermore, we verified that 35H proteins were efficiently immunoprecipitated from both the soluble and CSK fractions (Fig. 11). Thus, preferential recovery of phosphorylated 35H homologues in the soluble fraction cannot be attributed to more quantitative recovery of 35H proteins in this fraction. In summary, our results demonstrate that in response to PDBu, 35H proteins are phosphorylated and redistributed from CSK to soluble fractions and that the phospho-35H proteins are preferentially recovered in the soluble fraction. We have used a PKC overlay assay to detect PKC binding proteins and demonstrated a close correlation between PKC binding proteins (detected by blot overlay) and PKC substrates (detected by in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation assays)(9Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Liao L. Hyatt S.L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have also used the overlay assay in an interaction cloning strategy to isolate cDNAs for PKC binding proteins(12Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many, if not all, of the expressed cDNAs are PKC substrates in vitro. In the present studies, we have focused on clone 35H to determine if proteins corresponding to the cDNAs isolated according to PKC binding activity are substrates in vivo. Antibodies prepared to 35H recognize 80- and 90-kDa PKC substrates in RPTE cells, thus providing additional evidence that PKC binding proteins are PKC substrates. Furthermore, PKC phosphorylation regulated the CSK association of 35H (and clone 45) proteins. Thus, phosphorylation has demonstrable consequences on the function of these proteins, which, by analogy to other adducins, involves the regulation of actin assembly in the subcortical CSK. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that 35H is related to previously reported adducins. Like α- and β-adducins, 35H proteins are insoluble in Triton X-100 and concentrated at cell-cell junctions, and they are PKC substrates(23Waseem A. Palfrey H.C. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 93-98PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kaiser H.W. O'Keefe E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As previously reported for α-adducin(26Kaiser H.W. O'Keefe E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of 35H proteins correlated with their redistribution from CSK to soluble fractions. Furthermore, α-adducin (our clone 45) co-immunoprecipitates with 35H, indicating that 35H proteins associate with α-adducin. Other evidence emphasizes that despite the similarity to adducins, 35H is a unique sequence. The alignment shown in Fig. 1 indicates that 35H diverges significantly from α- and β-adducins in discrete regions. Northern analysis demonstrates that the size and tissue distribution of 35H message are distinct from α- and β-adducins. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 35H is a new member of the adducin family. We propose renaming it as γ-adducin. Since α- and β-adducins are known to form heterodimers, the structure and organization of adducins in cells and tissues that express α-adducin but not β-adducin (e.g. kidney(20Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)) have been questioned. It seems likely that 35H proteins (or other as yet unidentified adducins) could fulfill the role of β-adducin in forming heterodimers with α-adducin in these tissues. Our original goal was to determine if sequences isolated according to PKC binding in vitro were substrates in vivo. Several known PKC substrates were isolated in our initial library screens for PKC binding proteins including MARCKS-related protein (clone 35A), α-adducin (clone 45), annexin I, and annexin II. The fact that 35H, a unique sequence isolated according to PKC binding activity, also appears to be a PKC substrate in vivo further confirms this conclusion. Additional studies are in progress to determine if PKC is directly responsible for the PDBu-stimulated 35H phosphorylation and if other kinases also participate in 35H phosphorylation. In other studies, we have determined that two other unique binding protein sequences (clones 72 and 35F) are PKC substrates in vitro and in vivo (data not shown). MARCKS, a major PKC substrate in many cells, is also a PKC binding protein(9Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is a strong correlation between binding proteins detected in the overlay assay and PKC substrates. It should be noted that in addition to their roles as downstream targets and effectors of PKC activation, the apparent high affinity between PKC and the binding proteins also allows for the possibility that these sequences target PKCs to specific subcellular addresses in vivo, although we do not yet have direct evidence for this. Each of the binding proteins we have tested binds phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphorylation coordinately decreases PS and PKC binding(9Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liao L. Hyatt S.L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PS bridging is an important component of PKC binding, and as described previously, it is also an important component for efficient trans-phosphorylation(27Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, in our working model (Fig. 12), we propose that PKC and binding proteins are brought into close proximity due to their common affinity for PS. Since not all PS binding proteins are PKC binding proteins, additional protein-protein interactions appear to be required for formation of the high affinity ternary complex(28Hinrichsen R.D. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The model is drawn to indicate contact sites with the catalytic domain since the binding proteins are also substrates. PKC interactions with PS have been mapped to the regulatory domain, whereas MARCKS interactions with PS are due to electrostatic interactions with the high positive charge density domain containing the PKC phosphorylation site(8Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 29Kim J. Shishido T. Jiang S. Aderem A. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28214-28219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gnegy M.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 45-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to regulating PKC binding and phosphorylation, PS binding also regulates the association of MARCKS with cellular membranes(29Kim J. Shishido T. Jiang S. Aderem A. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28214-28219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In MARCKS and 35H 2C. Chapline, personal communication. , phosphorylated serine residues are located within high positive charge density domains that support electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged lipid surface. Thus, phosphorylation results in a coordinate loss of both PKC and PS binding. Dissociation of PKC from the binding protein represents a means for regulating the association of PKC with its binding proteins/substrates (Fig. 12). Loss of PS binding correlates with redistribution of binding proteins (such as MARCKS and adducins) from particulate to soluble fractions. This redistribution may be the means by which PKC alters the functions of the CSK-associated proteins and exerts the profound changes in cell shape elicited by phorbol ester treatment."

In the present study, we have stably transfected the cDNA encoding the organic anion transporting polypeptide (oatp) of rat liver into HeLa cells using a vector containing a zinc-inducible promoter. The parent cells have virtually no baseline transport of [35S]BSP, whereas the induced transfected cells express a novel 74-kDa protein and avidly transport this ligand. This has permitted dissection of the transport characteristics of oatp in a mammalian system without the possible confounding effects of other cell surface organic anion transporters. As previously reported(10Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recombinant DNA was digested with NcoI and HindIII (New England Biolabs Inc.), and the oatp cDNA insert was subcloned into the plasmid PrsetB (Invitrogen). This resulting plasmid was digested with KpnI and HindIII. The oatp cDNA insert was isolated and was cloned into the zinc-inducible vector pMEP-4 (Invitrogen). pMEP-4 is a mammalian expression vector that uses the inducible metallothionein IIa promoter and also carries the hygromycin resistance gene as a selectable marker(11Gupta S.L. Carlin J.M. Pyati P. Dai W. Pfefferkorn E.R. Murphy Jr., M.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2277-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pMEP4-oatp recombinant was amplified in Escherichia coli MJC1061 (gift of Dr. Thomas Shrader). The plasmid pMEP4-oatp was purified by the plasmid maxi kit (QIAGEN). HeLa cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Labs Inc.) and 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected with pMEP4-oatp using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique previously described by Okayama and Chen(12Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were cultured in selective medium containing hygromycin (550 units/ml, Calbiochem). After 14-18 days, resistant colonies were selected and expanded in selective medium. For induction of expression of stably transfected HeLa cells, cells were induced for 48 h by the addition of 100 μM ZnSO4 to hygromycin-free medium. An additional 50-100 μM ZnSO4 was added to this medium for the final 18-20 h before use(13McNeall J. Sanchez A. Gray P.P. Chesterman C.N. Sleigh M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 76: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblot as described previously(14Wolkoff A.W. Sosiak A. Greenblatt H.C.

A rabbit polyclonal antibody made to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the oatp sequence near the carboxyl terminus was used. Antibody was detected using [125I]protein A.

[35S]BSP (2500-4000 mCi/mmol) was prepared as described previously(15Kurisu H. Nilprabhassorn P. Wolkoff A.W. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cellular protein was determined in replicate plates by the method of Lowry et al.(16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as standard. These studies were performed in the absence of BSA at BSP concentrations of 0.25-25 μM. Studies were performed in normal SFM and SFM in which NaCl was substituted isosmotically by sucrose(4Wolkoff A.W. Samuelson A.C. Johansen K.L. Nakata R. Withers D.M. Sosiak A. J. Clin.

Data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares regression (SigmaPlot version 5.0, Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA). Uptake of [35S]BSP (0.8 μM) was determined in SFM alone and in SFM containing BSA (0-3%). Cl- dependence of [35S]BSP uptake was also determined as a function of albumin concentration. This was quantified as the difference in uptake by cells in NaCl-containing medium versus cells in sucrose-substituted medium(4Wolkoff A.W. Samuelson A.C. Johansen K.L. Nakata R. Withers D.M.

In other studies, ATP levels were depleted by preincubation of cells for 15 min in SFM containing 0.1% sodium azide and 50 mM 2-deoxyglucose as we have previously described(4Wolkoff A.W.

They were washed four times at 4°C with 1.5 ml of SFM to remove surface bound and extracellular ligand. Following addition of 1 ml of 5% BSA in SFM, cells were incubated for 5-30 min at 4 or 37°C(4Wolkoff A.W. Samuelson A.C. Johansen K.L. Nakata R. Withers D.M. Sosiak A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). At the end of this time, cells were washed twice with 1.5 ml of SFM and harvested, and radioactivity was determined. The plasmid pMEP4 contains an Epstein-Barr virus origin of replication allowing replication in eukaryotic cells and a metallothionein-inducible promoter for the expression of heterologous genes(11Gupta S.L. Carlin J.M. Pyati P. Dai W. Pfefferkorn E.R. Murphy Jr., M.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2277-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pMEP4-oatp was constructed, verified by restriction mapping, and transfected into HeLa cells. Transfected cells were selected on the basis of hygromycin resistance. As seen in Fig. 1, nontransfected cells (H) and cells transfected with vector alone (V) had virtually no uptake of [35S]BSP. Fifteen transfected HeLa cells were clonally expanded and were assayed for [35S]BSP transport activity. In the absence of ZnSO4 induction, there was little transport by any of these clones. Following induction, however, all clones transported [35S]BSP (Fig. 1). All further studies were performed with clone 2 or clone 10 cells. As seen in Fig. 2, transport of [35S]BSP increased with time of zinc induction over the first day. When additional ZnSO4 was added at 20 h, transport activity continued to increase through 48 h. As seen in Fig. 3, there was no immunoreactivity to proteins in nontransfected HeLa cells or in HeLa cells transfected with vector not containing the oatp sequence. pMEP4-oatp-transfected HeLa cells showed immunoreactivity to an approximately 74-kDa peptide only when induced with zinc. As seen in Fig. 4, at 37°C, [35S]BSP uptake by induced pMEP4-oatp-transfected HeLa cells was rapid and approached linearity for 2-3 min. At 15 min, as much as 40-50% of incubated ligand was cell-associated. In contrast, there was little association of [35S]BSP with cells incubated at 4°C (Fig. 4). At intermediate temperatures, there was a direct relationship of [35S]BSP uptake with incubation temperature (Fig. 5). Preincubation of cells in a mixture of sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose reduced their ATP concentration from 52.1 ± 1.2 (mean ± S.D.) nmol/mg protein to 29.1 ± 9.0 nmol/mg protein (n = 3). Under this condition, [35S]BSP uptake was reduced by approximately 50% (Fig. 6).Figure 5Temperature dependence of [35S]BSP uptake by zinc-induced pMEP4-oatp-transfected HeLa cells.

Previous studies in cultured rat hepatocytes suggested that high affinity uptake of BSP was Cl--dependent(5Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin.

In two studies, Km for BSP in the absence of Cl- was 4.4 and 2.3 μM with Vmax of 251 and 222 pmol/mg protein/min. Thus, under these conditions, there is no Cl- dependence of BSP transport. In vivo, however, BSP is bound to albumin in the circulation. Because this binding is of high affinity, the free fraction of BSP is very low. BSP transport by induced transfected cells was inversely related to the concentration of BSA in the medium (Fig. 8A). This is consistent with interaction of free BSP with the transporter. Although BSP uptake in the absence of BSA was not reduced by elimination of NaCl from the medium, transport of BSP in the presence of BSA was clearly Cl--dependent (Fig. 8B).Figure 8Influence of albumin on uptake of [35S]BSP by zinc-induced pMEP4-oatp-transfected HeLa cells.

Following this loading with BSP, they were washed and incubated in 5% BSA at 4 or 37°C. As seen in Fig. 9, efflux of BSP from cells was rapid at 37°C. There was little release of ligand from cells at 4°C. Although hepatocyte transport of organic anions such as bilirubin and BSP has been known for many years to have carrier-mediated kinetics, characterization of this important pathway has been difficult. In part this may be due to multiple transporters of high and low affinities that may be present on the hepatocyte surface(17Min A.D. Goeser T. Liu R. Campbell C.G. Novikoff P.M. Wolkoff A.W.

We have found that these cells have the ability to extract BSP from a molar excess of albumin. This uptake process is highly temperature-dependent and is markedly reduced following depletion of cellular ATP levels. Whether ATP interacts directly or indirectly with this transporter is not known. Uptake of BSP was not altered by removal of Na+ from medium and replacement with other cations such as K+, Li+, or choline. In contrast, replacement of Cl- in medium by gluconate or HCO3- significantly reduced BSP uptake. The mechanism for this Cl- dependence of transport is not known. Affinity of BSP for albumin is Cl--independent(5Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although there was a 7-fold increase in affinity of hepatocytes for BSP in the presence as compared with the absence of Cl-, it is not clear that this is sufficient to explain the large effect on BSP transport. Using Cl--dependent extraction of BSP from albumin as an assay of expression, a cDNA encoding an oatp has recently been cloned in Xenopus oocytes(9Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2146-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this system, uptake of BSP was Cl--dependent in the presence of albumin but Cl--independent in its absence (10Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Because of the relatively low transport signal and the inherent difficulties of the Xenopus oocyte system, the present study developed and characterized HeLa cells permanently transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector containing an inducible oatp cDNA. These cells have virtually no baseline transport of BSP, eliminating the possibility that an endogenous transporter could complicate interpretation of experiments. As seen in Fig. 1, of 15 cell clones that were randomly selected, all were transporters of BSP upon zinc induction. Transport activity declined between 20 and 48 h of induction, unless additional zinc was added to the medium (Fig. 2). The reason for this finding is not clear at this time but likely represents depletion of the metal from the medium. As there was virtually no basal BSP transport in control or uninduced transfectants, initial studies were performed in the absence of extracellular albumin. These studies revealed rapid, temperature-dependent uptake of BSP. This transport was not Cl--dependent. In the presence of albumin, the rate of BSP uptake fell considerably (Fig. 8A). However, close to 80% of BSP transport in the presence of albumin was Cl--dependent (Fig. 8B). These data thus strongly suggest that Cl- does not directly modulate transport activity of oatp. Some studies(5Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Blauer G. Harmatz D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 278: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have indicated that although Cl- binds to albumin(21Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17805) Google Scholar), it does not influence binding of organic anions to albumin. The mechanism resulting in Cl--dependent kinetics that has been described in cultured hepatocytes (4Wolkoff A.W. Samuelson A.C. Johansen K.L. Nakata R. Withers D.M. Sosiak A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin.

Hepatology. 1991; 14: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and perfused rat liver (4Wolkoff A.W. Samuelson A.C. Johansen K.L. Nakata R. Withers D.M. Sosiak A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) thus requires further clarification. Evidence presented in this study indicates that induced transfected HeLa cells transport BSP bidirectionally. Efflux of ligand is rapid and is temperature-dependent. It is possible, however, that these cells also have an endogenous organic anion efflux mechanism that is detectable only when BSP has entered the cell. This situation has been described for efflux of taurocholate from Xenopus oocytes(22Shneider B.L. Moyer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6985-6988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that BSP effluxes rapidly may complicate interpretation of studies performed in the presence of extracellular albumin. This protein binds BSP avidly and markedly reduces its free concentration(5Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The fact that in the absence of albumin BSP accumulation over time reaches an apparent steady state (Fig. 4) suggests that equilibration of free BSP between the medium and the cell is established; that is, influx of ligand equals its efflux at this time. The presence of albumin outside the cell will shift the equilibrium in that direction, reducing cellular accumulation of the ligand. It should be noted that HeLa cells contain several cytosolic glutathione transferases that may bind intracellular BSP(23Hao X.Y. Widersten M. Ridderstrom M. Hellman U. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is likely that in vivo, bile canalicular excretion provides the driving force for the net transport of BSP by keeping the system in a state of disequilibrium. It has been suggested that uptake of the organic anion bilirubin can be explained simply by its direct interaction with the plasma membrane lipid bilayer(24Noy N. Leonard M. Zakim D. Biophys. Chem. 1992; 42: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The present studies clearly show that in the case of BSP this is not so. Parental HeLa cells have virtually no uptake of this ligand. It is not until transfected cells are induced to express oatp that they develop the ability to transport BSP (Fig. 1). Thus, oatp facilitates the movement of BSP across the lipid bilayer. The mechanism by which it does this is as yet unknown. Previous observations in the isolated perfused rat liver suggested that the uptake mechanisms for bilirubin and more soluble organic anions are partially independent(25Gärtner Y. Stockert R.J. Levine W.G. Wolkoff A.W. Gastroenterology. 1982; 83: 1163-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although investigations in transfected Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed inhibition of BSP uptake by bilirubin(19Kullak-Ublick G.-A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 411-416PubMed Google Scholar), whether oatp is an efficient transporter of bilirubin has not as yet been studied directly. These studies thus establish in a mammalian system that the presence of oatp is sufficient to permit BSP transport. The characteristics of transport resulting from oatp transfection are identical to those that have been described previously in cultured rat hepatocytes. These studies do not imply, however, that oatp is the only basolateral plasma membrane organic anion transporter in the rat hepatocyte. Several putative transporters have been suggested by a number of other investigators(6Berk P.D. Potter B.J. Stremmel W. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Tiribelli C. Lunzaai G.C. Sottocasa G.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Termination of cytokine or growth factor signals has been recognized as an important cellular event, particularly when a signal acts as an activator of genes that are constitutively silent or expressed at a very low basal levels(23Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of termination of IFN-induced signals and the consequent deactivation of IFN-stimulated genes remained to be resolved. The down-regulation of the IFN-stimulated gene transcription may be a consequence of either the inactivation of transcription factors or the induction/activation of repressor molecules or a combination of both. For example, induction of repressors, like IRF-2 and positive regulatory domain 1 binding factor 1, has been demonstrated in the down-regulation of IFN-β gene transcription(24Harada H. Willison K.

To address the roles of PTP activities in regulating ligand (IFN-γ)-dependent and constitutive activation of Stat1 proteins, we investigated the kinetics of Stat1α activation and deactivation in cells treated with regulators of PTPs. We present evidence that more than one PTP activity is involved in the regulation of both the constitutive and IFN-γ-dependent signal transduction mediated through the tyrosyl phosphorylation of Stat1α. By using cell lines lacking Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2, we show that none of these kinases individually is required for the ligand-independent activation of Stat1α molecules. The wild-type (5′-TCGAGCCTGATTTCCCCGAAATGACGGC-3′) and mutant (5′- TCGAGCCTGATTTCCCCGACATGACGGC-3′) GAS, also known as the inverted repeat element of the human IRF-1 gene(28Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.-Q. Gottleib K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Bol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and the corresponding complementary strands were synthesized with a SalI linker (TCGA) at the 5′-ends. The duplex oligonucleotides were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described previously(29Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19523-19529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stat1α-specific antibody was raised in rabbits using a GST-fusion protein encoding the C-terminal 37 amino acids of human Stat1α protein(7Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 30Schindler C. Fu X.-Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89 (7836-7789)Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The GST-fusion protein construct was prepared by ligating a BamHI-linked 118-bp polymerase chain reaction product (encoding C-terminal 37 amino acids of Stat1α) to the BamHI site of pGEX-3X vector. The fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (DH-5α) and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. A 1.3-kb SstI fragment of the human IRF-1 gene promoter was excised from pBluescript vector (28Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.-Q. Gottleib K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell.

HeLa and Cos-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 50 units of penicillin and 50 units of streptomycin/ml of medium. 2fTGH and its mutant-derivative cell lines were grown as described previously(29Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19523-19529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Namalwa and HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 50 units of penicillin and 50 units of streptomycin/ml of medium. Daudi cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 μM Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids, 5 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, and 50 units of penicillin and 50 units of streptomycin/ml of medium. Cells were grown to an appropriate density and treated with the indicated agents. WCE was prepared as described previously(29Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19523-19529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For EMSA, WCE containing 5-10 μg of protein was incubated at room temperature in a 18-μl final reaction volume containing 20 mM Na+-Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.6 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 4 mM Tris•Cl, pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 3 μg of poly(dI•dC), and 0.2 ng of end-labeled GAS/inverted repeat oligonucleotide duplex probe for 20 min. The protein-DNA complex was resolved on a 5.5% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bis, 75/2) gel using 0.4 × TBE (1 × TBE = 89 mM Tris borate, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.35) at room temperature for 1.5-2.0 h at 0.65 V/cm2, and the gel was dried and exposed to film at −70°C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in permeabilization buffer (10 ml of buffer/10-cm plate containing 10-15 × 106 cells) for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were washed 2 times with fresh medium and incubated in fresh medium for indicated length of time. The composition of the permeabilization buffer was essentially the same as described by Bernier et al.(31Burnier M. Liotta A.S. Kole H.K. Shock D.D. Roth J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4343-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) except the digitonin was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. 20 mM sodium orthovanadate was prepared in water and mixed with an equal volume of 20 mM hydrogen peroxide for 15 min at room temperature(32Trudel S. Paquet M.R. Grinstein S. Biochem. J. 1990; 276: 611-619Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Sodium molybdate and sodium tungstate were treated similarly with hydrogen peroxide to prepare the peroxo-derivatives of these metals. Whole cell extracts containing 10 μg of protein were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and proteins transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and blocked with 5% carnation milk in TBST (10 mM Tris•Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) at 4°C overnight. The blot was briefly rinsed 2 times with TBST and incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature followed by an anti-Stat1α antibody in TBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 3 h. The membrane was washed for 40 min with TBST at room temperature and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase in 5% Carnation milk in TBST for 45 min, washed with TBST for 1 h, and developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Corp.). Cos-1 cells were transfected with appropriate plasmids using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, the cells were incubated with OPTI-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing DNA-lipofectin complex for 8 h, washed, and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin (50 units/ml) for 16 h before treatment with 50 μM pervanadate for 5 h. Luciferase activity was measured by using Promega kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reference plasmid expressed the β-galactosidase gene driven by Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat, and the β-galactosidase activity was measured as described elsewhere(33Kimura A. Israel A. Le Bail O. Kourilsky P. Cell. 1986; 44: 261-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The GAS-binding activity of Stat1α (GAF) in most cell lines was maximal after 30 min of IFN-γ treatment. When HeLa S3 cells were exposed to IFN-γ (50 units/ml) for 30 min and the treatment was withdrawn, 40-50% of the GAF activity remained by 4-6 h falling to 10-20% at 8-10 h, compared with that observed after a 30-min exposure of the cells to IFN (Fig. 1). Under similar conditions of treatment, Namalwa cells exhibited a different time course of GAF inactivation. In these cells, only 40-50% of GAF activity (compared with 30 min of treatment with IFN-γ) remained at 2 h (Fig. 1). Continuous treatment of HeLa or Namalwa cells with IFN-γ prolonged GAF activity (data not shown). Like HeLa cells, HT1080 and Jurkat showed longer GAF inactivation time compared with human fibroblast cells WI38 and GM2667 (data not shown). Since the gene encoding the Stat1 proteins is transcriptionally induced by both type I and type II IFNs(34Muller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), changes in GAF activity may reflect different levels of Stat1α protein. However, in HeLa S3 cells, the level of Stat1α increased only by 1.5-2.0-fold after 4 h of IFN-γ treatment, and in Namalwa cells there was no change in Stat1α protein levels (Fig. 2). Thus, the persistence of GAF activity in HeLa cells may be partly attributed to the increase in Stat1α protein level, but clearly the inactivation of the DNA-binding activity of Stat1α is not due to degradation of the Stat1α protein.Figure 2Stat1α level in IFN-γ-treated cells. Western blot analysis was performed with WCE containing 10 μg of protein, derived from HeLa and Namalwa cells as described in Fig. 1. Equivalent amount of WCE prepared from 2fTGH and U3A cells were used as positive and negative controls, respectively, for the detection of Stat1α band. The immunoblot was probed with a Stat1α-specific polyclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide prolongs the induction period of IFN-induced genes(35Lew D.J.

To determine whether protein synthesis inhibition altered the inactivation rate of the DNA-binding activity of Stat1α, GAF activity was followed in the presence and absence of cycloheximide for several hours after HeLa cells were treated with IFN-γ for 30 min. The rate of inactivation of Stat1α was not markedly affected by protein synthesis inhibition (Fig. 3). A similar observation was made with Namalwa cells (data not shown). We investigated the effects of commonly used PTP inhibitors, such as vanadate, molybdate, and tungstate on Stat1 phosphorylation. However, since these agents do not efficiently enter intact cells(38Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol.

Treatment of vanadyl sulfate, molybdate, and tungstate with an equimolar concentration of hydrogen peroxide and exposure of intact cells to the resulting mixture fails to induce any detectable DNA-binding of Stat1α (Fig. 4). However, when the peroxo-derivatives of these metals were added to permeabilized cells, the molybdate and tungstate, but not the vanadyl derivative, induced the DNA-binding activity of Stat1α (Fig. 5). We confirmed that the PTP inhibitor-activated complex contained Stat1α and hydrogen peroxide did not induce Stat1α activation (data not shown). To determine if pervanadate-activated Stat1α is able to activate the transcription of the IFN-γ-induced genes, we carried out transient transfection assays in Cos-1 cells by using a reporter construct containing the luciferase coding sequence driven by a 1.3-kb IFN-responsive promoter fragment of the human IRF-1 gene(28Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.-Q. Gottleib K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Bol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Pervanadate increased the luciferase activity by 2-3-fold when treated with a nontoxic dose of pervanadate for 5 h (Fig. 6). This clearly indicates that the pervanadate-mediated activation of Stat1α is biologically functional. Thus, the ligand-independent activation of Stat proteins by pervanadate restricts its use in demonstrating the role of PTP in the deactivation of ligand-induced Stat activity.Figure 5GAF activation by PTP inhibitors in permeabilized HeLa cells. EMSA was performed using an end-labeled GAS probe and WCE prepared from the permeabilized HeLa cells. The cells were permeabilized in a hypotonic buffer containing 10 μg/ml digitonin for 10 min and then added PTP inhibitor (described in Fig. 5) in the same buffer followed by an incubation for 20 min at 37°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Pervanadate activates the IRF-1 gene promoter.

Each bar represents the mean of normalized luciferase activities of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A short term (1-2 h) treatment of permeabilized HeLa cells with sodium orthovanadate did not induce DNA-binding activity of Stat1α but prevented the inactivation of IFN-γ induced DNA-binding activity of Stat1α (Fig. 7). Like orthovanadate, vanadyl sulfate, molybdate, and tungstate also prevented the inactivation of IFN-γ-activated DNA-binding activity of Stat1α molecules (data not shown). Moreover, longer (4-6 h) treatment of permeabilized cells with molybdate and tungstate but not vanadyl sulfate resulted in the ligand-independent Stat1 activation (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that tyrosine dephosphorylation is a mechanism for the inactivation of ligand-activated Stat1α. Pervanadate prevents dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues in many cellular proteins(22Igarashi K. Garotta G. Ozmen L. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. J. Biol.

These results indicate that Cys-337 and Cys-340 participate in the NADH:DTNB oxidoreductase activity in the wild-type enzyme and demonstrate the involvement of Cys-337 and Cys-340 as the redox-active disulfide(7Ohnishi K.

The amino acid sequence of A. xylanus NADH oxidase exhibits 51.2% identity in comparison with the alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase F-52a component (AhpF) from Salmonella typhimurium(5Niimura Y. Ohnishi K. Yarita Y. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki H. Kozaki M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a flavoprotein that has also been shown to possess NADH oxidase activity. Together with the 22-kDa protein component (AhpC) of the S. typhimurium alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase, AhpF was reported to catalyze the NADH-dependent reduction of alkyl hydroperoxides, but not H2O2(5Niimura Y. Ohnishi K. Yarita Y. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki H. Kozaki M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now found that both S. typhimurium AhpF and A. xylanus NADH oxidase scavenge not only alkyl hydroperoxides, but also hydrogen peroxide in the presence of S. typhimurium AhpC. We describe the properties of such enzyme activities in this report. The A. xylanus NADH oxidase and its mutants (C337S, C340S, and C337S/C340S) were purified as described previously(5Niimura Y.

Recombinant AhpC and AhpF were purified in a manner similar to that previously published(8Poole L.B. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1993. Walter de Gruyter, New York1994: 583-586Crossref Google Scholar), using an expression system derived from the POXO4 vector(9Parsonage D. Miller H. Ross R.P. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3161-3167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions at 25°C. Reaction mixtures (1.0 ml in volume), containing 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 150 mM ammonium sulfate, 2 mM NADH, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, and 97 μg (4.4 nmol) of AhpC, were loaded into anaerobic cuvettes with two side arms, in one of which was placed flavoprotein (61.6 μg, 1.1 nmol) and in the other varying amounts of cumene hydroperoxide or t-butyl hydroperoxide. After establishing anaerobiosis by repeated evacuation and equilibration with oxygen-free argon and equilibration at 25°C, the reaction was started by first mixing the two enzymes, followed by cumene hydroperoxide or t-butyl hydroperoxide from the second side arm of the cuvette. After the reaction was complete, as judged by no further changes in the 300-400 nm region, the alkyl hydroperoxide content of the reaction mixtures, including that of control experiments without enzyme carried through the same anaerobic process, was analyzed by the methods of Tagaki et al.(10Takagi T. Mitsuno Y. Masumura M. Lipids. 1977; 13: 147-151Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and Jacobson et al.(11Jacobson F.S. Morgan R.W. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In evaluating the stoichiometries of NADH reduction on addition of a limiting amount of hydrogen peroxide in anaerobic turnover experiments, standardization of the hydrogen peroxide was carried out by addition of 6-10 μl of a stock hydrogen peroxide solution (88 mM) to a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 0.01% o-dianisidine and 20 μg of horseradish peroxidase(12Worthington Enzyme Manual. Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ1972: 41-45Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the NADH oxidase reaction was determined aerobically under conditions of limiting NADH (21, 41, and 62 nmol), and the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced was assayed using the o-dianisidine/horseradish peroxidase system(12Worthington Enzyme Manual. Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ1972: 41-45Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption by the enzymes was determined at 25°C as described previously(5Niimura Y. Ohnishi K. Yarita Y. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki H. Kozaki M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidase activity of NADH oxidase was measured at 25°C as described previously(5Niimura Y. Ohnishi K. Yarita Y. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki H. Kozaki M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidase activity of AhpF was measured in a total of 1 ml of 25 mM potassium buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mM EDTA, 200 μM NADH, and 3.9 μg (75 pmol) of AhpF at 25°C. Turnover studies of hydrogen peroxide or alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase activities were carried out in a temperature-controlled stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Hi-tech SF-61) interfaced with a Dell 325D computer. The activity was measured under anaerobic conditions at 25°C. The flavoprotein/AhpC mixture (10 ml in volume), containing 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 300 mM ammonium sulfate, 1.12 μM flavoprotein (A. xylanus NADH oxidase or S. typhimurium AhpF), and 70.4 μM AhpC, was loaded into a tonometer. After establishing anaerobiosis by repeated evacuation and equilibration with oxygen-free argon and equilibration at 25°C, the reaction was started by mixing the protein solution with varying mixtures of NADH and peroxide substrates, and the reaction was monitored at 340 nm. The NADH/peroxide mixture, containing 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.06-2 mM hydrogen peroxide or cumene hydroperoxide, and 150-600 μM NADH (concentrations were halved after mixing in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer), was bubbled with oxygen-free argon at 25°C. Although most of these determinations were carried out under anaerobic conditions, to avoid possible complications from reaction with oxygen, we found that in the presence of AhpC, the peroxide reductase activities were in fact the same in air-saturated solution as those determined anaerobically. We did not bubble argon into NADH/hydrogen peroxide mixtures in the experiments in which the effect of changing salt concentrations was evaluated. Under aerobic conditions, the purified A. xylanus NADH oxidase consumes oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide(5Niimura Y. Ohnishi K. Yarita Y. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki H. Kozaki M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Vmax value is 119 s-1 at pH 7.0 and 25°C(6Ohnishi K. Niimura Y. Yokoyama K. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki H. Uozumi T. Kozaki M. Komagata K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31418-31423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our analyses of the purified recombinant AhpF protein of the alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase system of S. typhimurium indicate that, like A. xylanus NADH oxidase, this flavoprotein also catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, at a rate of 1.23 units/mg at pH 7.0 and 25°C, under standard assay conditions (200 μM NADH and 260 μM O2). This corresponds to an apparent turnover number of 1.07 s-1, which is much lower than the kcat value (obtained by extrapolation to infinite concentrations of both substrates) of 119 s-1 for the Amphibacillus flavoprotein. While a complete kinetics study has not yet been done with the Salmonella flavoprotein, it would appear that it is indeed less reactive with O2 than the Amphibacillus enzyme since under the same assay conditions, the latter enzyme has an observed turnover of 15 s-1. As with the NADH oxidase, a stoichiometry of 1.06 ± 0.10 (n = 3) mol of hydrogen peroxide produced per mol of NADH oxidized was observed with AhpF. Free FAD also stimulates this measured oxidase activity as previously demonstrated for A. xylanus NADH oxidase (turnover increases to 6.4 and 10.1 s-1 on addition of 5 and 10 μM FAD, respectively). The ability of NADH oxidase and AhpF to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide in the presence or absence of S. typhimurium AhpC was tested using an anaerobic stopped-flow assay system allowing continuous monitoring of NADH oxidation in the presence of peroxide substrates such as hydrogen peroxide. Although earlier reports using an aerobic assay system stated that hydrogen peroxide was not a substrate for the S. typhimurium alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase system, our results clearly indicate that hydrogen peroxide is reduced through electron transfer from NADH that requires both AhpF and AhpC (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the A. xylanus flavoprotein is able to substitute for AhpF from S. typhimurium in catalysis of hydrogen peroxide reduction to give a turnover number of similar magnitude (Fig. 1). The Vmax values for the A. xylanus flavoprotein and S. typhimurium AhpF were 185 and 249 s-1, respectively, extrapolated to saturating AhpC concentrations. The dependence of activity on the AhpC concentration for NADH:hydrogen-peroxide reductase activity was determined from double-reciprocal plots (data not shown). These Vmax values were almost the same as the reduction rate of the Amphibacillus flavoprotein by NADH. (2)Y. Niimura and V. Massey, unpublished data. The Km values for AhpC with the A. xylanus flavoprotein or AhpF were 13.5 and 20 μM, respectively. However, the Km values for hydrogen peroxide or NADH were too low to allow accurate determination of values; the rates were the same with NADH in the concentration range 75-300 μM and with H2O2 in the range 0.03-1 mM. From the shapes of the progress curves, such as those of Fig. 1, upper limit Km values of 10 μM for H2O2 and 20 μM for NADH can be estimated. The stoichiometry of NADH oxidation relative to limiting hydrogen peroxide added from a standardized stock solution was 113.5 nmol of NADH to 105.4 nmol of hydrogen peroxide (1.08:1) in assays containing both AhpF and AhpC. Studies employing an oxygen electrode to directly monitor oxygen consumption also confirmed hydrogen peroxide-producing oxidase activities for both the NADH oxidase and AhpF flavoproteins in the absence of the AhpC component, although considerably more AhpF was required in these studies to achieve rates similar to the oxidase (2.3 nmol of AhpF gave rates comparable to those with 0.22 nmol of NADH oxidase). On addition of catalase following full reaction with limiting oxygen, excess NADH (600 μM), and NADH oxidase (Fig. 2) or AhpF (data not shown), oxygen was produced, indicating the formation of hydrogen peroxide during turnover with oxygen. When the same experiments were repeated in the presence of 8.8 nmol of AhpC, however, no oxygen was detected following addition of catalase (Fig. 2), indicating that no hydrogen peroxide accumulated under these conditions. That oxygen consumption was the result of 2-electron reduction in the presence of flavoprotein only or 4-electron reduction in the presence of AhpC and either flavoprotein was confirmed by determination of the stoichiometry of NADH reduction relative to oxygen consumption in the presence of limiting NADH amounts. Thus, in experiments conducted with AhpF in the absence or presence of AhpC, the ratios of NADH oxidation relative to oxygen consumed were 1.11 and 2.35, respectively. The overall reaction catalyzed by both flavoproteins (AhpF and A. xylanus NADH oxidase) in the presence of AhpC is envisaged to occur as outlined in Fig. S1(see “Discussion” for further details).Figure S1Scheme 1Proposed reaction mechanism for oxygen reduction catalyzed by A. xylanus NADH oxidase in the presence of AhpC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Peroxidase assays using cumene hydroperoxide as substrate under anaerobic conditions were also carried out to confirm the ability of A. xylanus NADH oxidase to substitute for AhpF in alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase assays with AhpC (Fig. 3). Again, neither flavoprotein nor AhpC alone supported facile reduction of the hydroperoxide by NADH (data not shown), while both flavoproteins were able to catalyze such reduction in the presence of AhpC (Fig. 3). The extrapolated Vmax values for the A. xylanus flavoprotein and AhpF at saturating concentrations of AhpC were 170 and 238 s-1, respectively. These Vmax values were also almost the same as the reduction rate of the flavoprotein by NADH. The Km values for AhpC in its reaction with the A. xylanus flavoprotein and AhpF were 15 and 23 μM, respectively. However, the Km values for cumene hydroperoxide and NADH were again too low to allow their determination, with upper limit values of 10 and 20 μM, respectively. Stoichiometric electron transfer by A. xylanus NADH oxidase in the presence of AhpC was indicated by the consumption of 1.68 μmol of cumene hydroperoxide on oxidation of 1.73 μmol of NADH and by the consumption of 1.39 μmol of t-butyl hydroperoxide on oxidation of 1.68 μmol of NADH (data not shown). Thus, alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase activity is also supported by the A. xylanus NADH oxidase flavoprotein in the presence of AhpC. As a direct indication of the stoichiometric transfer of electrons from NADH to AhpC via the A. xylanus NADH oxidase, anaerobic NADH titration of AhpC in the presence of a catalytic amount of the flavoprotein was carried out, followed by DTNB assay to detect protein thiols. Anaerobic titration of AhpC in the presence of a 200-fold lower amount of the A. xylanus flavoprotein resulted in the oxidation of 1.06 eq of NADH/subunit of AhpC (data not shown). The DTNB assay for free thiols indicated the generation of 1.83 thiols/subunit of AhpC, fully consistent with results obtained earlier using the AhpF flavoprotein from S. typhimurium instead of the A. xylanus flavoprotein(8Poole L.B. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1993. Walter de Gruyter, New York1994: 583-586Crossref Google Scholar). We had postulated that Cys-337 and Cys-340 of the A. xylanus flavoprotein are involved in the flow of electrons from NADH to a second redox disulfide center(6Ohnishi K. Niimura Y. Yokoyama K. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki H. Uozumi T. Kozaki M. Komagata K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31418-31423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis, we had constructed three mutant enzymes, C337S, C340S, and C337S/C340S, in which Cys-337 and Cys-340 had been changed to serine residues(7Ohnishi K. Niimura Y. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Suzuki H. Uozumi T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5812-5817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the NADH oxidase activity, the Km values for NADH and oxygen and the Vmax values for these mutant enzymes were not different from those for the wild-type enzyme (7Ohnishi K. Niimura Y. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Suzuki H. Uozumi T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5812-5817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, very little peroxide reductase activity for hydrogen peroxide or cumene hydroperoxide was observed in the single mutants (C337S and C340S) (Fig. 4), and we could not detect any activity in the double mutant (C337S/C340S). These results parallel the loss of DTNB reductase activity for these mutants and indicate that Cys-337 and Cys-340 are involved in the NADH:peroxide reductase activity in the wild-type enzyme in the presence of AhpC. The peroxide reductase activity of NADH oxidase/AhpC mixtures was markedly dependent on ionic strength. All the data above were obtained in the presence of optimal concentrations of ammonium sulfate (150 mM). The Vmax and Km values for AhpC of 185 s-1 and 13.5 μM quoted above were obtained under these conditions. When the NADH:hydrogen-peroxide reductase activity was measured in the absence of ammonium sulfate, but with a high concentration of AhpC (35.2 μM), the activity was only ˜20% of that in the presence of 150 mM ammonium sulfate, and the activity was found to be markedly dependent on the salt concentration (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 also shows the effect of other salts on the basal activity obtained with the standard buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) used throughout this work, expressed as a function of the total ionic strength. While there is clearly a general ionic strength effect, the stimulation effect is greatest with phosphate and least with chloride. This order is the same as that found for enhancing hydrophobic interactions (13Englard S. Seifter S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and suggests that the activity stimulation by salts is due to enhancing the hydrophobic interaction between the flavoprotein and the simple disulfide protein, AhpC. The interaction between the flavoprotein component of AhpF from S. typhimurium and AhpC from the same organism is less dependent on ionic strength. While we have not performed a complete study, in the absence of additional salt, the Vmax value for the AhpF-AhpC system for both hydrogen peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide, extrapolated to saturating AhpC concentrations, was 280 s-1. This Vmax value was almost the same as that in the presence of 150 mM ammonium sulfate. However, the Km values for AhpC in hydrogen peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide assays were 50 and 62 μM, respectively, over twice as great as the corresponding values reported above in the presence of 150 mM ammonium sulfate. Thus, with both enzyme systems, the interaction between the flavoprotein and AhpC appears to be significantly dependent on hydrophobic interactions. The A. xylanus NADH oxidase flavoprotein has unique functional properties that are different from other known NADH oxidases (14Schmidt H.L. Stocklein W. Danzer J. Kirch P. Limbach B. Eur. J.

Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2343-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The flavoprotein was shown to catalyze electron transfer between NADH and DTNB, and the complete reduction of the enzyme by dithionite required 6 electron eq/mol of enzyme-bound flavin(6Ohnishi K. Niimura Y. Yokoyama K. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki H. Uozumi T. Kozaki M. Komagata K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31418-31423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such behavior indicates the presence of redox centers in addition to the FAD, and these were shown to be two disulfides(7Ohnishi K. Niimura Y. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Suzuki H. Uozumi T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5812-5817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase of S. typhimurium was first recognized through the isolation of mutant cells that were resistant to mutagenesis by alkyl hydroperoxide(11Jacobson F.S. Morgan R.W. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its scavenging activity for hydrogen peroxide was not found in early research(11Jacobson F.S. Morgan R.W. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A. xylanus NADH oxidase is thought to function in vivo to regenerate NAD from NADH produced in the aerobic pathway, and hydrogen peroxide was shown to be the final product in the isolated NADH oxidase reaction(5Niimura Y. Ohnishi K. Yarita Y. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki H. Kozaki M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two enzyme systems were presumed to be unable to reduce hydrogen peroxide. However, in the presence of saturating concentrations of AhpC, the Vmax values for hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxide are almost the same as the reduction rate by NADH of the enzyme-bound FAD in the NADH oxidase, suggesting that these values may be limited by the reduction rate of the flavoprotein component. Km values for hydrogen peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and NADH are too low to allow accurate determination of their values in these experiments. Several enzymes that show scavenging activity for hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides have been purified and characterized from bacteria or mammalian sources(9Parsonage D. Miller H. Ross R.P.

Miller H. Ross R.P. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3161-3167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Km values for hydrogen peroxide of this enzyme are 130 μM at pH 5.4 and 10.1 μM at pH 7.5(9Parsonage D. Miller H. Ross R.P. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3161-3167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Km value for hydrogen peroxide of horse liver catalase is 1.1 M(21Ogura Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1955; 57: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Km value for cumene hydroperoxide with the glutathione peroxidase from pig erythrocytes is 40 μM at pH 8.0(22Little C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 284: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). None of these enzymes has been reported to show such high turnover numbers and low Km values for both hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxide as the enzymes described here. Amphibacillus sp. are Gram-positive microorganisms and taxonomically far distant from Gram-negative microorganisms, such as Salmonella sp. However, the amino acid sequences of Amphibacillus NADH oxidase and Salmonella AhpF show a high identity of 51.2%(5Niimura Y. Ohnishi K. Yarita Y. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki H. Kozaki M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of AhpC, Salmonella AhpF also shows NADH oxidase activity that is accelerated in the presence of additional free FAD, in a manner similar to that of A. xylanus NADH oxidase. Furthermore, in the presence of S. typhimurium AhpC, both enzymes catalyze the NADH-dependent 4-electron reduction of oxygen to water (Fig. S1) or the 2-electron reduction of hydrogen peroxide or alkyl hydroperoxides to water or the respective alcohol products (Fig. S2). The two peroxidase activities of NADH oxidase and AhpF in the presence of AhpC give turnover numbers of similar magnitude. The efficiency of the two-protein component systems of Schemes 1 and 2 deserves comment. The overall rate of NADH:peroxide reductase activity, with H2O2 or cumene hydroperoxide, appears to be limited by the rate of flavin reduction by NADH. The bimolecular rate constant for the binding of NADH in this reaction, derived from kcat/Km(NADH), is at least 1 × 107M-1 s-1 at 25°C. What is even more remarkable, however, is the efficiency of electron transfer between the reduced flavin and the Cys-337-Cys-340 disulfide of the flavoprotein and the thiol-disulfide interchange with the disulfide of AhpC. All of these events must occur considerably faster than the limiting rate of flavin reduction, i.e. >200 s-1 at 25°C. (3)Y. Niimura and V. Massey, manuscript in preparation. With A. xylanus, which lacks a respiratory chain, NADH oxidase should regenerate NAD from NADH formed in the aerobic pathway (Fig. S3), and a lot of hydrogen peroxide is presumed to be produced in aerobic growing cells. Despite lacking catalase, A. xylanus can grow well under aerobic conditions(2Niimura Y. Yanagida F. Suzuki K. Komagata K. Kozaki M. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1990; 40: 297-301Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The location of a partial open reading frame upstream of the NADH oxidase locus (from positions −15 to −312; (5Niimura Y. Ohnishi K.

This region of thioredoxin reductase contains the redox-active disulfide, which is composed of Cys-135 and Cys-138(29Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetic analysis of two active-site mutants of thioredoxin reductase, Ser-135,Cys-138 and Cys-135,Ser-138, shows 10 and 50%, respectively, of the thioredoxin reductase activity of the wild-type enzyme(30Prongay A.J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 2656-2664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the remaining thiol can carry out interchange with the disulfide of thioredoxin, and the resulting mixed disulfide can be reduced by NADH via FAD. On the other hand, the single mutants of NADH oxidase (C337S and C340S) show very little activity for hydrogen peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide, and no activity was observed in the double mutant (C337S/C340S). These results indicate that neither the remaining thiol nor the second disulfide alone has thiol-disulfide interchange activity with AhpC. It is clear that thiol-disulfide interchange reactions also differ from that of thioredoxin reductase, in spite of the high degree of conservation around the active-site cysteines. We found that the mutants require only 2 electron eq to reach the reduced flavin state (7Ohnishi K. Niimura Y. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Suzuki H. Uozumi T. Nishino T. J. Biol.

Thus, electrons from FADH2 must pass through Cys-337 and Cys-340 to reduce the second disulfide of the NADH oxidase or the disulfide of AhpC. Rhee and co-workers (31Chae H.Z. Kim I.-H. Kim K.

Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These activities, however, were quite low, partially because of inactivation of the 25-kDa protein by peroxides, especially by alkyl hydroperoxides(35Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No inactivation by peroxides was observed in the NADH oxidase-AhpC or AhpF-AhpC systems, and the peroxide reductase activity for both substrates appears to be limited in rate by the reduction by NADH of the flavin in the NADH oxidase component.2 We thank Dr. Al Claiborne (Wake Forest University) for valuable discussion."

INTRODUCTIONThe two-cell stage mouse embryo has been shown to exhibit HCO−3;/Cl− exchange activity which mediates recovery from intracellular alkalosis(1Baltz J.M. Biggers J.D. Lechene C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17212-17217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemically, this activity is much like HCO−3;/Cl− exchange activities found in many cultured mammalian cells: it is inhibitable by the stilbene drug DIDS, 1The abbreviations used are: DIDS4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidSNARF-1carboxyseminapthorhodafluor-1SNARF-1-AMacetoxymethylester derivative of SNARF-1PMSGpregnant mare serum gonadotropinhCGhuman chorionic gonadotropinANOVAanalysis of variancePCRpolymerase chain reactionRTreverse transcribed. is active above about pH 7.2 and has a Km for external Cl− in the millimolar range(1Baltz J.M. Biggers J.D. Lechene C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17212-17217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, there was no detectable corresponding activity of mechanisms to correct deviations of pHi in the acid direction, such as the otherwise ubiquitous Na+/H+ antiporter (2Baltz J.M. Biggers J.D. Lechene C. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or the Na+,HCO−3;/Cl− exchanger(3Baltz J.M. Biggers J.D. Lechene C. J. Biol.

Zygote. 1994; 2: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, HCO−3;/Cl− exchange appears to be the sole pHi regulatory mechanism in the early embryo (at least at the two-cell stage).Three genes encoding HCO−3;/Cl− exchangers have been identified in mammals(5Alper S.L. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 4: 265-281Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All are related and are homologs of the erythroid anion exchanger, band 3, which functions as both a HCO−3;/Cl− exchanger and a membrane anchor of the cytoskeleton in erythrocytes. These homologs are designated AE1, AE2, and AE3 (“AE” for “anion exchanger”). The AE1 gene encodes at least two alternate polypeptides, erythroid band 3(6Kopito R.R. Lodish H.F.

In addition, alternatively spliced mRNA encoding a polypeptide lacking the transmembrane domain has been described(18Morgans C.W. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1275-1282PubMed Google Scholar). It is not yet known if all HCO−3;/Cl− exchangers are members of the AE family, or if unrelated proteins also serve this function. However, the physiological properties of HCO−3;/Cl− exchange in all those cell types where it has been examined resemble those of the proteins of the AE family.pHi regulation by HCO−3;/Cl− exchange has similar properties in various nucleated cell types and also when mediated by heterologously expressed AE polypeptides: HCO−3;/Cl− exchange is activated above a threshold pHi which is usually around 7.1-7.3(1Baltz J.M.

The activity is inhibited by stilbene drugs such as DIDS, requires HCO−3; in the cell, and requires an inwardly directed Cl− gradient. HCO−3; and Cl− compete for the same transport sites, and the apparent Km for both anions is similar (generally in the range of 1-10 mM; 1, 12, 26).While HCO−3;/Cl− exchange activity has been demonstrated in the two-cell mouse embryo, neither the molecular basis of this HCO−3;/Cl− exchange, nor a requirement for HCO−3;/Cl− exchange activity in early development has been described. In addition, there has been no information available on the presence or absence of HCO−3;/Cl− exchange activity in other stages of preimplantation embryo. The studies presented here address these questions.MATERIALS AND METHODSEmbryosEmbryos were obtained from superovulated (intraperitoneal injections of 5 IU PMSG followed 48 h later by 5 IU hCG, Sigma) CF1 female mice mated with BDF males (Charles River, Canada). One-cell stage embryos, two-cell stage embryos, morulae, and blastocysts were obtained 22-24, 44-48, 70-72, and 94-96 h post-hCG, respectively. One- and two-cell stage embryos were obtained by flushing excised oviducts with KFHM medium (described below), morulae were obtained by similarly flushing excised oviduct-uterus complexes, and blastocysts were obtained by flushing excised oviduct-uterine horn complexes or uterine horns alone. The flushed embryos were collected and washed three times in KFHM using mouth-operated, flame-pulled glass pipettes(23Hogan B Constantini F Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo.

The pH of KSOM as a function of CO2 concentration was determined with a Corning (Corning, NY) combination pH electrode with temperature compensator and Corning pH meter (model 350 ion analyzer) while bubbling the medium with a defined CO2/air mixture (using a Cole-Parmer, Niles IL, gas proportioner with N042 flow tubes). The measured equilibrium pH of KSOM at 5.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.7, 1.5, 0.8, and 0.4% CO2 is 7.35, 7.59, 7.77, 7.85, 7.94, 8.10, and 8.32, respectively. KFHM medium(24Lawitts J.A. Biggers J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 255: 153-164Crossref Scopus (474) Google Scholar), wherein 21 mM of the NaHCO3 in KSOM is replaced by equimolar HEPES (pH adjusted with NaOH to 7.4 at 37°C), was used for obtaining and handling the embryos.Embryo Culture in Varying CO2 Concentrations with and without the Anion Exchange Inhibitor DIDSTwo-cell stage embryos were placed into culture at approximately 46-48 h post-hCG. They were cultured in 50-μl drops of KSOM medium in standard microdrop cultures (23Hogan B Constantini F Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) under medium-equilibrated mineral oil (Sigma, embryo-tested grade) in Falcon tissue culture dishes, in a CO2 incubator (VWR, South Plainfield, NJ, model 35908-100) at 37°C and 100% humidity. Drops containing the anion exchange inhibitor DIDS (100 μM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were prepared by adding fresh 100 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide to CO2-equilibrated KSOM; control drops had the same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide alone (0.1%) added. DIDS did not significantly partition into the oil phase overlying the drops; we found that >90% of the DIDS (measured by absorbance at 340 nm) remained after vigorous vortexing with a 10-fold excess of oil. Groups of two-cell embryos (usually 15/group) were placed into culture drops, with the groups evenly divided between DIDS and control cultures, and immediately returned to the CO2 incubator. Almost all embryos in control cultures reached the expanded blastocyst stage by 68-70 h; embryos were considered to be expanded blastocysts if they had a large fluid-filled blastocoel cavity and a distinct inner cell mass. Embryos were cultured in this way at 0.4, 0.8, 1.5, 1.7, 2.0, and 5% CO2.The results of these experiments were expressed as the number of embryos reaching the expanded blastocyst stage after 68-70 h of culture. There were three or four replicates at each CO2 concentration (except for 0.4%, where there were two). These replicates were tested for homogeneity and found to be not significantly different (all p > 0.05 by Fisher's exact test, except for one anomalous replicate at 1.5% CO2, control, which was nonetheless included). The replicates were therefore pooled for further analysis. The data were analyzed by logistic regression analysis, which allows estimates of the effects of each individual treatment variable as well as any interactions between them. The logistic regression parameters were calculated by exact calculation, rather than using asymptotic methods, since this allows for sparse data sets and data sets with numerous responses near 0 and 100%.Intracellular pH (pHi) MeasurementsMeasurements of embryo pHi were made using an intracellularly loaded pH-sensitive fluorescent probe, by ratiometric imaging with a quantitative imaging fluorescence videomicroscopy system built around a Zeiss Axiovert inverted epifluorescence microscope. Fluorescence excitation was via a grating-type monochrometer (Photon Technologies International, New Brunswick, NJ) with an electronic shutter (UniBlitz, Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). The image was detected with a solid-state video camera (CCD72, Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN) fitted with a Geniisys image intensifier (DAGE-MTI) and a tunable imaging monochrometer (VariSpec model VISI5, Cambridge Research Instruments, Cambridge, MA). All these are controlled by Isee and dsp/os software and imaging hardware (Inovision, Inc., Durham, NC) running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 (R4400, Extreme Graphics) Unix workstation (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA). The pHi measurements were made using SNARF-1, a pH-sensitive fluorophore, loaded into embryos using SNARF-1-AM (5 μM in KFHM for 30 min at 37°C; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Excitation was 535 nm; ratiometric measurements were obtained using emission wavelengths of 640 and 600 nm. Spectra (570-670 nm) obtained in situ from embryos clamped at various pHi showed that 600 nm was an isosbestic point, while 640 was maximally pH-sensitive. The ratio of intensity at 640 divided by that at 600 was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis using the Inovision Isee software, and the mean ratio for each embryo or cell (in two-cell embryos) recorded. The ratio was linearly related to pH in the range of 6.9-8.0; ratios were converted to pH by clamping pHi to the extracellular values using nigericin (10 μg/ml, Sigma) and valinomycin (5 μg/ml, Sigma) in 100 mM K+ solution(2Baltz J.M. Biggers J.D. Lechene C. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Thomas R.C. Buchsbaum R.N. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar).pHi Measurements of Embryos under Culture ConditionsTo assess the effect of DIDS on the pHi of cultured embryos, pHi of two-cell stage embryos was measured under conditions that were as close to normal culture conditions as possible: SNARF-1-loaded embryos were placed in pre-equilibrated microdrop culture dishes containing either KSOM or KSOM + 100 μM DIDS, as for culture, and placed into the incubator with an atmosphere of 5.0, 1.7, or 0.8% CO2. After 3-5 h in culture, five pairs of images (640 and 600 nm, 32 video frames averaged) of the embryos in each culture, and then two background images away from the embryos were immediately taken. Ratio images were calculated after background subtraction and the mean ratio of each embryo cell determined (as described above).Four to six replicates (36-74 embryos total/treatment) at each CO2 concentration with and without DIDS were used. The data from identical conditions were pooled and normal distribution confirmed by normal probability plots. To determine if there was a significant effect of CO2 on pHi, the data were analyzed by two separate ANOVAs, one treating the data with [DIDS] = 0 at all three CO2 levels, and the other treating the data with [DIDS] = 100 μM at all three CO2 levels. These tests determine if pHi depends on CO2 level in control medium or in DIDS-containing medium. To determine if DIDS had a significant effect on pHi, the data were analyzed by an exact Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. The data were treated as comprising two groups (DIDS and control) stratified by CO2 (i.e. treating it as a confounding variable). This test determines if pHi depends on the presence or absence of DIDS overall.Detection of Functional HCO−3;/Cl− Exchangers in EmbryosHCO−3;/Cl− exchanger can be detected by monitoring pHi during replacement of the external medium with one which lacks Cl−(3Baltz J.M. Biggers J.D. Lechene C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6052-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nord E.P. Brown S.E.S. Crandall E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5599-5606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cassel D. Scharf O. Rotman M. Cragoe E.J. Katz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6122-6127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subsequent efflux of Cl− through any HCO−3;/Cl− exchanger(s) present obliges an import of HCO−3; into the cell, increasing pHi. The exchanger runs in the reverse direction to that required by its usual physiological role but still effects HCO−3;/Cl− exchange. Activity is confirmed by showing that the rise is abolished by DIDS but independent of external Na+.SNARF-1-loaded embryos were placed into a temperature- and atmosphere-controlled chamber (37°C and 5% CO2; Biophysica Inc., Baltimore, MD) fitted with a perfusion apparatus (solution changed in <30 s). After monitoring pHi for 10 min, the medium (KSOM with 9 mM sodium lactate replaced by NaCl, [Cl−] = 110 mM) was replaced by medium that was identical except that Cl− was replaced by gluconate and sulfate ([Cl−] = 0, nominally); 100 μM DIDS was used to assess inhibition, and Na+- and Cl−-free medium was used to assess Na+ dependence (NaCl, sodium lactate, and sodium pyruvate replaced by isosmotic sucrose, remainder of Cl− replaced by gluconate, and HCO−3; supplied by choline HCO3). Embryos at the one-cell, two-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages were used. Blastocysts were mechanically collapsed by passage through a narrow-bore pipette to allow DIDS access to the blastocoel cavity(27Baltz J.M. Biggers J.D. Lechene C. Development. 1993; 118: 1353-1361PubMed Google Scholar). Three measurements, with and without DIDS, and two measurements without Na+, were carried out at each stage (8-20 embryos/measurement group). The data, expressed as the mean pHi of the group of embryos at each time point, were analyzed by determining the initial rate of pHi increase after Cl− removal, and by determining the maximum net change in pHi. Initial rate of pHi increase was determined by a linear regression performed on the linear portion of the increase, constituting the first seven (one-cell stage) or 10 (other stages) data points (taken at 30-s intervals). The net increase was determined as the difference between the base-line pHi just prior to Cl− removal, and the peak or plateau pHi following Cl− removal (both averaged over 5 min). Statistical analysis was performed to determine whether the initial rate of increase and/or net increase were significantly different in the presence or absence of DIDS; this was done by t test (assuming unequal variances) at each stage. The data were also analyzed to determine if the initial rate of increase or net increase in pHi changed over development. Initial examination showed that there was no significant difference in either parameter (by t test) between the one- and two-cell stages, nor between the morula and blastocyst stages, so the data for one- and two-cell and for morula and blastocyst were pooled for further analysis. To determine if there was a change over development, t tests (two-tailed, assuming equal variances) were performed to compare initial rates and net changes between the pooled one- and two-cell, and the pooled morula and blastocyst, groups.Isolation of mRNA and Preparation of cDNA from EmbryosFor RNA isolation, the embryos were obtained as described above, and washed eight times through clean drops. The embryos were placed in a ninth drop with micrococcal nuclease (0.006 micromolar units/μl; Sigma) for 15 min at 37°C, which eliminated false positive signals which otherwise arose from the wash medium. Since micrococcal nuclease is Ca2+-dependent, it was only active in this step, as subsequent steps were Ca2+-free. Groups of 50 embryos were placed into 300 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% SDS in TE buffer with 0.02 μg of Escherichia coli, Sigma). The samples were phenol-extracted, and the nucleic acids ethanol-precipitated, pelleted, washed with 70% ethanol, dried on a vacuum concentrator (Speed-Vac), and resuspended in 6 μl water with 1 μl/100 μl RNase inhibitor. The mRNA from the embryos was then reverse transcribed in 20 μl total volume using the Promega RT Kit and oligo(dT) primer.Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Determination of Anion Exchanger mRNA in EmbryosTo detect cDNAs reverse transcribed from anion exchanger mRNAs in embryos, 30 cycles of PCR were performed as described below. In addition, for increased specificity and increased sensitivity in detecting the small amounts of mRNA produced by a few embryos, a “semi-nested” PCR protocol was used in which the products of the 30-cycle PCR were diluted 100-fold, and then a second, 20-cycle round of PCR was performed using the same 5′ primer, and a 3′ primer internal to the first one. Primers, close to the 3′ end of the translated regions of each message, were designed for AE1, AE2, and AE3 (Oligo 4.1, National Biosciences, Plymouth, MN) and synthesized (Beckman Oligo 1000). The sources of the mouse anion exchanger cDNA sequences used were, for AE1, (6Kopito R.R. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1985; 316: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar); for AE2, 10; and for AE3, 15. The PCR primers sequences were (shown 5′ to 3′): AE1 5′, CTG TTC AAG CCA CCC AAG TA; AE1 3′, TCA CAC AGG CAT GGG CAC TT; AE1 3′-internal, ATC ATC ACC GTC CAG ACA CT; AE2 5′, GTC AAA AAG GTT CGG ACC AT; AE2 3′, TGC CTC TGG ACA GCA GCT AC; AE2 3′-internal, CAC TGG CTC TGC CTC ATT AG; AE3 5′, GGG CGT CAC ATC ACT GTC TG; AE3 3′, AGG CAC ATC CCT GGG TCT GA; AE3 3′-internal, AAA GTT CGG CTC CGC ATC TT.The Perkin Elmer Cetus PCR kit with Taq DNA polymerase was used with 1 μl of embryo cDNA (equivalent to 2.5 embryos) or diluted 30-cycle product, in 20 μl total volume. The temperature cycle was 93°C (1 min), 55°C (1 min), and 72°C (3 min; or 13 min at end), controlled by a PTC-100 thermocycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA). The products were analyzed on agarose gels (3:1 NuSieve:Seakem, FMC) and visualized with ethidium bromide. The predicted product sizes from cDNA were: for the 5′,3′ pair (30-cycle PCR), AE1, 303; AE2, 280; AE3, 449; for the semi-nested PCR (5′, 3′-internal pair), AE1, 237; AE2, 210; AE3, 301.These primers flank at least one intron in each genomic sequence so that any product due to contaminating genomic DNA would be identifiably larger than that arising from cDNA, and embryo samples in which reverse transcriptase was omitted were all negative (not shown). Thus, any detected bands must arise from mRNA. To control for the possibility that our semi-nested PCR protocol was too sensitive and was detecting “leaky transcription” (see “Discussion”), we used cDNA derived from tissues known not to express significant levels of a given AE message. Each negative control tissue was run in parallel with a positive tissue. For AE1, stomach was used as a negative control, and spleen as positive(11Kudrycki K.E. Newman P.R. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 462-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); for AE3, spleen was used as negative and heart as positive(11Kudrycki K.E. Newman P.R. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 462-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, there is no tissue which has been definitively shown to be negative for AE2, and thus no obvious negative control(10Alper S.L. Kopito R.R. Libresco S.M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17092-17099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kudrycki K.E. Newman P.R. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 462-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); stomach, brain, heart, and kidney were all positive. Neither of the negative control tissues showed any detectable band of the expected size, while all positive controls were clearly positive (data not shown). Thus, any mRNAs detected by our PCR methods are unlikely to result from over-amplification and detection of non-physiological (“leaky”) transcription.Restriction Digest Confirmation of PCR ProductsThe identities of (semi-nested) PCR products were confirmed by restriction analysis. The predicted AE1 product should yield BglI fragments of 137 and 100; the predicted AE2 should yield RsaI fragments of 146 and 64; the predicted AE3 product should yield HincII fragments of 170 and 131. To obtain enough PCR product for restriction enzyme digestion, semi-nested PCR reactions were carried out as described above, except that the second round (using the 5′ and 3′-internal primers) was carried out for 30 rather than 20 cycles and was done at a 5-fold larger scale (100 μl total). The resultant products were then ethanol precipitated and resuspended in the appropriate restriction buffer as supplied by the manufacturer and digested according to the manufacturer's instructions.StatisticsANOVAs, t tests, and linear regressions were performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Inc.). Normal probability plots were constructed using SigmaPlot for Windows v. 1.0 (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Fisher's Exact and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were performed with the StatXact software package (Cytel Inc., Cambridge, MA), which allows exact as well as asymptotic calculation of probabilities. Logistic regression analysis was performed with LogXact (Cytel), which fits response data which follows a logistic response; LogXact allows fits to arbitrary models of parameter dependence and exact and asymptotic calculation of the probabilities associated with the terms of these fits and their confidence limits. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test and Deviance test, both indicating goodness of fit in a logistic regression, were also calculated using LogXact.RESULTSEffect of Alkaline pH and the Anion Exchange Inhibitor DIDS on Embryos in CultureTwo-cell stage mouse embryos were cultured for 3 days at 37°C and 5.0, 2.0, 1.7, 1.5, 0.8, or 0.4% CO2. Fig. 1 shows the percentage of two-cell embryos which reached the expanded blastocyst stage by 70 h in culture as a function of CO2 concentration and medium pH. Lowering CO2, even as far as 0.4% (pH 8.32), had only a minimal, although statistically significant, effect on the proportion of embryos developing to the blastocyst stage (p = 0.007 by exact calculation of logistic regression parameters on CO2 dependence using the model: Logit(proportion of blastocysts) = β1[CO2] +β2, where βi are constants; only a marginally good fit was demonstrated by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p = 0.074, and the Deviance test, p = 0.066, indicating weak dependence on CO2). Thus, two-cell stage embryos will develop at a fairly high rate (70-80%) to the expanded blastocyst stage even in medium with very high pH.The inclusion of the anion exchange inhibitor, DIDS (100 μM), in the culture medium with 5% CO2 (pH 7.35) had no effect on the proportion of embryos developing to blastocysts by 70 h in culture: 98% of the embryos developed to blastocysts in the presence of DIDS, which is not significantly different from the 93% obtained in the absence of DIDS (p = 0.62 by Fisher's exact test). Thus, DIDS alone is non-toxic.However, at lower CO2 levels (2.0% down to 0.4%), DIDS greatly inhibited the development of embryos, with fewer than 20% reaching the blastocyst stage at 0.4 and 0.8% as compared to the 70-80% in the absence of DIDS (Fig. 1). To show that the effect of DIDS was significant, and that it depended on an interaction with CO2, the full data set was analyzed by exact logistic regression analysis. The regression model assumed dependence on DIDS and on an interaction between CO2 and DIDS (model: Logit(proportion of blastocysts) = β1[DIDS] +β2[DIDS] × [CO2] +β3; a very good fit was demonstrated by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p = 0.88, and Deviance test, p = 0.29). This model was chosen after models in which a [CO2] term had been included failed to give an adequate fit by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and also failed to converge, indicating that dependence on [CO2] alone does not contribute significantly to the overall fit. This analysis showed that both the effect of DIDS and the interaction between DIDS and CO2 were highly significant (both β1 and β2 were highly significantly different from zero, p < 10−4). Therefore, DIDS, but only in conjunction with lowered CO2 level, significantly decreases overall development.Intracellular pH (p"

The full-length NDFβ2 was shown to bind sHer3 with a dissociation constant of 26 ± 9 nM, while it showed a 1000-fold weaker binding to sHer2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that NDF is a high affinity ligand for Her3, but not for Her2. No increase in affinity of the NDFβ2 for sHer3 was observed upon addition of sHer2 to the NDFβ2-sHer3 mixture. Binding of NDFβ2 to sHer3 did not induce receptor dimerization or oligomerization, the stoichiometry being one sHer3 per one NDF molecule. This finding suggests that transmembrane and/or intracellular domains of receptor family members or perhaps additional unidentified components may be involved in NDF induced dimerization and autophosphorylation, or alternatively, that dimerization is not the mechanism for Her3 autophosphorylation and signal transduction.

There have been numerous studies showing that high expression of erbB2/Her2 tyrosine kinase receptor correlates with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer (Slamon et al., 1989; Wright et al., 1989; Gullick et al., 1991; Hartmann et al., 1994). Her2 is a member of the EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorNDFneu differentiation factor. receptor subfamily, which also includes the EGF receptor, and Her3 and Her4 receptors (Kraus et al., 1989; Plowman et al., 1993). EGF and transforming growth factor-α are known as ligands for the EGF receptor but they do not stimulate autophosphorylation of Her2, Her3, and Her4 receptors. epidermal growth factor neu differentiation factor. Receptor dimerization has been implicated as a mechanism of receptor phosphorylation and signal transduction for a variety of ligand-receptor pairs. Using a recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor, dimerization and oligomerization of the receptor, induced by EGF, have been observed with a dissociation constant of 100-200 nM and a stoichiometry of one receptor per one EGF molecule (Hurwitz et al., 1991; Brown et al., 1994). Recently, neu differentiation factor (NDF) or heregulin and other structurally related ligands have been shown to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of the Her2 receptor and, therefore, was initially assumed as a Her2 ligand (Peles et al., 1992; Wen et al., 1992; Holmes et al., 1992; Marchionni et al., 1993; Falls et al., 1993). However, there is evidence that NDF neither binds directly to Her2 nor stimulates its kinase activity (Tzahar et al., 1994), but rather binds to and stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Her3 and Her4 (Plowman et al., 1993; Kita et al., 1994). There is also evidence that NDF's stimulatory activity on Her3 is augmented when Her2 was also coexpressed (Sliwkowski et al., 1994). Here we have studied the interaction of NDF with the extracellular domains of Her2 (sHer2) or Her3 (sHer3) using native gels, light scattering, and sedimentation equilibrium in order to further define the binding strengths and stoichiometries and to explore whether binding specificity is solely a property of the receptor extracellular domains. Recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cell-derived sHer2 and sHer3 were prepared as described elsewhere. 2Y. Kita, J. Tseng, T. Horan, J. Wen, J. Philo, D. Chang, B. Ratzkin, R. Pacifici, O. Brankow, S. Hu, Y. Luo, D. Wen, T. Arakawa, and M. Nicolson, manuscript in preparation. Recombinant Escherichia coli-derived NDF was prepared as described (Tzahar et al., 1994; Lu et al., 1995). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using ɛ280 nm0.1% = 0.632 for NDFβ2, 0.492 for NDFα2, 0.870 for sHer2, and 0.991 for sHer3. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 25°C using 6-channel charcoal-Epon cells in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Concentration distributions were measured at 280 or 230 nm. Samples were equilibrated at each speed for at least 24 h, and attainment of equilibrium verified by the constancy of scans taken 4 h apart. At the conclusion of a run the rotor was taken to 48,000 rpm for >18 h to force all the protein to the bottom of the cell. Scans of the upper portions of each channel at this high speed were used to establish a baseline absorbance level for each sample, and this baseline offset was subtracted from the data before further processing. Simultaneous data analysis on data from multiple samples and speeds was carried out using nonlinear least squares techniques similar to those in NONLIN (Johnson et al., 1981), using the program KDALTON developed in-house. Confidence intervals for the parameters were evaluated using the “preferred method” outlined by Johnson and Faunt(1992). The sedimentation data on the mixtures were fitted to heterogeneous association models of the forms A + B↔AB or A + 2B↔AB + B↔AB2, where A is NDF or a sHer3•NDF complex, and B is sHer2 or sHer3, accounting for the different molar extinction coefficients of each species at the measurement wavelength, using techniques described previously (Philo et al., 1994). During the fitting, the buoyant molecular weights of each monomeric species were held fixed at the values determined when run alone. The data for up to 18 samples were globally fitted to determine the association constants. The fitted parameters were constrained to values which correctly account for the total concentrations each protein placed into the cell. Buffer densities were measured with a Mettler-Paar DMA-02 density meter. Polypeptide partial specific volumes of 0.7258, 0.7220, and 0.7272 ml/g, and molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 6.04 × 104, 6.76 × 104, and 1.56 × 104M-1 cm-1 for sHer2, sHer3, and NDFβ2, respectively, were calculated from their amino acid composition (Laue et al., 1992; Gill and von Hippel, 1989). The experimental setup, procedures, and data analysis have been described previously (Arakawa et al., 1994; Philo et al., 1994), essentially following Takagi(1990). Binding of NDFα2 and NDFβ2 to either sHer2, sHer3 or both was analyzed by native gel electrophoresis using 8% polyacrylamide gels (Novex) run in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, pH 8.6. Prior to loading, 1 μg of sHer2 or sHer3, or 0.5 μg each was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with either a 6.8- or 1.7-fold molar excess of NDF. After incubation, sample buffer was added, samples were loaded, and the gel were run 6 h at 45 volts constant voltage. Silver staining (0.1% AgNO3) was used to visualize protein bands after running. As shown in Fig. 1, in the native gel system employed in this study, sHer2 (lane 2) migrates faster than sHer3 (lane 1) because of its lower relative pI value. Because the unusually high pI (~10) of both NDF isoforms, they do not migrate into the gel when run alone (lane 3), but should retard migration of sHer2 or sHer3 if a stable complex is formed. Fig. 1A shows the results with NDFα2. In the presence of 6.8- (lane 4) or 1.7-fold (lane 8) molar excess of NDFα2, sHer3 displayed a new band slightly above the free molecules, indicating formation of a complex. Under identical conditions, sHer2 gave no complex formation (lanes 5 and 9). In the presence of equal amounts of sHer2 and sHer3, addition of excess NDFα2 gave the same band seen with sHer3 alone, i.e. no stable ternary complex of sHer3•NDFα2•sHer2 was observed (lanes 6 and 10). Despite the presence of excess NDFα2 a large portion of sHer3 remained as a free molecule. Fig. 2B shows the results with NDFβ2 obtained under exactly the same experimental conditions. Here again, complex formation was observed only when NDFβ2 was mixed with sHer3 and no ternary complex was observed when sHer2 was also present. Comparing Fig. 1, A and B, it is apparent that a larger portion of sHer3 was incorporated into complexes with NDFβ2 than with NDFα2, suggesting that the NDFβ2 has a higher affinity for sHer3 under the experimental conditions used. We have also used size exclusion chromatography with on-line light scattering, refractive index, and absorbance detectors to explore the interaction of NDFβ2 with sHer3. As we have shown previously, by using the signals from all three detectors we can obtain the polypeptide molecular weights of glycoproteins and glycoprotein complexes (Arakawa et al., 1994; Philo et al., 1994). A significant complication in these studies is the fact that NDFβ2 interacts strongly with size exclusion chromatography columns, especially at physiological ionic strength (Lu et al., 1995). Therefore, a 0.5 M NaCl + phosphate-buffered saline eluant and a Superose 12 column were selected to minimize this problem when studying sHer3 and NDFβ2. When sHer3 was run by itself, its molecular weight from light scattering was 68,000 (our light scattering system normally gives a ~3% error in molecular weight measurement). When sHer3 was mixed with NDFβ2 at an 1:1 molar ratio, much of the NDFβ2 eluted as a complex with sHer3, but some free NDFβ2 was also seen. The peak of the complex eluted significantly earlier than the sHer3 control sample, and its molecular weight from light scattering was 80,000. This molecular weight is significantly lower than the theoretical molecular weight of an 1:1 complex (92,900). One possible reason for this is that the binding of sHer3 and NDFβ2 may be weak enough that significant dissociation occurs during chromatography. However, this is inconsistent with sedimentation equilibrium data (next section). A second possibility is that the high ionic strength of phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5 M NaCl may dissociate the complex. However, similar molecular weights were obtained for the complex when it was run using phosphate-buffered saline alone or phosphate-buffered saline + 0.3 M NaCl as eluant. We think the most likely explanation of incomplete complex formation is that the significant, competing interaction of NDFβ2 with the column matrix probably breaks the complex with sHer3 and causes some dissociation. This is supported by the fact that no complexes were observed when Superdex-200 or −75 columns, which interact more strongly with NDFβ2, were used. Sedimentation equilibrium provides a non-perturbing means of studying ligand-receptor interactions at true thermodynamic equilibrium. Furthermore, as we have shown previously, this technique is capable of detecting and quantifying binding interactions which are too weak to persist during chromatography (Philo et al., 1994). We therefore carried out sedimentation equilibrium studies of mixtures of NDFβ2 and sHer3 over a wide range of concentration and stoichiometry. Control studies of NDFβ2 alone were consistent with a monomer at the sequence Mr of 24,694. The data for sHer3 were also well fitted by a single ideal species, with no evidence for self-association to dimers or higher oligomers. From the buoyant molecular weight of 24035 [23976 and 24103] (values within square brackets indicate 95% confidence intervals), the sequence Mr of 68178, and estimates for the carbohydrate partial specific volume (Philo et al., 1994), it is possible to calculate that sHer3 contains 17.0% [15.0%, 18.5%] carbohydrate, for a total mass of 82.2 [80.2, 83.7] kDa. Fig. 2 shows some data for samples containing 6 μM sHer3 and either 3 or 6 μM NDFβ2. On such a plot, a single species will give a straight line with a slope proportional to molecular weight, and for mixtures of species the slope near the outer portion of the cell will primarily reflect the largest species which are present (only data for the outer half are shown). The dashed line on the plot indicates the slope expected for complexes with two sHer3 bound to one NDF; the solid and dotted lines indicate the slope for one sHer3 per NDF. Clearly both samples contain primarily the 1:1 complex. Furthermore, there appears to be little, if any, 2:1 complex in the sample made at that stoichiometry despite the high protein concentration (which should favor such complexes even if the binding of a second sHer3 is relatively weak). For more detailed analysis, sedimentation equilibrium data from 13 experiments were simultaneously analyzed to different binding models. These data covered a range of sHer3 loading concentrations from 400 nM to 6 μM, both 2:1 and 1:1 sHer2:NDF stoichiometries, and 2 rotor speeds. Consistent with the simple analysis presented in Fig. 2, a model in which sHer3 and NDF bind to form 1:1 complexes gives a good fit to all the data, with nearly randomly distributed residuals, as shown in Fig. 3, and returns a dissociation constant of 26 [17, 35] nM. We have also looked for evidence for the binding of a second sHer3 to the same NDF molecule by analyzing data using a binding model in which NDF has two sites that bind sHer3 independently with different dissociation constants. This analysis clearly showed that no significant amount of 2:1 complex (<~3%) exists in these samples, but could not rule out a very weak second binding site with a dissociation constant of 100-300 μM. To further explore the possibility of a second very weak interaction, we carried out further experiments at higher protein concentrations, reaching sHer3 concentrations >35 μM (>2 mg/ml). The inclusion of a second binding interaction in these high concentration data does not significantly improve the fit over the 1:1 stoichiometry model, and the analysis indicates that any such second binding site, if it exists at all, has a dissociation constant >1 mM. Similar sedimentation equilibrium studies were also carried out with sHer2 and NDF. When studied alone, sHer2 again shows no evidence of self-association, and appears to contain 19.3% [16.8, 21.2] carbohydrate, for a total mass of 86.1 [83.5, 88.1] kDa. Preliminary studies at sHer2 loading concentrations of 2-4 μM suggested a possible weak interaction with NDF, so further experiments were done at sHer2 loading concentration up to 23 μM, and at both 1:1 and 2:1 sHer2:NDF stoichiometries. Simultaneous analysis of 18 data sets gave a reasonably good fit to the 1:1 stoichiometry model with a dissociation constant of 19.6 μM [17.3, 22.0], i.e. about 1000-fold weaker binding than seen for sHer3. This fit does, however, show some systematic deviation from the experimental data, especially at the highest concentrations where the apparent Mr is somewhat below that predicted by the fit. Consistent with this pattern of deviations, the inclusion of a second interaction (to allow 2:1 complexes) only makes the fit worse, and fits to the two-site independent model will not converge because the fitting routine attempts to make the second dissociation constant become zero. The deviations from the model are consistent with some solution non-ideality (which would not be surprising at these protein concentrations), but might also be due to some heterogeneity related to glycosylation. We therefore conclude that the 1:1 binding model is correct. Since it has been reported that a coexpression of Her2 and Her3 on the surface of cells reconstitutes a high affinity binding site for NDF (Sliwkowski et al., 1994), it is interesting to ask whether the same phenomenon is seen in solution with the extracellular domains. We have examined the sedimentation equilibrium of equimolar mixtures of sHer2, sHer3, and NDF with each component loaded at 3, 1.5, or 0.3 μM. Control experiments on a mixture of sHer2 and sHer3 did not show any interaction between them in the absence of ligands. To interpret the data on the ternary mixtures, there are three general cases we need to consider. We have already demonstrated that NDF will bind strongly to sHer3 and weakly to sHer2, but does not induce dimerization of either receptor. Those studies cannot tell us, however, whether sHer3 and sHer2 are binding to the same, or different, sites on NDF. Therefore the first possibility to consider is one where the sites are the same or largely overlapping, in which case the low affinity of sHer2 will make it unable to compete with sHer3, so essentially no interaction with sHer2 will occur. A second possibility is that sHer2 may bind independently to a different “face” of NDF, and then we would expect to see some formation of sHer3•NDF•sHer2 ternary complexes, but the amount of ternary complex would be strongly limited by the weak NDF-sHer2 interaction. The last, and most interesting, possibility is a synergistic binding of sHer2 and sHer3 to the same NDF molecule, giving much more ternary complex than expected based on the weak binding of sHer2 alone. We can again get a good overall view of the results by looking at Fig. 4, a linearized data plot like that in Fig. 2, for a sample loaded with 3 μM of each protein. The solid line shows the slope expected for a sHer3•NDF complex, while the dashed line shows that for a ternary sHer3•NDF•sHer2 complex. Clearly there is no large amount of ternary complex formed, and the data are consistent with essentially complete formation of sHer3•NDF complexes, as expected at this high protein concentration. Therefore we can eliminate the case of significant synergistic binding of sHer2 and sHer3. On the other hand, if sHer2 is not bound at all, its lower molecular weight would be expected to reduce the slope below that for 100% sHer3•NDF, which is not seen. Therefore the data would be consistent with a very weak formation of ternary complexes. We have not attempted to directly fit to an appropriate ternary association model. Such a model would require consideration of 6 species with different molecular weights, and at least 3 binding constants, and is therefore exceedingly complex and unlikely to give unique results. However, to further confirm our interpretation that the sHer2 is binding only weakly, if at all, we first tried an analysis of the data for the higher concentration samples as a mixture of two non-interacting species: sHer2, and a sHer3•NDF complex. During this analysis, the concentrations were constrained to give the correct 1:1 molar ratio averaged over the cell. This model gave a moderately good description of the data (not shown), but seemed to somewhat underestimate the average molecular weight, particularly at the highest concentrations. We then tried a model where sHer2 binds to the sHer3•NDFβ2 complex with the same low affinity seen for sHer2 binding to NDF alone. This model clearly predicts too much ternary complex, and gives a variance 3 times higher than the non-interacting model. Last, we allowed the affinity of sHer2 for the sHer3•NDF complex to vary during the fitting. This latter model gives quite a good fit of the data, as shown in Fig. 5, and returns a dissociation constant of 99 μM [77, 128], i.e. 5-fold weaker binding than when sHer3 is not already bound to NDF. Thus this analysis confirms that there is no enhanced binding of sHer2 in the presence of sHer3. Instead, the binding of sHer2 actually appears to be weaker in the presence of sHer3, perhaps as a result of some overlap of their binding sites on NDF, or steric interference between the 2 receptors, or some negative cooperativity through the common ligand. Native gel, light scattering, and sedimentation equilibrium experiments have all demonstrated binding of NDFβ2 to sHer3, while native gels and sedimentation equilibrium detected little binding of NDFβ2 (or NDFα2) to sHer2. Both native gels and size exclusion chromatography/light scattering showed only partial formation of sHer3•NDFβ2 complexes, while sedimentation equilibrium showed stoichiometric 1:1 binding at moderately high (26 nM) affinity. We do not regard these results as contradictory; rather, they probably indicate that NDFb2 is rather easily dissociated by competing interactions with the polyacrylamide and dextran matrices. The 26 nM dissociation constant found here for the interaction of sHer3 with NDFβ2 is significantly different from the 1-2 nM values reported for the EGF domain of NDFβ1 binding to Her3 expressed on insect or COS-7 cells (Carraway et al., 1994; Sliwkowski et al., 1994). It is likely that the difference in temperature during the binding experiments (0 versus 25°C) accounts for a large part of the lower affinity in the present experiments, but there also may be significant differences between different NDF isoforms, between full-length NDFs and their EGF-like domains, and/or between the extracellular domain and the full-length receptor in a solubilized membrane. The present studies showing extremely weak sHer2-NDF interactions reinforce the proposal that Her2 is not a receptor for NDFs (Peles et al., 1993), and for the first time demonstrate and quantitate an interaction between Her2 and a ligand by physical techniques. Sliwkowski et al.(1994) have reported that co-expression of Her2 and Her3 in COS-7 cells creates a binding site for NDF with a dissociation constant 130 pM, about 10-fold lower than when Her3 is expressed alone. They also observed chemical cross-linking of Her2 to NDF when Her3 was also present. These data provide strong support for a model that a Her2/Her3 heterodimer represents a high affinity binding site for NDF. In contrast, our studies using purified receptor extracellular domains show no evidence for enhanced binding by the receptor heterodimer. Indeed, we actually find weaker binding of sHer2 to NDFβ2 when sHer3 is already bound. This striking difference in binding behavior may indicate that enhanced binding by a Her2/Her3 heterodimer requires the transmembrane and/or intracellular domains. Alternatively, it could indicate that the enhanced binding requires a third component which is constitutively expressed in COS-7 cells. It is interesting that the cross-linked complexes seen by Sliwkowski et al.(1994) have an apparent molecular mass in excess of 500 kDa, much higher than expected for a Her2•NDF•Her3 complex. They also observe complexes of this size when only Her3 is present, whereas we find no formation of Her3•NDF•Her3 or higher complexes even at very high protein concentrations. In this regard, it should be noted that Kita et al.(1994) have shown aggregation of Her3 receptor by cross-linking when Her3-expressing cells were stimulated with NDF. All this data suggests that a third component (presumably a protein) might be promoting oligomerization of Her family members on cell surfaces. In many cases, soluble receptors have been shown to dimerize upon binding to their cognate ligand, although the number of ligand molecules incorporated into the complex differs for different receptors. It is, therefore, quite significant that NDF does not dimerize the soluble receptor at least under the conditions used here, suggesting the possibility that dimerization is not the mechanism of Her3 autophosphorylation and signal transduction. However, if in fact, receptor dimerization is essential for receptor kinase activation, then these results suggest that components required for dimerization are missing in the experimental conditions used here. Alternatively, one or both of the soluble receptors studied here may be altered in such a way to have lost the capability to dimerize without losing the ability to bind ligand. The methods we have used in this study are not able to distinguish this presumed defect from the participation of other receptor domains or ancillary factors."

EPR spectra (X-band) on frozen solutions at 77 K were obtained on a Jeol JES FE-1 EPR spectrometer. All resonance Raman spectra were measured at room temperature with a spinning cell (1800 rpm; diameter = 5 mm), and Raman shifts were calibrated to an accuracy of 1 cm-1 using indene. Resonance Raman scattering was excited at 647.1 nm by a Kr+ ion laser (Spectra-Physics Model 2016) and an Astro-Med CCD 3200 detector attached to a single monochrometer (Ritsu Oyo Kogaku Model DG-100) (20Takahashi S.

Cyclic voltammetry and square-wave voltammetry were carried out using a Bioanalytical Systems Model CV-50W voltammetric analyzer with a Faraday cage. Modification of the gold electrode was carried out as described previously(21Kohzuma T. Shidara S. Suzuki S. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1994; 67: 138-143Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A single compartment electrochemical cell was used with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.) and a platinum wire counter electrode separated by a Vicor glass tip from the working solution. Controlled potential electrolysis of pseudoazurin was investigated with a Bioanalytical Systems Model CV-27 voltammograph. Electronic absorption spectra were monitored during the course of electrolysis using a Shimadzu spectroscopic flow cell. Oxygen was removed from the working compartment by passing humidified O2-free argon through the electrochemical cell for 15 min. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained for pseudoazurin in the potential range +600 to 0 mV versus NHE1 and showed a well defined quasi-reversible faradaic response, with a midpoint potential of Emidpoint = 260 mV versus NHE and a peak-to-peak separation of ΔEp = 59 mV at a 4-pyds/Au electrode at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2). The cathodic peak current (ipc Controlled potential electrolysis of pseudoazurin was also performed at a 4-pyds/Au mesh electrode, and UV-visible spectra were measured simultaneously at various electrode potentials (Fig. 4A). A decrease in the intense blue absorbance of pseudoazurin at 593 nm indicates reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I). Reoxidation of electroreduced pseudoazurin could be achieved, confirming that electron exchange of pseudoazurin occurs at the electrode surface without denaturation of the protein. Spectra observed at intermediate potentials are a measure of the ratio of oxidized to reduced forms present. Fig. 4B shows a typical plot of Eapplied against log([pseudoazurinred]/[pseudoazurinox]). The slope of the straight line is 61 mV, which compares favorably with the predicted nernstian value of 59 mV for a 1-electron process. At 25°C and pH 7.0 (0.10 M phosphate), the reduction potential (E‘0) of pseudoazurin from the potential axis intercept is 259.1 ± 0.2 mV versus NHE, which is in good agreement with the value of 260 mV obtained from cyclic and square-wave voltammetry. The pH dependence of the reduction potential of the protein displays at least two acid-base equilibria (Fig. 5). At the lower pH values, the behavior is similar to that observed for plastocyanin (23Segal M.G. Sykes A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 4585-4592Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Lappin A.G.

From the difference between the pKa values for amino acid residues in the two oxidation states of the protein, it is possible to determine, using Equation 1, the effect of protonation or deprotonation of specific amino acid residues on the redox potential of the protein(26van de Kamp M. Canters G.W. Andrew C.R. Sanders-Loehr J. Bender C.J. Peisach J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) : E′0(pH)=E′0(low pH)+(RT/nF)(∑iln((Karedi+[H+])/(Kaoxi+[H+])))(Eq. 1) where Kared,i and Kaox,i are the proton dissociation constants for the residues i in the reduced and oxidized proteins, respectively. Then the electrochemical data can be fitted to two pKa values of 6.6 and 10.4, respectively. In the case of plastocyanin, it has been demonstrated that protonation results in a loss of redox activity(27McGinnis J. Sinclair-Day J.D. Sykes A.G. Powls R. Moore J. Wright P.E. Inorg. Chem. 1988; 27: 2306-2312Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies on reduced plastocyanin at different pH values (3.8-7.8) have confirmed the effect as an H+-induced dissociation of His-87, resulting in the Cu(I) being coordinated by His-37, Cys-84, and Met-92 in a trigonal arrangement(28Guss J.M. Harrowell P.R. Murata M. Norris V.A. Freeman H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 361-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Similarly, the increase in reduction potential of pseudoazurin at the lower pH values is assigned to the protonation of the corresponding histidine residue (His-81, pKa = 6.6). At pH 11.3, the reduction potential of pseudoazurin is less, Emidpoint = 201 mV versus NHE, which is assigned here to a structural transition brought about by the acid dissociation of the -NH3+∈-amino group of Lys-77 (pKa = 10.4). A. cycloclastes Cu(II) pseudoazurin exhibits three intense charge transfer bands (λnm) at 452 (∈ = 1400 M-1 cM-1), 593 (∈ = 3700), and 753 (∈ = 1800) nm at pH 7.0. Recent works suggest that both the bands at around 600 and 450 nm in the visible absorption spectra of blue copper proteins correspond to S(Cys) → Cu(II) electronic transitions(29Han J. Loehr T.M. Lu Y. Valentine J.S. Averill B.A. Sanders-Loehr J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4256-4263Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Lu Y. LaCroix L.B. Lowery M.D. Solomon E.I. Bender C.J. Peisach J. Roe J.A. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 5907-5918Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The visible spectrum of Cu(II) pseudoazurin is not changed drastically in the pH range 4.6-10.4. At pH 11.3, the intensity of the peak at 593 nm increased (∈ = 3900), and that at 452 nm decreased (∈ = 1100), indicating a structural transition at the Cu(II) (Fig. 6). Han et al.(29Han J. Loehr T.M. Lu Y. Valentine J.S. Averill B.A. Sanders-Loehr J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4256-4263Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have pointed out that the sum of the ∈ values for these two bands is similar for most type 1 copper proteins. At pH 7.0, the sum of the two ∈ values at 452 and 593 nm for oxidized pseudoazurin is 5100 M-1 cM-1, whereas at pH 11.3, it is 5000 M-1 cM-1. This constancy of the sum is in agreement with the behavior of other blue copper proteins and confirms that the changes are not due to denaturation. The EPR spectra of the type 1 blue copper proteins can be either axial or rhombic. At pH 7.0, the spectrum of pseudoazurin shows a typical rhombic signal with anisotropic spin hamiltonian parameters, gx = 2.01 (Ax = 6.7 milliteslas), gy = 2.09, and gz = 2.21 (Az = 5.0 milliteslas) (Fig. 7A). The EPR spectra of pseudoazurin do not change with pH in the range 4.6-10.4, consistent with no active-site effect in the Cu(II) form of the protein. However, at pH 11.3, the rhombic signal becomes almost axial with anisotropic EPR parameters, g⊥ = 2.06 and g∥ = 2.20 (A∥ = 6.3 milliteslas) (Fig. 7B). Resonance Raman spectra of blue copper proteins are enhanced by excitation, leading to characteristic spectra with one or two vibrational modes in the 250-280 cM-1 region and as many as nine vibrational modes in the 330-490 cM-1 region. The modes at the lower frequencies are assigned to Cu-His transitions and those at higher frequencies to Cu-Cys transitions(31Blair D.F. Campbell G.W. Schoonover J.R. Chan S.I. Gray H.B. Malmström B.G. Pecht I. Swanson B.I. Woodruff W.H. Cho W.K. English A.M. Fry H.A. Lum V. Norton K.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 5755-5766Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A. cycloclastes pseudoazurin has its own unique spectra in the Cu-Cys region, with one strong peak at 392 cM-1 and an additional seven smaller peaks at 454, 439, 411, 383, 368, 353, and 335 cM-1 (Fig. 8A). There is also an isolated Cu-His mode close to 257 cM-1. The multiplicity of vibrational modes between 330 and 460 cM-1 has been ascribed to kinematic coupling of the Cu-S(Cys) stretch with deformations of both the δ(S-Cβ-Cα) and δ(Cβ-Cα-N) modes of the cysteine ligand(32Thamann T.J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10904-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The Raman bands of ν(Cu-S) are at 449, 424, 400, 383, 361, and 337 cM-1, and at pH 11.3, an isolated Raman band corresponding to Cu-N(His) is observed at 269 cM-1 (Fig. 8B). 2Resonance Raman spectra obtained for Cu(II) pseudoazurin do not show significant changes in going to the more acidic pH values. This is in agreement with the crystallographic studies carried out on poplar Cu(II) plastocyanin at different pH values, which give no evidence for changes in active-site bond lengths. These spectra indicate that the 439, 411, 392, 353, and 257 cM-1 Raman bands have been shifted to 449, 424, 400, 361, and 269 cM-1, respectively. These shifts to higher energy (˜10 cM-1) indicate that the Cu-S(Cys) and Cu-N(His) bonds are stronger and shorter than those observed for pseudoazurin at neutral pH. The transition occurring at pH ˜11.3 can be monitored by the effect of pH on the visible spectrum of the Cu(II) protein. It is referred to here as a blue copper active-site transition. The ratio (R) of the ∈ values at 452 and 593 nm is 0.38 at neutral pH and 0.28 at higher pH values (11.3). The value of R is believed to reflect the strength of the axial coordination(29Han J. Loehr T.M. Lu Y. Valentine J.S. Averill B.A. Sanders-Loehr J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4256-4263Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The larger R values indicate stronger axial coordination, leading to a distorted tetrahedral copper environment as in the type 1 copper site of nitrite reductase from A. cycloclastes (R = 1.22)(29Han J. Loehr T.M. Lu Y. Valentine J.S. Averill B.A. Sanders-Loehr J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4256-4263Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Lu Y. LaCroix L.B. Lowery M.D. Solomon E.I. Bender C.J. Peisach J. Roe J.A. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 5907-5918Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The smaller value indicates a weaker axial binding as in the case of azurin (R = 0.11), where the Cu(II) coordination is almost trigonal(15Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 1071-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum of pseudoazurin at pH 11.3 also suggests that the structural transition at pH 11.3 makes the axial coordination weaker and that the Cu-S(Met-86) bond is elongated compared with the situation at neutral pH. The axial distortion of the copper center is also supported from the Raman shifts (˜10 cM-1) of the Cu-S(Cys) and Cu-N(His) vibrational modes to higher energy at pH 11.3. As a result of the axial distortion, the copper atom lies more in the plane of the three equatorial ligands His-40, His-81, and Cys-78 (Fig. 9). It is significant that the trigonal to tetrahedral blue copper transition in the H117G azurin mutant leads to Cu-S(Cys-112) Raman bands coupled with cysteine deformations that are 10-40 cM-1 lower in energy(35den Blaauwen T. Hoitink C.W.G. Canters G.W. Han J. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12455-12464Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Andrew C.R. Yeom H. Valentine J.S. Karlsson B.G.

A trigonal geometry at the copper, with the S(Cys) lying in the plane formed by His-81, His-40, and Cys-78, is therefore the most reasonable structure for pseudoazurin at high pH. These results are also consistent with the relationship between the blue copper active-site transition and the electron transfer reactivity at an electrode including reduction potential variations brought about by changes in electron density at the copper center. Pseudoazurin shows a fast electron transfer process at the 4-pyds/Au electrode (ks = 3.2 × 10-2 cm s-1) and slower electron transfer at the positively charged 4-pydsH+/Au electrode surface (ks = 6.7 × 10-3 cm s-1). In the case of electrochemical experiments on cytochrome c, fast electron transfer of the protein is believed to be achieved by hydrogen bonding between the lone-pair electrons on a pyridine moiety at the electrode and positively charged lysine residues on the protein(37Armstrong F.A. Hill H.A.O. Walton N.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 407-413Crossref Scopus (678) Google Scholar). With pseudoazurin, electron transfer is faster at the 4-pyds/Au electrode than at a pyrolytic graphite (38Iwasaki Y. Suzuki M. Takeuchi T. Tamiya E. Karube I. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Kadoi H. Uchiyama S. Suzuki S. Electroanalysis. 1992; 4: 765-770Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) or glassy carbon (39Sakurai T. Ikeda O. Suzuki S. Inorg. Chem. 1990; 29: 4715-4718Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) electrode. The slower reaction at the pyrolytic graphite and glassy carbon electrodes is probably due to the presence of sites that are less active for electron transfer on a microscopic scale(40Armstrong F.A. Bond A.M. Hill H.A.O. Psalti I.S.M. Zoski C.G. J. Phys. Chem. 1989; 93: 6485-6493Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). At a 4-pydsH+/Au electrode at pH 4.6, the same two determinations were carried out and gave 6.7 × 10-3 cm s-1 and 301 mV versus NHE, respectively. The positively charged electrode surface does not interact as favorably with the positively charged protein, thus impeding electron transfer. In recent studies, the electron self-exchange rate constant for pseudoazurin has been determined by an NMR line-broadening technique and by cross-reaction studies with Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin, and a value of 2.8 × 103M-1 s-1 (average at I = 0.100 M and 25°C) was obtained(18Dennison C. Kohzuma T. McFarlane W. Suzuki S. Sykes A.G. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1994; : 437-443Crossref Google Scholar). In the case of azurin (P. aeruginosa), rapid self-exchange (7.0 × 105M-1 s-1 at pH 9.0) (41Groeneveld C.M. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 167-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to occur via the adjacent hydrophobic patch through which the His-117 ligand is exposed(26van de Kamp M. Canters G.W. Andrew C.R. Sanders-Loehr J. Bender C.J. Peisach J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 42van de Kamp M. Floris T. Hali F.C. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 907-908Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, pseudoazurin and higher plant plastocyanins have charged residues at or near the adjacent site and subsequently are less efficient at self-exchanging due to electrostatic repulsions. It is interesting to note that the plastocyanin from Anabaena variabilis, which does not possess an acidic patch, has a much larger self-exchange rate constant(44Dennison C. Kyritsis I. McFarlane W. Sykes A.G. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1993; : 1959-1963Crossref Google Scholar). In pseudoazurin, the cause of this repulsion is a number of lysine residues, in particular Lys-38, which is located in the middle of what might be described as the adjacent site (at around His-81) and in a similar position to the M44K residue of the P. aeruginosa azurin mutant(26van de Kamp M. Canters G.W. Andrew C.R. Sanders-Loehr J. Bender C.J. Peisach J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 42van de Kamp M. Floris T. Hali F.C. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 907-908Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The latter mutation has a drastic effect on the rate constant for self-exchange of azurin at low pH values. Another positive charge on pseudoazurin comes from Lys-77, which is adjacent to the Cys-78 ligand. This amino acid residue is located in a similar position to Tyr-83 in plastocyanin, which is in the middle of the remote acidic patch of the protein. In studies on cytochrome c2 from Rhodobacter spheroides, specific lysine residues have been proposed as a part of the binding site, their role being to create an optional orientation for electron transfer(45Long J.E. Durham B. Okamura M. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6970-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and a similar role for lysine residues in pseudoazurin is also possible. It has been reported that the negatively charged A. cycloclastes nitrite reductase complexes strongly with positively charged residues on pseudoazurin(21Kohzuma T. Shidara S. Suzuki S. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1994; 67: 138-143Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the case of the blue copper protein amicyanin, a recent electrochemical study has indicated that the reduction potential of the protein is shifted by 73 mV when complex formation with methylamine dehydrogenase occurs(46Gray K.A. Davidson V.L. Knaff D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13987-13990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex has been confirmed by x-ray structure analysis to have hydrophobic interactions between amicyanin and the enzyme(43Chen L. Durly R. Poliks B.J. Hamada K. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Satow Y. Huizinga E. Vellieux F.M.D. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4959-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It is possible that complex formation with nitrite reductase through the positive charges on pseudoazurin induces structural changes at the redox center, so that the reduction potential is tuned for a thermodynamically more favorable electron transfer.

Previous studies have indicated that c-Src preferentially autophosphorylates Tyr-416, a residue in the middle of the catalytic domain, in vitro, and that Tyr-527 is phosphorylated by the carboxyl-terminal Src kinase, Csk. However, indirect evidence suggests that c-Src may also autophosphorylate Tyr-527 as part of a negative feedback loop. While some in vivo evidence suggests that Tyr-527 can be autophosphorylated in an intermolecular interaction, it has not previously been possible to directly demonstrate significant autophosphorylation in vitro. Here we show that c-Src purified from recombinant bacteria can autophosphorylate Tyr-527 to high levels in vitro when incubated with sufficiently high concentrations of ATP (Km(Mg2+/ATP) ≈ 20 μM) that are well above those that have been used previously. In vitro Tyr-527 autophosphorylation can occur both as an intra- and intermolecular interaction; higher enzyme concentrations are required for intermolecular Tyr-527 phosphorylation than for Tyr-416 autophosphorylation.

Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Tyr-527 can be phosphorylated by Csk, and its phosphorylation is reduced 2-5-fold in transgenic Csk knock-out mice(2Imamoto A. Soriano P.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, some evidence points to a role for Tyr-527 autophosphorylation. Autophosphorylation could account for the 20-50% of the Tyr-527 phosphorylating activity that remains in mouse cells lacking Csk (2Imamoto A. Soriano P.

Okada M. Nada S. Nakagawa H. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 117-124PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of Tyr-527 is decreased in kinase-defective c-Src mutants, particularly during mitosis(5Bagrodia S. Chackalaparampil I. Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Nature. 1991; 349: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Shenoy S. Chackalaparampil I. Bagrodia S. Lin P.-H. Shalloway D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7237-7241Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the existence of a negative feedback loop that might be mediated by Tyr-527 autophosphorylation(7Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Some indirect evidence has been presented to suggest that c-Src might autophosphorylate Tyr-527(8Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but direct evidence for autophosphorylation of Tyr-527 in vitro is lacking. When incubated with ATP in vitro, c-Src preferentially autophosphorylates Tyr-416, a residue in the center of the catalytic domain, and not Tyr-527(9Smart J.E. Oppermann H. Czermilofsky A.P.

However, all in vitro Src-autophosphorylation studies of which we are aware have used ATP concentrations in the low micromolar range, presumably because of technical limitations imposed by the use of radioactive isotopes. Physiological ATP concentrations are significantly higher (>1 mM), and it is possible that Tyr-527 autophosphorylation might proceed efficiently at these concentrations. To unambiguously resolve this issue, we have investigated the ability of c-Src to autophosphorylate Tyr-527 in vitro using both immunoprecipitated proteins and proteins purified from recombinant bacteria (which are believed to contain no other protein-tyrosine kinases). We demonstrate that c-Src can extensively phosphorylate Tyr-527 by intra- as well as intermolecular mechanisms, implying that isolated c-Src molecules can down-regulate their own activity.

In situ dephosphorylation of Src prior to immunoprecipitation was achieved by incubation of digitonin-permeabilized cells in the presence of EDTA, as described previously(12Bagrodia S. Laudano A.P.

Western blots of lysates from transformed E. coli with anti-Src MAb 327 showed that c-Src(Y416F) was, as expected, expressed only in cells that had been induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (data not shown). About 10% of total expressed c-Src(Y416F) was soluble and found in the cytoplasmic fraction that was used as the starting material for purification. Cultures of E. coli DH10B carrying pLSc416F were grown at 37°C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to A600 = 0.3. Expression of c-Src(Y416F) was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM. After further incubation for 3 h, cells were collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet from 1 liter of cell culture was resuspended in 30 ml of ice-cold buffer (20% sucrose, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mg/ml lysozyme), and incubated at 4°C for 15 min. Then, 0.2 ml of 1 M MgCl2 and 1.2 ml of 6 mg/ml DNase I were added, and the cells were incubated for another 15 min. Lysis was completed by the addition of 10 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 M NaCl, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. After 10 min at 4°C, the suspension was sonicated 4 times for 15 s (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, sonicator model W375). The lysate was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for subsequent c-Src(Y416F) purification. All purification steps were carried out at 4°C. Proteins were precipitated from the supernatant by adding solid (NH4)2SO4 to 70% saturation, stirring for 2 h, and then centrifuging for 30 min at 15,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM thioglycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. c-Src(Y416F) was purified from the dialyzed sample by affinity chromatography on a polyE4Y1-Sepharose affinity column as described previously(15Zhang S. El-Gendy M. Abdel-Ghany M. Clark R. McCormick F. Racker E. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1991; 1: 24-30Crossref Google Scholar). Most of the c-Src(Y416F) kinase activity emerged in the 0.3 M NaCl eluate. This was used for subsequent immunoaffinity chromatography (16Feder D. Bishop J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8205-8211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on a column prepared by coupling anti-Src MAb327 to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma). Fractions containing protein-tyrosine kinase activity were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C. Wild-type c-Src for in vitro autophosphorylation experiments was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells (generously provided by R. Clark and F. McCormick, Cetus) as described by Zhang et al.(15Zhang S. El-Gendy M. Abdel-Ghany M. Clark R. McCormick F. Racker E. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1991; 1: 24-30Crossref Google Scholar) followed by immunoaffinity chromatography as described above. In vivo32P-labeled wild-type c-Src for tryptic phosphopeptide standards was prepared from NIH(pMcsrc) c-Src overexpresser cells as described(11Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at room temperature for the indicated times in a final volume of 50 μl containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM sodium vanadate, and the indicated amounts of ATP and kinase. Reactions were initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN). They were terminated by adding electrophoresis sample buffer containing 1% SDS and heating for 5 min at 95°C or, for the dilution assays, by precipitation with 20% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration), washing 3 times with ethanol/ether (1:1), and drying prior to resuspension in electrophoresis sample buffer. Phosphoamino acid analyses(17Revis-Gupta S. Abdel-Ghany M. Koland J. Racker E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5954-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), Cleveland digests with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease(18Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol.

Cell. 1989; 57: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. To avoid the limitations on ATP concentrations imposed by the use of radioactive isotopes, we measured Tyr-527 autophosphorylation in immunoprecipitates from Src overexpresser cells using 200 μM nonradioactive ATP and Western blots with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1). Essentially no autophosphorylation was detected in c-Src(Y416F/Y527F), a mutant that lacked the two primary tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 10). This indicated that the tyrosine phosphorylation that was observed in other c-Src mutants could be ascribed to phosphorylation at one of these sites. Cyanogen bromide digests of autophosphorylated 32P-labeled c-Src(Y416F) directly confirmed that Tyr-527 was the site of tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). In the presence of 200 μM Mg2+/ATP, immunoprecipitated, dephosphorylated c-Src(Y416F) autophosphorylated at Tyr-527 to levels similar to the steady-state levels observed in vivo (Fig. 1, lanes 1-4). This level has been shown by different methods to be >90%(4MacAuley A. Okada M. Nada S. Nakagawa H. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 117-124PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shenoy S. Chackalaparampil I.

Science. 1986; 231: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation at Tyr-527 by c-Src(Y416F) was completely abolished by pretreatment with FSBA (lanes 5 and 6). However, stoichiometric phosphorylation of FSBA-treated, kinase-inactive c-Src(Y416F) was observed in the presence of co-immunoprecipitated kinase-active c-Src(Y416F/Y527F) (lanes 7 and 8). This indicated that c-Src(Y416F/Y527F) was able to phosphorylate Tyr-527 of c-Src(Y416F) in an intermolecular interaction (in trans). The level of intermolecular Tyr-527 phosphorylation was similar to the level of Tyr-527 autophosphorylation observed with kinase-active c-Src(Y416F) alone (cf. lanes 4 and 8). We conclude that the in vitro reaction can phosphorylate most of the available Tyr-527 residues. Tyr-527 autophosphorylation of the c-Src(Y416F) mutant exhibited a Km for Mg2+/ATP of approximately 20 μM (data not shown). In agreement with previous results, little autophosphorylation was detected at ATP concentrations below 10 μM. Autophosphorylation of Tyr-527 (in c-Src (Y416F)) was at least 2-fold slower than autophosphorylation of Tyr-416 (in c-Src (Y527F)) at 200 μM ATP (data not shown). These results suggest that c-Src can autophosphorylate Tyr-527 to high levels at physiological ATP concentrations, and that this can occur by an intermolecular interaction. However, in spite of stringent immune complex washing conditions, as with prior studies, the possibility that the immunoprecipitates contained Csk or another contaminating exogenous Tyr-527 kinase could not be formally excluded. To unambiguously exclude the possibility that the Tyr-527 phosphorylation had been catalyzed by an associated kinase, c-Src(Y416F) was purified from recombinant E. coli, which carried pLSc416F, a c-src(Y416F) expression plasmid. E. coli was appropriate for this purpose since it appears to lack any endogenous protein-tyrosine kinase activity that could confound the interpretation of the experiments. Plasmid pLS4, which contains a lac UV5 promoter linked to the v-src gene, has previously been used for expression of v-Src in bacteria(21Gilmer T.M. Erikson R.L. Nature. 1981; 294: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Gilmer T.M. Parsons J.T. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2152-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). pLSc416F was constructed by replacing the v-src gene with the c-src(Y416F) gene (from plasmid pRLc416F, generously provided by B. C. Cobb, University of Virginia). The NaeI-MluI and MluI-Tth111I fragments containing the c-src(Y416F) coding region were isolated from pRLc416F and ligated into the homologous NaeI and Tth111I sites in pLS4. c-Src(Y416F) was purified from lysates of pLSc416F-transformed DH10B cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blots with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody showed that the purified protein contained negligible phosphotyrosine, possibly because of dephosphorylation during purification in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors (data not shown). The specific activity of the purified protein, using polyE4Y1 random oligomers of glutamate and tyrosine as substrate, was approximately 230 nmol 32P incorporated/min/nmol of c-Src(Y416F). Autophosphorylation assays were conducted using radioactively labeled [γ-32P]ATP to permit the position(s) of the autophosphorylated site(s) to be precisely mapped. Wild-type c-Src (purified from baculovirus) was autophosphorylated and analyzed in parallel as a control. Examination by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography showed, as expected, that Src was the only labeled protein present (data not shown). Autophosphorylated c-Src(Y416F) was subjected to multiple analyses to identify the autophosphorylated residue(s) (Fig. 2). Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that only phosphotyrosine was present (Fig. 2A). Cleveland partial digests with S. aureus V8 protease showed that the phosphorylated residue(s) were located within the V2 fragment consisting of the carboxyl-proximal 26-kDa fragment of the protein (Fig. 2B). No autophosphorylation in the amino-proximal 34-kDa region was detected under the conditions used. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide analyses of autophosphorylated c-Src(Y416F) revealed a single spot corresponding to the peptide containing phosphotyrosine 527 (Fig. 2C). Tryptic phosphopeptide maps of in vivo phosphorylated (Fig. 2D) and in vitro autophosphorylated (Fig. 2E) wild-type c-Src were used to provide standards for the locations of the phosphotyrosine 527- and phosphotyrosine 416-containing peptides, respectively. Spots corresponding to phosphotyrosine 527 as well as to phosphotyrosine 416 were observed with in vitro autophosphorylated wild-type c-Src (Fig. 2E). (Because of unavoidable inefficiencies in digestion and recovery of the tryptic peptides, the relative intensities of the spots do not necessarily correspond to the relative phosphorylation levels.) We conclude that c-Src(Y416F), purified from a source containing no other protein-tyrosine kinase activity, autophosphorylates itself primarily at Tyr-527 in the presence of sufficient (≥20 μM) ATP concentrations. Experiments with purified proteins showed that the Km for autophosphorylation of wild-type c-Src at Tyr-416 was −6 μM Mg2+/ATP, while that for autophosphorylation of c-Src(Y416F) at Tyr-527 was −20 μM. Dilution experiments with v-Src (22Gilmer T.M. Parsons J.T. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2152-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and platelet c-Src (16Feder D. Bishop J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8205-8211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) purified by immunoaffinity chromatography have indicated that autophosphorylation at Tyr-416 is intramolecular. On the other hand, in vivo experiments with c-Src mutants expressed in yeast indicate that autophosphorylation at both Tyr-416 and −527 in c-Src can be intermolecular(8Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Intermolecular Tyr-416 autophosphorylation was also demonstrated by mixing immunoprecipitates of kinase-defective and kinase-active c-Src mutants(8Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); this result was extended to Tyr-527 autophosphorylation in the experiment shown in Fig. 1. To investigate the nature of the autophosphorylation reactions in more detail, we performed autophosphorylation dilution experiments with purified wild-type c-Src and c-Src(Y416F). Autophosphorylation of fixed amounts of these proteins was assayed in different volumes of a buffer containing 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP/10 mM Mg2+ as well as 0.3% sodium deoxycholate (to minimize the possibility of aggregation). (Both protein preparations contained no detectable phosphotyrosine and had similar specific activities for phosphorylation of polyE4Y1 synthetic random oligomers (3,000-4,000 nmol/min mg).) If autophosphorylation were intramolecular, we would expect the level to be independent of concentration; if it were intermolecular, we would expect it to increase linearly with concentration. Quantitative analysis of the autophosphorylation levels by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography yielded the curves shown in Fig. 3. Incorporation of radioactive 32P into wild-type c-Src increased roughly linearly with concentrations in the range of 5-143 ng/ml. This indicates that much of the Tyr-416 autophosphorylation was intermolecular. The residual autophosphorylation in the (extrapolated) limit of zero c-Src concentration is larger than the amount that can be explained by Tyr-527 autophosphorylation, which suggests, in agreement with previous results(16Feder D. Bishop J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8205-8211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that there is also an intramolecular Tyr-416 autophosphorylating activity. In contrast, autophosphorylation of c-Src(Y416F) was essentially independent of concentration. To exclude the possibility that this result was an artifact induced by c-Src(Y416F) aggregation, we analyzed the most diluted samples using Sephadex G-100 Superfine column chromatography in the presence of protein standards of known molecular weight (glucose oxidase, −160 kDa, and bovine serum albumin, −66 kDa). Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and either Western blotting with anti-Src antibody MAb327 or silver staining (to locate the marker proteins). The Src proteins were detected in fractions containing proteins with molecular weights ≤66 kDa, indicating that they were present as monomers in the reaction. The concentration independence of Tyr-527 autophosphorylation indicates that most of this activity was intramolecular under these conditions. Previous studies showing that kinase-active but not kinase-defective c-Src is phosphorylated at Tyr-527 when expressed in yeast have suggested that c-Src can autophosphorylate this site(8Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, a clear demonstration of Tyr-527 autophosphorylation in the absence of potentially interfering cellular tyrosine kinases has been lacking. While autophosphorylation at Tyr-416 is readily observed in c-Src immunoprecipitates, significant Tyr-527 phosphorylation in vitro has not previously been observed. We have now shown that Tyr-527 can be autophosphorylated to high levels by c-Src in vitro. This was demonstrated with protein purified from recombinant E. coli, thereby removing the possibility that the phosphorylation was catalyzed by an associated protein-tyrosine kinase. The Tyr-527 autophosphorylation reaction has a Km for ATP of about 20 μM in the presence of 5-10 mM MgCl2. This is significantly higher than the ATP concentrations used in previous published studies of c-Src autophosphorylation, which probably explains why this in vitro reaction has not previously been observed to occur at a significant level. However, the Km is much lower than physiological ATP concentrations, so Tyr-527 autophosphorylation may well have physiological significance. In particular, it may account for the residual Tyr-527 phosphorylation observed in Csk-deficient mouse cells (2Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 3Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and for the decreased Tyr-527 phosphorylation level observed with kinase-defective c-Src during mitosis(5Bagrodia S. Chackalaparampil I. Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Nature. 1991; 349: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Even at high ATP concentrations, the Tyr-527 autophosphorylation rate is a few-fold slower than the Tyr-416 autophosphorylation rate. However, this still represents a significant activity that is capable of phosphorylating most of the available sites, at least in vitro. The ratio of autophosphorylation rates depends on the Src concentration since the Tyr-416 autophosphorylation rate is concentration-dependent, presumably a result of significant intermolecular autophosphorylation. The detection of intermolecular autophosphorylation in the dilution experiment is gratifying and consistent with earlier observation of intermolecular phosphorylation at this site in mixed immunoprecipitates and in cotransfected yeast (8Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). While the data suggest that some intramolecular autophosphorylation also takes place, our results contrast with earlier dilution studies with v-Src (23Sugimoto Y. Erikson E. Graziani Y. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and c-Src (16Feder D. Bishop J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8205-8211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (covering the same range of concentrations), which concluded that Tyr-416 autophosphorylation is strictly intramolecular. We do not know the reason for this difference. In contrast with Tyr-416 autophosphorylation, Tyr-527 autophosphorylation was primarily intramolecular within the concentration range tested in the dilution experiments. While our immune complex mixing experiments and previous yeast co-transfection experiments (8Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) indicate that Tyr-527 can be autophosphorylated by an intermolecular interaction (presumably occurring at higher effective concentrations than those tested here), the dilution experiment results show that significant rates of Tyr-527 autophosphorylation can be achieved in a unimolecular interaction. This implies that negative feedback by Tyr-527 autophosphorylation need not depend on local accumulation of Src molecules. The rate of unimolecular Tyr-527 autophosphorylation measured using purified protein was −0.2 mol PO4/mol of Src/min, corresponding to a t1/2 for Tyr-527 autophosphorylation of ˜35 min. Thus, c-Src, even in the absence of exogenous regulatory proteins like Csk, will only remain in an active state for a finite period of time after activation and Tyr-527 dephosphorylation. Although the Tyr-527 autophosphorylation rate is low, it may be functionally important if the competing dephosphorylation rate is also slow. This seems likely since dephosphorylation of Tyr-527 proceeds much more slowly in vitro than dephosphorylation of Tyr-416, 2S. J. Taylor, unpublished results. presumably because of protection by intramolecular association of phosphotyrosine 527 with the c-Src SH2 domain. In this regard, c-Src autoregulation may be similar to that seen in G proteins that have an intrinsic mechanism for time-delayed down-regulation. It will be important to determine whether there are proteins that act analogously to GTPase-activating proteins to accelerate Tyr-527 autophosphorylation and c-Src kinase down-regulation. Such proteins would clearly possess tumor suppressor potential. Finally, our results place the model of a negative feedback loop involving direct c-Src auto-regulation on firmer ground. We thank M. Abdel-Ghany for invaluable assistance in purification of c-Src(Y416F) from E. coli, B. C. Cobb for plasmid pRLc416F, R. Clark and F. McCormick for baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, A. Gupta and E.

The contractile vacuole of Acanthamoeba has been demonstrated to selectively bind the myosin-IC isoform(20Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 111: 1895-1904Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Myosin-IA and myosin-IB were found, using immunogold, to be associated along one side of fractionated membranes(21Baines I.C. Brzeska H. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), as though bound to proteins. Myosin-I could associate with other proteins on membrane surfaces via interactions with SH3. SH3 domains have been shown to mediate specific associations between SH3-containing proteins and various binding partners, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(22Prasad K.V. Janssen O. Kapeller R.

In each of these studies, bacterially expressed fusion proteins of SH3 domains were used as affinity ligands to selectively extract the binding partner from a cell lysate. Selectivity may be dictated by the structures of both the SH3 domain and its binding partner(32Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.D.

We report here one protein from Acanthamoeba, Acan125, which binds to the SH3 domain of myosin-IC and colocalizes with myosin-I on cellular organelles. GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion protein constructs were prepared from polymerase chain reaction products of SH3 domains of Acanthamoeba myosin-IC and human nonerythroid spectrin (fodrin). The DNA corresponding to amino acids 981-1031 of Acanthamoeba myosin-IC was amplified from the plasmid p4.5L (gift from T. D. Pollard, Johns Hopkins University). The polymerase chain reaction primers were 5′-CCGGATCCGCGCGTGCGCTGTA (sense) and 5′-GATGAATTCGACGTAGGA (antisense), which included BamHI and EcoRI sites in the sense and antisense primers, respectively. We subcloned the product into Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and verified the nucleotide sequence. The bona fide DNA was subcloned directly into the BamHI and EcoRI cloning sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia, Piscatawa, NJ). We received the sequence verified DNA for the SH3 domain of human nonerythroid spectrin (fodrin) corresponding to residues 974-1030 in the pGEX vector (gift from J. P. Albanesi, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Both constructs and the empty vector were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells for expression. GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The protein was eluted with glutathione, dialyzed, and stored at 4°C with NaN3 added. Proteins were stable as determined by SDS-PAGE during the time of the experiments. Acanthamoeba (~2 g) were harvested, resuspended in 2 ml of 0.5 × TBS (1 × TBS: 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3.7 mM KCl, 138 mM NaCl) supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and 1 mM dithiothreitol, and lysed with 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 400,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant passed through a 0.45-μm filter. A 0.5-ml volume of the filtrate was mixed with 0.2 ml of glutathione beads coupled with 250 μg of fusion protein for 15 min at 4°C. The beads were washed five times with 1.5 ml of 0.5 × TBS and then eluted with 0.2 ml of 5 × TBS. The proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against Acan125 in rabbits. Rabbits were injected with 10-30 μg of Acan125 cut from an SDS-PAGE gel (8 × 1 ×~0.1 cm) and mixed 1:1 with TiterMax adjuvant (Vaxcel, Norcross, GA). The rabbits were boosted twice with the same antigen and once with the excised Acan125 gel band in phosphate-buffered saline (12 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 138 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl). Control serum was collected before immunizing the rabbit. Antibodies to myosin were obtained from other laboratories. From T. D. Pollard (Johns Hopkins University), we received mouse monoclonal antibodies, M1.7 and M1.8, to Acanthamoeba myosin-I, and M2.42, to Acanthamoeba myosin-II. From I. C. Baines (National Institutes of Health), we received rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Acanthamoeba myosin-IC. These antibodies have been characterized elsewhere(20Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 111: 1895-1904Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 34Hagan S.J. Kiehart D.P. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2121-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Specificity of the anti-Acan125 antibodies was determined by Western blot. A whole cell lysate of Acanthamoeba was separated on SDS-PAGE and a strip of the gel was cut and stained with Coomassie Blue. The remainder of the gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and used for a Surf Blot (Idea Scientific, Minneapolis, MN) in which sealed wells of solution containing the antibodies overlay the filter. This creates lanes for antibody reactivity on a continuous blotting surface and eliminates the problems associated with aligning strips cut from a blot. Peroxidase coupled secondary antibodies to mouse or rabbit IgG (American Qualex, La Mirada, CA) were added to the wells, and the peroxidase reaction was developed on the whole blotting surface with chemiluminescent reagent (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Lysate (0.7 ml) of Acanthamoeba (described above) was mixed with 0.7 ml of 0.5 × TBS and with 20 μl of protein A beads alone (Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and Sigma) or an equal volume of protein A beads coupled with ~7 μg of IgG. The suspensions were incubated 60 min at 4°C with constant gentle mixing. The beads were recovered by gentle centrifugation (82 × g for 1 min) and washed five times with 1 ml of 0.5 × TBS. Proteins were eluted from the beads in 100 μl of 5 × TBS, separated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The blots were incubated with the primary antibodies indicated and developed using peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent reagent. M1.7 and anti-Acan125 immune serum in phosphate-buffered saline were directly labeled with fluorescent dyes(35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). M1.7 was conjugated with tetramethylrhodamine 6-isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and purified on G-25 (A548/A280 = 0.40), and anti-Acan125 immune serum was conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes) and purified on protein A (A495/A280 = 0.12). Acanthamoeba castellanii, Neff strain (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), were grown in normal liquid culture on polystyrene and split 12-24 h prior to staining. Cells (2-5 × 105) were seeded on polylysine-coated coverslips and allowed to attach 60 min in culture medium. One-step fixation was used(19Yonemura S. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 629-642PubMed Google Scholar); coverslips were immersed in 1% paraformaldehyde and methanol at −20°C and incubated 5 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS. For staining, coverslips were incubated 60 min in 110 μl containing 1.4 μg of rhodamine-labeled M1.7, 78 μg of fluorescein labeled anti-Acan125 IgG, and 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS. Fluorescence was observed with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope outfitted with 100X oil immersion lens and standard filter sets for fluorescein and rhodamine. Raw images were captured with a CCD camera, digitized, and stored on disk. Digital images were processed with Adobe Photoshop only to match backgrounds in the two channels and then printed directly by dye sublimation. To isolate SH3-binding proteins, affinity beads was prepared with the ligand being the SH3 domain of Acanthamoeba myosin-IC (SH3AmyoIC) expressed as a fusion protein of GST. The fusion proteins GST, GST-SH3AmyoIC, or GST-SH3HuFod (human fodrin SH3-negative control) were immobilized on glutathione beads and then mixed with a lysate of Acanthamoeba; best results were obtained using the lysate clarified by centrifugation at 400,000 × g. High salt was used to elute amoeba proteins without disrupting the association between fusion proteins and the beads. The same proteins that eluted from all beads containing fusion proteins were shown to be nonspecifically bound to the beads alone (Fig. 1). Specifically bound proteins were detected exclusively in the high salt wash from the beads containing GST-SH3AmyoIC (Fig. 1, a-d). Subsequent release of all proteins from the beads with SDS revealed that the same amount of fusion protein was bound to all beads and that no other proteins were specifically associated with SH3AmyoIC (data not shown). Thus, four proteins, Acan125, 2In a preliminary report (Zot, A. S., and Zot, H. G.(1994) Mol. Biol. Cell5 162A), Acan125 was incorrectly estimated to be 150 kDa. Acan62, Acan55, and Acan47 (Fig. 1), are reversibly associated with SH3AmyoIC. Acan125 was selected for further study because it was the least likely to be a proteolytic fragment, the most abundant, and the most well separated from other proteins on the gel. A large preparation yielded ~400 μg of the Acan125, which was sufficient for the production of antibodies and the attainment of microsequence data. Given that the SH3 of Src binds a proline-rich motif (10Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) and that a proline-rich region is present in the sequence of SH3-containing isoforms of myosin-I(5Pollard T.D. Doberstein S.K. Zot H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 653-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the SH3 domain of myosin-IC could interact with the proline-rich region of another, possibly uncharacterized, myosin-I. To determine if Acan125 is a myosin-I, we transferred Acan125 to a PVDF membrane for microsequence determination. Attempts to obtain sequence directly failed, indicating that the N terminus is blocked. The bound Acan125 was digested with endoproteinase lysC and the peptides separated by high performance liquid chromatography. Several peptide sequences were obtained (data not shown) and searches of protein data bases (PIR 42 and Swiss-Prot 30) did not reveal a match to a known myosin-I. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits immunized with Acan125 that was excised from SDS-PAGE. A single protein of 125 kDa was recognized on a Western blot of Acanthamoeba whole cell lysate using anti-Acan125 antibodies (Fig. 2); immune serum, protein A purified immune IgG, and blot purified antibodies gave identical results. On the same blot, mouse monoclonal antibodies to myosin-I (M1.7 and M1.8) recognized multiple bands of proteins (Fig. 2). Previously, M1.7 was shown to react with myosin-IA, myosin-IC, and myosin-II; M1.8 was shown to react with the same proteins plus myosin-IB(34Hagan S.J. Kiehart D.P. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2121-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The M1.7- and M1.8-reactive proteins on the blot of Acanthamoeba lysate (Fig. 2) correlate with the sizes of myosins, 130-190 kDa. The fact that the broad spectrum myosin antibodies M1.7 and M1.8 recognize proteins larger than the anti-Acan125-reactive protein is consistent with the assertion that Acan125 is not a myosin-I. To demonstrate that Acan125 interacts with myosin-I, we immunoprecipitated the complex from a lysate of Acanthamoeba using M1.7 and M1.8. The myosin-II antibody M2.42 was used as a control. Immunoprecipitations with M1.7 and M1.8, but not with M2.42, showed a single band of reactivity to anti-Acan125 antibodies on a Western blot (Fig. 3A). Thus, Acan125 is precipitated specifically by myosin-I antibodies, indicating that a direct association between the two proteins is likely. To verify Acan125 association with myosin-I, myosin-I was coprecipitated with Acan125 antibodies from a lysate of Acanthamoeba. Anti-Acan125 and preimmune sera were used to form immunoprecipitates, but only the anti-Acan125 antibodies coprecipitated proteins that reacted with M1.7. The blot shows at least two bands of M1.7 reactivity in the immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B), indicating that Acan125 interacts with more than one isoform of myosin-I. We identified one isoform, myosin-IC, in the lower band in Fig. 3B using antibodies specific for myosin-IC (data not shown); we have not yet identified a specific isoform of myosin-I in the upper band. The ability of anti-Acan125 antibodies to precipitate myosin-I isoforms from a soluble lysate suggests that complexes of Acan125 and myosin-I exist in Acanthamoeba. To assess potential interactions in vivo, we stained Acanthamoeba cells for both myosin-I and Acan125. Myosin-I was detected using M1.7 labeled with rhodamine, and Acan125 was detected using protein A-purified anti-Acan125 antibodies labeled with fluorescein. Rhodamine-labeled M1.7 staining of Acanthamoeba was characterized by diffuse fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm excluding the interior of vacuoles, by intense fluorescence in the nuclear region, and by occasional intense fluorescence circumscribing a single round structure (Fig. 4A). The same round structure was stained by fluorescein-labeled anti-Acan125 antibodies in double-labeled cells (Fig. 4B). Staining in the nuclear region by rhodamine-labeled M1.7 was observed in all cells (one cell is marked and two cells are unmarked in Fig. 4A). This fluorescence arises from intense staining of the nucleoplasm that surrounds a single large unstained nucleolus (visible in the unmarked cells in Fig. 4A). The nucleoplasmic staining is absent from identically prepared cells stained with unlabeled M1.7 and a labeled secondary antibody. Although the nucleoplasmic staining appears to be an artifact of the rhodamine-labeled M1.7, this provides a convenient internal control for the present experiment. The nucleoplasm is not stained with anti-Acan125 antibodies (Fig. 4B); however, the round structures in Fig. 4 are double-stained, revealing the colocalization of myosin-I and Acan125. These round structures appear to be similar to structures described earlier as vacuoles in Acanthamoeba stained with M1.7(19Yonemura S. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 629-642PubMed Google Scholar). But a more recent exhaustive study 3S. K. Doberstein, I. C. Baines, E. D. Korn, and T. D. Pollard, personal communication. indicates that M1.7 stains myosin-I on tubular structures known as amoebastomes, which appear similar to vacuoles in cross-section. All amoebastomes that stained with M1.7 also stained with anti-Acan125 antibodies in our experiments. No structures were observed to be stained exclusively by anti-Acan125 antibodies, and we found no more than a single organelle per cell to be stained by both antibodies. Colocalization of Acan125- and myosin-I-reactive proteins on M1.7-stained organelles, which are probably amoebastomes, further indicates the formation of a complex of myosin-I and Acan125 in the cell. Acan125 is presently the only protein aside from actin known to interact with myosin-I. However, we think it is likely that others will be identified including Acan62, Acan55, and Acan47, which bind myosin-I SH3 and do not react with anti-Acan125 antibodies on a blot. The SH3 domain of myosin-I may regulate or target myosin-I's interactions with these proteins in response to cellular signals. The presence of Acan125 and myosin-I in the high speed supernatant suggest that they are both present in the cytoplasm, and the immunoprecipitation results demonstrate that Acan125 and myosin-I are competent to form a complex. The complex may be recruited to organelle surfaces where attachment could be mediated by either Acan125 or myosin-I. A role for the complex will become clearer when a function can be ascribed to Acan125.

https://openalex.org/W2014861214,"PKR is an interferon (IFN)-induced serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). In addition to its demonstrated role in translational control, recent findings suggest that PKR plays an important role in regulation of gene transcription, as PKR phosphorylates IκBα upon double-stranded RNA treatment resulting in activation of NF-κB DNA binding <i>in vitro</i> (Kumar, A., Haque, J., Lacoste, J., Hiscott, J., and Williams, B. R. G.(1994) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.</i> 91, 6288-6292). To further investigate the role of PKR in transcriptional signaling, we expressed the wild type human PKR and a catalytically inactive dominant negative PKR mutant in the murine pre-B lymphoma 70Z/3 cells. Here, we report that expression of wild type PKR had no effect on κ-chain transcriptional activation induced by lipopolysaccharide or IFN-γ. However, expression of the dominant negative PKR mutant inhibited κ gene transcription independently of NF-κB activation. Phosphorylation of eIF-2α was not increased by lipopolysaccharide or IFN-γ, suggesting that PKR mediates κ gene transcriptional activation without affecting protein synthesis. Our findings further support a transcriptional role for PKR and demonstrate that there are at least two distinct PKR-mediated signal transduction pathways to the transcriptional machinery depending on cell type and stimuli, NF-κB-dependent and NF-κB-independent."

Chemical modifications performed with osmium tetroxide, chloroacetaldehyde, and diethyl pyrocarbonate revealed the presence of non-paired nucleotides on the “coding strand” at positions −209 through −217. These reactivities were induced by negative supercoiling, low pH, and magnesium ions. Downstream point mutations associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) altered the extent of the modifications and some of the patterns. Specifically, C−202 → G and C−202 → T significantly decreased the reactivities, whereas the patterns were increased and altered in the T−198 → C. C−196 → T and C−195 → G caused local decreases in reactivity. Modifications at the upstream flanking duplex were modulated by the composition of the vector sequence. In summary, our data indicates the formation of an intramolecular triplex between nucleotides −209 to −217 of the “non-coding strand” and the downstream sequence containing the HPFH mutations.

Human hemoglobin is synthesized from two sets of clustered genes designated the α-cluster (ζ-ψζ-ψα-α2-α1) located on chromosome 16 and the β-cluster (∊-Gγ-Aγ-ψβ-δ-β) on chromosome 11. Expression of the genes follows a developmentally, as well as tissue-specific, regulated program that allows ζ and ∊ to be transcribed during early embryonic life in placental yolk sac-derived red cells. At subsequent stages of development, globin expression shifts to the α and γ genes in the red cells of hepatic origin. At the time of birth, β-chains are predominantly expressed, and erythropoiesis shifts to the bone marrow(1Karlsson S. Nienhuis A.W. Annu. Rev.

This pattern of expression can be altered by mutations affecting any of the transcribed genes(1Karlsson S. Nienhuis A.W. Annu. Rev.

Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this protracted expression are not known, alterations in the recognition of cis-acting elements by regulatory factors and/or in the supramolecular assembly of chromatin have been invoked (4-7 and references therein). Ulrich et al. suggested that selected mutations in the −200 region destabilize a non-B DNA structure formed during the course of the γ-to-β switching(4Ulrich M.J. Gray W.J. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18649-18658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by the finding that some of the mutations abolished an S1 nuclease-hypersensitive site (S1-HSS) located just upstream, which suggested the formation of an intramolecular triplex (I.T.). This occurrence is interesting for several reasons. First, it is becoming increasingly evident that various types of sequence motifs, including simple repeating defined-order-sequences, have the potential of adopting non-B conformations and that these structural transitions occur in biological systems(8Sinden R.R.

Second, the isolation of DNA-binding proteins specific for pyrimidine-, or purine-rich, motifs are intriguing (12-16 and references cited therein) since these sequences are known to undergo conformational polymorphisms.

The mechanism(s) through which such aberrant expansions are carried out is unknown, but the propensity of defined-order-sequences to adopt multiple conformations suggests that these properties may be directly involved in the process(24Fry M.

Intramolecular triplexes have been well characterized in recent years and are known to form at mirror repeat oligopurine-oligopyrimidine tracts under the influence of negative supercoiling and low pH. Sequences of this type, but usually with imperfect mirror repeat symmetries, are often found at regulatory regions in eukaryotic genomes and have been proposed to participate in the regulation of physiological processes such as transcription and recombination. Additionally, some of these sequences have been shown to adopt I.T. structures under appropriate conditions(27Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F.

Here we extend the previous studies on the human γ-globin 5′-flanking sequence, which identified the formation of an I.T. based upon S1 nuclease and oligomer binding assays. By applying chemical probe analyses and two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, we now identify the bases associated with the Hoogsteen-paired third strand and describe the structural alterations introduced by the HPFH point mutations. Plasmid pγ-200 contains the sequence of the 5′-flanking region of human γ-globin genes from bp −228 to −189 inserted at the HincII site of pUC9. Plasmids −202G, −202T, −198C, −196T, and −195G harbor the same γ-globin fragment with the sequence diverging at the indicated position to reproduce the HPFH point mutations. The mutated inserts were cloned at the HincII site in −202G and −202T, and at SmaI in −198C, −196T, and −195G. The cloning was described previously(4Ulrich M.J. Gray W.J. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18649-18658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pγ-200S is as pγ-200, but the γ-globin insert was cloned at the SmaI site of pUC9. This was performed using synthetic oligonucleotides and standard procedures (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was amplified in the Escherichia coli strain DH5α and purified twice through CsCl banding. Na+ ions were exchanged for Cs+ by dialysis in 10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. DNA was stored in 10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. 12 μg of plasmid DNA was incubated with various concentrations of ethidium bromide from 0.1 to 4.0 μg/ml for 90 min at 37°C in 300 μl of J-1 buffer (10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol) in the presence of 26 units of topoisomerase I prepared from chicken erythrocytes according to the procedure of Germond et al.(35Germond J.E. Hirt B. Oudet P. Gross-Bellard M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1843-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Ethidium bromide was allowed to intercalate into the DNA for 30 min at room temperature before topoisomerase I was added. DNA isomers differing in their linking numbers were resolved on 1.2% agarose gels containing increasing concentrations of chloroquine from 0.1 to 400 μM(36Keller W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4876-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The average number of superhelical turns (y) introduced at each concentration of ethidium bromide (x) was described by the function y = 0.05 + 10.25x - 0.32x2 (r2 = 0.9990). Mean superhelical densities - were derived from -= yh/d, where (h) was the DNA helical repeat (10.5 bp) and (d) the size of the plasmid (2,750 bp). The concentration of ethidium bromide was determined by optical absorption using ∊343 = 40,000 M-1 cm-1. Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) (Fluka) was prepared as described(37Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 155-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The concentration of OsO4 was determined using ∊282 = 1,738 M-1 cm-1 and ∊250 = 3,116 M-1 cm-1. OsO4 was mixed with equimolar amounts of 2,2′-bipyridine (Sigma) just before use. 2.4 μg of plasmid DNA, corresponding to 72 μM of phosphate-DNA, was reacted with chemical probes in 100 μl of 50 mM Tris acetate, pH 4.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl. DNA was allowed to equilibrate at 22°C for 30 min before the modifications were started. OsO4 was used at 1.8 mM for 30 min at 22°C, CAA at 4% (v/v) for 3 h at 25°C, and diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) at 1.5% (v/v) for 15 min at 22°C. The modified DNA was separated from the unreacted chemical by filtration through spin columns of Sephadex G-50 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5.4 μg tRNA/100 μl. To visualize the modifications on the coding strand (top strand on Fig. 1A), DNA was cleaved with EcoRI, 3′-end labeled with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and [32P]ddATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq), and then cleaved with HindIII. For the modification on the non-coding strand, DNA was cleaved with BsrBI (located at about 40 bp 5′ of HindIII site), 3′-end labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and [32P]ddATP, and then cleaved with EcoRI. The restriction fragments containing the γ-globin insert were separated and purified through 10% polyacrylamide gels. Sites of modifications were cleaved by 1 M piperidine for 30 min at 90°C and resolved on 8% sequencing gels. Gels were fixed, dried, exposed to Fuji RX films, and quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using the ImageQuant software. Data were processed using the SigmaPlot program (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis was conducted as reported previously (38Collier D.A. Griffin J.A. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7397-7405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the buffer described for the chemical modifications. 4 or 30 μM of chloroquine were used in the second dimension. Fig. 1 shows the sequences analyzed in this study, the location of the S1-HSS, and a schematic model for the I.T. based on previous data(4Ulrich M.J. Gray W.J. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18649-18658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now extended these data using chemical probe analyses (OsO4, CAA, and DEPC) in order to detect perturbations at the bp level(27Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 28Lu G. Ferl R.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 29Mirkin S.M.

We examined the reactivities on the coding strand of the wild type sequence (pγ-200) by using OsO4, which reacts with the C5-C6 double bond of unpaired thymines(39Palecek E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Lanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 2A show a typical result. While relaxed (R) pγ-200, lane 1, did not show any strong reactivity, introduction of supercoiling (S, lane 2, - = 0.137) induced strong cleavages at thymines −209, −210, −212, −215, and −217. The percentage of modifications ranged from ~7 to 14 (Fig. 2B). Weaker bands were observed corresponding to thymines −227 and −228 (less than 1%). Modifications were pH dependent, being observed only at pH 4.5. At pH 5.0 or higher (up to 7.5 was tested), no appreciable signals were detected. In addition, reactivities were increased by the addition of up to 10 mM Mg2+ ions in a concentration-dependent manner (not shown). CAA forms ∊-etheno adducts with unpaired cytosines, adenines, and, to a lesser extent, guanines(37Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 155-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Supercoiling-induced cleavages were found at C-211, C-213, C-214, and A-216 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). However, these bands accounted only for 0.5-1.5% of the total radioactivity (Fig. 2B). Acid treatment of the samples, before piperidine cleavage, did not improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The sites of modification complemented those detected by OsO4 and suggested that the 5′ end of the single-stranded region was 3′ of A-219. The character of the flanking nt was determined by DEPC, a probe specific for unpaired adenines and guanines(37Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 155-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in lanes 5 and 6 of Fig. 2A, supercoiling-induced reactivities extended from A-216 to A-226, the strongest band corresponding to A-216 (0.94 ± 0.05% of the total radioactivity). Taken together, these data define two sets of accessible nt: a major site that extends from T-209 to T-217 that we interpret as single-stranded and a minor one, from nt −218 to −228, that we consider being weakly bonded (filled and open circles in Fig. 2A and Fig. 4C). These structural transitions are influenced by supercoiling, protonation at specific residues, and Mg2+ ions. Reactions with OsO4, CAA, and DEPC were conducted and visualized on the coding strand of plasmids containing point mutations associated with HPFH (Fig. 1A). Relaxed and supercoiled DNA (- = 0.137) were treated under the same conditions as pγ-200. The results demonstrated that the modifications occurred at the same residues as the wild type (not shown) but that there were quantitative differences, which are summarized in Fig. 3. Here the columns represent the percentages of the signals from OsO4 and CAA normalized to the wild type sequence. The major changes were caused by the G−202 and T−202 mutations, which produced a general reduction in modification; the consequences of the G−202 mutation were more severe than those of −202. −198C exhibited a 2-fold increase in modification at T-209 and T-210, whereas −196T and −195G displayed a modest reduction in modification at the middle residues. The normalization at A-216 with DEPC gave the following values: 0.00 for −202G, 0.38 for −202T, 1.19 for −198C, 0.91 for −196T, and 1.32 for −195G. Plasmids carrying the wild type sequence or the HPFH point mutations were reacted with OsO4, CAA, or DEPC, and the sites of cleavage were monitored on the non-coding strand. In response to supercoiling (- = 0.137), CAA modified C-205 and C-206 in the wild type sequence (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). A second set of reactive nt was present from A-217 to C-224. Since modifications at these latter positions were also detected on the coding strand (Fig. 4C), they support the interpretation of a locally distorted duplex DNA. However, in contrast to the coding strand, no cleavages were seen between purines −209 and −215. This strand-selective pattern of reactivity, together with the modifications at C-205 and C-206, is indicative of an I.T. Accordingly, the protected purines constitute the third strand of the structure, whereas C-205 and C-206 would be located in the loop (Fig. 1B and Fig. 7)(40Shimizu M. Kubo K. Matsumoto U. Shindo H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 41Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5950-5956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data with DEPC showed the accessibility of A-217, G-220, and G-223 (not shown). OsO4 modified the thymines spanning positions −216 to −226 to a moderate extent (Fig. 4B), confirming the chemical accessibility of the I.T. flanking sequences as well as that of the triplex-duplex junction (nt −217 and −218). -202G and −202T showed a marked reduction in reactivities (Fig. 4B) relative to the wild type sequence, confirming their destabilizing effect. −196T and −195G displayed patterns of modifications with CAA and DEPC qualitatively identical to that of the wild type. These mutants also showed a considerable reduction in reactivity at T-216 (Fig. 4, A and B). These results, together with those on the coding strand (Fig. 3), suggest that these two mutations perturb the overall geometry of the triplex structure, but do not change the sequence alignment. In contrast, the CAA-induced cleavages at C-205 and C-206 were not observed in the −198C mutant. Instead, signals were detected at C-204, G-203, and G−202 (denoted by asterisks in Fig. 4, A and C), indicating an alteration in the loop structure. This may be accomplished by a slippage of the purine-rich third strand relative to the Watson-Crick duplex or by multiple adjustments in the interactions among nt that retain their sequence alignment. In either case, it is clear that this mutation has profound consequences on the triplex structure. The increase in OsO4 modification at T-225 and T-226 in mutants −198C, −196T, and −195G relative to pγ-200 (Fig. 4B) was quite significant (3-4-fold). However, this behavior is not due to differences in the I.T. structures. A detailed analysis of these reactivities will be given in the last section under “Results.” Since the previous experiments were conducted at very high superhelical densities, they left open the question on whether mutations C−198, T−196, and G−195 had a significant influence on I.T. formation. To address this issue, OsO4 was reacted with a set of topoisomers spanning superhelical densities from 0 to −0.137. At each supercoil density, the percentages of cleavage on the coding strand (from T-209 to T-217) were totaled. Fig. 5A shows the results with pγ-200, −202G, and −202T; a substantial amount of free energy from supercoiling was required to form the I.T. even in the wild type sequence. In fact, at a superhelical density of −0.06, typical of plasmid DNA isolated from E. coli, only about 10% reactivity was detected. The results from −202G and −202T confirm their strong inhibitory effect. Panel B shows the results with −198C and pγ-200 (as a dotted line). Whereas the increase in modification for −198C may be attributed to the stronger reactivity at T-209 and T-210 (Fig. 3), the significant shift in - at 50% modification (0.068 ± 0.001 versus 0.078 ± 0.001) indicates that this mutation decreases the amount of free energy required for the duplex to triplex transition. On the other hand, the data for −196T and −195G, reported in panels C and D, respectively, do not show dramatic perturbations. We also conducted two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to assay for the relaxation associated with the DNA structural transition. Topoisomers of pγ-200 and all five mutant plasmids were separated on agarose gels in the same buffer solution used for the chemical modification experiments. Chloroquine concentrations of 4 and 30 μM were employed in the second dimension, which afforded the resolution of topoisomers up to 23 negative superhelical turns. A transition centered at 15 negative superhelical turns was observed; however, this was attributed to the formation of a non-B DNA structure in the vector. No transitions due to the duplex-triplex conversion were observed. Two explanations are possible: first, the transition may be too small to be detected in this range of topoisomers or, second, the I.T structure may be too unstable to survive the electrophoretic conditions. Reactivities to OsO4 on the non-coding strand and DEPC at the corresponding adenines were interpreted from a dynamic standpoint. Fig. S1 represents a bp in conventional duplex DNA. As bp opening depends on k1 and k-1, the two constants regulate the extent of modification at both residues. However, if Fig. S2 occurs, in which T may interact with a second partner (X) once in an open conformation, the reactivities will depend on k2 and k-2, in addition to k1 and k-1. This is expected to selectively increase modification at A, since this residue remains in an open conformation for a longer time than its partner T. If the percentages of cleavage are expressed as a ratio of T/A, values for A•T pairs involved in a type 2 process will be smaller than those progressing through Fig. S1.Figure S2:View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Table 1 shows the results for A•T bp −226, −225, −222, −219, and −216 for pγ-200 and mutant plasmids. The values varied considerably, from 0.7 to 66, but, with the exception of −216, they were relatively homogeneous at a given locus. The variations observed may be interpreted in terms of modulation in the accessibility to the reactants. In fact, not shown in the schemes are intermediate states in which a given bp may adopt distorted conformations and/or alterations in the stacking interactions with neighbor residues. These changes, which are favored by high levels of supercoiling and flanking non-B DNA structures such as the I.T., not only facilitate bp opening, but also increase the rate of chemical attack on partially unpaired conformations(42Buckle M. Fritsch A. Roux P. Geiselmann J. Buc H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 236-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Table 1 Open table in a new tab Locus −216 appears to be a different case. Here the low values, which spanned a greater range (0.7-6.3), were determined by an increased modification at A(open) (A-216) associated with normal or low cleavages at T (Fig. 4B and 6A) and are appropriately accounted for by a type 2 process. Thus, the ratio of T/A modifications is a measure of the relative chemical accessibility and hence the extent to which the A or the T residue has reassociated with another partner. We observed variations in chemical modifications among the mutants that did not correlate with the stability of the respective triplex structures. For example, the OsO4 modifications at T-225 and T-226 were ~3-4-fold higher in −198C, −196T, and −195G relative to pγ-200 (Fig. 4B), whereas an increase in stability was apparent only for −198C (Fig. 5). Since this behavior reflected the differences in the cloning sites for mutants, a comparison of OsO4, CAA, and DEPC reactivities between pγ-200 and pγ-200S was performed to resolve this issue. Fig. 6A shows the results from DEPC treatment of the coding strand. The tracings represent the signal from the supercoiled plasmids (- = 0.137) less the modification found for the relaxed DNA. Quantitation of the peak areas revealed that A-226 and A-225 acquired an ~2-fold increase when subcloned at the SmaI site (pγ-200S), whereas smaller differences were associated with the other residues. Also, the supercoiling-dependent modifications with OsO4 at T-227 and T-228 (Fig. 6B) revealed that greater signals were associated with the plasmids containing the γ-globin insert at the SmaI site. Hence, these data show that the flanking vector sequences are responsible for the reactivities at these positions, rather than the HPFH point mutations. These chemical probe analyses on the 5′-flanking region of the human γ-globin genes enable a molecular description of the I.Ts. at a level of detail previously not possible. The duplex to triplex transition characteristic of oligopurine-oligopyrimidine sequences is accomplished by the purine residues simultaneously engaging in Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds(27Wells R.D.

In general, the bound third strand may occupy a parallel, or antiparallel, orientation relative to the purine residues, depending on its sequence composition. Accordingly, a purine-rich third strand will be accommodated in the major groove in an antiparallel orientation, whereas a pyrimidine-rich third strand will occupy the reverse position. Therefore, stable hydrogen bonds may form between G:G, A:A, and A:T in the former case, and G:C+ and"

When PU.1 was added to the assay, a supershifted DNA band was found, indicating that PU.1 and NFY proteins bind to the same DNA molecule. We conclude that I-Aβ gene expression is repressed by PU.1 binding to the PU box domain. The PU.1 protein is an ets-related transcription factor that is expressed in macrophages and B lymphocytes. We present evidence that PU.1 binds to the promoter of the I-Aβ gene, i.e. a PU box located next to the Y box. Transfection of PU.1 in B lymphocytes or in interferon-γ-treated macrophages represses I-Aβ gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2080223187,"PotA protein, one of the components of the spermidine-preferential uptake system in Escherichia coli, was purified to homogeneity, and some of its properties were examined. PotA protein showed Mg2+- and SH-dependent ATPase activity. The specific activity was approximately 400 nmol/min/mg of protein and the Km value for ATP was 385 μM. The nature of the ATP binding site was explored by identification of the amino acid residue photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-ATP. It was found that 8-azido-ATP was attached to cysteine 26. In the spermidine transport-deficient mutant E. coli NH1596, valine 135 of PotA protein, which is located between two consensus amino acid sequences for nucleotide binding (50-57 and 168-173), was replaced by methionine (Kashiwagi, K., Miyamoto, S., Nukui, E., Kobayashi, H., and Igarashi, K.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 19358-19363). This mutated PotA protein could be labeled with 8-azido-ATP, but showed very low ATPase activity. To identify which cysteine is involved in the function of potA protein, cysteines 26, 54, and 276 were replaced by alanine, threonine, and alanine, respectively. Among the three mutated PotA proteins, the mutated PotA protein C54T only lost both ATPase and spermidine uptake activities. The results taken together indicate that the adenine portion of ATP interacts with a domain close to the NH2-terminal end of PotA protein, and active centers of ATP hydrolysis are located both within and between the two consensus amino acid sequences for nucleotide binding. Association of PotA protein with membranes was strengthened by the existence of channel forming PotB and PotC proteins. ATPase of PotA protein was inhibited by spermidine, suggesting that uptake inhibition by spermidine may function during this process.

ATPase of PotA protein was inhibited by spermidine, suggesting that uptake inhibition by spermidine may function during this process. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are known to be necessary for cell growth(1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3233) Google Scholar, 2Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus important to understand the mechanism by which the cellular polyamine is regulated. Polyamine transport is one of the important determination factors of polyamine content in cells. In Escherichia coli, polyamine uptake is energy-dependent, and the putrescine transport system is different from the spermidine (spermine) transport system(3Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3714-3723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 972-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, two transport systems for putrescine have been suggested in E. coli K12 grown in a low osmolarity medium(5Munro G.F. Bell C.A. Lederman M. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 952-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently obtained and characterized three clones of polyamine transport genes (pPT104, pPT79, and pPT71) in E. coli(6Kashiwagi K. Hosokawa N. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20893-20897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The system encoded by pPT104 was a spermidine-preferential uptake system and that encoded by pPT79 a putrescine-specific uptake system. Furthermore, these two systems were periplasmic systems (7Ames G.F.-L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 397-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) consisting of four kinds of proteins: pPT104 clone encoded PotA, PotB, PotC, and PotD proteins and pPT79 clone encoded PotF, PotG, PotH, and PotI proteins, judging from the deduced amino acid sequences of the nucleotide sequences of these clones(8Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20928-20933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Pistocchi R. Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Sadakata Y. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 146-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PotD and PotF proteins were periplasmic substrate binding proteins, and PotA and PotG proteins were membrane-associated proteins having the nucleotide-binding site. PotB and PotC proteins, and PotH and PotI proteins, were transmembrane proteins probably forming channels for spermidine and putrescine, respectively. In contrast, the putrescine transport system encoded by pPT71 consisted of one membrane protein (PotE protein) having 12 transmembrane segments (10Kashiwagi K. Suzuki T. Suzuki F. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20922-20927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was active in the excretion of putrescine from cells through putrescine-ornithine antiporter(11Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Suzuki F. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4529-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We also found that spermidine uptake by membrane vesicles was strongly dependent on PotD protein, and the uptake by intact cells was completely dependent on ATP through its binding to PotA protein(12Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we tried to identify the functional domain in PotA protein using the purified and several mutated PotA proteins. We found that 8-azido-ATP was attached to cysteine 26, and replacement of cysteine 54 and valine 135 by threonine and methionine, respectively, led to the loss of ATPase and spermidine uptake activities. The results also indicate that PotA protein is associated with membranes through the interaction with PotB and PotC proteins. A polyamine-requiring mutant, E. coli MA261(13Cunningham-Rundles S.

Appropriate antibiotics (30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 15 μg/ml tetracycline) were added during the culture of E. coli. Plasmids pPT104, pPT94, pMWpotAB, pMWpotA1B (V135M), pKKpotABC, and pKKpotA1BC (V135M) were prepared as described previously(8Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol.

Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) was used for the preparation of mutated potA genes (potA2 (C26A), potA3 (C54T), and potA4 (C276A)). The primers used for potA2, potA3, and potA4 genes were 5′-GGAATTCGCAAGGCCTTTGATGGTAA-3′, 5′-GCCCTTCTGGTACCGGTAAAACAA-3′, 5′-GGCCGCGAAGCTAATATTTACGTTA-3′ and their complementary deoxynucleotides. To obtain 1.5-kb mutated potA genes, PCR was performed using 5′-TAAGAGTCACCAAGGTGGTTAACC-3′ and 5′-CGGACGCACCTTGTGTGGCAACTT-3′ as the 5′- and 3′ primers, respectively. PCR products of the 1.5-kb mutated potA2, potA3, and potA4 genes were confirmed by digestion with StuI, KpnI, and SspI, respectively. The PCR products were then digested with EcoRI, and 1.0-kb fragments were ligated with a 5.8-kb fragment obtained from pMWpotAB.

Transformation of E. coli cells with various plasmids was carried out as described by Maniatis et al.(21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 250-251Google Scholar). The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab E. coli JM105/pKKpotA was grown in 20 liters of LB medium (21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 250-251Google Scholar) at 37°C. When cell growth reached A600 = 0.3, 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the medium, and the culture was continued for 3 h. The 100,000 × g supernatant (3.9 g of protein) was prepared as described previously(22Watanabe Y. Igarashi K. Hirose S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 633: 87-94Google Scholar), using Buffer A containing 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, and 20 μM FUT-175 (6-amino-2-naphthyl-4-guanidino-benzoate dihydrochloride), a protease inhibitor(23Fujii S. Hitomi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 661: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The proteins (2.5 g) precipitated with 50% saturation of (NH4)2SO4 were dissolved in Solution A (1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μM FUT-175, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.15 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and were applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column (4.6 × 13 cm) previously equilibrated with Solution A containing 0.15 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2-0.6 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, in Solution A (600 ml). The PotA protein was eluted at 0.4 M potassium phosphate, and the protein fraction containing PotA protein (110 mg) was concentrated by ultrafiltration. After the concentration of potassium phosphate was adjusted to 80 mM, the protein was applied to a Bio-Rad Econo-Pac Q Cartridge (5 ml) previously equilibrated with Solution A containing 80 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.08-0.4 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, in Solution A (200 ml). The fraction containing PotA protein (23.4 mg) was concentrated and chromatography with a Bio-Rad Econo-Pac Q Cartridge was repeated. Finally, 10.2 mg of PotA protein (95% purity) was obtained (Fig. 1). PotA protein was identified by Western blotting using antibody for PotA protein as described below. Mutated PotA protein (V135M) (12Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was purified from E. coli JM105/pKKpotA1BC by the same method. Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared by French press treatment of E. coli cells suspended in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, and 10 mM EDTA according to the method of Houng et al.(24Houng H.S. Lynn A.R. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured by the method of Lill et al.(25Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), except that the reaction mixture (0.025 ml) contained 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 10-50 cpm/pmol), and purified PotA protein or inside-out membrane vesicles. Spermidine uptake by intact cells was performed as described previously (4Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 972-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 10 μM [14C]spermidine as substrate. Inside-out membrane vesicles (100 μg of protein) were added to a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM CaCl2, and 4 μM 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (111 kBq) in a final volume of 0.1 ml and placed in a well on ice. The reaction mixture was irradiated for 3 min with UV light (12 watts) at 365 nm at a distance of 2 cm(26Hobson A.C. Weatherwax R. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7333-7337Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The samples were then centrifuged for 20 min at 150,000 × g, resuspended without boiling in Laemmli sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) with the omission of 2-mercaptoethanol, and subjected to electrophoresis on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-12% polyacrylamide gel. Autoradiography of dried gel was performed at −80°C using an intensifying screen. Photoaffinity labeling of PotA protein was carried out as described above except that the reaction mixture (0.1 ml) contained 40 μg of purified PotA protein and 50 μM 8-azido-ATP. Digestion of 8-azido-ATP-labeled PotA protein with 1-tosylamino-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was performed according to the method of Mimura et al. (28Mimura C.S. Admon A. Hurt K.A. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19535-19542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 0.8 μg of the enzyme. Peptides thus obtained were separated by HPLC as described previously (29Fukuchi J. Kashiwagi K. Takio K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22581-22585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide peaks absorbing ultraviolet rays at 260 nm were analyzed by automated Edman degradation on a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 477A) equipped with a phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (model 120A). The reaction mixture (1.0 ml) containing 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.16 mMN-[14C]ethylmaleimide (37 kBq) and 50 μg of protein of inside-out membrane vesicles was incubated at 37°C for 3 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of dithiothreitol at the final concentration of 1 mM. The proteins of membrane vesicles were subjected to gel electrophoresis (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) followed by fluorography(30Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 56: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (3036) Google Scholar). Radioactivity on dried gel was quantified by Fujix imaging analyzer Fuji BAS 2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.). Antibody for PotA protein was prepared as described previously(8Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20928-20933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the conjugate of the deduced carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acid residues (VESWEVVLADEEHK) of PotA protein and bovine thyroglobulin. Western blotting was performed according to the method of Neilsen et al.(31Neilsen P.J. Manchester K.L. Towbin H. Gordon J. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12316-12321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary structure of PotA protein was analyzed according to the method of Chou and Fasman (32Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) using the DNASIS program (Hitachi Software Engineering Co. Ltd). PotA protein was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The most purified preparation was found to be nearly homogeneous (Fig. 1). The molecular mass of the band was estimated to be 45 kDa, close to the deduced molecular mass (43 kDa) from the nucleotide sequence of potA gene(8Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20928-20933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal amino acid of the protein was probably blocked, since it could not be determined by Edman degradation. ATPase activity of PotA protein was dependent on Mg2+, and 10 mM Mg2+ was necessary to obtain the maximal activity (Fig. 2A). The ATPase activity was strongly inhibited by spermidine, and the function of Mg2+ could not be replaced by spermidine (Fig. 2B). Spermine, but not putrescine, also inhibited the ATPase activity. Since spermidine uptake was inhibited by the already accumulated spermidine, the inhibition may be in operation during this process. The specific activity was approximately 400 nmol/min/mg of protein (Table 2), and the Km value for ATP was estimated to be 385 μM according to the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Since spermidine uptake was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid(4Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 972-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), effect of the inhibitors on the ATPase activity was examined. As shown in Fig. 3, the ATPase activity of PotA protein was inhibited by NEM and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and the inhibition was restored by the addition of dithiothreitol.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Figure 3Effect of N-ethylmaleimide (A) and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (B) on ATPase activity of PotA protein.

Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the properties of PotA1 protein were examined. As shown in Fig. 4, PotA1 protein on the inside-out membrane vesicles was photolabeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP to almost the same degree as that of the normal PotA protein on the membrane vesicles(12Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the membrane vesicles did not have any ATPase activity (Table 2). The inability of PotA1 protein to hydrolyze ATP was confirmed with purified PotA1 protein. These results indicate that PotA1 protein is a mutant of ATPase activity. Purified PotA protein was photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-ATP in the presence of 5 mM Ca2+, in which the ATPase activity of PotA protein was inhibited. Then, the PotA protein was digested with trypsin and subjected to HPLC to separate the hydrolyzed products. Fig. 5 shows the peptide elution profile obtained by HPLC. There were two peaks showing an absorbance at 260 nm: one (peak A) was eluted at 11.3 min and the other (peak B) at 24.5 min. Since peptide B also showed absorbance at 275 nm and A275 was higher than A260, it was expected that peptide B contained tryptophan. The sequence of peptide B was MAINWVESWEVVLADEEHK, corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptide(360-378) of PotA protein (Fig. 6A). However, peptide A did not show strong absorbance at 275 nm, indicating that it contained the 8-azido-ATP photoaffinity-labeled amino acid. The sequence of peptide A was XFDGK (Fig. 5). The first amino acid was not identified and the others corresponded to the 27-30 amino acids of PotA protein (Fig. 6A). Thus, it was concluded that cysteine 26 was photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-ATP.Figure 6Structure and function of PotA protein. A, consensus amino acid sequences for nucleotide binding (sites A and B), photoaffinity-labeled amino acid with 8-azido-ATP (C26) and ATPase-deficient mutants (C54T and V135M) are shown in the figure. B, the secondary structure of PotA protein was analyzed according to the method of Chou and Fasman(32Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PotA protein contains three cysteine residues (Cys-26, Cys-54, and Cys-276). To identify which cysteine is involved in its ATPase activity, they were converted to alanine, threonine, and alanine, respectively, using site-directed mutagenesis on the potA gene. ATPase activity was measured using inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli JM105atp-/pKKpotABC, in which the potA gene was modified by site-directed mutagenesis. As shown in Table 3, only PotA3 (C54T) protein did not have significant ATPase activity. The other proteins A2 (C26A) and A4 (C276A) showed the ATPase activity. Since the amount of PotA4 protein on the vesicles was small (Fig. 7, C and D), the ATPase activity of the vesicles with PotA4 protein was lower than with PotA2 protein. When another PotA3∗ (C54A) protein was made, the vesicles containing the protein did not show any ATPase activity, in spite of its small amount (rapidly degraded) (data not shown). Spermidine uptake activity was measured using E. coli MA261 potA:: Km/pMWpotAB, in which potA gene was modified by site-directed mutagenesis. The uptake activity paralleled the activity of ATPase. E. coli MA261 potA::Km/pMWpotA3B showed very low spermidine uptake activity (Table 3).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 78-azido-[α-32P]ATP and N-[14C]ethylmaleimide labeling of normal and mutated PotA proteins.

In a foregoing paragraph, we identified cysteine 26 as photoaffinity-labeled amino acid. Thus, threonine 39 may be photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-ATP instead of cysteine 26 with regard to PotA2 (C26A) protein, as will be discussed later. The properties of PotA3 (C54T) protein were similar to those of PotA1 (V135M) protein. Although both proteins were photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-ATP, they showed very low ATPase activity. Next, the binding of [14C]NEM to PotA2, PotA3, and PotA4 proteins was examined. As shown in Fig. 7B, [14C]NEM could bind to the three mutated PotA proteins. When the amount of [14C]NEM bound to the mutated PotA proteins was calculated by measuring radioactivity and density of band from the data of Fig. 7, B and D, it was approximately 60-70% of that to the normal PotA protein. The results suggest that NEM can bind to all three cysteines (Cys-26, Cys-54, and Cys-276). The secondary structure of PotA protein was analyzed by the method of Chou and Fasman(32Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, the three cysteines are located at the turning region of the protein. It was tested whether membrane association of PotA protein is influenced by the channel-forming PotB and PotC proteins. Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli JM105/pKKpotA and JM105/pKKpotABC cultured in the presence of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Although the total amount of PotA protein was almost the same in both cells (Fig. 8A), the association of PotA protein with membranes was greatly stimulated by PotB and PotC proteins (Fig. 8B). The results indicate that PotA protein is associated with membranes through the interaction with PotB and PotC proteins. The spermidine-preferential uptake system belongs to periplasmic active transport systems (permeases), which consist of one periplasmic substrate-binding protein and three membrane-bound components(7Ames G.F.-L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 397-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the membrane components is a nucleotide-binding protein involved in energy supply. A model for the structure of the nucleotide-binding protein (HisP) in the histidine transport system was proposed by analogy to the adenylate kinase structure(33Mimura C.S. Holbrook S.R. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It was shown that site A (Gly-X-X-Gly-X-Gly-Lys) of consensus amino acid sequences for nucleotide binding is important for ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, MalK protein, the nucleotide-binding protein in the maltose transport system, has been purified to homogeneity, and it was reported that the specific activity of MalK protein as ATPase was approximately 130 nmol/min/mg of protein(34Walter C. Höner zu Bentrup K. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8863-8869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of PotA protein as ATPase was 396 nmol/min/mg of protein, higher than that of MalK protein, and the activity was inhibited by NEM. We found that cysteine 54, located in site A (GPSGCGKT), is involved in ATP hydrolysis. This supports the idea that site A is important for ATP hydrolysis(33Mimura C.S. Holbrook S.R. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We found that valine 135 is also located in the active center of ATPase in PotA protein. Replacement of proline 172 by threonine in site B (Pro-X-Val(Leu)-Leu-Leu-X-Asp-Glu) of the consensus amino acid sequences for nucleotide binding in HisP protein-stimulated ATPase activity(35Petronilli V. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16293-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Baichwal V. Liu D. Ames G.F. -L Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the active sites of ATP hydrolysis of the nucleotide-binding protein in periplasmic active transport systems are located both within and between the two consensus amino acid sequences for nucleotide binding. In MalK protein, cysteine is located at the equivalent position of cysteine 54 of PotA protein(37Gilson E. Nikaido H. Hofnung M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7449-7458Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When this cysteine was replaced by glycine, the transport activity did not change significantly(38Panagioditis C.H. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Boos W. Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23685-23696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that cysteine may not necessarily be essential, but still be important for the ATPase and transport activities. When ATPase activities of HisP and MalK were measured using proteoliposomes equivalent to rightside-out membrane vesicles, the existence of substrate and substrate-binding protein in proteoliposomes was essential for the ATPase activity(39Bishop L. Agbayani Jr., R. Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 40Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Structure of the nucleotide-binding protein in inside-out membrane vesicles or in free form may be different from that in proteoliposomes. We also found that cysteine 26 was photoaffinity-labeled by 8-azido-ATP. Cysteine 26 is the 24th amino acid from site A (GPSGCGKT) (Fig. 6A). It has been reported that histidine 19 of HisP protein is photoaffinity-labeled by 8-azido-ATP (28Mimura C.S. Admon A. Hurt K.A. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19535-19542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is the 21st amino acid from site A. The results suggest that the adenine portion of ATP interacts with a domain close to the NH2-terminal end of the nucleotide-binding protein in periplasmic active transport systems. When cysteine 26 of PotA protein was replaced by alanine, the mutated PotA protein was still photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-ATP. Threonine 39 in the mutated PotA protein might be photoaffinity-labeled by 8-azido-ATP instead of cysteine 26, since it has been reported that serine 41 in HisP protein was also photoaffinity-labeled in addition to histidine 19 in the presence of 5 mM Ca2+ and 10 mM Mg2+(28Mimura C.S. Admon A. Hurt K.A. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19535-19542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the pocket for ATP on the nucleotide-binding protein in periplasmic active transport systems may be wide. The results taken together indicate that the center of ATPase activity is located in the NH2-terminal portion in PotA protein. In fact, the NH2-terminal peptide consisting of 239 amino acids of PotA protein showed ATPase activity. 2K. Kashiwagi, H. Endo, H. Kobayashi, and K. Igarashi, unpublished results. It has been reported that the interaction of HisP protein with membranes was enhanced by HisQ and HisM membrane proteins(41Kerppola R.E. Shyamala V.K. Klebba P. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9857-9865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that the association of PotA protein with membranes was strengthened by the existence of PotB and PotC channel forming proteins. When the secondary structures of PotB and PotC proteins were compared, common amino acid sequences, LEAAR(K)DLGAS, were observed in the hydrophilic region(8Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20928-20933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sequences may be involved in the interaction with PotA protein. It has been reported that a similar amino acid sequence has been found in a hydrophilic loop of channel forming membrane proteins in periplasmic active transport systems(42Kerppola R.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2329-2336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)."

In this report we have investigated the function of a novel cis-acting element designated Kil (−204 to −188) which is located adjacent to the distal glucocorticoid response element, in steroid hormone-induced transcription of MMTV. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that cellular factors bind to the Kil element, and dexamethasone stimulation results in alterations in the binding pattern of proteins in this region.

Mutagenesis of the Kil sequence suggests that the entire Kil element functioning as one unit is necessary for hormone-induced transcription of MMTV. When placed in the context of heterologous promoters, neither Kil element nor glucocorticoid response element is able to induce significant hormone-induced transcription of MMTV.

These cells do not express a functional membrane CD14. The LPS response in SW480 cells was weaker and markedly slower than the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response. Pretreatment with TNF for 72 h inhibited both TNF, tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) p55, TNFR p75, and LPS-mediated activation of nuclear factor -κB (NFκB), whereas pretreatment with LPS only inhibited the LPS response. TNFR p55 antibody pretreatment resulted in marked inhibition of the LPS response, while pretreatment with TNFR p75 antiserum only had a weak inhibitory effect. Flowcytometric analysis showed that LPS binding as well as expression of TNFR p55 and TNFR p75 were not affected by LPS or TNF pretreatment, indicating that the observed inhibition is not due to reduction of specific binding sites at the cell surface. The results suggest that LPS signaling in SW480 cells involves intracellular components which may be depleted or inactivated via TNFR p55, indicating that the LPS and TNFR p55 pathways overlap. We propose that TNFR p55 can mediate activation of NFκB and cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer in SW480 cells via two distinct mechanisms, one which is activated only via TNFR p55 and leads to rapid activation of NFκB, and another which is overlapping with the LPS pathway.

Milsark I.W. Cerami A.C. Science. 1985; 229: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). LPS is a potent stimulator of monocytes and macrophages which respond by production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, eicosanoids(2Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Annu. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 417-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and nitric oxide(3Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar).

A wide variety of other cell types are also affected by LPS, and some of these cells do not express membrane CD14. Thus, LPS has been reported to stimulate arachidonate metabolism and surface expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells, and it can induce aggregation of platelets, stimulate cytokine release from mast cells and fibroblasts, and lead to generation of chemotactic factors in epithelial cells(8Lynn W.A.

TNF is also known as a potent inducer of NFκB as well as of other transcription factors including AP-1, NF-IL6, IRF-1, and NF-GMa(14Kronke M. Schutze S. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Immunol. Ser. 1992; 56: 189-216PubMed Google Scholar). NFκB belongs to the rel family of transcription factors which form a number of different hetero- and homodimers participating in the regulation of a large number of genes involved in the immune response(15Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). NFκB proteins are constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm, bound to inhibitor IκB, and are released and translocated to the nucleus upon phosphorylation and degradation of IκB(16Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A.

Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). Most likely, more than one IκB kinase is involved, and different stimuli lead to phosphorylation and degradation of different IκB species. Thus, while IκB-α is degraded both by TNF and LPS, IκB-β is only degraded in response to LPS and IL-1, but not in response to TNF(19Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). TNF can induce NFκB via two different receptors, TNFR p55 and TNFR p75(20Laegreid A. Medvedev A. Nonstad U. Bombara M.P. Ranges G. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7785-7791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In most cells, TNFR p55 is responsible for activation of NFκB(21Hohmann H.P. Brockhaus M. Baeuerle P.A. Remy R. Kolbeck R. van Loon A.P. J. Biol.

Ranges G. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7785-7791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but TNFR p75 signaling mechanisms are still poorly understood. Association of serine/threonine kinases with cytosolic domains of both TNFR p75 (25Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19687-19690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TNFR p55 (26VanArsdale T.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3043-3050PubMed Google Scholar, 27Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported, and recently, two cytosolic proteins which specifically associate with TNFR p75 intracellular domains were identified and cloned(28Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). However, no intracellular pathways activated by any of these proteins have yet been identified, and it is not known whether they are involved in TNF-mediated activation of NFκB. LPS-mediated activation of NFκB in monocytes is dependent on intracellular protein tyrosine kinase activity(29Geng Y. Zhang B. Lotz M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6692-6700PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, TNF-mediated activation of NFκB in lysates of the monocyte-derived cell line U937 was inhibited by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor(30Reddy S.A. Chaturvedi M.M. Darnay B.G. Chan H. Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25369-25372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, both LPS- and TNF-induced activation of NFκB is inhibited by the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (31Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 32Ziegler Heitbrock H.W. Sternsdorf T. Liese J. Belohradsky B. Weber C. Wedel A. Schreck R. Bauerle P. Strobel M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6986-6993PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that reactive oxygen intermediates play a role in both LPS- and TNF-mediated NFκB activation. So far, LPS signal transduction has been most extensively studied in cells expressing a functional membrane CD14. However, LPS effects on CD14 negative cell types may also contribute to LPS-mediated pathology. In the present study, we show that LPS activates the transcription factor NFκB and the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-enhancer in SW480 human adenocarcinoma cells which do not have a functional membrane CD14. Since both TNFR p55 and TNFR p75 independently activate SW480 cells(20Laegreid A. Medvedev A. Nonstad U. Bombara M.P. Ranges G. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7785-7791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we considered it important to compare the LPS signaling mechanism to the signal transduction pathways activated by the TNF receptors. The results demonstrate that TNF induces LPS tolerance in SW480 cells and that TNFR p55 and LPS may activate overlapping pathways. Human colon adenocarcinoma cells, SW480/β-gal (generously provided by Dr. Gerald Ranges, Miles Inc., West Haven, CT), contain a β-galactosidase (β-gal) gene under the control of the CMV immediate early promoter-enhancer(33Galloway C.J.

Espevik, unpublished results. was used as a control antibody. All mAbs were purified on a Sepharose goat anti-mouse IgG column (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Benzamidine (Sigma) was dissolved in 50% ethanol at 0.5 M and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) in isopropyl alcohol at 0.1 M. The β-galactosidase assay was performed essentially as described previously(20Laegreid A. Medvedev A. Nonstad U. Bombara M.P. Ranges G. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7785-7791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate conversion was measured as optical density (OD) at 570 nm. For pretreatment studies, cells were seeded out in A+ medium containing pretreatment reagents. After 72 h, the plates were washed three times in Hanks' buffered salt solution, and test reagents were added in A+ medium. Preparation of nuclear extracts and band shift analysis was performed essentially as described (20Laegreid A. Medvedev A. Nonstad U. Bombara M.P. Ranges G. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7785-7791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of nuclear protein from each sample were incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden), in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% Ficoll) (20 μl final volume) for 10 min at room temperature. Then, 17 fmol (1-5 × 104 counts/min) of end-labeled NFκB-specific double-stranded oligonucleotide probe 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′ (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 15-20 min. The samples were applied on native polyacrylamide gels (7% acrylamide, 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA, 2.5% glycerol) and run at 100 V for 1 h and then at 130 V for 2-3 h, after which the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat AR, Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 2-16 h. Specific band shifts were quantitated with a PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) by measuring the radioactivity within a rectangle enclosing the band shift in gel scans after exposures of 18-24 h. Radioactivity counts, which are a function of both gel exposure times and of the specific activity of the probe, were termed “PhosphoImager units” and were used to compare the relative amounts of radioactivity in band shifts within one gel. In order to control that a similar amount of nuclear proteins was applied for each sample, we (i) performed band shift assays with 32P-labeled OCT oligonucleotide (Promega) (5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′) which binds to constitutively expressed “octamer” proteins(37Sturm R.A. Das G. Herr W. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1582-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), or (ii) measured the intensity of nonspecific bands in the NFκB band shift. All samples were analyzed in at least two band shift assays. SW480/β-gal cells were pretreated with 10 ng/ml TNF or with 0.1 μg/ml Re595 LPS in A+ medium for 72 h before the cells were labeled with 10 μg/ml of biotinylated (B)htr-9 or Butr-4 and 0.2 μg/ml streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) as described previously(38Espevik T. Brockhaus M. Loetscher H. Nonstad U. Shalaby R. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Binding of FITC-LPS was estimated by adding 10 μg/ml FITC-labeled LPS from S. minnesota 6261 in PBS with 2.5% A+ serum (PBS-A+ buffer) to 1 × 106 SW480/β-gal cells for 40 min at 0-4°C. Background fluorescence was estimated by adding 6.2 μg/ml of FITC-goat anti-murine Ig (Becton Dikinson). After washing three times in PBS-A+ buffer, cells were analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Transcriptional activation of the CMV promoter-enhancer was measured in a reporter gene assay in SW480 cells stably transfected with a plasmid containing β-gal under control of the CMV promoter-enhancer(33Galloway C.J. Madanat M.S. Sarr T. Espevik T. Dumas M.L. Mitra G. Ranges G.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3045-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Treatment of SW480/β-gal cells with LPS resulted in strong induction of β-gal activity (Fig. 1) which shows that LPS can activate intracellular signals leading to activation of the CMV promoter-enhancer in SW480 cells. S. minnesota LPS was found to be several orders of magnitude more potent than LPS from Escherichia coli or from Pseudomonas. S. minnesota mutant Re595 LPS gave rise to a higher maximal response than wild type 6261 LPS, while the lipid A part of S. minnesota LPS showed very little activity on its own (Fig. 1). The LPS activity was strongly influenced by human serum which caused a dose-dependent enhancement of LPS mediated β-gal activity (Fig. 2A). The presence of neutralizing anti-CD14 mAb 3C10 completely inhibited LPS-mediated induction of β-gal activity (Fig. 2B), and we found that recombinant (r)CD14 could enhance LPS activity in serum-free medium (Fig. 2C). Recombinant LPS-binding protein (LBP) had little or no enhancing effect on the LPS response (Fig. 2C), and LBP did not further potentiate the rCD14-mediated enhancement of the LPS response (Fig. 2C). Taken together, the data indicate that SW480 cells do not express a functional membrane CD14 and that soluble (s)CD14 in human serum is necessary for the LPS response. The LPS effect was not mediated by TNF or LT-α as neutralizing antibodies against TNF or LT-α did not inhibit the LPS response (data not shown). Nuclear extracts from SW480 cells stimulated with LPS or TNF were analyzed for trancription factor NFκB. LPS was found to induce activation of NFκB in a dose-dependent manner, and S. minnesota Re595 mutant LPS was more potent than wild type(6261) LPS (Fig. 3). The response maximum of LPS was markedly lower than that of TNF. The finding that LPS and TNF both induce activation of transcription factor NFκB and activate the CMV promoter-enhancer in SW480 cells, raises the question whether these agents mediate their effects through similar intracellular mechanisms. In order to compare the LPS and TNF responses, we first analyzed the kinetics of NFκB activation for each of the stimuli. It was found that LPS activated NFκB at a significantly slower rate than TNF (Fig. 4, A and B). Activation of NFκB by TNF was clearly detectable at 10 min and reached a plateau level after approximately 45 min. However, LPS-induced NFκB activation was only detected after 60 min and further increased during incubations of up to 120 min (Fig. 4, A and B). Stimulation with LPS for more than 2 h did not significantly increase the amounts of activated NFκB (data not shown). In the reporter gene assay, LPS required at least 6 h to yield maximal response, while the TNF response reached plateau levels after 4 h of incubation (Fig. 4C), indicating that LPS also activates the CMV promoter-enhancer at a slower rate than TNF. These results suggest that LPS activates NFκB and CMV promoter-enhancer via mechanisms that are different from the TNF-activated mechanisms. LPS- and TNF-induced NFκB activation was further compared in a series of experiments where SW480 cells were pretreated for 72 h with either LPS, TNF, or agonistic antibodies against TNFR p55 or TNFR p75, followed by stimulation with LPS, TNF, or agonistic TNFR antibodies. Pretreatment of the cells for 72 h with TNF only marginally influenced the expression of TNFR p55 and TNFR p75 receptors (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, pretreatment of the cells with TNF or LPS did not affect the binding of FITC-LPS from S. minnesota (Fig. 5B). Band shift analysis of nuclear extracts from pretreated cells stimulated with LPS, TNF, or with agonistic anti-TNFR antibodies are shown in Fig. 6. The data demonstrate that the LPS response is inhibited by pretreatment with either LPS or with TNF or agonistic TNFR antibodies (Fig. 6, A and B), while the TNF response is only inhibited by pretreatment with TNF or TNFR antibodies and not by LPS pretreatment (Fig. 6, C and D). Activation of NFκB by TNFR p55 mAb htr-9 was inhibited by pretreatment with htr-9 or TNF (Fig. 6, E and F), while the TNFR p75-mediated response was mainly inhibited by p75 AS and TNF pretreatment (Fig. 6, G and H). Taken together, the results suggest that pretreatment with a given stimulus leads to depletion or reduction of active intracellular components involved in the signal transduction pathway induced by that stimulant. In addition, pretreatment with agents like htr-9 or TNF may also reduce the level of active components involved in signal transduction by other agents like LPS.Figure 6Activation of NFκB in pretreated SW480/β-gal cells by Re595 LPS, TNF, or agonistic TNFR antibodies. Cells were pretreated of for 72 h with either A+ medium alone, Re595 LPS (0.1 μg/ml), TNF (1 ng/ml), TNFR p55 mAb htr-9 (10 μg/ml)(35Brockhaus M. Schoenfeld H.J. Schlaeger E.J. Hunziker W. Lesslauer W. Loetscher H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), or with TNFR p75 antiserum p75 AS (dil. 1/100)(20Laegreid A. Medvedev A. Nonstad U. Bombara M.P. Ranges G. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7785-7791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and band shift analysis performed on nuclear extracts from cells stimulated for 2 h with different doses of Re595 LPS (A), TNF (C), htr-9 (E), or with p75 AS (G), followed by PhosphoImager quantitation of relative radioactivity in the slower migrating, p50/p65 containing complex B, D, F, and H (mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements of the same band shifts). Similar results were obtained by analysis of three other series of nuclear extracts from cells pretreated and stimulated as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In all experiments performed, inhibition of the LPS response by pretreatment with TNFR p55 mAb htr-9 was of a similar magnitude as inhibition by LPS pretreatment (Fig. 6, A and B), indicating that activation of NFκB by LPS is dependent on cellular components which are reduced or inactivated by long term stimulation of TNFR p55. Pretreatment with TNFR p75 antiserum led to a weak but consistent inhibition of the LPS response (Fig. 6, A and B) and thus, components activated via TNFR p75 may also be involved in LPS signal transduction. However, neither TNFR p55- nor TNFR p75-mediated activation of NFκB was inhibited by pretreatment with LPS (Fig. 6, E-H), suggesting that long term stimulation with LPS does not lead to a reduction or inactivation of components involved in either of these pathways. In contrast to the lack of inhibition of the TNFR p75 response by LPS, pretreatment with TNFR p55 mAb htr-9 caused a low but reproducible inhibition of the TNFR p75 response. This inhibition, however, was markedly lower than the inhibition of the TNFR p75 response caused by p75 AS pretreatment (Fig. 6, G and H). The TNFR p55-mediated response was not inhibited by pretreatment with p75 AS in any of the experiments. Thus, it seems that TNFR p55-induced activation of NFκB does not depend on components activated via TNFR p75. LPS- and TNFR-mediated activation of the CMV promoter-enhancer was compared by subjecting the cells to similar protocols of pretreatment and stimulation as described above. It was found that LPS-induced β-gal activity was markedly reduced after pretreatment with LPS or with the TNFR p55 mAb htr-9, while pretreatment with p75 AS had less inhibitory effect (Fig. 7A). The TNFR p55-mediated activity was almost completely abolished after pretreatment with TNFR p55 mAb htr-9 and very weakly inhibited by pretreatment with p75 AS, while pretreatment with LPS showed no inhibitory effect (Fig. 7B). Thus, pretreatment of the cells affected the subsequent activation of both the CMV promoter-enhancer and NFκB in a similar manner. The present paper demonstrates that LPS can induce activation of transcription factor NFκB, as well as activation of the CMV promoter-enhancer in the human adenocarcinoma cells SW480. These cells do not express a functional membrane CD14 because addition of LBP did not enhance the LPS effect under serum free conditions. Such lack of enhancement is a typical phenomenon in cells which do not express a functional membrane CD14(39Lee J.D. Kato K. Tobias P.S. Kirkland T.N. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 40Espevik T. Otterlei M. Skjak Braek G. Ryan L. Wright S.D. Sundan A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Other CD14 negative cells where LPS has been found to mediate activation of NFκB include the murine pre-B-cell line 70Z/3 (10Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells(11Read M.A. Cordle S.R. Veach R.A. Carlisle C.D. Hawiger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9887-9891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The LPS response in SW480 cells was strongly dependent on human serum and could be completely inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against CD14. Recombinant soluble (s)CD14 could only partly compensate for the human serum enhancing effect since the activity of LPS in the presence of rCD14 was markedly lower than LPS activity in the presence of 20% human serum. Thus, sCD14 is necessary but not sufficient for LPS activity, and other serum factors in addition to sCD14 are necessary for maximal LPS response in SW480 cells. LPS stimulates activation of NFκB at a markedly slower rate than TNF, indicating that the LPS and TNF signal transduction pathways are not identical. As shown earlier, the kinetics of NFκB activation by agonistic antibodies against the TNFR p55 is identical to the TNF kinetics with maximal levels reached after ˜45 min, while stimulation of TNFR p75 results in maximum activation after ˜60 min(20Laegreid A. Medvedev A. Nonstad U. Bombara M.P. Ranges G. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7785-7791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in order to reach maximum NFκB activation, stimulation with LPS has to be continued for a significantly longer period of time than stimulation of any of the TNF receptors, indicating that the LPS signaling mechanism differs from the mechanisms employed by the two TNF receptors. Supershift analysis showed that stimulation of SW480 cells with LPS or with agonistic TNFR p55 or p75 antibodies resulted in activation of an identical pattern of NFκB hetero- and homodimers. 3A. Lægreid and L. Thommesen, unpublished observations. Thus, SW480 is a cell system where the different pathways employed by LPS and the two TNF receptors can be compared, and where the question can be asked as to whether these pathways are independent or overlapping. Comparison of LPS and TNF signal transduction pathways was performed by analyzing activation of NFκB and the CMV promoter-enhancer in cells pretreated with LPS, TNF, or with agonistic antibodies against TNFRs. We found that pretreatment of the cells did not result in down-regulation of TNF receptors or reduction in the binding of LPS. Thus, it is likely that the observed inhibition of activation of NFκB and CMV promoter-enhancer is due to intracellular effects of the pretreatment analogous to depletion of protein kinase C by long term treatment with the phorbol ester PMA. Such treatment renders cells unresponsive to subsequent activation of NFκB by PMA, while the TNF response remains unaffected, indicating that TNF does not depend on PMA-responsive protein kinase C for activation of NFκB(41Meichle A. Schutze S. Hensel G. Brunsing D. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8339-8343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Johns L.D. Sarr T. Ranges G.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5877-5882PubMed Google Scholar). The results from the pretreatment experiments are in agreement with our previous results which indicated that TNFR p75 mediates NFκB activation through a different signal transduction mechanism than TNFR p55(20Laegreid A. Medvedev A. Nonstad U. Bombara M.P. Ranges G. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7785-7791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the TNFR p75-mediated response is maximally inhibited by pretreatment with p75 AS while pretreatment with TNFR p55 mAb htr-9 led to a markedly lower reduction of the TNFR p75 response. Furthermore, lack of inhibition of the TNFR p75 response by LPS pretreatment suggests that the TNFR p75-activated signaling mechanism is independent of components activated by LPS. Thus, the TNFR p75 pathway leading to NFκB activation is different from the LPS, as well as from the TNFR p55 pathway, although it appears to include intracellular components which are depleted or inactivated by long term stimulation of TNFR p55. TNFR p55, which mediates rapid NFκB activation, apparently employs a signaling mechanism which is independent of intracellular components activated by LPS or TNFR p75, since pretreatment with LPS or TNFR p75 AS did not inhibit the TNFR p55 response. On the other hand, the LPS response seems to be mediated by a pathway which is partly overlapping with the TNFR p55 pathway, since pretreatment with TNFR p55 mAb htr-9 inhibited the LPS response to a similar extent as the LPS pretreatment. The observation that TNFR p55 and LPS signaling pathways may be partly overlapping suggests that TNFR p55 employs more than one pathway leading to activation of NFκB in SW480 cells. Thus, our results suggest that TNFR p55 may activate one pathway which mediates rapid activation of NFκB and is independent of intracellular components activated by LPS or p75 AS, and another pathway which overlaps with the LPS signal transduction pathway. The stage at which the LPS and TNFR p55 signaling pathways overlap may involve ceramide, a lipid messenger which participates in the activation of NFκB in several cell lines including Jurkat(23Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), HL-60 (43Yang Z. Costanzo M. Golde D.W. Kolesnick R.N. J.

TNFR p55-mediated activation of NFκB in Jurkat cells as well as 70Z/3 cells has been found to proceed by ceramide generated by an acidic sphingomyelinase(23Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 44Machleidt T. Wiegmann K. Henkel T. Schutze S. Baeuerle P. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13760-13765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while TNFR p55-mediated activation of NFκB in HL-60 cells is reported to involve a 97-kDa ceramide-activated protein kinase which is activated via ceramide generated by a neutral sphingomyelinase(43Yang Z. Costanzo M. Golde D.W. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20520-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Mathias S. Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, LPS was found to stimulate ceramide-activated protein kinase in HL-60 cells directly, in the absence of detectable sphingomyelinase activity(47Joseph C.K. Wright S.D. Bornmann W.G. Randolph J.T. Kumar E.R. Bittman R. Liu J. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17606-17610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible reason for this LPS activity may be structural similarities between LPS and ceramide(47Joseph C.K. Wright S.D. Bornmann W.G. Randolph J.T. Kumar E.R. Bittman R. Liu J. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17606-17610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, ceramide-activated protein kinase may be an intracellular component putatively involved in both LPS- and TNFR p55-mediated NFκB activation in SW480 cells. Release of LPS during Gram-negative infections may induce high levels of circulating TNF which can lead to shock and death(48Waage A. Halstensen A. Espevik T. Lancet. 1987; 1: 355-357Abstract PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Our finding that TNF pretreatment inhibits LPS-induced NFκB activation may have important clinical implications as release of low TNF levels during Gram-negative infections could render cells resistant to subsequent LPS stimulation. This is supported by in vivo data showing that pretreatment of mice with TNF or IL-1 induces partial tolerance to LPS (49Erroi A. Fantuzzi G. Mengozzi M. Sironi M. Orencole S.F. Clark B.D. Dinarello C.A. Isetta A. Gnocchi P. Giovarelli M. et al.Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4356-4359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, release of low TNF levels during Gram-negative infections may have an important function in limiting harmful effects of LPS in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2022135311,"We have purified 3500-fold from rabbit skeletal muscle a 12,020-Da mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-enhancing factor (MEF) that stimulates both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) autophosphorylation and the rate (24-fold) at which the enzyme is phosphorylated by MEK in vitro. This was manifest by the finding that in the presence of MEF, molar equivalents of MEK to MAPK were sufficient to produce fully phosphorylated (2.1 ± 0.4 mol/mol; S.D., n = 3) and activated MAPK. This contrasted with the 40:1 molar excess ratio of MEK to MAPK required to produce fully phosphorylated and activated MAPK in the absence of MEF. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that in the presence of MEF, phosphorylation of MAPK by MEK was ordered, with Tyr-185 phosphorylation preceding Thr-183 phosphorylation. However, the rate at which Thr-183 was phosphorylated relative to Tyr-185 was greatly increased. The finding that MEF stimulated MAPK autophosphorylation and increased its ability to be phosphorylated by MEK suggests a mechanism of action in which MEF interacts with MAPK to alter its conformation. We have purified 3500-fold from rabbit skeletal muscle a 12,020-Da mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-enhancing factor (MEF) that stimulates both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) autophosphorylation and the rate (24-fold) at which the enzyme is phosphorylated by MEK in vitro. This was manifest by the finding that in the presence of MEF, molar equivalents of MEK to MAPK were sufficient to produce fully phosphorylated (2.1 ± 0.4 mol/mol; S.D., n = 3) and activated MAPK. This contrasted with the 40:1 molar excess ratio of MEK to MAPK required to produce fully phosphorylated and activated MAPK in the absence of MEF. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that in the presence of MEF, phosphorylation of MAPK by MEK was ordered, with Tyr-185 phosphorylation preceding Thr-183 phosphorylation. However, the rate at which Thr-183 was phosphorylated relative to Tyr-185 was greatly increased. The finding that MEF stimulated MAPK autophosphorylation and increased its ability to be phosphorylated by MEK suggests a mechanism of action in which MEF interacts with MAPK to alter its conformation.

Significantly, many features of the MAPK pathway in higher eukaryotes are conserved in the pheromone and stress response signal transduction pathways of fission and budding yeast(19Errede B.

To date, two tentative connections have been made. In one pathway, several laboratories, utilizing a combination of overexpression and antisense techniques, have identified p74raf-1 and possibly its homologs A-Raf and B-Raf as activators of MEK in vitro(23Dent P.

In yeast, an alternative pathway suggests that MEKs are activated by heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors via the activation of STE-11 homologs of MEK kinases (MEKKs)(19Errede B. Levine D.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3277-3281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a 50-60-kDa insulin-stimulated MEK kinase (I-MEKK) in isolated adipocytes (49Haystead T.A.J. Dent P. Wu J. Haystead C.M.M. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and NIH 3T3 cells(29Reuter C.W. Cattling A.D. Jelnek T. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7644-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The existence of multiple MEK-activating pathways has led to the hypothesis that MEK acts as a signaling convergence point, explaining how so many diverse cellular agonists can activate MAPKs.Our laboratory has had a long standing interest in the mechanism by which insulin both activates and then inactivates MAPK in vivo. We recently identified in isolated adipocytes a MEK kinase (I-MEKK) that, like MEK and MAPK, showed acute phasic activity kinetics in response to the hormone(50Haystead C.M. Gregory P. Shirazi A. Fadden P. Mosse C. Dent P. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12804-12808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since this initial report, we have made several unsuccessful attempts to purify I-MEKK from insulin-treated adipocytes. Although I-MEKK remains stable over anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography, further purification results in immediate loss of all activity. These findings led us to conclude that activation of MEK by MEK kinases in vitro requires additional factors that are lost in subsequent purification steps. Accumulating genetic evidence in yeast may support this hypothesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the conserved MAPK module, comprising STE-11 (MEKK), STE-7 (MEK), and FUS-3 (MAPK), requires a fourth protein, STE-5, to mediate pheromone responses ((51Choi K.-Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); see also (52Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80 (– and references therein): 187-197,Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar)). In the module, STE-5 has been proposed to tether these protein kinases together in order to bring about their sequential activation. If an STE-5-like protein exits to activate MEK in higher eukaryotes, this might also explain discrepancies we have observed in the mechanism by which MEK activates MAPK in vitro. We had reported earlier that in the presence of catalytic amounts of purified MEK, the Tyr-185 phosphorylated form of MAPK accumulated. To produce the fully activated and phosphorylated form of MAPK, repeated additions of purified MEK were required(49Haystead T.A.J. Dent P. Wu J. Haystead C.M.M. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). From this study, we concluded that phosphorylation of MAPK by MEK was ordered, with Tyr-185 phosphorylation preceding Thr-183 phosphorylation. Recently, Goldsmith and co-workers (53Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) solved the apo structure of p42MAPK to 2.3-Å resolution. In the apo structure, Tyr-185 is buried in a hydrophobic pocket near the ATP-binding cleft, whereas Thr-183 is exposed on the surface of the enzyme. These findings are paradoxical since the apo structure would indicate that MEK is unlikely to phosphorylate MAPK on Tyr-185 first. Taken together, these observations strongly support the hypothesis that additional factors may be required for the activation of MAPK and possibly MEK. In this paper, we report the purification of a 12,020-Da protein that potently enhances the activation of MAPK by MEK. We propose that our findings have general implications for some of the models currently proposed for MAPK activation in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRecombinant p42MAPK was purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)[pET-MK](49Haystead T.A.J. Dent P. Wu J. Haystead C.M.M. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Native MEK was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously(54Haystead C.M.M. Gregory P. Sturgill T.W. Haystead T.A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The pGEX-2T plasmids expressing wild-type recombinant MEK1, S218D/S222D MEK1, and KR52 MAPK were a gift from Dr. Andrew Cattling (Department of Microbiology, University of Virginia).MethodsPreparation of Recombinant GST-MEK Fusion ProteinsDH5α cells transformed with the respective pGEX-2T MEK plasmid were streaked onto LB plates containing ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37°C. Six 4-ml cultures containing LB broth, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and a single colony of E. coli were grown overnight at 37°C. Six flasks containing 1 liter of LB broth and 50 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated with the overnight culture and grown at 37°C to an absorbance of 600. Cells were induced with 30 μM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 10 h at room temperature and then centrifuged at 3600 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The pellet was stored overnight at −20°C. The thawed pellet was resuspended in 45 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM benzamidine), lysed with 2 mg/ml lysozyme, incubated on ice for 15 min, sonicated for 3 min, and then centrifuged at 14,500 × g for 30 min at 4°C. 1.0 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads at 50% (v/v) beads/lysis buffer was added to the supernatant and rotated overnight at 4°C. The beads were centrifuged at 200 × g and washed four times with 25 ml of lysis buffer. The GST-MEK fusion protein was eluted with 6 ml of 5 mM glutathione, 50 mM Tris, pH 8. The protein was dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of Tris buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.3, 1.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM benzamidine) and applied to a Waters Protein-Pak Q AP-1 anion-exchange column equilibrated in buffer A (50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 1.5 mM EGTA, 150 μM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM benzamidine). The column was developed with a 400 mM linear salt gradient (200 ml), and 2.0-ml fractions were assayed for activation of MAPK(54Haystead C.M.M. Gregory P. Sturgill T.W. Haystead T.A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The peak of activity was pooled and concentrated under a vacuum to a 1-ml volume. Glycerol was added to 50% (v/v), and protein was stored at −20°C.Preparation of MEFA fed female New Zealand White rabbit was euthanized by lethal injection with phenobarbital via the marginal ear vein. The back and hind limb skeletal muscle (300 g, wet weight) were rapidly excised, minced, and homogenized at 4°C with 2.5 volumes of buffer B (50 mM β-glycerophosphate pH 7.3, 1.5 mM EGTA, 0.15 μM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM benzamidine). All subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant was applied to a FFQ-Sepharose column (20 × 50 cm; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed extensively until the absorbance at 280 nm of the eluate was <0.005 and then developed with the indicated salt gradient (see Fig. 2). The most active fractions of MEF were pooled (1500 ml) and concentrated successively to 10 ml in an Amicon 400-ml stirred cell using a Diaflo YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Inc.) followed by vacuum concentration. Concentrated MEF was further purified by successive applications to a Waters SW300 gel filtration column equilibrated in buffer C (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 μM microcystin, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) containing 150 mM NaCl (see Fig. 3). The most active column fractions were pooled, heated at 90°C for 5 min, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g. Following concentration to 1.0 ml, the extract was applied to a Waters Nova-Pak C8 reverse-phase column (3.9 × 150 mm) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was developed as described (see Fig. 4A). For further purification, the most active fractions were pooled and reapplied to a Waters Nova-Pak C18 reverse-phase column (3.9 × 150 mm) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the column was developed as described (see Fig. 4B).Figure 3:Gel filtration analysis of MEF activity. A concentrated sample (200 μl) of the column wash from anion-exchange chromatography containing MEF activity was applied to a Waters SW300 gel filtration column (8.0 × 300 mm), and the column was developed at 1.0 ml/min. Column fractions (200 μl) were assayed for MAPK activity in the presence (○) or absence (▵) of S218D/S222D MEK1. Molecular mass markers were as follows: 150 kDa, aldolase; 69 kDa, bovine serum albumin; 42 kDa, MAPK; 12 kDa, MEF; and 8 kDa, aprotinin. Data shown are from a single experiment; however, this was repeated with identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4:Reverse-phase chromatography of MEF. Heat-treated MEF was purified to homogeneity over C8 (A) and then C18 (B) reverse-phase columns developed (1.0 ml/min) with the indicated gradients of O.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water and acetonitrile. In A, MEF activity was measured on column fractions following microdialysis against buffer C. In B, peaks of absorbance were collected by hand, and MEF activity was measured following microdialysis against buffer C. Absorbance was measured by an on-line photodiode array detector at 214 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Assay of MEF ActivityMEF activity was determined by its ability to enhance the activity of MEK toward MAPK. Two types of assay were utilized, either a two-stage robotic assay that measured activation of MAPK or direct phosphorylation of MAPK. In the two-stage robotic assay, 20 μl of column fraction was placed into microtiter plate wells, and the reaction was started by the addition of 40 μl of buffer C containing 0.6 μg of p42MAPK, 0.6 μg of MEK, 300 μM ATP, 7.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 μM microcystin. After 10 min at 22.5°C, the robot removed 20 μl and placed this into a second set of wells containing 5 μg of myelin basic protein, 300 μM [γ-32P]ATP (250 cpm/pmol), and 7.5 mM MgCl2 in buffer C. The reaction was terminated after 5 min by the addition of 20 μl of 100 mM H3PO4. The reactions (40 μl) were spotted onto P-81 paper (Whatman) and washed four times in 100 mM H3PO4, and the amount of radioactivity incorporated into myelin basic protein was determined by scintillation counting. To measure endogenous MEK activity, the first reaction was carried out in the absence of exogenous MEK. In the second type of assay, 20 μl of column fraction was placed into microtiter plate wells, and the reaction was started by the addition of 40 μl of buffer C containing 0.6 μg of p42MAPK, 0.6 μg of MEK, 300 μM [γ-32P]ATP (250 cpm/pmol), 7.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 μM microcystin. After 20 min at 22.5°C, the robot terminated the reaction by the addition of 20 μl of SDS sample buffer (20% glycerol, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 (25°C), 2% SDS, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Again, endogenous MEK was measured by carrying out the assay in the absence of exogenous MEK. Following heating (100°C) for 5 min, the phosphorylated proteins were characterized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Quantitation of phosphorylation was by PhosphorImager analysis. In assays in which the stoichiometry of MAPK phosphorylation was measured, reactions were terminated with 25% trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity incorporated into the precipitated proteins was determined by Cerenkov counting.RESULTSPhosphorylation of MAPK by MEKThe ability of recombinant p42MAPK to be phosphorylated by various concentrations of purified native rabbit skeletal muscle MEK1 was measured (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows that in order to achieve a stoichiometry close to 1 mol/mol within a 30-min period, a 3-4-fold (3.6 ± 0.19 S.D., n = 3) molar excess of MEK (~2 μM) over MAPK (0.5 μM) was required. At this time point and concentration of MEK, phosphoamino acid analysis of MAPK revealed ~80% of the phosphate to be incorporated into tyrosine, with the remainder on threonine (Fig. 1, inset). Increasing the concentration of MEK by an order of magnitude (40:1) achieved a stoichiometry of phosphorylation close to 2 mol/mol within the same time frame. Under these conditions, the phosphothreonine content of MAPK was equal to phosphotyrosine (Fig. 1, inset). When fully phosphorylated, recombinant MAPK displayed a specific activity toward myelin basic protein of 0.32 ± 0.08 μmol/min/mg (S.D., n = 3), approximating values previously estimated for the activated native enzyme(49Haystead T.A.J. Dent P. Wu J. Haystead C.M.M. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Increasing the concentration of MAPK in the assay to 10 μM, with a fixed MEK concentration of 20 μM, resulted in an appreciable reduction in the overall stoichiometry of phosphorylation to >0.2 ± 0.05 mol/mol (S.D., n = 3). Correspondingly, phosphorylation of threonine was considerably reduced relative to tyrosine. These results suggest that the relative poor rate of phosphorylation of MAPK by purified MEK was not due to a suboptimal substrate concentration being utilized in our assays. In previous work, we had also noted that high concentrations of MEK relative to MAPK were required to activate the enzyme completely(49Haystead T.A.J. Dent P. Wu J. Haystead C.M.M. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Also in this earlier study, it was observed that Tyr-185 phosphorylation increased relative to Thr-183, suggesting that phosphorylation of MAPK by MEK was ordered.Figure 1:Phosphorylation of MAPK by native MEK. Purified recombinant p42MAPK (0.5 μM) was incubated for 30 min in a 30-μl assay containing 300 μM ATP, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and the indicated concentrations of purified rabbit skeletal muscle MEK1. Reactions were terminated by the addition of ice-cold 25% trichloroacetic acid. Following centrifugation (14,000 × g for 5 min) and washing, the radioactivity in the precipitated protein was determined. Insets are the results of phosphoamino acid analysis (62van der Geer P.

Indeed, many laboratories have observed a potent and rapid activation of both MEK and MAPK in several cell types in response to various agonists(1Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Cheng M. Xu S. Ebert D.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In earlier studies, we demonstrated that APLP2 matures through the same unusual secretory/cleavage pathway as APP. Furthermore, APLP2 pre-mRNAs are alternatively spliced to generate at least four alternatively spliced transcripts(9Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol.

Using in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approaches, we and others have demonstrated that in most adult tissues, APLP2 and APP mRNAs were expressed at similar, if not identical, levels. There are several exceptions; notably, in liver APP mRNA is essentially undetectable, but APLP2 mRNA is fairly abundant(5Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. von Koch C. Lo A.C.Y. Tanzi R.E. Sisodia S.S. J.

Moreover, APLP2 is highly enriched in olfactory sensory axons and axon terminals in glomeruli. On the other hand, APP is expressed, albeit at lower levels, in olfactory sensory neurons and to a lesser extent in sensory axons. This suggests that APLP2 and APP are regulated differentially in selected neuronal populations. amyloid precursor protein activator protein 1 and 2, respectively amyloid precursor-like protein base pair(s) kilobase(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase E26 avian leukemia oncogene low density lipoprotein receptor preproenkephalin polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase-PCR promoter-specific transcription factor Chinese hamster ovary piperazine-N,N‘-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) N,N-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. In order to assess whether the differential levels of APLP2 and APP expression may be a reflection of differences in sequence elements contained within respective promoters, we cloned and characterized an ˜1.2-kb fragment of the mouse APLP2 gene promoter. The mouse APP promoter has been characterized previously(13Izumi R. Yamada T. Yoshikai S. Sasaki H. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We show that the mouse APLP2 gene promoter contains several features characteristic of promoters of “housekeeping genes”; these include the lack of a typical TATA box, the presence of a high GC content, and multiple transcription start sites. These latter features of the APLP2 promoter are similar to features described for mouse, rat, and human APP promoter regions(13Izumi R. Yamada T. Yoshikai S. Sasaki H. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Salbaum J.M. Weidemann A. Lemaire H.G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K.

We assessed whether the APLP2 promoter contained positive or negative regulatory elements by transfecting mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells and mouse fibroblast (Ltk-) cells with constructs containing progressive 5′-truncated promoter fragments of the APLP2 gene fused with the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT). We demonstrate that CAT expression remains fairly constant across different deletion constructs in both N2a and Ltk- cells and that a fragment representing just 99 bp upstream of the predominant transcription start site is sufficient to direct high levels of transgene expression in both cell lines. Interestingly, 5′-deletion studies of the human, mouse, and rat promoters also revealed that ˜100 bp of the respective promoters can drive high levels of expression of reporter genes(13Izumi R. Yamada T. Yoshikai S. Sasaki H. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Hoffman P.W. Chernak J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Interspecific backcross progeny were generated by mating (C57BL/6J × Mus spretus)F1 females and C57BL/6J males as described(19Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). A total of 205 N2 mice were used to map the APLP2 locus (see “Results and Discussion” for details). DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern blot transfer, and hybridization were performed essentially as described(20Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Taylor B.A. Lee B.K. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All blots were prepared with Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.). The probe, an ˜2.65-kb XhoI/EcoRI fragment of mouse cDNA, was labeled with [α32P]dCTP using a nick translation labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim); washing was done to a final stringency of 0.1 × SSCP, 0.1% SDS, 65°C. Major fragments of 21.0, 3.5, 2.9, and 2.5 kb were detected in ScaI-digested C57BL/6J DNA, and major fragments of 6.6, 4.2, and 2.7 kb were detected in ScaI-digested M. spretus DNA. The presence or absence of the 6.6-, 4.2-, and 2.7-kb M. spretus-specific fragments, which cosegregated, was followed in backcross mice. A description of the probes and restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the loci linked to APLP2 including low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr), preproenkephalin (Penk), and E26 avian leukemia oncogene (Ets1) has been reported previously (21Wilkie T.M. Chen Y. Gilbert D.J. Moore K.J. Yu L. Simon M.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1993; 18: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recombination distances were calculated as described (22Green E.L. Genetics and Probability in Animal Breeding Experiments. Oxford University Press, New York1981: 77-113Crossref Google Scholar) using the computer program SPRETUS MADNESS. Gene order was determined by minimizing the number of recombination events required to explain the allele distribution patterns. To isolate the promoter of mouse APLP2, a 67-bp fragment of the 5′-untranslated region of mouse APLP2, position −64 to +3 with respect to the translation start codon, was generated by PCR and labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random primer-initiated synthesis. This probe was used to screen a genomic DNA library, prepared from 129 SV mouse embryonic stem cells cloned into λEMBL3. Hybridization and wash conditions were 50% formamide, 6 × SSC at 42°C for 16 h, and 2 × SSC at 50°C for 15 min, followed by 0.2 × SSC at 50°C for 15 min, respectively. One positive phage contained a 14-kb SalI-SalI fragment, which included 2.8 kb of sequence upstream of the translation start codon. A 2.84-kb SalI-HindIII restriction fragment from this phage was subsequently subcloned into Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene) to generate plasmid pAPLP2P and partially sequenced with Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequences were analyzed for putative transcription factor binding sites using a MacVector version 4.1 software package. Total RNA was isolated by homogenization of mouse thymus, heart, brain, liver, kidney, lung, testes, and spleen in 4 M guanidine thiocyanate and centrifugation of the lysate over a 5.7 M cesium chloride cushion (23Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was prepared similarly with the addition of fractionation on an oligo(dT)-Sepharose column(24Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar). Total cytoplasmic RNA, from confluent dishes of mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells and mouse fibroblast (Ltk-) cells, was isolated as described(25Sisodia S.S. Sollner-Webb B. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A 534-bp KpnI-HindIII fragment, extending from 494 bp upstream of the translation start site to 40 bp into exon 1, was liberated from pAPLP2P and subcloned into KpnI-HindIII-digested Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene), to generate plasmid pAPLP2S1. This plasmid was linearized with HindIII, which lies 40 bp 3′ to the translation start codon, and the 5′ ends were dephosphorylated with calf alkaline phosphatase. S1 nuclease probe was prepared by 5′ end-labeling with [γ-32P]ATP. For S1 nuclease analysis (25Sisodia S.S. Sollner-Webb B. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) 0.02 pmol of 32P-end-labeled double-stranded DNA probe was mixed with either 20 μg of total RNA or with 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA and hybridized in a solution containing 80% formamide, 0.4 M NaCl, 40 mM PIPES, pH 6.4, and 1 mM EDTA for 12-16 h at 57°C. Samples were then diluted 15-fold with ice-cold S1 nuclease buffer to yield a final concentration of 1 × S1 buffer (0.2 M NaCl, 30 mM NaOAc, pH 4.5, 5 mM ZnCl2, and 0.05 μg/μl salmon sperm DNA) and treated with 100 units of S1 nuclease at 25°C for 1 h. S1-resistant hybrids were fractionated by electrophoresis on 4% acrylamide, 9 M urea-containing gels, and the protected probe was visualized by autoradiography. To determine the endogenous levels of APLP2 and APP mRNA in mouse N2a and mouse Ltk- cells, 1 μg of total cytoplasmic RNA was reverse-transcribed in the presence of reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The first strand cDNA obtained from reverse-transcribed RNA was then subjected to PCR with degenerate primers, APP/APLP2S and APP/APLP2AS(5Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. von Koch C. Lo A.C.Y. Tanzi R.E.

Primer APP/APLP2S is GAGCAYGCCCRYTTCCAGAARGC, where Y = C + T and R = A + G, and encodes APLP2-751 residues 386-392 or APP-751 residues 368-374. Primer APP/APLP2AS is GGAGGTGTGTCATMACCTGGGA, where M = A + C, and is complementary to sequences that encode APLP2-751 residues 527-532 or APP-751 residues 509-514(5Slunt H.H.

PCR was performed at an annealing temperature of 58°C for 20 cycles. PCR generated 444-bp products consisting of a mixture of APP and APLP2 cDNAs, which were subsequently digested with XhoI to specifically cleave the APP-related species. Digested PCR products were fractionated on 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. PCR products generated from plasmids encoding mouse APLP2 and mouse APP templates were used as controls. A ˜2.8-kb SalI-BamHI fragment, extending from ˜2.7 kb upstream of the transcription start codon to 62 bp of exon 1, was isolated by PCR using a sense primer EMBL (GCTTCTCATAGAGTCTTGCAGACAAACTGCGCAAC, located in the left arm of λEMBL3 polylinker; (26Manninen I. Schulman A.H. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 174PubMed Google Scholar)) and an antisense primer BamHI+62 (CCGGGATCCCTCTCCCCGTCTCTCGCACAGCCAGGCTACAG, located from +62 to +31 with respect to the transcription start codon), in the presence of λ-APLP2 DNA and subcloned into SalI-BamHI-digested pBLCAT3(27Luckow B. Schuetz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), to generate plasmid pAPLP2PCAT. pAPLP2PCAT was digested with PstI and religated to generate plasmid pAPLP2PCAT-380. During this digestion, a 590-bp PstI-PstI fragment was isolated and cloned in the sense orientation into PstI-digested pAPLP2PCAT-380 to generate plasmid pAPLP2PCAT-971. APLP2 promoter fragments range from −380 to +62 in pAPLP2PCAT-380 and from −971 to +62 in pAPLP2PCAT-971 (with respect to the transcription start site). Additional promoter deletions were prepared by PCR using the following sense primers linked to a HindIII site, GCCAAGCTTCACGGTCTACCCGCGAAG, GCCAAGCTTAGCCTCGGGTCCAGAG, GCCAAGCTTGAGTCGGTGTATCCGTGCT, and GCCAAGCTTGTTATGCCGGCTCGTATTG, respectively, with antisense primer BamHI+62 in the presence of pAPLP2P. The resulting 334-bp HindIII-BamHI (−272 to +62), 302-bp HindIII-BamHI (−240 to +62), 222-bp HindIII-BamHI (−160 to +62), and 161-bp HindIII-BamHI (−99 to +62) fragments were ligated to HindIII-BamHI-digested pBLCAT3 to generate plasmids pAPLP2PCAT-272, pAPLP2PCAT-240, pAPLP2PCAT-160, and pAPLP2PCAT-99, respectively. pRSVCAT(28Gorman C.M.

Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). 0.12 μg of pBLCAT3, or equivalent molar amounts of APLP2-CAT constructs containing various 5′-deletions of APLP2 promoter were adjusted to 2 μg with empty vector DNA. DNA was incubated with 62.5 μmol of CaCl2 and 1 × BES-buffered saline (pH 6.97) at 25°C for 20 min, and the mixture was added dropwise to each well. Cells were incubated at 3% CO2 for 16-18 h, after which time the precipitate was removed by washing cells two times with culture medium. The cells were subsequently returned to 5% CO2 for 12-14 h, washed once with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 200 μl of 0.25 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.9. To assay for CAT activity, 20 μg of cell lysate was incubated in the presence of 1.1 mM acetyl CoA, 100 nCi of [14C]chloramphenicol (60 mCi/mmol) in 0.22 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.7, at 37°C for 45 min. Acetylated and nonacetylated forms of chloramphenicol were extracted with 0.5 ml of ethyl acetate and separated by ascending silica gel thin-layer chromatography in chloroform:methanol (95:5) at room temperature. Thin-layer chromatography sheets were then air-dried, and acetylated and nonacetylated forms of chloramphenicol were quantified using a PhosphorImager. The percentages of monoacetylated forms of chloramphenicol were plotted for each construct and normalized to the CAT activity of pRSVCAT. Each construct was tested in three separate transfections, and standard error of the mean was determined. For transfections of mouse fibroblast Ltk- cells, cells were plated at a density of 0.2 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well dish. Cells were transiently transfected with 4.26 μg of pBLCAT3 or equivalent molar amounts of CAT plasmids containing various 5′-deletions of the APLP2 promoter adjusted to 7 μg with empty vector DNA. 20 μg of cell lysate was used for CAT assays. Recent studies have indicated that APP is a member of a larger gene family that includes APLP1 and APLP2. The physiological function(s) and regulation of the APP-related proteins is not well understood. In this study, we mapped the genomic location of APLP2 and have analyzed the APLP2 promoter for the presence of potential regulatory sequences that may be involved in transcriptional activity of the APLP2 gene. The chromosomal location of the mouse APLP2 gene was determined by interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived from matings of ((C57BL/6J × M. spretus)F1× C57BL/6J) mice. This interspecific backcross mapping panel has been typed for over 1800 loci that are well distributed among all of the autosomes as well as the X chromosome(19Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). C57BL/6J and M. spretus DNAs were digested with several enzymes and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization for informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms using a mouse cDNA APLP2 probe. The 6.6-, 4.2-, and 2.7-kb M. spretus restriction fragment length polymorphisms (see “Materials and Methods”) were used to follow the segregation of the APLP2 locus in backcross mice. The mapping results indicated that APLP2 is located in the proximal region of mouse chromosome 9 linked to Ldlr, Penk, and Ets1. Although 152 mice were analyzed for every marker and are shown in the segregation analysis (Fig. 1), up to 185 mice were typed for some pairs of markers. Each locus was analyzed in pairwise combinations for recombination frequencies using the additional data. The ratios of the total number of mice exhibiting recombinant chromosomes to the total number of mice analyzed for each pair of loci and the most likely gene order are: centromere, Ldlr (3/162) Penk (13/185) APLP2 (5/158) Ets1. The recombination frequencies (expressed as genetic distances in centimorgans ± the standard error) are as follows: Ldlr (1.9 ± 1.1) Penk (7.0 ± 1.9) APLP2 (3.2 ± 1.4) Ets1. We have compared our interspecific map of chromosome 9 with a composite mouse linkage map that reports the map location of many uncloned mouse mutations (provided from the Mouse Genome data base, a computerized data base maintained at The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). APLP2 mapped in a region of the composite map that lacks mouse mutations with a phenotype that might be expected for an alteration in this locus (data not shown). The proximal region of mouse chromosome 9 shares regions of homology with human chromosomes 19p, 8q, and 11q (summarized in Fig. 1). The recent assignment of APLP2 to 11q23-q25 (31von der Kammer H. Loeffler C. Hanes J. Klaudiny J. Scheit K.H. Hansmann I. Genomics. 1994; 10: 308-311Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) confirms and extends the synteny between mouse chromosome 9 and human 11q. RNA prepared from CHO cells and several mouse tissues was subjected to S1 nuclease protection analysis using a double-stranded DNA probe 5′ end-labeled 40 bp downstream of the translation start codon (Fig. 2A). Although the predominant start site is located ˜89 bp upstream of the translation start codon, there appeared to be variable levels of alternatively initiated APLP2 transcripts in mRNA isolated from CHO cells or from mouse thymus, heart, brain, liver, kidney, lung, testes, and spleen (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2-9, respectively). Primer extension analysis also revealed the presence of multiple transcription start sites in mouse tissues (data not shown). Multiple transcription start sites have been identified for human (14Salbaum J.M. Weidemann A. Lemaire H.G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2807-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and rat (15Hoffman P.W. Chernak J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) APP mRNA, with the predominant start sites located 146 and 156 bp upstream of the translation start codons, respectively. However, the transcription start site of mouse APP has not yet been reported. We screened ˜800,000 independent phage-containing genomic DNA from a 129 SV embryonic stem cell library with a 67-bp fragment of the 5′-untranslated region of APLP2 (position −64 to +3 with respect to the translation start codon). We obtained two overlapping phage with the longest insert containing 2.8 kb of sequence upstream of the translation start codon. ˜1.2 kb of this promoter region was sequenced (Fig. 3). The DNA sequence upstream of the predominant transcription start site contains a CAAT box (−135 in antisense orientation) but lacks a typical TATA box (Fig. 3). The promoter has a high GC content, specifically between positions −1 and −300 (68%) and −500 and −700 (69%). Multiple consensus sequences for transcription factor binding sites are present in the entire region, including one AP-1, two AP-2s, five GC boxes, one GC element, two GC factors, and seven SP-1 sites. Similar putative transcription factor binding sites are found in the APP promoter, however, at different locations with respect to the transcription start site(13Izumi R. Yamada T. Yoshikai S. Sasaki H. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Salbaum J.M. Weidemann A. Lemaire H.G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K.

Furthermore, the APP promoter contains sites for transcription factors not present in the APLP2 promoter, including a potential heat shock element and an overlapping AP-1/AP-4 site(14Salbaum J.M. Weidemann A. Lemaire H.G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2807-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 16La Fauci G. Lahiri D.K. Salton S.R.J. Robakis N.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17362-17368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of APLP2 and APP genes may be dissimilar. The presence of multiple transcription start sites, the absence of a typical TATA box, the high GC content, and the presence of GC-rich boxes places the APLP2 promoter in the class of promoters of housekeeping genes; these include the human, rat, and mouse APP genes (13Izumi R. Yamada T. Yoshikai S. Sasaki H. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Salbaum J.M. Weidemann A. Lemaire H.G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K.

Recently, the upstream AP-1 site (position −350 with respect to the predominant transcription start site) in the APP promoter has been implicated in protein kinase C mediated up-regulation of APP gene expression(35Trejo J. Massamiri T. Deng T. Dewji N.N. Bayney R.M. Heller Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21682-21690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AP-1 binding activity is thought to be composed of Jun-Jun homodimers. Interleukin-1, nerve growth factor, and retinoic acid, agents known to increase APP gene expression, have been shown to induce c-jun and c-fos expression and cause transcriptional activation of target genes through AP-1 sites(36Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 37Muegge K. Williams T.M. Kant J. Karin M. Chiu R. Schmidt A. Siebenlist U. Young H.A. Durum S.K.

Furthermore, interleukin-1 effects are thought to involve protein kinase C activation(40Goldgaber D. Harris H.W. Hla T. Maciag T. Donnelly R.J. Jacobsen J.S. Vitek M.P. Gajdusek D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7606-7610Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined if APLP2 gene expression is also regulated by interleukin-1, nerve growth factor, and retinoic acid, particularly in view of the presence of a potential AP-1 site located at position −982. To identify regulatory sequences responsible for the expression of the mouse APLP2 gene, we constructed plasmids containing progressive 5′-deletions of the APLP2 promoter fused upstream of the bacterial reporter gene CAT, as diagrammed in Fig. 4B. Equimolar amounts of each construct were transfected into mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) (Fig. 4C) and mouse fibroblast (Ltk-) (Fig. 4D) cells. RT-PCR analysis of cytoplasmic RNA from mouse N2a and mouse Ltk- cells with degenerate primers which hybridize to both APLP2 and APP mRNA revealed that these two cell lines express moderate levels of endogenous APLP2 mRNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). Hence, we concluded that these cell lines would be appropriate for analysis of the APLP2 promoter. Progressive 5′-deletions from position −971 to position −99, with respect to the predominant transcription start site, had no significant effect on promoter activity in either of the two cell lines tested. These findings suggest that in N2a and Ltk- cells, 99 bp of the APLP2 promoter are sufficient for directing high levels of promoter activity. Similarly, studies that analyzed progressive 5′-deletions of the APP promoter from human, mouse, and rat have shown that reporter gene expression levels remained fairly constant up to approximately 100 bp upstream of the predominant transcription start site(13Izumi R. Yamada T. Yoshikai S. Sasaki H. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Hoffman P.W. Chernak J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In summary, we have localized APLP2 to the proximal region of mouse chromosome 9, characterized ˜1.2 kb of the APLP2 promoter, and shown it to contain features characteristic of promoters in the class of housekeeping genes. We further showed that 99 bp upstream of the predominant transcription start site are sufficient to direct high levels of promoter activity. Given the similarities in overall structure of the APLP2 and APP promoters and the minimal sequence requirements for transcription initiation, it is highly likely that additional sequence elements distal to the regions analyzed here are responsible for differential expression of APLP2/APP in specific neuronal populations or systemic organs (i.e. liver). Further studies will be directed toward using transgenic strategies with larger genomic fragments to clarify these issues with the eventual goal of identifying transcription factors responsible for mediating basal level of APLP2 gene expression.

Polymerase is capable of abortive initiation until it reaches a position beyond +3 and before +7, at which stage polymerase is released from its promoter contacts and an elongation complex is formed. Initial elongation is accompanied by two transcription bubbles, one moving with the polymerase and the other remaining at the transcription start site. The σ54-associated polymerase shows an earlier and more efficient transition out of abortive initiation mode than prior studies of σ70-associated polymerase.

Initial elongation is accompanied by two transcription bubbles, one moving with the polymerase and the other remaining at the transcription start site. The σ54-associated polymerase shows an earlier and more efficient transition out of abortive initiation mode than prior studies of σ70-associated polymerase. σ54 is an alternative bacterial transcription factor that directs transcription of specific subsets of genes (reviewed by Magasanik(1989), Kustu et al.(1989), and Merrick(1993)). σ54 is the only sigma factor that is not a member of the σ70 family of proteins, as defined by sequence similarity (Merrick and Gibbins, 1985; Lonetto et al., 1992). Regulation of σ54-dependent promoters differs from regulation of σ70-dependent promoters (Gralla, 1991; Collado-Vides et al., 1991) despite the fact that both sigma factors bind the same core RNA polymerase. All known σ54-dependent promoters are controlled by activator proteins rather than by repressors (Collado-Vides et al., 1991). The activators are generally enhancer-binding proteins (Reitzer and Magasanik, 1986), which work from locations that are too remote to activate transcription in σ70-dependent systems. Certain steps in the transcription cycle at σ54 promoters differ from analogous steps at σ70 promoters. σ54 can bind certain promoters without being part of holoenzyme (Buck and Cannon, 1992), whereas σ70 cannot (Dombroski et al., 1992). The two holoenzymes recognize different sequence elements (see review by Merrick, 1993). In addition the σ54 promoter elements are located in different positions near −12 and −24 (Morett and Buck, 1989). ATP hydrolysis is required to form open complexes at the σ54 promoters (Popham et al., 1989; Weiss et al., 1991) but not at σ70 promoters. Recently we identified another difference; σ54 can remain bound to a promoter after RNA polymerase begins transcription elongation (Tintut etal., 1995). This is in contrast to the well established σ70 transcription cycle, in which σ70 is released when an elongation complex is formed. The observation has led us to attempt to investigate the transition from open promoter complex to elongation complex for σ54 holoenzyme. The process is well known for σ70 promoters (Hansen and McClure 1980; Carpousis and Gralla, 1985; Krummel and Chamberlin, 1989). At those promoters RNA synthesis begins with an abortive cycling phase, in which promoter-bound holoenzyme synthesizes short RNAs (Carpousis and Gralla, 1980). Subsequently, a longer RNA of length 10 or 11 is made, and at this point polymerase is released from the promoter (Carpousis and Gralla, 1985; Krummel and Chamberlin, 1989). σ70 is released both from the polymerase and from the DNA, and the complex becomes fully committed to elongation. In this paper we investigate the transition of σ54 holoenzyme from open complex to elongation complex at the Escherichia coli glnAp2 promoter. Popham et al(1989) showed that open complexes formed at an analogous promoter are capable of synthesizing short, probably abortive, RNAs. We confirm this finding in a different context and go on to characterize the transition from abortive to productive transcription. The results indicate that several important aspects of this transition differ from those observed in prior studies of σ70 systems. Core polymerase was purchased from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI), and σ54 and NtrC were purified as described (Tintut et al., 1995). NTPs and 3′-O-methyl-GTP were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Dinucleotide UpA, 3′-dATP, DNase I, KMnO4, and carbamyl phosphate was purchased from Sigma. The competitor DNA is a 160-base pair fragment carrying the Rhizobium meliloti nifH promoter (Tintut et al., 1995). The following common procedures were performed for both DNase I and KMnO4 footprinting experiments. In order to form a closed complex, core RNA polymerase (10 nM) and σ54 (20 nM) were mixed with 0.5 nM supercoiled plasmid carrying the glnAp2 promoter (pLR1; Reitzer and Magasanik, 1986) in footprinting buffer (25 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 8 mM magnesium acetate, 10 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 3.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol; Buck and Cannon, 1992). The reaction was incubated for 20 min at 37°C. For open complex formation, NtrC (40 nM), CBP (10 mM), and ATP (4 mM) were included in the above reaction for 20 min. Before transcription initiation, the competitor DNA, R. meliloti nifH, (48 nM) was added for 3 min to bind free excess proteins. In order to stall the polymerase at different positions along the template DNA, different nucleotide combinations (0.5 mM each) were added for 1 min as indicated in Table 1. In some reactions, ATP was substituted with 3′-dATP (0.5 mM) as a source of hydrolysis, where indicated. The samples were probed with footprinting reagent in a 40-μl reaction as follows.Table 1 Open table in a new tab For DNase I digestion, 2 μl of DNase I (0.45 μg/ml, including 45 mM MgCl2 and 22.5 mM CaCl2) was added for 30 s at 37°C, followed by an addition of 2 μl of 0.5 M EDTA to stop the reaction. For KMnO4 footprinting, 4 μl of 92.5 mM KMnO4 was added for 1 min at 37°C, and the reactions were quenched by adding 6 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. The modified DNA was isolated by extracting with phenol and passed through a 1-ml syringe packed with G50-80 (Sigma) equilibrated with water. The samples were subjected to primer extensions using 32P-labeled primers (Sasse-Dwight and Gralla, 1991). The DNA products of the Taq reaction was isolated on 6% denatured polyacrylamide gel. Abortive initiation was done essentially as described previously (Carpousis and Gralla, 1980). For abortive initiation, open complex was formed by incubating purified protein components with the template DNA, as described previously, in a transcription buffer (Hunt and Magasanik, 1985; 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 μg of bovine serum albumin) for 20 min at 37°C. The amount of the template was increased to 2.5 nM, and the proteins were increased 2.5 times over the concentration used in the footprinting experiments. The nucleotides (0.5 mM for GTP and UTP; 20 μM labeled CTP) were added as indicated for 10 min, followed by addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer (98% formamide, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 10 mM EDTA, and 8 M urea). In the cases where the transcripts were digested with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, 10 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and 10 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega) were added after the addition of nucleotides. The samples were incubated at 37°C for an additional 30 min before loading dye was added. The abortive products were separated on a 25% denatured polyacrylamide gel at 2500 V for 4-5 h. For quantitative results, the gels were exposed on phosphorimage screen and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The initial goal was to monitor the progress of σ54 holoenzyme as it transcribed from the glnAp2 promoter. In order to do that, the polymerase was stalled at different positions along the template as it attempted to move downstream during transcription initiation. The stalling was accomplished by omitting a subset of the required nucleotides. The expected positions of stalling are shown in Table 1 along with the nucleotide combinations used. Three assays were used to characterize these stalled complexes: DNase I footprinting to locate the polymerase, abortive initiation to assay abortive transcripts, and permanganate probing to locate melted regions. Plasmid pLR1, which contains the σ54-dependent promoter glnAp2 with upstream NtrC enhancer sites, was used (Reitzer and Magasanik, 1986). Primer extension footprinting methods, which allow probing of both DNA strands of the same sample, were used (see Gralla(1985)). This method also allows the use of supercoiled DNA, which may be an important parameter in this system. First, known closed and open complexes (Ninfa et al., 1987; Popham et al., 1989) are probed with DNase I to establish control patterns. To form a closed complex, template DNA was incubated with purified core RNA polymerase and σ54. To form an open complex, ATP and enhancer NtrC (phosphorylated with carbamyl phosphate; Feng et al., 1992) were added in addition to core and σ54. Each sample was divided in half, and both the top and bottom strands of DNA were probed to observe footprints. The footprint pattern of the top strand of the glnAp2 promoter is shown in Fig. 1A. Lane 1 shows the protection pattern of a closed complex formed from σ54 and core polymerase. The closed complex footprint covers from −34 to −2 (compare lane1versus the lane2 control pattern). This encompasses both the −12 and −24 promoter recognition elements but not the transcribed region, in agreement with prior experiments (Popham et al., 1989). When phosphorylated NtrC and ATP were also present, the open complex formed extends into the transcribed region to position +23 (lane3), covering at total of approximately 57 bases. Next, the holoenzyme was allowed to transcribe to different positions by adding different combinations of nucleotides (see Table 1). In order to prevent binding by new polymerases from solution, free proteins were titrated with a competitor promoter DNA. The competitor contains the σ54-dependent tightly binding R. meliloti nifH promoter (Buck and Cannon, 1992) carried on a 160-base pair fragment. A ~100-fold excess of this competitor was added after open complexes were formed with glnAp2 DNA, but before the addition of nucleotides, which caused the polymerase to begin RNA synthesis. The lack of protection in control lane2, where competitor was mixed with glnAp2 before addition of proteins, confirms that a sufficient amount of the competitor is present to titrate excess proteins. In the first experiment dinucleotide primer UpA and CTP were added to the open complex to allow the polymerase to form a single bond, creating the product UpApC, where “A” is the initiating nucleotide (see “Transcription” below) (Popham et al., 1989). This corresponds to incorporating the nucleotide at position +2 in the natural mRNA. Under these conditions the result shows no change in the DNase protection pattern compared to the open complex (lane4versuslane3). Not surprisingly, the polymerase can make the first bond of the mRNA without moving along the DNA. By contrast, the polymerase did change its interaction with DNA when GTP was added to allow transcription as far as the +7 position (see Table 1). This is demonstrated by the shortened protection seen in lane5. The polymerase now fully protects the DNA only from −2 to +23 with additional partial protection as far as −11 upstream and perhaps to +27 downstream. The overall protection pattern corresponds to less than a 40-base pair region, compared to open and first bond-making complexes, both of which protect approximately 57 base pairs. The comparison indicates that when the polymerase transcribes to the +7 position, it is released from its upstream promoter contacts. The important promoter element near −24 is no longer protected, and the protection near the −12 element is quite weak. Next, the polymerase is allowed to transcribe to position +18 (see Table 1). The primary protection (lane6) now extends from +3 to +23 and is not as complete as in other cases. In addition there is partial protection from +23 to +39. Thus, the stalled polymerase covers a total of 36 bases, approximately the same extent as seen at the +7 position, but the protection is weaker. Finally, when all four nucleotides are present no protection is seen (lane7), as expected for a polymerase that has moved to downstream positions. The top strand footprinting results above indicate that the polymerase breaks free of the promoter and exhibits a shortened footprint sometime after reaching position +2 and before reaching position +7. The bottom strands of the same DNA samples were probed for purposes of comparison (Fig. 1B). On this strand the open complex protection extends downstream to +15 (lane 3). Because the primer is in the near upstream region, this border is not well defined; footprinting using a labeled glnAp2 promoter fragment showed that the upstream boundary protection is approximately at −35 (data not shown). This yields an approximately 50-base pair footprint, which is slightly shorter than seen on the top strand. When polymerase was allowed to produce UpApC, the footprint did not change (lane4), as also seen on the top strand. As also observed on the top strand, a drastic change in the footprint occurs when polymerase is allowed to move to position +7 (lane5). The protection is strong from −13 to +22. The result is similar to that from the top strand in that polymerase no longer protects the critical −24 promoter element. A transition indicative of loss of promoter interaction has occurred on both strands. The footprints shorten a little more when transcription is halted at +18 (lane6), at which positions from −3 to +31 are partially protected. In addition, lanes 5, 6, and 7, corresponding to stalling at +7, at +18, and steady-state transcription, show partial protection of the region upstream from the start site (lesser intensity in these lanes compared to the control lane2). This is a reflection of the weak DNase protection due to σ not being released from this region, as shown by Tintut et al.(1995). A pictorial summary of the DNase I footprinting results is presented in Fig. 7. The main point at this stage is that a transition releasing polymerase from the promoter elements has occurred before polymerase reaches position +7. The purpose of experiments in this section is to compare the transcriptional state of the polymerase to the physical state studied in the DNase footprinting experiments. The goal is to learn if abortive transcription occurs and, if so, at what position it ends as the polymerase transits to elongation mode. The production of UpApC was used as a measure of abortive initiation. This product is made using dinucleotide primer UpA and 32P-labeled CTP as the only source of nucleotides (Fig. 2). When all required abortive transcription components were present, an abortive initiation product was seen (lane7 with ATP). The specificity of this reaction was confirmed by showing its dependence on various required components. No signal is seen with the omission of: NtrC (lane1), carbamyl phosphate to phosphorylate NtrC (lane2), σ54 (lane3), core polymerase (lane4), ATP (lane5), and UpA (lane6). Parallel experiments (data not shown) to produce long transcripts under these same conditions confirmed the specificity of glnA transcription. Next we characterized the amount of abortive initiation that occurs when polymerase is permitted to move to various positions (see Table 1) as described in the DNase footprinting experiments. The goal is to learn at what position the polymerase ceases to make large amounts of abortive initiation products. Open complexes were formed, and a subset of nucleotides containing radioactive CTP (see Table 1) were added. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min to achieve the steady state conditions. Reaction products were loaded directly onto an acrylamide gel, separated by electrophoresis, and detected by autoradiography. In the presence of dinucleotide UpA and labeled CTP, the polymerase produced a large amount of abortive product UpApC (see band indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3A, lane 1). When the polymerase was allowed to move as far as position +7, a much smaller amount of abortive product was made (much lighter band in the same position of lane2, quantified below). In addition small amounts of slightly longer products were made, as expected; we have not definitively characterized the size of these longer products. The data indicate that few abortive products are made when polymerase is allowed to move as far as position +7. When additional nucleotides were present (see Table 1) to promote further downstream movement of the polymerase, the amount of abortive product was only slightly lessened (lane3; band in same position denoted by arrow). Two major longer products were also produced under these conditions. Calibration using short RNAs (data not shown) suggests that these two products correspond to RNAs of the expected length, 19, and also of length 22; the 22-mer probably occurs from the mis-incorporating the omitted UTP, followed by stalling at the next position of UTP where two UTPs must be incorporated. This has been seen previously (Carpousis and Gralla, 1985). Finally, when all four nucleotides were present, the amount of abortive product was essentially unchanged (lane4). This qualitative analysis indicates that a transition from a frequent abortive initiation state to a lower abortive state has occurred between position +2 and +7 (lane1versuslane2). Note that the +7 position is the same point at which DNase footprinting revealed a physical change in the state of the transcription complex. One further combination of nucleotides was used to narrow the position at which the transition occurs. By the use of UpA, CTP, and 3-methyl-GTP the polymerase could be stalled at position +3. The result (Fig. 3B, lane 6) indicates that the polymerase stalled at +3 still produces large amounts of abortive products (quantified below). That is, the amount is comparable to that seen when transcription is stalled at +2 (lane5) but much more than that seen when transcription is stalled later (lane7). Thus the transition out of frequent abortive mode seems to occur after the polymerase reaches +3 but before it reaches +7. For each of several samples where the polymerase stalled at positions +2, +3, +7, +18, and >+18, the amount of abortive products and productive transcripts were quantified using a PhosphorImager. From the quantitative data, the relative molar amount was determined by normalizing to the number of radiolabeled CTPs incorporated (Table 2). Note that the longer products incorporate more than one radioactive cytidine, and thus their molar amount is over-represented on the autoradiographs. The molar excess of abortive RNA UpApC (compared to productive RNA, 18 + 19 nucleotides long, produced in a parallel experiment) was determined. The data (Table 2) showed that during the 10-min abortive initiation period, a 50-fold excess of abortive product UpApC was made from polymerase stalled at the +2 and +3 positions.Table 2 Open table in a new tab The relative amount of abortive products associated with stalling at each position is plotted in Fig. 4 to display the transition from frequent abortive phase to more stable elongation complex. When transcription is artificially stalled at position +2, the amount of abortive product UpApC made is approximately 15-fold higher than the amount of abortive product made at position +7. This huge overproduction of UpApC is maintained when polymerase is artificially stalled at position +3. Apparently, a transition out of abortive mode has occurred at position +7, as the polymerase aborts transcription rarely after reaching this position. This much lower production of UpApC is maintained under conditions in which polymerase can reach position +18 and, indeed, under conditions of free transcription. The quantitative analysis confirms that a transition away from abortive mode has occurred between positions +3 and +7. A key parameter in the synthesis of productive transcripts is the probability of aborting synthesis at a particular position (Carpousis, 1983; Carpousis and Gralla, 1985). The probability can be defined as the amount of RNA shorter than a certain length divided by the sum of all RNA products made (abortive plus longer). For example, the data showed that UpApC constitutes approximately 75% of all RNAs made under various conditions (Table 2). That is, in several experiments where the polymerase was stalled at position +7 or +18, the probability of aborting synthesis at +2 was calculated to be 0.75. Thus, approximately three out of four times, polymerase aborts synthesis after forming UpApC and must restart; the remaining time, it goes forward to make productive transcript. This predicts that only a small (roughly 2-fold) excess of abortive product will be seen during productive transcription, as is observed. Note that huge amounts of abortive products are only produced when polymerase is artificially stalled at a position that is not far enough to be associated with the transition to elongation mode. Significant amounts of abortive transcripts have been seen previously under productive transcription conditions, but this is probably a consequence of the use of low concentrations of CTP, GTP, and UTP (Popham et al., 1989). In order to confirm that this abortive phase is not restricted to dinucleotide-primed synthesis, we repeated selected experiments using the normal initiating nucleotide ATP. Abortive transcripts could not be detected directly because the presence of the triphosphate end caused them to migrate within a region dominated by radioactive products from the unincorporated labeled CTP. Thus after transcription the samples were subjected to calf intestine alkaline phosphatase to cleave off the 5′-phosphate groups (Jacob et al., 1994) before loading onto gels. Under these conditions abortive product can be seen. Lane1 of Fig. 5 shows that a large amount of abortive product is made when ATP and labeled CTP are used to form pppApC. When the same experiment is done in the presence of additional GTP and UTP to allow elongation, the result shown in lane2 is obtained. The much reduced amount of abortive product under these conditions is similar to the result obtained with dinucleotide-primed synthesis. This confirms that abortive initiation can occur using the natural initiating nucleotide ATP. Both DNase footprinting and abortive transcription experiments indicate that a transition out of the abortive initiation phase occurs prior to RNA synthesis reaching the +7 position. We now follow the movement of the melted DNA bubble during this same transition. Previous experiments indicated that even after the transition occurs the promoter start site can remain transiently bound by σ54, which keeps the start site in a single-stranded state (Tintut et al., 1995). We now investigate single-stranded regions present during the transition from abortive mode to elongation mode. In order to follow the single-stranded regions in this transition, the exposed single-stranded DNA was probed with KMnO4. KMnO4 reacts selectively with single-stranded thymines and has been used previously to detect the melted transcription bubble at this promoter (Sasse-Dwight and Gralla, 1988; 1990). In these experiments the bottom strand of the glnAp2 promoter was probed. As a control, open complexes, formed as described above, yield a strong permanganate signal (Fig. 6, lane 2) corresponding to bottom strand thymines at positions −9 and +1. As expected, this reactivity was absent in closed complexes (Fig. 6, lane 1). Next, samples were probed with permanganate using the same conditions described above to move the polymerase to various positions along the template. No change in pattern was observed when complexes forming product UpApC were probed (Fig. 6, compare lane3 with the open complex signal of lane2). Recall that at this stage the polymerase has not moved (as assayed using DNase footprinting; Fig. 1) and is in abortive mode (as assayed by abortive initiation; Fig. 3A). By contrast, when the polymerase is stalled at position +7, new permanganate hypersites extended to positions +7 and +9 (Fig. 6, lane4). Recall that under these conditions the polymerase has been largely released from abortive mode (see above). When polymerase is stalled further downstream in the +18 to +21 region, additional permanganate-sensitive sites are seen corresponding to thymines within this region (lane5). As expected, no hypersites are seen in the transcribed region when polymerase transcribes in the presence of all nucleotides (lane6). The results provide evidence that a melted bubble moves downstream with the elongating polymerase. The differences in intensities of permanganate-sensitive bands is probably due to different environments surrounding thymines at different positions. Note that under all conditions the transcription start site remains open (Fig. 6, bracket indicating bands in lanes 2-6). This is in agreement with prior experiments, not involving abortive initiation, analogous to those in lanes 2,5, and 6 but probing the top strand with permanganate (Tintut et al., 1995). The result supports the view that, as polymerase is released from the promoter, the original open complex bubble splits into two bubbles; one moves with the elongating polymerase and the other remains behind with σ54. These experiments describe the transition from abortive initiation mode to elongation mode for σ54 holoenzyme at the glnAp2 promoter (see summary in Fig. 7). The holoenzyme makes the first mRNA bond without moving from the promoter. After making this short RNA product, the data show that there is a 75% chance that the synthesis will be aborted and started anew. Thus, even when all elongation substrates are present, this abortive product accumulates in modest excess over long RNA. However, longer abortive products do not accumulate in significant amount under these conditions, leading to relatively efficient productive transcription. The polymerase is capable of abortive initiation when RNA synthesis reaches position +3 but loses this property prior to position +7 (Fig. 4). At this stage, footprinting shows that the polymerase is released from the contacts that hold it to the promoter region (see summary in Fig. 7). This leads to a reduction in the size of the protected region by approximately 20 base pairs. Permanganate probing shows that the transcription bubble has moved forward to cover the position that is transcribed. Thus the polymerase appears to have reached elongation mode prior to +7 position of the glnA gene. Probing of complexes stalled further downstream also show elongation complexes with characteristic of shortened footprints and transcription bubbles covering the point of synthesis. This pathway may be compared to the analogous pathway used by the common σ70 form of RNA polymerase holoenzyme. The comparison reveals both similarities and differences. The main similarity is that both pathways require the polymerase to pass through an abortive initiation mode prior to being committed to transcription elongation (Carpousis and Gralla, 1985). The molecular basis for this requirement is not known, but it was speculated previously to be related to the primer-independent nature of mRNA initiation (Carpousis and Gralla, 1985). The lack of primers, common to RNA polymerases but not DNA polymerases, may cause difficulty in initiating RNA synthesis. The abortive mode can be thought of as a phase in which a primer is created with some difficulty. For example, cycling to produce abortive RNAs may occur because these short RNAs are associated with the “loose product site” and are not translocated to the “tight product site” (see Chamberlin(1992-1993)) until a stable ternary complex is formed (Mustaev et al., 1994). Alternatively, the need to break strong contacts between polymerase and promoter may also retard the transition to elongation phase. There are several differences in this pathway compared to prior studies, which used the σ70 form of polymerase. One important difference is that the σ54-dependent glnAp2 promoter involves a relatively efficient transition out of abortive cycling mode. The data show that approximately 25% of the glnAp2 RNA 5′ ends that are produced will end up in productive transcripts. In the two σ70 cases studied, the probabilities are much lower: 2% at lacUV5 (Carpousis and Gralla, 1980; Carpousis, 1983) and less than 8% at T7A1 promoters (Krummel and Chamberlin, 1989). 1L. Hsu and M. J. Chamberlin, personal communication. This difference is largely a consequence of what happens after the first bond of the mRNA is formed. Although the σ54 polymerase is capable of abortive initiation up to position +7, it aborts primarily after forming the first bond. That is, the release of abortive products at glnAp2 during transcription is observed primarily from polymerases that have formed a single bond. By contrast, in prior studies at σ70 promoters, longer RNA products are also aborted. A second difference is that polymerase is released from the contacts that hold it to the promoter sooner in the σ54 case studied here than in the σ70 cases studied previously (Carpousis and Gralla, 1985; Krummel and Chamberlin, 1989). As discussed above, at glnAp2 this occurs after formation of the second bond but prior to formation of the sixth bond. In the prior cases elongation mode is not attained until the RNA is approximately twice as long, and abortive cycling occurs at several positions. One possible cause of these differences might be a lower affinity of core polymerase for σ54 (see Lesley et al., 1991), allowing polymerase to dissociate more readily; the two sigma factors use different determinants to bind polymerase (Tintut et al., 1994; Tintut and Gralla, 1995). Another difference is that the initial transcription bubble is split into two parts only during initiation by σ54 holoenzyme. That is, as RNA synthesis begins the initial bubble separates into two bubbles; one moves downstream with the polymerase and the other remains transiently over the start site. We show elsewhere that this is because σ54 remains promoter-bound during initial transcription due to its stronger affinity for DNA (Tintut et al., 1995). The mechanism of σ54-dependent transcription has been described as a hybrid between prokaryotic and eukaryotic mechanisms (Gralla, 1991; North et al., 1993). If this analogy extends to the pathway studied here, then one might expect eukaryotic mRNA synthesis to go through an analogous, quite brief, abortive to elongation transition (see Jacob et al.(1994), and references therein). Indirect experiments 2Y. Jiang, M. Yan, and J. D. Gralla, unpublished data. support this possibility, but more direct experiments will be required to test this further. σ54 is also used more commonly in other bacteria, and it will be useful to learn if there are promoter- or species-specific differences in the mechanism of transcription initiation by σ54 holoenzyme. We thank members of the Gralla group for their discussion on the manuscript and Ming Yan for technical help in abortive studies."

Because of the limitations of previously used affinity analogs and photolabeling studies as well as controversies surrounding the identity of an ADP receptor on platelets, we have used an affinity label capable of alkylating a putative exofacial receptor on platelets. We now report that 8-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutylthio)adenosine-5′-diphosphate (8-BDB-TADP), which is an analog of the natural ligand ADP, blocked ADP-induced platelet shape change, aggregation, exposure of fibrinogen-binding sites, secretion, and calcium mobilization. Following modification by 8-BDB-TADP, the rates of aggregation of platelets induced by thrombin, a calcium ionophore (A23187) or a stimulator of protein kinase C (phorbol myristate acetate) were minimally affected. However, the 8-BDB-TADP-modified platelets exhibited decreased rates of aggregation in response to ADP, as well as collagen and a thromboxane mimetic (U46619), both of which partially require ADP. Autoradiograms of the gels obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized platelets modified by either [β-<sup>32</sup>P]8-BDB-TADP, or 8-BDB-TADP and NaB[<sub>3</sub>H]<sub>4</sub> showed the presence of a single radiolabeled protein band at 100 kDa. The intensity of this band was reduced when platelets were preincubated with ADP, ATP, and 8-bromo-ADP prior to labeling by the radioactive 8-BDB-TADP. The results show that 8-BDB-TADP selectively and covalently labeled aggregin (100 kDa), a putative ADP receptor, resulting in a loss of ADP-induced platelet responses."

Three additional 5′-deletion recombinant DNA were constructed by PCR using −1069Ml3Z as template and oligonucleotide primers 4-6 (all contain a KpnI site), each paired with SP6 promoter sequence (in the vector) as left side primer. The PCR products were digested with KpnI/PstI and inserted into the CAT vector(26Rosenthal N.

Pairwised oligonucleotides containing complementary DNA sequences, i.e. oligonucleotides 14 and 15, 16 and 17, 18 and 19, and 20 and 21, were annealed, and each were cloned into the BamHI site of pBLCAT2 vector, generating −210/−185TKCAT, −185/−155TKCAT, −153/−135TKCAT, and −127/−120TKCAT, as well as their reverse version of recombinants, respectively. A total of 11 site-specifically mutagenized constructs of −233M1CAT were prepared by replacing the wild-type sequence with mutated sequences generated by PCR. Eight left side primers (oligonucleotides 22-29) and three right side primers (oligonucleotides 30-32) were used. All of these primers contain a KpnI site (underscored) and site-specifically altered nucleotides (boldface letters) (Table 1). PCR products were synthesized using −133M1CAT as a template (or −1069ML3Z for left side mutant primers), and these oligonucleotides were paired with their opposite side primers. The PCR products were digested with KpnI/PstI and cloned into the CAT vector to generate the first set of eight mutants or with KpnI and cloned into −116 MlCAT to generate the second set of three mutants. All the constructs described here were confirmed by DNA sequencing. NIH3T3, HeLa cells, mouse hepatoma cell lines Hepalclc and Hepalclc-BprC1 (hereafter referred to as BprC1)(28Hankinson O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 96: 373-376Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and Hepal-6 (29Bernhard H.P. Darlington G.J. Ruddle F.H. Dev. Biol. 1973; 35: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected with CsCl-purified (2×) plasmid DNA (5 μg) by the polybrene method (34Kawai S. Nishizawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1172-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) using the cotransfected pH2B-βgal plasmid DNA as an internal reference to normalize transfection efficiency for CAT expression according to the procedure described(25Ikeguchi M. Teeter L.D. Eckersberg T. Ganapathi R. Kuo M.T. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The pH2B-βgal contains a lacZ gene linked to a basal promoter from Xenopus laevis histone H2B that promotes constitutive expression in all cells. In some experiments, pCMV-βgal plasmid DNA was used as internal control for transfection calibration. No significant difference was found between the use of these two control plasmids. Nuclear extracts were prepared cultured cells and mouse HCC according to the procedure described by Dignam et al.(30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Mouse HCC were spontaneously developed in the SV40 T-antigen transgenic mice ((31Sepulveda A.R. Fingold M.J.

The mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described previously(32Miskimins W.K. Roberts M.P. McClelland A. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6741-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting was carried out using the protocol described by Ohisson and Ediund(33Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Various lengths of the mdr1b 5′-flanking sequence were inserted into a vector containing a promoterless CAT gene (Fig. 1A). These constructs were transfected into mouse hepatoma cells (Hepalclc, BprC1, and Hepa1-6) and nonhepatoma cells (NIH3T3 and HeLa). A previous study has demonstrated that these hepatoma-derived cell lines exhibited high levels of steady-state mdr1b mRNA(25Ikeguchi M. Teeter L.D. Eckersberg T. Ganapathi R. Kuo M.T. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), whereas NIH3T3 cells contained very low levels of mdr1b mRNA(19Teeter L.D. Becker F.F. Chisari F.V. Li D. Kuo M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 11: 5728-5735Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The levels of mdr1b mRNA in these hepatoma cells are comparable to those in mouse kidneys, one of the organs that contain abundant mdr1b mRNA(25Ikeguchi M. Teeter L.D. Eckersberg T. Ganapathi R. Kuo M.T. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Levels of mdr1b mRNA in NIH3T3 cells are comparable to those in the normal livers(19Teeter L.D. Becker F.F. Chisari F.V. Li D. Kuo M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 11: 5728-5735Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The murine mdr1b homolog is missing in HeLa cells, which display very low levels of MDR1 and MDR2 expression. Recombinant −1069M1CAT (Fig. 1, construct a) was transfected into these cells. 2 days after transfection, the CAT activity in the transfected cells was determined. Levels of CAT expression in BprC1 cells were comparable to those in Hepalclc and Hepal-6 cells (not shown) but were about 2- and 20-fold higher than those in NIH3T3 cells and HeLa cells (not shown), respectively, using the cotransfected pH2B-βgal as an internal control (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained with pCMV-βgal, in which the expression of lacZ gene is controlled by cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter (not shown). These results suggest that a sequence within nt −1069 can direct reporter gene expression preferentially in hepatoma-derived cells. Cell type-specific activity of mdr1b upstream sequences have also been demonstrated previously by transient transfection assay(35Raymond M. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6036-6040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cohen D. Piekarz R.L. Hsu S.I. DePinho R.A. Carrasco N. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2239-2244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of CAT expression from −1069M1CAT, −586M1CAT, and −233M1CAT recombinants (Fig. 1B, constructs a-c) in the transfected BprC1 cells were not significantly different. However, deleting nt −233 to −158 and further downstream (Fig. 1B, constructs d and e) resulted in a reduction of more than 90% of CAT activity. These results suggest that sequences downstream from nt −233 are important for the expression of the mdr1b gene in mouse hepatoma cells. Similar results were seen in Hepal-6 and Hepalclc hepatoma cells (data not shown), in which high levels of mdr1b expression were also seen(25Ikeguchi M. Teeter L.D. Eckersberg T. Ganapathi R. Kuo M.T. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When the same set of recombinant plasmids were transfected into NIH3T3 cells and HeLa cells, different expression patterns emerged. In the transfected NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1B), the level of CAT activity progressively decreased as the lengths of 5′-mdr1b region decreased. Furthermore, only less than 20% reduction in the levels of CAT expression was found between −233M1CAT (construct c) and −158M1CAT (construct d). In the transfected HeLa cells, there was no significant difference in the CAT activity between −233M1CAT and −158M1CAT recombinants (not shown). These results suggest that positive cis-regulatory element(s) located downstream from −233 nt of the mdr1b gene functions preferentially in hepatoma cell lines. To determine the 3′ boundary of the cis-regulatory element, we carried out similar analysis using −233MlCAT constructs with progressive deletions from −116 to −172 (Fig. 1A, recombinants f, g, and h). Removing sequences between −116 and −130 or between −116 to −155 resulted in reduction of no more than 30% CAT activity in BprC1 cells. Removal of additional sequences, i.e. −155 to −172, resulted in reduction of 45% of activity. These results, together with those from the 5′-deletion assay, suggest that the sequence located between −233 and −172 plays a major role for the expression of the reporter constructs in BprC1 cells, whereas the sequence between −172 and −155 may also be contributory but comparatively less substantial. To further characterize the hepatoma-related cis-regulatory element located downstream from nt −233 of the mdr1b promoter, we inserted nt −233 to −116 into −116M1CAT vector in the reverse orientation (Fig. 2A, constructb). Transient transfection assay showed that the resultant construct exhibited about 6-fold enhancement in CAT activity, in comparison with the 9-fold increase seen in the same construct with forward orientation (Fig. 2A, construct a). This result indicated that the cis-regulatory element located −233 to −116 can function in both forward and reverse orientations. All the constructs, regardless of either orientation, yielded very poor enhancement activity in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2A), supporting the cell type specificity of the regulatory element. To investigate whether nt −233 to −116 can enhance reporter gene expression from a heterologous promoter, we inserted this sequence in both forward and reverse orientations into pBLCAT2 (Fig. 2B, constructs d-f). This vector contains a CAT reporter gene driven by the basal promoter from the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. As shown in Fig. 2A, the forward version of construct (construct d) displayed a 10-fold increase in the CAT activity in BprC1 cells, whereas it displayed about a 2-fold increase for the reverse version (construct e). Again, all of these constructs exhibited a very low enhancement of CAT activity in NIH3T3 cells. These results indicate that nt −233 to −116 can enhance the reporter gene expression in an orientation- and promoter context-independent manner. Furthermore, this sequence showed hepatoma specificity in directing the expression of the reporter gene even in a heterologous promoter. Therefore, this sequence can be considered as an enhancer preferentially active in the hepatoma cells. To determine whether there were specific protein binding sites in the enhancer, we carried out DNase I footprinting analysis. A DNA fragment containing nt −233 to −116 was synthesized by PCR using labeled primers at either end. The labeled DNA was incubated with nuclear extracts from BprC1 cells and digested with nuclease. Remarkably reproducible footprints (four experiments) were observed in the crude nuclear extracts, suggesting that the trans-acting factors are either in high abundance or have high affinity for their target sequences. Two DNase I protection sites, located approximately nt −205 to −186 (site A) and −181 to −164 (site B), were found in both the coding and noncoding strands (Fig. 3A). Some of these footprints were characterized by the flanking DNase I hypersensitive sites in the presence of nuclear extracts, e.g. site B in the coding strand and site A in the non-coding strand. Due to technical limitations, the borders of these sites could only be assigned with approximation. Furthermore, binding sites located on one strand were not always exactly superimposed on another strand, and the footprints detected in one strand were not equally discernible on the other. To determine whether additional protein binding sites located downstream from −164 that could not be adequately resolved under the gel electrophoretic conditions were favorable for detection of sites A and B, we carried out footprinting analyses using end-labeled fragments spanning nt −50 to −185 for the coding strand and −210 to −80 for the non-coding strand (Fig. 3B). At least two additional protein binding sites, located approximately at −153 to −135 (site C) and −128 to −119 (site D), were detected. For the reason as mentioned above, site C could be better detected in the non-coding strand (by the characterized flanking hypersensitive sites) than in the coding strand. The reason for this is not clear but could be due to the unfavorable cleavage bias of A and C residues by the nuclease (see lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3B). These results demonstrated multiple protein binding sites in the mdr1b enhancer region. Fig. 3B also shows one footprint (indicated by bars) downstream from −120 nt. The functional aspect of this footprint was not further characterized. To investigate whether these protein binding sites are important for the enhancer function and to dissect the essential domain in the enhancer, oligonucleotide sequences spanning these binding sites, either as an individual or in combination, were inserted into pBLCAT2 vector in both forward and reverse orientations. Fig. 4 shows that BprC1 cells transfected with recombinant −210/−155TKCAT (construct b), which contains both sites A and B, exhibited about 9-fold increase in CAT activity, as compared with those transfected with vector alone. This level of increase is comparable to that of the same cells transfected with −233/−116 recombinant (construct a). Even the reverse version of −210/155TKCAT (construct b) still showed 3-fold increase of CAT activity. NIH3T3 cells transfected with these recombinants showed no more than 2-fold increase in either orientations. This result suggests that sites A and B contain most, if not the entire, enhancer function seen in −233/−116TKCAT. Recombinant −210/−185TKCAT (construct c), which contains site A only, exhibited no enhancing activity in both BprC1 and NIH3T3 cells, whereas recombinants −185/−155TKCAT (construct d, containing site B) in both orientations displayed 7-fold increased activity in BprC1 cells lines. No enhancer activities were found with recombinants −162/−116TKCAT, −153/−135TKCAT, and −127/−120TKCAT (constructs e through g) containing sites C and D, combined or in individual, respectively. We conclude that the entire enhancer function is mostly located in sites A and B, with site B as a major player. These results are in general agreement with those using deletion mutants as shown in Fig. 1. To further substantiate this finding, we carried out site-specific mutagenesis of nucleotides downstream from −233 in −233M1CAT. A total of 11 mutants were prepared (Fig. 5A). These constructs were transfected into BprC1 cells. The CAT activities in the transfected cells were determined (Fig. 5B). Mutants b through e, which contain specific mutations between nt −226 and −200, had CAT activities comparable to that of the wild-type construct (construct a). Mutants f through i, which contain mutations spanning from the 3′-half of site A to the 5′-half of site B, however, exhibited a 90% reduction of CAT activity in BprC1 cells but no reduction in NIH3T3 cells. Mutations in sites C and D (mutants j-l) exhibited minor reduction in CAT activities in BprC1 cells in relative to those found in mutant e, and no significant reduction in NIH3T3 cells. These results collaborate the notion that sites A and B are important for the enhancer function as mentioned above. To investigate the protein(s) that recognize the enhancer sequence, we used the DNA fragment containing nt −233 to −116 (sites A through D) as a probe in gel mobility retardation assays. Nuclear extracts from BprC1 cells were mixed with 32P-labeled probe and nonspecific competitor, poly(dI)•poly(dC), followed by various amounts of specific competitors containing sequences in sites A-D. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under neutral conditions and visualized by autoradiography. In the absence of competitors, a major retarded band (Fig. 6A, arrow) and several minor bands were observed from the autoradiograms. Under the conditions used, this major band could be effectively competed by a sequence containing site B but not by those containing A, C, and D. This result suggests that the major retarded band must arise by protein binding to site B. This was also evident when nt −210 to −155 (containing sites A and B) was used as probe (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that either protein recognizing site B sequence is much more abundant than those recognizing other sites or that the affinity of the protein bound to site B supersedes those to other sites. When individual sequences containing sites A-D were used as competitors to probe protein binding to nt −162/−116, which contains sites C and D, only site C sequence could compete efficiently, suggesting that protein binding to site C dominates site D (Fig. 6C). Similar results were observed when nuclear extracts from NIH3T3 (Fig. 6, D-F), normal mouse livers, and mouse HCC (not shown) were used. These results, taken together, suggest that multiple proteins in hepatoma- and nonhepatoma-derived cell extracts recognize the enhancer with different capacities. The finding that site B contains a dominant binding protein is consistent with the functional assay that distinguishes site B from other binding sites (Fig. 4). The precise reasons that oligonucleotides containing site A and site D sequences failed to show competitions in gel shift assays are not clear but could be due to the following possibilities: (i) protein binding to these sites, as detected by DNase footprinting assays (Fig. 3), may require neighboring sequences, since the probes used in these two assay systems were not entirely the same; (ii) protein bindings to site A and site D may require protein occupancies to site B and site C for stabilization; (iii) site A and site D may not be genuine protein binding sites; instead, they may be created by protein-protein interactions, using sites B or C as anchoring points, thereby masking nuclease accessibilities of the neighboring sequences. Likewise, the failure of detecting enhancing activities for site C and site D in CAT assay (Fig. 4) suggests that proteins recognizing these sites may serve only a structural role. Further studies are needed to clarify these possibilities. Recent studies from several laboratories have demonstrated that several putative positive and negative cis-regulatory elements are present in the promoter regions of the rodent and human mdr genes(35Raymond M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8290-8297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several protein binding sites have been located at the promoter region of the murine mdr1b gene(42Yu L. Cohen D. Piekarz R. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7520-7526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Combates N.J. Rzepka R.W. Chen Y-N.P. Cohen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29715-29719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The study presented here identified an enhancer located between nt −233 and −116 in the mouse mdr1b gene in which four DNase I footprints are located. Further analyses showed that site A and site B together possess full enhancer function, but site B plays a predominant role. Strikingly, these sequences can promote preferentially in hepatoma-derived cell lines. This is the first cell type-specific enhancer found in the mdr locus (a cell type-specific enhancer upstream from the human MDR1 gene was reported(44Kohno K. Sato S. Uchiumi T. Takano H. Kato S. Kuwano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19690-19696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but association to the MDR1 could be due to cloning artifact(45Germann U.A. Schoenlein P.V. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1994; 10: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar)). Site A contains the imperfect inverted repeat sequence 5′-ACTTACCTGAACACGTAAAG (underscored). Mutations in the first half repeat (Fig. 5, mutant e) failed to abolish the function of the enhancer, whereas the second half did (Fig. 5, f and g), suggesting that the 5′ boundary of the enhancer may begin at the second half of site A. We searched DNA sequences recognized by transcription factors in the GenBank and found that the second half repeat of site A contains a subsequence resembling the sequence motif CGT(A/C)A that is critical for binding of a group of cellular transcription factors, i.e. ATP, CREB, E4F1, or E4TF3, and EivF. Although these transcription factors are capable of activating E1a- and cyclic AMP (cAMP)-inducible promoters(46Lee K.A.W. Green M.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 47Lee K.A.W. Fink J.S. Goodman R.H. Green M.R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1988; 8: 1290-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), different promoters respond very differently to these inducers. Thus, whether mdr1b enhancer can be modulated by E1a or by cAMP remains to be determined. However, it may be relevant to note that cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulated sensitivity of mammalian cells to multiple drugs has been reported(50Abraham I. Hunter R.J. Sampson K.E. Smith S. Gottesman M.M. Mayo J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3089-3106Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Site B contains two tetranucleotide direct repeats 5′-GTATGTAAATGTCTGAGG (Fig. 5) and a potential HNF-1 binding site ((G/A)TTAATN(A/T)T(T/C)AG)(51Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 117-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, one copy of p53 binding site (-188AAGACAAGTCT-178) (52El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar) is located between sites A and B of the mdr1b enhancer. However, it has been reported that a single copy of the recognition sequence was insufficient for transcriptional activation by p53(52El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 53Pietenpol J.A. Toking T. Thiagalingam S. El-Deiry W. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1998-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In this context, mdr1b enhancer may not be sensitive to the function of p53, although previous studies have demonstrated that the promoters of human MDR1(38Chin K.V. Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Science. 1992; 255: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) and Chinese hamster Pgp1(55Zastawany R.L. Salvino R. Chen J. Benchimol S. Ling V. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1529-1533PubMed Google Scholar) (both are homologs of murine mdr1a) are modulated differentially by wild-type and mutant p53. In any event, the identities of interacting protein factors that confer cell type-specific enhancer function remain to be demonstrated. DNase I footprinting and gel mobility retardation assays apparently suggested that protein factors recognizing specific binding sites in the mdr1b enhancer are present in both hepatoma and non-hepatoma cells. This does not preclude the possibility that these proteins have a role in the regulation of mdr1b expression, specifically in hepatoma cells. For example, ATBF1, a multiple homeodomain zinc finger protein that selectively down-regulates hepatoma cell-specific enhancer of human α-fetoprotein gene, is present in both hepatoma and nonhepatoma cells(56Morinaga T. Yasuda H. Hashimoto T. Higashio K. Tamaoki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6041-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 57Yasuda H. Mizuno A. Tamaoki T. Morinaga T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At this time, we cannot exclude the possibility of differential posttranscriptional modification of these proteins (e.g. phosphorylation, poly(ADP-ribosylation), etc.) resulting in transcriptional activation of mdr1b gene in liver tumors. Alternatively, these enhancer binding proteins may interact with other non-DNA binding factors to confer tissue specificity in the similar manner as the recently identified novel B cell-derived coactivator (OCA-B), which potentiates the activation of immunoglobulin promoters by octamer-binding transcription factors(58Luo R. Fujii H. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 231-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Several such coactivators have also been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of liver-specific gene expression(59Wang Y. Hahan T.N. Tsai S.Y. Woo S.L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9137-9146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 60Mandel D.B. Khavari P.A. Conley P.S. Graves M.K. Hensen L.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of genes encoding these mdr1b enhancer binding proteins should facilitate understanding of the complex control mechanism of mdr1b gene expression. Levels of mdr1b mRNA are elevated during hepatocarcinogenesis. Studies of mdr1b expression in this system are hampered by the lack of culture cell systems that mimic the in vivo situation. Culturing primary hepatocytes in vitro for several hours shows spontaneous activation of mdr1b expression(61Fardel O Ratanasavanh D. Loyer P. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 205: 847-852Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 62Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 31-40PubMed Google Scholar, 63Lee C.H. Bradley G. Zhang J.T. Ling V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 392-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Whether the enhancer described here is involved in the mdr1b expression in vivo remains to be determined. Investigations using transgenic animals and/or targeting gene delivery to HCC (54Ding Z-M. Cristiano R.J. Roth J.A. Takacs B. Kuo M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3667-3676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 64Kimura O. Yamaguchi Y. Gunning K.B. Teeter L.D. Husain F. Kuo M.T. Human Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) may allow us to address these issues. These experiments are currently under way in our laboratory. In summary, we have characterized a hepatoma-specific enhancer in cultured cells. The identification of this enhancer may serve as a molecular basis for future studies of the regulation of mdr1b expression during hepatocarcinogenesis. These studies may eventually increase our understanding of how mdr gene expression in HCC is controlled and hence facilitate the development of approaches to control intrinsic drug resistance in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2051505762,"We have raised antisera against recombinant peptides expressed from cDNAs fragments common to all splicing variants generated at the Shaker locus of Drosophila and used them as a tool to biochemically characterize these channel proteins. This antisera succeeded in detecting the expression of multiple Shaker potassium channels (Sh Kch), proteins with variable molecular mass (65-85 kDa) and pI (5.5-7). Additionally, for first time, specific Sh proteins of 40-45 kDa most probably corresponding to some of the so-called short Sh cDNAs previously isolated by others have been identified. Using genetic criteria, it has been determined that at least a good part of this variety of proteins is generated by alternative splicing. Developmental experiments show a double wave of Sh Kch channel expression with a first pick at the third instar larvae stage, a minimum at the beginning of puparation, and the highest plateau 36 h after hatching of adult flies. The pattern of Sh splice variants changes dramatically throughout development. A detergent-resistant fraction with about 50% of Sh Kch which seems to be anchored to submembranous structures has been found. Finally, other biochemical properties of Sh Kch, like membrane fractionation and glycosylation, are also described. We have raised antisera against recombinant peptides expressed from cDNAs fragments common to all splicing variants generated at the Shaker locus of Drosophila and used them as a tool to biochemically characterize these channel proteins. This antisera succeeded in detecting the expression of multiple Shaker potassium channels (Sh Kch), proteins with variable molecular mass (65-85 kDa) and pI (5.5-7).

https://openalex.org/W2009851155,"The chimeric gene E2A-PBX1 is formed by the t(1;19) chromosomal translocation exclusively associated with pediatric pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL). The resultant fusion protein from this chimeric gene contains the DNA-binding homeodomain of Pbx1. The first and only functional Pbx1 binding site has been localized in bovine CYP17 to a sequence (CRS1) that participates in cAMP-dependent transcription of this gene encoding the steroid hydroxylase, 17α-hydroxylase cytochrome P450. Because Pbx1 is not expressed in pre-B cells, it may be possible that the E2a-Pbx1 fusion protein expressed in pre-B cells having this translocation will activate, in response to cAMP, transcription of genes not normally expressed in these cells leading to arrest of differentiation at the pre-B cell stage. We have now shown that reporter genes comprising CRS1 are activated transcriptionally by protein kinase A (PKA) in the pre-B cell line 697, which endogenously expresses the fusion protein, and that overexpression of E2A-Pbx1 in additional cell lines enhances transcription of reporter genes in a PKA-dependent fashion. Thus, it seems plausible that arrest in the pre-B stage leading to pre-B ALL includes cAMP-dependent activation of E2A-Pbx1."

In the endoplasmic reticulum, prepro-LPH is split by signal protease. The resulting pro-LPH is cut to mature LPH directly (human) or via a 180-kDa intermediate (rabbit), most likely in the trans-Golgi network or in a later compartment. Antibodies directed against different regions of rabbit pro-LPH locate the cleavage site resulting in the 180-kDa intermediate between amino acid residues 79 and 286. This stretch contains the two sequences -Arg-Cys-Tyr-Arg114˜ and -Arg-Ala-Ser-Arg191˜, which are potential cleavage sites for subtilisin-like proprotein convertases. These sites are not conserved in human pro-LPH. By coexpression in COS 7 cells of rabbit prepro-LPH and proprotein convertases (PC1/3, PC2, PC6A, PC6B, furin), we show that furin, PC1/3, and PC6A generate a processing intermediate that is immunologically indistinguishable from the one observed in vivo. Furin, PC1/3, and PC6A are all expressed in the small intestine as shown by a polymerase chain reaction-based approach and, more specifically, in enterocytes, as shown by in situ hybridization. These results suggest that furin, PC1/3, and/or PC6A are responsible for the in vivo processing of rabbit pro-LPH to the 180-kDa intermediate.

The converting protease(s) responsible for this step have been identified as furin, PC1/3, and/or PC6A. The presence of their transcripts in the rabbit small intestine was confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction approach and by Northern analysis.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The different LPH forms were immunoprecipitated as described by Lottaz et al.(23Lottaz D. Oberholzer T. Bahler P. Semenza G. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), using region-specific polyclonal guinea pig-anti-rabbit LPH sera directed against amino acid residues 21-78 (region Ia), 287-373 (region Ib), 670-750 (region II) (24Zwicker, E., 1993, Laktase-Phlorizin-Hydrolase des Kaninchens: Zwischenprodukte in der Prozessierung und Biosynthese entlang des Dünndarms.

The products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 5% polyacrylamide gels(25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). COS 7 cells (cultured in DMEM/10% FCS; Life Technologies, Inc.) were transiently transfected as described by Chen and Okayama(26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). One day before the transfection, the cells were seeded into 6-well plates, so that they were approximately 80% confluent the next day. During the last 30 min prior to transfection, the cells were incubated in fresh 1.5-ml DMEM/10% FCS at 37°C and 3.5% CO2. The calcium phosphate-DNA mixture was prepared by mixing 5 μg of plasmid DNA with 100 μl of 250 mM CaCl2 and 100 μl of 2 × BBS (50 mM BES, 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4, with NaOH adjusted to exactly pH 6.95) and incubating for 15 min at room temperature. 150 μl of this mixture were then slowly added to the cells, and incubation was continued for 24 h at 37°C and 3.5% CO2. On the following day, the cells were washed twice with PBS, refed with 2 ml of fresh medium, and incubated for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. For immunoverlays (see below), the cells were collected 48 h after transfection by detachment with a rubber policeman. Cells were solubilized in 5 × Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, and then used for SDS-PAGE analysis. For metabolic labeling studies, the cells were cultured for another 24 h in fresh medium. 72 h after transfection, the cells were washed with MEM, and then incubated in 2 ml of labeling medium (MEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS) for 60 min at 37°C and 5% CO2. After depletion of methionine, the cells were pulse-labeled in 1 ml of labeling medium, containing 25 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham) for 1 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and were then either directly collected or chased in DMEM/10% FCS supplemented with 10 mM cold methionine. (In some experiments, BFA was added to all media at a concentration of 5 μg/ml.) The labeled cells were collected and solubilized in 400 μl of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.01 volume of 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 volume of inhibitor mixture (0.25 mg/ml pepstatin, 0.06 mg/ml aprotinin, 1.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 4.7 mg/ml benzamidine, 0.24 mg/ml bestatin, 0.3 mg/ml E-64, and 38.3 mg/ml o-phenanthroline)). Immunoprecipitations, using polyclonal guinea pig-anti rabbit LPH (see above) or monoclonal mouse-anti human LPH (27Hauri H.P. Sterchi E. Bienz D. Fransen J. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) antibodies, were performed as described by Lottaz et al.(23Lottaz D. Oberholzer T. Bahler P. Semenza G. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Protein from polyacrylamide gels was transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore) using semidry blotting in a Sartoblot II-S apparatus (Sartorius) with the buffer system of Kyhse-Andersen(28Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). After incubation in TTW5 (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 0.04% NaN3, 0.05% Tween 20) for 20 min at room temperature, the membrane was incubated with the first antibody (serum dilution 2000× in TTW5) for 60 min, then was washed four times for 5 min with TTW5, incubated with the secondary antibody (goat anti-guinea pig IgG- alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, Inotech/KPL; 1000× diluted in TTW5) for 60 min, and then washed again four times for 5 min with TTW5. The blot was developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Inotech/KPL) in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from small intestine of New Zealand White baby rabbits. 4 μg of mRNA were used for single strand cDNA synthesis (Pharmacia degenerate primers system; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Degenerate primers were designed based on the conserved amino acid sequences within the catalytic domain of known subtilisin-like endoproteases(29Seidah N.G. Day R. Hamelin J. Gaspar A.M. Collard M.W. Chrétien M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Two upstream primers, SGrlac3+ (5′-CAYGGIACNMGNTGYGC, corresponding to the His-Gly-Thr-Arg-Cys-Ala motif, where M = (A/C), R = (A/G), W = (A/T), Y = (C/T), K = (G/T), S = (G/C), N = (A/G/C/T)), and SGrlac6+ (5′-TAYWSIGCIWSNTGGGG, corresponding to the Tyr-Ser-Ala-Ser-Trp-Gly motif) and two downstream primers, SGrlac4- (5′-TGCATRTCNCKCCANGT, corresponding to the Thr-Trp-Arg-Asp-Met-Gln motif) and SGrlac5- (5′-TGNACRTCNCKCCANGT, corresponding to the Thr-Trp-Arg-Asp-Val-Gln motif) were used in PCR for amplification using Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer). In the first reaction (67 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 16.6 mM ammonium sulfate, 6.7 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM dNTP, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.72% bovine serum albumin, and 1.2 μM concentration of each primer), primers SGrlac3+ and SGrlac4- were used and samples were taken through 35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 90 s at 40°C, and 90 s at 65°C. This reaction produced a 600-base pair DNA fragment. In the second reaction, primers SGrlac6+ and SGrlac4- or SGrlac5- were used. 1 μl of a 1/10 dilution of the first reaction was taken through 35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 90 s at 40°C, and 90 s at 65°C. This second reaction produced two bands of 400 and 600 base pairs, respectively, which were cloned into pBluescript by blunt end ligation. Clones were sequenced using T7 or T3 primers and the DNA sequencing kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Nucleotide sequences were compared with the Gene/EMBL Data Bank using the GCG software package (University of Wisconsin). 1 μg of poly(A+) RNA from baby rabbits was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 3% formaldehyde and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham). An RNA probe from a rabbit furin clone was labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP (Boehringer). The probe was hybridized in 5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 0.02% SDS, 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine, 2% (w/v) Boehringer blocking reagent, 20 mM maleic acid, 30 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, at 48°C. Detection with anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer). Intestinal biopsies of adult New Zealand White rabbits were fixed in a 4% phosphate-buffered saline formaldehyde solution for 4 h at room temperature and then embedded in paraffin. The paraffin blocks were cut into 5-μm thick sections which were subsequently mounted onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated glass slides. RNA probes were synthesized in the presence of biotin-11-UTP (Boehringer) from the rabbit cDNA clones described above. The sizes of these cRNAs were approximately 600, 400, 600, and 600 nucleotides for furin, PC1/3, PC2, and PC6A/B, respectively. Their sizes were reduced to about 150 nucleotides by alkaline hydrolysis. Hybridization was performed in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, pH 6.1. The in situ hybridization experiments were performed in a fully automated way, using the VENTANA ISH System (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). After a proteinase pretreatment step with protease 1 (Ventana Medical Systems) for 8 min at 37°C, the slides were washed and dried. After a light denaturing step at 50°C for 1 min, the hybridization was performed for 60 min at 47°C. The slides were washed twice with 2 × SSC, once with 0.5 × SSC, twice with 0.1 × SSC (all at 45°C) and then incubated with 20 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) for 12 min at 37°C. The slides were incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase for 12 min at 42°C. The peroxidase substrate (Ventana Medical Systems), aminoethylcarbonate, and H2O2 were applied for 20 min at 42°C. The slides were removed from the machine and slightly counterstained with Mayer's hemalum solution (Merck) prior to mounting with aquamount solution (BDH). Fig. 1A shows that in the rabbit, as reported by others (see e.g.(11Keller P. Zwicker E. Mantei N. Semenza G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and (12Rossi M. Maiuri L. Russomanno C. Auricchio S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar)), pro-LPH is processed to mature LPH via an intermediate form of 180 kDa. We have raised polyclonal antibodies against different, only once occurring sequences of rabbit pro-LPH (see Fig. 1C). Antibodies against a peptide corresponding to the 59 N-terminal amino acid residues of pro-LPH (segment Ia, amino acid residues 21-78), which did precipitate pro-LPH, failed to precipitate the 180-kDa intermediate form and mature LPH (Fig. 1B, lane Ia); the intermediate form was instead precipitated by antibodies raised against a later segment of region I (i.e. segment Ib, amino acid residues 287-373; Fig. 1B, lane Ib) and a segment of region II (amino acid residues 670-750; Fig. 1B, lane II). Antibodies directed against mature LPH precipitated all LPH forms (Fig. 1B, lane m). Hence, the site of the first split in rabbit pro-LPH must be located between positions 78 and 287 of prepro-LPH. In the last few years, several subtilisin-like proprotein convertases homologous to the yeast kex2 protease have been identified: furin(30Roebroek A.J.M. Schalken J.A. Leunissen J.A.M. Onnekink C.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)) have also been reported. Most prohormones and neuroendocrine precursor proteins of the regulated pathway are processed at KR˜ or RR˜ sequences (˜ indicating the cleavage site), while the precursors of some growth factors and a few plasma membrane proteins (that are delivered via the constitutive pathway) are processed at more complex multibasic cleavage sites of the general type RX(K/R)R˜. However, cleavage after RXXR˜ has been reported in a number of cases (see e.g.(37Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (38Creemers J.W.M. Siezen R.J. Roebroek A.J.M. Ayoubi T.A.Y. Huylebroeck D. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21826-21834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). As to pro-LPH, in the stretch between positions 78 and 287 (i.e. between the sequences of the peptides used to raise antibodies in the experiment above, see Fig. 1C), rabbit pro-LPH contains two sequences of the RXXR˜ type, which are potential cleavage sites for furin or other PCs: -Arg-Ala-Ser-Arg191˜ and -Arg-Cys-Tyr-Arg114˜. Neither site is present in the human enzyme, which is split to final LPH without going through this intermediate. Human pro-LPH, however, does have two dibasic sites between regions Ia and Ib that could in principle serve as a cleavage signal (-Arg-Arg115˜ and -Arg-Arg143˜). COS cells transiently transfected with human prepro-LPH cDNA produce, but proteolytically process pro-LPH to mature LPH only to a very low extent(23Lottaz D. Oberholzer T. Bahler P. Semenza G. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 39Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line, therefore, is suitable to study the effect of PCs on the processing of pro-LPH. We thus coexpressed in COS 7 cells rabbit or human prepro-LPH along with individual PCs (furin, PC1/3, PC2, PC6A, PC6B; see Table 1) of rat and mouse origin.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The results of the coexpression experiments (Fig. 2 and Table 1) clearly show that coexpression of rabbit prepro-LPH with furin and, but to a lesser extent, PC1/3 or PC6A leads to the appearance of a band of approximately 180 kDa. Furin converts more than 55% of 220-kDa pro-LPH into a band with a size identical with the 180-kDa intermediate found in organ culture, whereas PC1/3 and PC6A convert about 38% and 18% of pro-LPH, respectively. All other proteases tested do not cleave the 220-kDa protein in significant amounts. Note that the processing of pro-LPH in general is slow, since in organ cultures even after a 20-h chase there is still some pro-LPH left (cf. Fig. 1A). Interestingly, human pro-LPH (which is directly converted into mature LPH) is not cleaved by any of the PCs tested, providing a “negative control” that furin or PC1/3 or PC6A might indeed be the protease(s) generating the 180-kDa intermediate in rabbit LPH. When human prepro-LPH is cotransfected with PCs, a band of approximately 150 kDa is sometimes detectable (Fig. 2). This band, however, is also visible in cells transfected with human prepro-LPH alone, indicating that human pro-LPH might be processed to some extent (or degraded) by an intrinsic protease of the COS 7 cells. Since processing of pro-LPH is known to take place in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or in a later compartment(23Lottaz D. Oberholzer T. Bahler P. Semenza G. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 41Rossi M. Maiuri L. Salvati V.M. Russomanno C. Auricchio S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we wondered whether this was also true in COS 7 cells overexpressing furin. While the intracellular location of endogenous furin has not been reported (due to its very low level of expression), recombinant furin, expressed after transfection, has been localized to the Golgi complex by immunofluorescence (42Bresnahan P.A.

VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). If this is true also for transfected COS 7 cells, then the processing of rabbit pro-LPH should be prevented by brefeldin A (BFA), since BFA interrupts the transport from the trans-Golgi to the TGN. The processing of rabbit pro-LPH to the 180-kDa intermediate was completely blocked in the presence of 5 μg/ml BFA (Fig. 3). The conclusions therefore are (i) that overexpressed furin is most likely localized in the TGN in COS 7 cells, and (ii) that the processing pattern in the presence or absence of BFA is indistinguishable from the one reported in organ cultures of rabbit small intestine(41Rossi M. Maiuri L. Salvati V.M. Russomanno C. Auricchio S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In analogy to the experiment shown in Fig. 1B, we tried to localize the cleavage site within region I of rabbit pro-LPH using the antibodies generated against regions Ia, Ib, and II. We cotransfected COS 7 cells with rabbit prepro-LPH and all available PCs and detected the different LPH forms on Western blots. The results for furin are shown in Fig. 4. In cells transfected with rabbit prepro-LPH alone, only the 220-kDa band is detectable with all antibodies (there is an additional faint band of approximately 200 kDa; probably high mannose glycosylated pro-LPH). Coexpression with furin leads to the appearance of an additional band at approximately 180 kDa. This band is not detected by the antibody against region Ia, weakly detected by the antibody against region Ib, and clearly detected by the antibody against region II. The same pattern was observed for PC1/3 (data not shown), the 180-kDa band being much weaker due to the lower extent of processing (see Table 1). No band at 180 kDa could be detected for PC2 and PC6B (not shown). Thus, the pattern of LPH bands precipitated by our battery of antibodies is identical in cultures of rabbit small intestine (Fig. 1B) and in COS 7 cells coexpressing rabbit prepro-LPH and furin. Furin mRNA is known to be almost ubiquitous (16Hatsuzawa K. Hosaka M. Nakagawa T. Nagase M. Shoda A. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2022804831,"α1-Inhibitor 3 (α1I3) is a rodent-specific proteinase inhibitor of about 190 kDa belonging to the α2-macroglobulin family. It consists of five globular domains, three of which are connected by disulfide bridges, and contains an intramolecular thiol ester which can react with attacking proteinases. To explore the folding of newly synthesized α1I3, we have used rat hepatocytes and pulse-chase experiments. In one of the analyses, the radiolabeled protein was isolated from cell lysates by immunoprecipitation and its Asp-Pro bonds cleaved by treatment with formic acid. The size of the major fragment, as assessed by electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, was found to increase from 100 to 150 kDa upon the chasing. This result, together with knowledge of the positions of the cleavage sites and the disulfide arrangement, indicates that one of the interdomain disulfide bonds is formed after the synthesis of the polypeptide. Analysis of the same material by limited proteolysis and by velocity centrifugation showed that the folded regions became larger and that the protein became more compact; the thiol ester was found to be formed after these conformational changes. These results suggest that the domains of α1I3 are only partially developed directly after the synthesis of the polypeptide and that they acquire their final structure as the protein condenses and the domains interact with one another. α1-Inhibitor 3 (α1I3) is a rodent-specific proteinase inhibitor of about 190 kDa belonging to the α2-macroglobulin family.

These results suggest that the domains of α1I3 are only partially developed directly after the synthesis of the polypeptide and that they acquire their final structure as the protein condenses and the domains interact with one another. All proteins are synthesized as linear polypeptides which subsequently fold into their unique three-dimensional structure. Studies of the renaturation of isolated proteins have shown that the information required for proper folding of a nascent polypeptide resides in the amino acid sequence alone (Anfinsen, 1973). However, folding in a living cell is faster and more efficient because it is mediated by several proteins (Lorimer, 1992). So far, the in vivo folding of only a small number of proteins has been investigated in any detail, but the mechanisms of this process are presently the subject of intense studies (Jaenicke, 1991; Gething and Sambrook, 1992). Secretory proteins fold in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumα1I3α1-inhibitor 3PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. where they also undergo various kinds of modifications (Hurtley and Helenius, 1989). In particular, most of these proteins acquire disulfide bonds, a reaction mediated by protein disulfide isomerase (Bulleid and Freedman, 1988), one of the most abundant proteins in the lumen of the ER (Freedman, 1984). The rate at which different proteins fold varies greatly; some acquire their final conformation more or less cotranslationally (Peters and Davidson, 1982), whereas others may require up to an hour (Lodish and Kong, 1991) facilitating analysis of the reaction. endoplasmic reticulum α1-inhibitor 3 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In this study we have analyzed the folding of α1-inhibitor 3 (α1I3), a 180-200 kDa proteinase inhibitor secreted by rodent hepatocytes (Esnard and Gauthier, 1980; Geiger et al., 1987; Sjöberg et al., 1991). α1I3 shows sequence homology with α2-macroglobulin and the complement components 3 and 4 (Braciak et al., 1988; Sottrup-Jensen, 1989). All of these proteins have two characteristic features: they contain an intramolecular thiol ester and have a sequence which is particularly sensitive to proteolysis, the bait region (Esnard et al., 1985; Sottrup-Jensen et al., 1989). When the polypeptide is cleaved in the bait region, the protein undergoes a conformational change, and the thiol ester becomes exposed to the exterior (Sottrup-Jensen, 1989); in this position the thiol ester may react with hydroxyl or amino groups on adjacent proteins or carbohydrates forming a covalent link (Enghild et al., 1989). α1I3 appears to consist of five globular domains (Rubenstein et al., 1991), and electron microscopic analysis has revealed a ring-like structure (Ikai et al., 1990). In a previous study we found that some disulfides of α1I3 are formed after the synthesis of the polypeptide, indicating that part of the folding occurs posttranslationally (Sjöberg et al., 1991). In the present paper we have characterized this process further. Our results indicate that the newly synthesized protein undergoes a gross conformational change upon which the globular domains acquire their final structure. [35S]Methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) and 14C-methylated molecular mass standards were purchased from Amersham International, Bucks., United Kingdom. Protein disulfide isomerase, which had been isolated from bovine liver, was kindly given to us by Margareta Ingelman (Biomedical Center University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden). Saponin was from E. Merck, Darmstadt, Federal Republic of Germany, and chymotrypsin A4 from Boehringer Mannheim. Rat hepatocytes were isolated and cultured in 60-mm dishes for 20-24 h as described (Sjöberg et al., 1991). The cells were labeled for 10 min with 50-80 μCi of [35S]methionine as described previously (Sjöberg et al., 1991). After different times of chasing, the plates were put on ice and the medium withdrawn. The cells were rinsed twice with 250 mM sucrose and twice with 50 mM sucrose, and 800 μl of the latter sucrose solution was added; all solutions contained 0.1 mMN-methylmaleimide. The cells were then scraped off the dishes, homogenized, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1.6 × 103× g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and mixed with 80 μl of a solution containing 200 g/liter Triton X-100, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mMN-ethylmaleimide, and 20 mM iodoacetamide (solubilizing buffer). Normal rabbit IgG (5 μg), rabbit antibodies against human albumin (10 μg), or a rabbit serum against α1-microglobulin (1.5 μl) was added to all samples. After an overnight incubation at 4°C, 50 μl of a 10% (w/v) suspension of glutaraldehyde-fixed Staphylococcus aureus bacteria was added. The test tubes containing the mixtures were rotated end-over-end for 40-60 min, and the bacteria were removed by centrifugation. Then 1.5 μl of a rabbit serum against α1I3 was added. After 3-4 h the immunocomplexes were collected, treated with methylamine unless indicated, and analyzed as described previously (Sjöberg et al., 1991). The immunocomplexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels (Mini-PROTEAN II, Bio-Rad; 0.75-mm spacers). Gel strips containing the different lanes were cut out and soaked in 75% (v/v) formic acid for 3-4 h at room temperature essentially as described (Sonderegger et al., 1982). The acid was then removed and paraffin oil (0.88 g/ml) added. After incubation at 37°C for 18 h, the gel strips were soaked twice for 1 h in 250 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 5 g/liter SDS and twice for 1 h in 125 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 5 g/liter SDS, 20% glycerol. They were then placed on top of the stacking gel of a polyacrylamide gel (20 × 25 × 0.15 cm) with a 10-15% gel gradient. Finally, the gel strips were fixed by the addition of more stacking gel and running buffer containing 1.3 g/liter SDS added. The electrophoresis was run overnight at 7 mA. Immunocomplexes were collected as described above and limited proteolysis was performed essentially as described by Rubenstein et al.(1991). The washed S. aureus particles were suspended in 10 μl of a buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 100 mM β-propionitrile, 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 and 0.1 mg/ml chymotrypsin. The samples were then incubated for 15 min at 37°C. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 1.5 μl of 200 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 μl of the sample buffer used for SDS-PAGE with or without a reducing agent was added. The mixtures were then heated for 3 min at 95°C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The cells in two dishes were pulse-labeled as described above and the cells in one dish were then chased for 20 min. After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated for 60 min at +4°C with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.0 mg/ml of saponin, 0.1 mMN-ethylmalemide, and 2 mM iodoacetamide on a rocking device; this treatment releases all secretory proteins from the ER (Wassler et al., 1987). The saponin extracts from both dishes were collected, mixed, and 400 μl was layered on a 5-30% (w/w) sucrose gradient containing 25 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, and 0.1 mMN-ethylmalemide. After centrifugation at 112 × 103× g for 32 h at 4°C, the bottom of the tube was punctured and 250-μl fractions collected. A sample containing aldolase was treated in the same way. The cells in two dishes were pulse-labeled, homogenized, and centrifuged as described above except that the sucrose-containing solutions lacked N-ethylmalemide and were supplemented with 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The resulting supernatant was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. After thawing, the sample was centrifuged in an Airfuge (Beckman) at maximum speed for 10 min. The supernatant was withdrawn and the pelleted membranes suspended to their original volume in a buffer containing 20 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM Hepes, 2.0 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, with or without 10 mg/ml Triton X-100; this solution was degassed immediately before use. Where indicated, reduced and oxidized glutathione (both at a final concentration of 0.6 mM) and protein disulfide isomerase (1.7-2.0 mg/ml) were added to the reaction mixture; these additives constituted 10% of the final volume. After incubation for different times at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of a 10 times concentrate of the solubilizing buffer described earlier. The samples were stored at −70°C before electrophoretic analysis. Immunocomplexes were suspended in 35 μl of a solution containing 83 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 g/liter sucrose, 30 g/liter SDS, 0.1 g/liter bromphenol blue, and 4 mM EDTA and heated at 80°C for 60 min. Then 5 μl of 50 mM dithiothreitol was added, and the samples were heated at 95°C for 3 min. Most proteins migrate more rapidly upon SDS-PAGE in the oxidized than in the reduced form presumably, because the presence of disulfides makes the proteins more compact. α1I3 (in its secreted, mature form) is unusual in that it has a lower mobility under nonreducing than reducing conditions; the apparent molecular masses of secreted α1I3 upon SDS-PAGE in the absence and presence of a reducing agent are 210 and 184 kDa, respectively (Saito and Sinohara, 1985; Sjöberg et al., 1991). Examples of other proteins behaving in the same way are complement component 4 (Karp, 1983) and the insulin receptor (Olson et al., 1988). Apparently, the disulfides in these proteins are arranged in such a way that they disturb the SDS binding. Analysis of cellular α1I3 from a pulse-chase experiment by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions shows that the mobility decreases stepwise (Fig. 1), the apparent molecular mass increasing from 162 to 210 kDa. Four different bands can be detected, denoted α and β1-β3 in Fig. 1, indicating that at least three new disulfides are formed posttranslationally. As α disappears, β1 and β2 appear, apparently simultaneously, and finally, β3 becomes the major band. Under reducing conditions, α and β1-β3 all have the same mobility, which is intermediate to those of α and β1 (Sjöberg et al., 1991). Thus, the mobility of pulse-labeled α1I3, in contrast to that of later forms, is higher under nonreducing than reducing conditions. This fact shows that at least one disulfide is formed cotranslationally. In our previous study, a substantial part of the radiolabeled α1I3 remained in the cells even after a prolonged chase (Sjöberg et al., 1991). We later found that the inefficiency of the secretion was due to the presence of cycloheximide which was added to stop further incorporation of the labeled amino acid; this drug was therefore not used in the present study. Fig. 2 shows the the domain structure as well as the disulfide arrangement of mature α1I3 as proposed by Rubenstein et al.(1991) and Braciack et al.(1988), respectively. To characterize the posttranslationally formed disulfide bonds of α1I3, we cleaved the radiolabeled protein at specific sites with formic acid and analyzed the products by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The triangles in Fig. 2 indicate the positions of the amide bonds that are sensitive to treatment with formic acid, those between aspartyl and prolyl residues (Landon, 1977). Only two of the acid-sensitive bonds are located outside disulfide-linked cysteine residues, and these are both near the N terminus. Therefore, treatment of secreted α1I3 with formic acid followed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions should yield a relatively large fragment. It should be added here that cloning of cDNA for rat α1I3 has revealed that there are at least four different isoforms of this protein (Braciack et al., 1988). The complete nucleotide sequence is known for only one of them but the partial amino sequence obtained from proteolytic fragments of α1I3 isolated from serum (Rubenstein et al., 1991) indicates that this is the major form. For the experiment shown in Fig. 3A, α1I3 was isolated by immunoprecipitation from the medium of hepatocytes labeled with [35S]methionine or from a lysate of pulse-labeled cells. Coprecipitating proteins were then separated from α1I3 by electrophoresis in a short polyacrylamide gel. The gel strips containing the different electrophoretic lanes were cut out and treated with formic acid. They were then placed along the upper edge of an electrophoresis gel, and the protein fragments were separated. When the electrophoresis was performed under nonreducing conditions, secreted α1I3 (lane 1) yielded two major bands: the intact protein of 200 kDa and a 150-kDa fragment (arrow). Cellular, pulse-labeled α1I3 (lane 2) yielded both these fragments as well as smaller ones, in particular in the range 90-110 kDa (bracket). Under reducing conditions, identical fragments were obtained from both secreted and pulse-labeled α1I3 (lanes 3 and 4, respectively); the major bands had apparent molecular masses of about 95 and 55 kDa. As judged from the amino acid sequence of α1I3, the largest fragments formed by mild acid hydrolysis should be of 43 and 44 kDa (cf. Fig. 2). The presence of the 95 kDa band therefore implies that the cleavage reaction was incomplete; longer incubation was not beneficial, however, because it resulted in substantial loss of fragments. In a time course study we found that the relative amount of polypeptides larger than 110 kDa increased upon chasing (Fig. 3B); densitometric analysis showed that this amount increased from 38 to 86% during 40 min of chase, the half-maximal increase occurring after 10-20 min. Incompletely folded proteins are more sensitive to proteolytic degradation than mature ones, and a decrease in protease sensitivity can therefore be used as an indicator of folding (Scheele and Jacoby, 1982). To see if this technique would reveal conformational changes in α1I3, we isolated the protein by immunoprecipitation from cells that had been pulse-labeled and chased for different times and incubated it briefly with chymotrypsin; the protease inhibiting activity of α1I3 had been blocked by the addition of β-propionitrile (Rubenstein et al., 1991). The cleavage products were then detected by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Since artifactual bands have been reported to occur with this technique, the results should be treated with some caution (Rüchel et al., 1974). With pulse-labeled α1I3 (Fig. 4; 0-min chase), three protease-resistant fragments of 77, 50, and 37 kDa were obtained. Upon chasing, the relative amount of the 77- and 50-kDa bands decreased and concurrently, polypeptides of 97, 89, 86/84, and 65 kDa appeared. Densitometric analysis of the fluorograms showed that the half-life of the former bands was 10-20 min. When α1I3 from the cell medium was treated with chymotrypsin under the same conditions, three major bands of 90, 69, and 43 kDa were formed (data not shown). We wished to see if the posttranslational folding of α1I3 could be detected also as a change in the sedimentation properties of the protein. A sample was therefore prepared containing both early and late forms of radioactively labeled α1I3 and subjected to velocity centrifugation. Fig. 5 shows that α1I3 of the β3 form sedimented faster than both the α and the β2 forms, suggesting that α1I3 becomes more spherical and/or compact shortly after its synthesis; the difference between the sedimentation coefficients of the slowest and fastest forms can be estimated to about one S unit. The binding of a small protein would also account for the increase in the sedimentation rate of α1I3. However, the fact that the sedimentation rate seemed to increase stepwise with time of chase makes this possibility unlikely. The sedimentation rate of the α form was similar to that of aldolase (data not shown), which has a sedimentation coefficient of 7.4 S (Stellwagen and Schachman, 1962); that of secreted α1I3 is 8.6 S (Esnard and Gauthier, 1980). To be able to biochemically analyze the process underlying the folding of α1I3, we attempted to obtain the reaction in a cell-free system. For this purpose, microsomes were prepared from pulse-labeled hepatocytes and incubated at 37°C for up to 30 min. α1I3 was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Fig. 6 shows that within 15 min of incubation, the initial form of α1I3 (band α) had essentially disappeared, and the slowest migrating band (β3) had become the major form; the bands β1 and β2 appeared to be intermediates in this transition. As a result of the incubation, some immunoreactive material had formed that was too large to enter the separating gel (arrow), probably disulfide-linked aggregates of α1I3. Addition of the calcium ionophore A23187 (2 μM) and EGTA (1 mM) did not affect the reaction, showing that it was not dependent on Ca2+. To see whether the conformational change of α1I3 could also occur in free solution, we isolated microsomes from pulse-labeled cells, solubilized them with Triton X-100, and incubated at 37°C; predominantly the intermediate forms, β1 and β2, were formed (Fig. 6, TX). If, however, the medium was made less oxidizing by the addition of reduced and oxidized glutathione (both of 0.6 mM), a minor increase of β3 occurred (Fig. 6, TX+G); the calculated redox potential of this solution is −0.14 V (Hwang et al., 1992). Addition of protein disulfide isomerase to the incubation mixture (TX+G+PDI) enhanced the rate of transition several times, yielding band β3 as the end product. If thiol ester-containing proteins are heated under denaturing conditions, an amide bond adjacent to the thiol ester is cleaved (Harpel et al., 1979; Howard et al., 1980). When the secreted form of α1I3 is treated in such a way, analysis by SDS-PAGE yields two fragments of about 150 and 60 kDa (Esnard et al., 1985; Sjöberg et al., 1991) (see Fig. 7A, bands denoted b‘ and c‘). The cell samples in Fig. 7A show the time course for the formation of the thiol ester. As reported previously (Sjöberg et al., 1991), temperature-sensitive α1I3 appears with a lag of 10-30 min. The relative amount of cleaved α1I3 was lower in the cell than in the medium samples, indicating that the formation of the thiol ester occurs immediately before or upon secretion. Since our results showed that the thiol ester is formed after the disulfide bonds, we were interested to see if this structure would also form in a cell-free system. Fig. 7B shows that upon incubation of pulse-labeled microsomes, heat-sensitive α1I3 was rapidly formed; densitometric analysis of the fluorogram showed that the t of the reaction was about 15 min and that the maximum level was 25-35% of the total amount. When the microsomes were first solubilized and then incubated under the conditions that we had found to be optimal for the formation of the disulfides, the thiol ester was formed with the same efficiency as in the microsomes. In this study we obtained evidence that at least one of the interdomain disulfides of α1I3 is formed after the synthesis of the polypeptide. This conclusion is based on the analysis of pulse-chase experiments in which α1I3 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and cleaved with formic acid. Subsequent detection of the cleavage products by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions showed that the size of the major fragment shifted from 100 to 150 kDa upon chasing (Fig. 3B). With the assumption that cleavage occurred at the same rate at all Gly-Pro bonds, the simplest explanation for this finding is that the disulfide that links domains III and IV (Fig. 2), and which spans half of the cleavage sites, is formed during the chase. Another method we used to monitor the folding of α1I3 is based on the observation that tightly folded regions or domains are more resistant to proteolytic degradation than extended polypeptide segments (Porter, 1959; Fontana et al., 1986). This method had earlier been used to identify the domains of mature, secreted α1I3 (Rubenstein et al. 1991; Fig. 2). In that investigation, the protein was isolated from rat serum and treated with increasing concentrations of chymotrypsin. The cleavage products were then separated by SDS-PAGE and the obtained polypeptide bands identified by amino acid sequencing. The initial cleavage products were two bands of about 100 kDa, which were found to be formed by scission of the bait region (see Fig. 2), the upper and lower bands representing the C- and N-terminal halves, respectively. At higher chymotrypsin concentrations, the C-terminal fragment gave rise to two bands of 64 and 43 kDa (domains IV and V, respectively; see Fig. 2). In the present study we found that when radiolabeled α1I3 from cells chased for 20 min or more was treated with a low concentration of chymotrypsin, three major fragments of 86/84, 65, and 37 kDa were obtained (Fig. 4). The similarity of the sizes of these fragments to those obtained from secreted α1I3 suggests that they represent the N-terminal half of the molecule and domains IV and V, respectively. (Intracellular forms usually have lower apparent molecular masses due to incomplete carbohydrate processing.) Chymotrypsin treatment of pulse-labeled α1I3 also yielded the 37-kDa band, but the other major fragments, of 77 and 50 kDa, were clearly different from those obtained from chased cells; however, comparison of the peptide patterns of the 77- and the 86/84-kDa fragments after cleavage with formic acid indicated that these fragments were partially identical. 2M. Wassler, F. Esnard, and E. Fries, unpublished observations. A simple explanation for these results is that the C-terminal region of α1I3 (domain V) is fully folded in the pulse-labeled protein, whereas the central region is not and is therefore partially degraded upon treatment with chymotrypsin. The 77- and 50-kDa fragments would then represent truncated forms of domains I-III and domain IV, respectively. Regardless of whether this interpretation is correct or not, our results show that the proteinase resistant regions become larger after the synthesis of the polypeptide. Furthermore, they indicate that the protein occurs in two distinct conformations, since the fragments of α1I3 obtained from pulse-labeled and chased cells were markedly different and there seemed to be no intermediates. Concurrent with the shift in the sizes of the proteinase-resistant fragments and the formation of new disulfides, α1I3 became more compact as shown by the fact that its sedimentation rate increased (Fig. 5). It is possible that these conformational changes reflect a transition from an open, extended structure to the ring-like shape of the mature protein (Ikai et al., 1990). We also found that these changes preceded the appearance of the thiol ester, suggesting that the formation of this structure requires an almost completely folded protein. This notion is supported by the finding that mutated forms of complement component 3, in which the thiol ester could not be formed because one of the necessary amino acid residues was missing, had a native-like conformation (Isaac and Isenman, 1992). When the bait region of α1I3 and related proteins is proteolytically cleaved, the thiol ester becomes exposed to the exterior of the molecule making linkage to proteases possible (Enghild et al., 1989). Simultaneously, the conformation of the C-terminal part changes so that the proteins will bind to cell surface receptors effecting their removal from the blood stream (Van Leuven et al., 1986; Law and Dodds, 1990). Under the electron microscope, α1I3 appears to consist of one large and two small elements forming an assymmetric ring; upon cleavage of the bait region, the molecule acquires a more open, C-like shape (Ikai et al., 1990). Presumably, the bait region is located in the larger, central domain, and upon cleavage, this part of the molecule changes its conformation so that the flanking structures are forced apart. Clearly, this reaction must require a close association between neighboring domains; the presence of interdomain disulfides (Fig. 2) indicates that this is indeed the case. The redox potential of the interior of the ER has been found to be intermediate between that of the cytoplasm and the extracellular space (Hwang et al., 1992). The physiological significance of this observation has been borne out by studies on the folding of proteins in cell-free systems which have shown that the formation of correct disulfides is optimal under weakly oxidizing conditions (Scheele and Jacoby, 1982; Huth et al., 1993; Lilie et al., 1994). Consistent with these observations, we found that when pulse-labeled α1I3 in free form was incubated in the presence of a mixture of reduced and oxidized glutathione, a substantial part of the protein acquired the correct disulfides as judged by its mobility upon SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 6, TX+G); under more oxidizing conditions, in the absence of glutathione, the formation of the disulfides was incomplete and/or incorrect (Fig. 6, TX). In agreement with previous studies on other proteins (Bulleid and Freedman, 1988; Huth et al., 1993; Creighton et al., 1993), we found that the efficiency of the folding reaction was greatly enhanced in the presence of protein disulfide isomerase (Fig. 6, TX+G+PDI); in addition to mediating the formation of disulfides, this protein may also act as a chaperone (Noiva and Lennarz, 1992). We also measured the formation of the thiol ester of α1I3 in the cell-free systems. This analysis showed that the in vitro folding was only partially complete (Fig. 7B). It is possible that this result is due to our incubation mixture being too oxidizing. This explanation is supported by the fact that the folding rate, as judged by the rate of disulfide formation, was higher in vitro than in vivo and that the redox potential of our incubation medium was higher (−0.14 V) than what has been reported to be optimal for other in vitro folding systems (−0.18 to −0.31 V; Huth et al. 1993; Marquardt et al., 1993). It should also be noted that in the living cell, the thiol ester formation is less efficient than the formation of the disulfides (cf. Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:A). In summary, our results suggest that α1I3 directly after its synthesis has an only partially developed domain structure. It then undergoes a conformational change that appears to bring the domains together, whereby they acquire their final structure. Such an interactive folding process has previously been described for oligomeric proteins in which the conformation of the subunits has been found to change upon assembly (Huth et al., 1992; Hurtley and Helenius, 1989).

To test for a possible functional link between phosphorylation and the previously described Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat (LTR) repression (Yeh, C. H., and Shatkin, A. J.(1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A major phosphorylation target in p21/SIIR was localized to the Arg/Ser-rich region between amino acids 12 and 49. Deletion of this region impaired the ability of p21/SIIR to down-regulate RSV LTR promoter function. Four serine pairs, all displaying the Arg/Lys-Ser-Ser motif typical of phosphorylation sites, are present in p21/SIIR between positions 31 and 48. Conversion of these individual serine pairs to alanine resulted in decreased phosphorylation in each case. Mutation of the Ser36-Ser37 pair also diminished by severalfold the repression activity of p21/SIIR. The single tyrosine (Tyr155) in p21/SIIR was not detectably phosphorylated in transfected COS-1 cells, suggesting that the Ser36-Ser37 pair mediates Ser/Thr phosphorylation of p21/SIIR and is critical for LTR repression function.

Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common forms of post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells. It is involved in the regulation of a multitude of cellular processes(1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar, 2Campbell J.S. Seger R. Graves J.D. Graves L.M. Jensen A.M. Krebs E.G. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 131-159PubMed Google Scholar). Since many different types of stimuli that affect gene expression also lead to the activation of protein kinases, it is not surprising that transcription factors are directly regulated by phosphorylation. Almost every eukaryotic transcription factor that has been analyzed in detail has proved to be phosphorylated, and global regulation of transcription involves phosphorylation of both general transcription factors and subunits of RNA polymerases(3Hill C.S.

Nature. 1995; 374: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of transcription factors has also been shown to modulate protein subcellular localization, DNA binding activity, and transactivation function(5Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of transcriptional control by phosphoproteins and the role of phosphorylation status in these processes have been intensively investigated. A thorough analysis of transcription factor phosphorylation will be essential for complete understanding of the signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and differentiation.

Examination of the primary sequence of p21/SIIR revealed that it contains an Arg/Ser-rich region (amino acids 4-72) near the N-terminal end. This region includes multiple phosphorylation consensus sites for a variety of cellular kinases including protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, p34cdc2 kinase, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase II, and glycogen synthase kinase 3(8Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step toward unraveling the upstream signaling pathway involved in p21/SIIR regulation, we set out to identify any site(s) of phosphorylation in p21/SIIR and to test their importance for RSV LTR repression function. Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase hemagglutinin putative domain polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In this communication, we demonstrate that a segment in p21/SIIR encompassing amino acids 12 to 49 represents a major site of phosphorylation that is required for the inhibition of RSV LTR. Further mutation analysis revealed that the Ser36-Ser37 pair is crucial for both phosphorylation and promoter repression function, suggesting that Ser/Thr phosphorylation mediated through this Ser pair plays a role in regulating p21/SIIR activity. Vectors for expression of CAT reporter gene (pR-CAT) and HA-tagged p21/SIIR (pR-p21) were constructed as described previously(7Yeh C.H. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11002-11006Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To obtain truncated proteins of p21/SIIR, synthetic oligonucleotides were used to introduce unique DraI or PvuII sites into p21/SIIR cDNA (in pBluescript) by single-stranded DNA-based mutagenesis(9Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were digested with DraI or PvuII to delete defined regions (amino acids 12-49, 50-100, and 101-149), and the plasmids were then religated. Four serine to alanine mutants, S31A/S32A, S36A/S37A, S41A/S42A, and S47A/S48A, were created by the same mutagenesis method. All mutants and ligation junctions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For expression in mammalian cells, these constructs were inserted into the XhoI and XbaI sites of the expression vector pBC12BI(7Yeh C.H. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11002-11006Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recombinant plasmids were Qiagen-column purified and transfected into COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran method(7Yeh C.H. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11002-11006Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transfected with 5 μg of the indicated expression plasmid were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) minus phosphate or methionine for 1 h prior to addition of [32P]phosphate (800 μCi/ml) or [35S]methionine (200 μCi/ml, Amersham). After incubation for 3-4 h, cells were washed and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA: 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts (500 μl containing ~500 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated using 5 μl of anti-HA monoclonal antibody for ~16 h at 4°C, followed by 40 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4°C. Bound radiolabeled proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed three times in RIPA buffer and one time in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Western blotting of the anti-HA immunoprecipitated complexes was also performed after 12.5% SDS-PAGE using 1:1000 dilutions of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (7Yeh C.H. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11002-11006Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Yeh C.H. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol.

COS-1 cells were cotransfected by the DEAE-dextran method with 0.5 μg of CAT reporter and 5 μg of the appropriate vector for expression of p21/SIIR or mutant proteins, or the same amount of control parental vector pBC12BI. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and extracts were assayed for CAT protein level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(7Yeh C.H. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11002-11006Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To determine if p21/SIIR can be phosphorylated in mammalian cells and to localize any phosphorylation site(s), we constructed mutants deleted in amino acids 12-49 (pd12-49), 50-100 (pd50-100), and 101-149 (pd101-149). COS-1 cells were transfected with control vector pBC12BI, a plasmid expressing full-length p21/SIIR, or one of the deletion mutants. Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with either [32P]phosphate or [35S]methionine, and cell extracts were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1, cells transfected with the control plasmid did not contain radiolabeled, immunoprecipitable proteins (lane 1). However, 32P-labeled bands migrating in the positions of full-length p21/SIIR (lane 2), mutant pd50-100 (lane 4), and mutant pd101-149 proteins (lane 5) were obtained from the corresponding transfected cells (Fig. 1, right panel). In contrast, 32P radiolabeling was eliminated in the pd12-49 mutant (lane 3) indicating that this region of p21/SIIR contains a major phosphorylation site(s). Although the expression of p21/SIIR and all three deletion mutants was confirmed by [35S]methionine labeling (Fig. 1, left panel), pd12-49 (lane 3) and pd50-100 (lane 4) were present in 10-15-fold lower amounts than either the full-length protein (lane 2) or mutant pd101-149 (lane 5). (Cross-reacting immunoprecipitated proteins were also evident in positions just above and below the mutant proteins.) After correction for the differences in protein levels and methionine content, mutant pd50-100 had the highest relative level of phosphorylation and pd12-49 the lowest. We also compared the effects of the p21/SIIR deletion mutants on RSV LTR-driven CAT reporter gene expression in cotransfected COS-1 cells. As reported previously(7Yeh C.H. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11002-11006Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), mutant proteins pd12-49 and pd50-100 lost 84% and 94%, respectively, of the inhibitory activity of full-length p21/SIIR (data not shown). In contrast, the inhibitory activity of pd101-149 was essentially unchanged, and, like the full-length protein, this mutant repressed CAT expression by 15-fold (data not shown). These results indicate that sequences in p21/SIIR between residues 12 and 100, which includes the major phosphorylation site, are necessary for RSV LTR repression. Since either a relatively high degree of phosphorylation (pd50-100) or negligible phosphorylation (pd12-49) both resulted in almost complete loss of LTR repression, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation has an important role in regulating the LTR promoter repression function of p21/SIIR. Excess phosphorylation of p21/SIIR may induce an inappropriate conformation resulting in an inactive protein, while a single (or few) phosphorylation event(s) may be insufficient to activate p21/SIIR. We next sought to identify in the major phosphorylation site (amino acids 12-49) any specific residues necessary for phosphorylation and possibly also the LTR repression activity of p21/SIIR. Four potentially phosphorylated serine pairs are present in this region, and they display multiple phosphorylation consensus sequences for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Arg-Arg-Ser41-Ser42, Arg-Arg-Ser47-Ser48), protein kinase C (Pro-Arg-Ser36-Ser37, Arg-Arg-Ser41-Ser42, Arg-Arg-Ser47-Ser48), p34cdc2 kinase (Ser31-Ser32-Pro-Pro-Arg, Ser41-Ser42-Pro-Arg-Arg), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (Ser31-Ser32-Pro-Pro-Arg-Ser36-Ser37, Ser36-Ser37-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ser41-Ser42) (Fig. 2)(8Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each serine pair was mutated to alanine, and the resulting mutant proteins were tested for phosphorylation level and effect on RSV LTR-driven reporter CAT expression in COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, right panel, mutation of individual serine pairs resulted in a decreased level of phosphorylation in each case.Figure 3Decreased phosphorylation level and repression function of p21/SIIR S36A/S37A mutant. A, COS-1 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]phosphate (right panel) or [35S]methionine (left panel) after transfection with the control vector pBC12BI (lane 1) or expression plasmids for p21/SIIR (lane 2) or the four serine to alanine mutants (lanes 3-6). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. B, the intensity of each band shown in A was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. After correction for the differences in protein expression, the relative phosphorylation level of each mutant was normalized to the wild-type p21/SIIR level set as 100% (right panel). To assay for repression of RSV LTR, COS-1 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of CAT reporter plasmid and 5 μg of either pBC12BI or expression vector for the indicated p21/SIIR constructs. Results were normalized to the CAT value obtained from pBC12BI-transfected samples and expressed as the fold repression of pR-CAT (left panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By normalization to [35S]methionine incorporation (Fig. 3A, left panel), we found that serine to alanine mutants S31A/S32A and S47A/S48A were phosphorylated at 40% and 45% of the p21/SIIR level, respectively, and in the S41A/S42A and S36A/S37A mutants phosphorylation was decreased 75% and 83%, respectively, relative to p21/SIIR (Fig. 3B, right). These data suggest that phosphorylation of p21/SIIR is a complex process, and one phosphorylation event may influence another. As in hierarchal protein phosphorylation, which usually involves different protein kinases(11Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there may be distinctive primary phosphorylation(s) of p21/SIIR which affect the course of subsequent secondary phosphorylation(s). It is reasonable that if the actions of several kinases influence the functional status of a target protein, its regulation would be more complex relative to that of a single kinase. Comparison of the effects of p21/SIIR mutants on RSV LTR promoter demonstrated that alanine replacements at Ser41-Ser42 had no adverse effect on p21/SIIR repression of pR-CAT expression (Fig. 3B, left), and mutation at Ser31-Ser32 or Ser47-Ser48 resulted in only a slight decrease in inhibitory activity (14-fold and 13-fold repression of pR-CAT, respectively, compared to 16-fold by wild-type p21/SIIR). However, the S36A/S37A mutation resulted in a substantial loss of LTR repression function (2.4-fold compared to 16-fold inhibition) (Fig. 3B, left). Thus, both promoter repression activity and phosphorylation level were decreased in the S36A/S37A mutant, suggesting that RSV LTR repression by p21/SIIR may be regulated by the phosphorylation events mediated by the Ser36-Ser37 pair. It will be of interest to test if p21/SIIR can be phosphorylated on Ser36 and/or Ser37 by PKC and/or glycogen synthase kinase 3. Tyrosine phosphorylation usually precedes Ser/Thr phosphorylation in the signal transduction network(12Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; . 119: 123-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Cantly L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar, 14Fu X.Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). As a first step to determine if phosphorylation of the single p21/SIIR tyrosine (Tyr155) is involved in regulating repression activity, extracts were prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with p21/SIIR expression plasmid or the control vector pBC12BI. Samples were either immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody or not and then immunoblotted with either anti-HA or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. No phosphotyrosine was detected in p21/SIIR either with or without immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 8), suggesting that regulation of p21/SIIR activity involves Ser/Thr but not Tyr phosphorylation. The results presented here indicate that the major phosphorylation site associated with p21/SIIR repression activity resides within a region of 38 amino acids between residues 12 and 49. A frequent hallmark of regulatory phosphorylation is the clustering of phosphorylation sites (11Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Roach P.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and this region of p21/SIIR contains four serine pairs with the motif Arg/Lys-Ser-Ser. These observations make the serine pairs good candidates for regulating p21/SIIR activity. Indeed, we have identified Ser36-Ser37 as critical residues for mediating phosphorylation and repression activity of p21/SIIR. Moreover, p21/SIIR mutants that had either a high (pd50-100) or relatively low level of phosphorylation (pd12-49, S36A/S37A) were less effective inhibitors of the RSV LTR promoter, implying that multisite phosphorylation may provide a means for fine-tuning p21/SIIR repression activity."
