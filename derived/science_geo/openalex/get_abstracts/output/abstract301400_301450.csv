https://openalex.org/W2086389569,The specific heats of lunar samples 10057 and 10084 returned by the Apollo 11 mission have been measured between 90 and 350 degrees Kelvin by use of an adiabatic calorimeter. The samples are representative of type A vesicular basalt-like rocks and of finely divided lunar soil. The specific heat of these materials changes smoothly from about 0.06 calorie per gram per degree at 90 degrees Kelvin to about 0.2 calorie per gram per degree at 350 degrees Kelvin. The thermal parameter gamma=(kpC-(1/2) for the lunar surface will accordingly vary by a factor of about 2 between lunar noon and midnight.
https://openalex.org/W2051873707,"Twelve rock chips and two samples of fines all have electronic absorption bands in diffuse reflected light between 0.32 and 2.5 micrometers. Major bands occur between 0.94 and 1.00 micrometer and at 2.0 micrometers, and arise from Fe(2+) in clinopyroxene and to a lesser extent in olivine. A band at 0.95 micrometer and other details of curve slope and shape for the lunar surface fines match McCord's telescopic curve for an 18-kilometer area that includes the Apollo-il site. Results confirm mineralogical predictions based on telescopic data and support the feasibility of obtaining mineralogical information by remote and in glass content. reflectivity measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2015337665,Reflectivity and polarization laws for the powder sample and its spectrum are close to the mean for the lunar maria. Solid samples show a marked absorption feature at 1 micron. The low albedo appears to be due to a surface coating on dust grains rather than to volume absorption. The high-frequency electrical properties resemble those of a fine powder made from typical dense terrestrial rocks and are consistent with previous estimates from ground-based radar observations. The differential mass spectrum is almost constant from 100 micron particles down to 0.1 micron particles; most particles are smaller than 0.3 micron. Their shapes disclose a variety of processes of generation.
https://openalex.org/W2063167356,"An electromagnetic search for magnetic monopoles of the minimum size predicted by Dirac, or of any larger magnitude, has been performed on 8.37 kilograms of lunar surface material. No monopole was found. This experimnent sets new limists on the production cross section for monopoles and on their occurrence in cosmic radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1974856424,"Ultrasonic measurement of P and S velocities of Apollo 11 lunar samples 10020, 10057, and 10065 to 5 kilobars pressure at room temperature shows a pronounced increase of velocity (as much as twofold) for the first 2 kilobars. The travel times predicted from the velocity-depth curve of sample 10057 are consistent with the results of the Apollo 12 seismic experiments. At pressures below 200 bars, the samples are highly attenuating; for both P and S waves, the value of Q is about 10."
https://openalex.org/W2988095378,"The magnetic properties of samples of rock, fines, and magnetic separate from the fines from Apollo 11 have been measured. Native iron, or possibly nickel-iron, of submicroscopic particle size is the most important constituent, with minor contributions from ilmenite, paramagnetic iron minerals, and other iron-titanium oxides. The remanent magnetization of a sample of the micro-breccia rapidly acquires a viscous magnetization and does not appear to have a significant stable remanence. The crystalline sample has a weak natural remanence showing some stability."
https://openalex.org/W2025001362,The thermal radiation properties were measured for lunar fines and chips from three different lunar rocks. Measurements for the fines were made at atmospheric pressure and at a pressure of 10(-5) torr or lower. The directional reflectance was obtained over a wavelength range of 0.5 to 2.0 microns for angles of incidence up to 60 degrees. The bidirectional reflectance-the distribution of reflected light-was measured for white light angles of illumination up to 60 degrees. The thermal conductivity was measured over a temperature range 200 to 400 degrees K under vacuum conditions.
https://openalex.org/W1987005515,"The fine-grained surface material at the Apollo 11 landing site is a brownish, medium-gray, slightly cohesive granular soil, with bulky grains in the silt-to-fine-sand range, having a specific gravity of 3.1 and exhibiting adhesive characteristics. Within the upper few centimeters, the lunar soil has an average density of about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter and is similar in appearance and behavior to the soils studied at the Surveyor equatorial landing sites. Althouglh considerably different in composition and in range of particle shapes, it is similar in its mechanical behavior to terrestrial soils of the same grain size distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2094227838,"Two drive-tube core samples were obtained at Tranquillity Base. Fines include much glass, are unweathered, medium gray, loose, nonstructured, very weakly coherent, and demonstrate both accumulation and mixing in a waterless vacuum environment. In contrast to chemical weathering characteristic on the earth, lunar alteration processes are primarily mechanical. We infer that environmental processes of the lunar surface may be expressed as follows: R (regolith) = f(cl, p, r, t, b, a, . . .), in which climate (cl) is constant and the time (t)-de-pendent processes of bombardment (b) and accumulation (a) assume significance unparalleled on the earth because of their effects on parent material (p) and relief (r)."
https://openalex.org/W2037646488,"Organogenic elements, mainly carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur are present in the particulate material and in a breccia rock from Tranquillity Base in amounts ranging from 5 to 4200 parts per million. The major compounds of carbon released by heating are carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide; the former predominates. Small amounts of other compounds of carbon have also been observed. Sulfur can be released as hydrogen sulfide by treatment with acid. The carbon isotopic delta(13L)C values are definitely nonterrestrial (+ 13 to + 18.5 per mil)."
https://openalex.org/W1992408075,"A sample of lunar dust was examined for organic compounds. Carbon detected in concentrations of 157 micrograms per gram had a delta(13)C per mil (PDB) value of + 20. Treatment with hydrochloric acid yielded hydrocarbons of low molecular weight, suggesting the presence of carbides. The gas chromatogram of the acylated and esterified derivatives of the hydrolyzate was similar to that obtained for the Pueblito de Allende meteorite. There were no detectable amounts of extractable high-molecular-weight alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, isoprenoid hydrocarbons, normal alkanes, fatty acids, amino acids, sugars, or nucleic acid bases. Traces of porphyrins were found, perhaps arising from rocket exhaust materials."
https://openalex.org/W2052035184,"Four experiments on lunar materials are reported: (i) resonance on glass spheres from the soil; (ii) compressibility of rock 10017; (iii) sound velocities of rocks 10046 and 10017; (iv) sound velocity of the lunar fines. The data overlap and are mutually consistent. The glass beads and rock 10017 have mechanical properties which correspond to terrestrial materials. Results of (iv) are consistent with low seismic travel times in the lunar maria. Results of analysis of the microbreccia (10046) agreed with the soil during the first pressure cycle, but after overpressure the rock changed, and it then resembled rock 10017. Three models of the lunar surface were constructed giving density and velocity profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2000612640,"The infrared absorption properties of lunar rock throughout the range 2 to 2000 micrometers were investigated and, in addition, direct measurements of specific heat and thermal conductivity of rock samples were made. The results suggest that pure radiation is an important, if not dominant, process in heat flow in the lunar surface layer. A new method for determining the mean conductivity of this layer gives somewhat lower values than earlier earth-based measurements. There is also evidence to suggest that, at depths of about 10 meters, the rock is still of a porous and fragmental nature."
https://openalex.org/W2057310711,"Nuclear gamma resonance measurements for the nuclide (57)Fe in lunar material were made in transmission on lunar fines and in scattering on intact lunar rock chips. No appreciable amnount of ferric iron was detected. Resonances were observed for ilmenite in all samples. Strong resonances attributed to ferrous iron in silicates, including pyroxenes and, in some samples, glasses and olivine, were also present. Metallic iron, alloyed with nickel, and troilite were also detected in the lunar fines. Differences in the spectra of various samples of lunar material and their significance are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1980148896,"Lunar bulk sample 10084,85 (< 1 mm size dust), and samples from rocks 10017,17 (fine grained, vesicular), 10046,17 (breccia), 10057,59 (fine grained, vesicular, top surface), 10057,60 (fine grained, vesicular, interior), and 10058,24 (medium grained, not vesicular) have been investigated by 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. Iron metal and the Fe2+ minerals ilmenite, pyroxene, troilite, and iron containing glass have been identified. An iron line of sample 10084,85 (originally sealed in nitrogen) showed no significant intensity change when the sample was exposed to air. The antiferromagnetic transition in several lunar ilmenites at 57° ± 2°K corresponds to stoichiometric FeTiO3. Magneticallv separated 10057 showed troilite and some metallic iron."
https://openalex.org/W1991519606,"A breccia sample (10023) from the moon was found to have a strong and fairly stable remanent magnetization. If this sample was not magnetized by local fields in the spacecraft or in the lunar receiving laboratory, it must have been magnetized on the moon. This could have happened in a variety of ways, such as cooling through the Curie temperature, by comitinuous thermal cycling, or by impact, but all of these require the presence ofr a magnetic field. Such a field could have been of internal origin in the moon, or it could have been a residual effect from the earth's magnetic field at a time when the moon and the earth were much closer together. Thermomagnetic studies identify the presence of iron with about 1 percent nickel (igneous). iron with abiout 5 to 10 percent nickel (meteoritic), iron with about 33 percent or more nickel (meteoritic), and ilmenite."
https://openalex.org/W1986398434,"Paramagnetic resonance spectra of Apollo 11 fines and rocks were measured at 9 and 35 gigahertz and at 4°, 80°, and 300°K. At both frequencies the material has an intense absorption at g = 2, with a line width of ∼950 gauss. Fe ions with strong exchange interactions produce this resonance. A comparison of the resonance absorption due to Fe3+ showed that the energy of the crystal field interaction was ∼0.1 per centimeter. Mn2+ was identified in several samples, and an absorption at g = 1.89 was tentatively attributed to Ti3+. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of 27Al had a distribution of asymmetry parameters η ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 and had nuclear quadrupole coupling constants e2qQ/h of approximately 3 megahertz."
https://openalex.org/W2022752593,"The carbon concentration in Apollo 11 lunar fine material is of the order of 200 ppm. By far the largest single amount of this carbon appears to be in carbon monoxide. Some of this seems to be in the form of gas bubbles in the glass spheres, but most of it could be in some complex form other than gas. This result would be consistent with the idea that most of the fines passed through a high temperature and that the carbon was oxidized by mineral oxides at that time."
https://openalex.org/W2057622805,"Lunar microbreccias and loose regolith materials contain abundant evidence of shock metamorphism related to crater-forming meteorite impacts. Diagnostic shock effects include (i) planar features in a silica phase and feldspars, and lamellae in clinopyroxene, (ii) thetomorphic feldspar glass, (iii) heterogeneous glasses of rock and mineral composition, (iv) distinctive recrystallization textures, and (v) characteristic changes in crystal structure as indicated by x-ray diffraction analysis and measurements of refractive index. The microbreccias are produced from regolith materials (ejected fromz craters) by shock lithification. Some feldsparrich fragments may represent ejecta introduced from nonlocal sources, such as the lunar highlands."
https://openalex.org/W2074888637,The thermal diffusivity and conductivity of type C lunar samples returned by Apollo 11 are lower and less dependent on temperature than those of type A samples. The thermal properties of both types are lower than the corresponding properties of normal terrestrial rocks.
https://openalex.org/W2085517003,"The remanent magnetismn of a lunar type C breccia sample includes a large viscous component with a time constant of several hours, and a high coercivity remanence, possibly acquired by impact processes on the lunar surface. Ilmenite(?) and metallic iron in breccias, and ferrous and metallic iron in glass beads separated from lunar fines (type D) were identified by high-field and low-temperature experiments. The iron appears to occur in a wide range of grain sizes including the single domain and multidomain states."
https://openalex.org/W2061762351,"Optical properties of the pulverized crystalline rocks from the Apollo 11 samples are different from the optical properties of lunar soil. Changes in these properties were induced in the samples by ultraviolet and x-irradiation, standing, and heating. The albedo and spectrum of the soil differed significantly from expected values."
https://openalex.org/W1976134082,"Calcic plagioclase is the dominant luminescent mineral in crystalline rocks and breccias. Minor amounts of cristobalite and tridymite are also luminescent, as are trace grains of potassium feldspar. Two types of intergrowths of potassium feldspar with a silica phase, possibly quartz, were found in the breccias. Luminescence spectra of plagioclase show significant similarities to, and differences from, spectra of terrestrial plagioclase. Shock damage in the breccias is reflected in systematic changes in the plagioclase spectra, thus giving evidence of disordering on the angstrom scale. Associated extinction patterns seen between crossed Nicol prisms give evidence of disordering on the micrometer scale."
https://openalex.org/W1981067846,"Luminescence measurements of Tranquillity samples indicate that energy efficiencies for excitation by protons and ultraviolet are in the range 10-6 or below; natural and induced thermoluminescence is even weaker. If these samples are typical, lunar surface luminescence cannot occur at reported levels. Comparison of proton luminescence spectra from the exterior and interior of rocks and fine fragments provides evidence of solar wind impingement on the moon's surface. Spectral reflectance and albedo measurements of fresh rock powders before and after both laboratory proton irradiation and fusion indicate that vitrification may be an important mechanism of lunar darkening."
https://openalex.org/W1992692961,"Lunar fines have been examined for organic compounds by crushing, programmed heating, hydrofluoric acid etching, and solvent extraction. Products were examined by mass spectroscopy. A variety of small organic molecules, including methane and other hydrocarbons, accompanied the release of the rare gases when the sample was heated in a stepwise fashion to 900°C under vacuum. Methane is more abundant (abundance on the order of 1 part per million) than argon in the matrix-entrapped gases liberated by hydrofluoric acid etching of lunar fines. Methane is also present in a dark portion of the gas-rich meteorite Kapoeta."
https://openalex.org/W2058288124,Magnetic measurements have shown that nondiamagnetic minerals in a lunar crystalline rock of type B are (free Fe2+ in paramagnetic pyroxenes) : (antiferromagnetic FeSiO3) : (antiferromagnetic FeTiO3) : (ferromagnetic iron) = 4.3 : 7 : 20 : 0.08 in weight percentage. The abundance of ferromagnetic Fe in the lunar fines is about 7.5 times its abundance in the crystalline rock. The natural remanent magnetization of the crystalline rock of 7.5 × 10-6 emu/ g in intensity may not be attributable to its thermoremanent magnetization.
https://openalex.org/W1984808700,Electron spin resonance searches at 9.5 gigahertz on several fines samples and portions of several rocks have yielded signals whose lineshapes and temperature dependences show that the samples are principally ferromagnetic in nature. Proton magnetic resonance searches at 60 megahertz of these samples have not revealed any signals ascribable to water or any other types of hydrogen in concentrations greater than 0.0001 percent by weight contained in narrow lines (5 oersteds wide or less) and 0.01 percent by weight in wide lines (as wide as 100 oersteds).
https://openalex.org/W2010978105,"Mineralogical descriptions and both wet chemical analyses and microprobe analyses are given of the glasses and crystalline components of the lunar fines and of the minerals in microgabbros (samples 10050 and 10047). The principal minerals described are various clinopyroxenes, plagioclase, olivine, low cristobalite, low tridymite, ilmenite, iron-nickel, iron, schreibersite, cohenite, troilite, and a new CaFe pyroxenoid. Descriptions are given of small craters produced by hypervelocity particle impact on glass and iron-nickel fragments in the fines. The rounding of grains in the fines and of surface rocks is attributed to mechanical ahrasion and not to cratering."
https://openalex.org/W1971879402,"Dust samples have been found to luminesce weakly under proton excitation, but not under ultraviolet. Damage, recovery, and heating effects have been investigated. Chips of breccia show luminescence, from white inclusions only, under ultraviolet and protons. Some rock chips show general luminescence, mainly from plagioclase. No natural or excited thermoluminescence has been found for dust or chips. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum shows the same broad Fe(3+) dipole resonance for dust and for some chips; other chips show no response. The polarization characteristics of dust are found to be identical to those of the Sea of Tranquillity, independently of proton damage. Chips show characteristics unlike any part of the lunar surface."
https://openalex.org/W1992142060,"Site occupancy numbers for ferrous iron, magnesium, and calcium at the M1 and M2 sites in lunar clinopyroxenes are estimated from nuclear gamma-ray resonant absorption spectra of 57Fe. The cation distribution is ordered; calcium and magnesium prefer M2 and M1, respectively. The distribution corresponds to an equilibrium at a temperature lower than 680°C. Crystals cleaved and sectioned by diamond-knife ultramicrotomy were examined by high-voltage (200 kv) electron microscopy and diffraction. Uniform 300- to 600-Å-wide bands that correspond to single crystal domains were found. Correlation of the bands with magnetic ordering at low temperatures is considered."
https://openalex.org/W2028699599,Silicate grains from Tranquillity Base have shock-induced features ranging from internal fragmentation through complete disruption of the lattice to thermal melting. Half the crystalline grains with diameters less than 125 micrometers have features of shock equivalent to those produced in the laboratory at pressures greater than about 40 kilobars. One quarter have features indicative of pressures greater than 90 kilobars. These properties together with great quantities of melt glass and aluminum-26 in the fine-grained material are indicative of repeated shock-loading by meteoritic bombardment over long periods of time.
https://openalex.org/W2075055318,Evidence for porphyrins was obtained in the Apollo 11 bulk sample of lunar dust by fluorescence spectrometry and analytical demetallation. The indicated porphyrins showed major fluorescence excitation at 390 nanometers. Abundance was about 10(-10) gram of porphyrin per gram of dust. Similar pigments were found in exhaust products from tests of a lunar descent engine. The similarity of results suggests that most if not all of the indicated porphyrin aggregate of the lunar sample probably was synthesized from rocket fuel during the landing of the lunar module. These compounds may be the product of a novel high-temperature synthesis of cosmochemical interest.
https://openalex.org/W2083627693,"Indications of shock metamorphism produced by pressures up to the megabar region have been observed in the fine material and the breccias, but very rarely in the coarser fragments of crystalline rocks. These indications are deformation structures in plagioclase and pyroxene, diaplectic plagioclase glasses, and glasses formed by shock-induced melting of lunar rocks. Two sources of shock waves have been distinguished: primary impact of meteorites and secondary impact of crater ejecta. There are two major chemical types of shock-induced melts. The differences in chemistry may be related to impact sites in mare and highland areas."
https://openalex.org/W2007486187,"Over two hundred spherules and cylinders were extracted from the lunar dust sample. Sizes ranged from 0.75 to 0.03 millimeters, and most were shiny glassy objects, which were studied by interferometry. This study reveals very high specular reflection, frequent perfect sphericity, and clear evidence in some objects of microcracking and microchipping. Many spheres were once projectiles. Some have impacted in free flight with much smaller pieces of rocky material, which embedded in the surface. It is conjectured that the glassy spherules originated as a gas-blown shower from a pool of molten glass."
https://openalex.org/W2093832660,"Determinations on 20- to 80-milligram portions of the rock samples and the -150 mesh fraction of the lunar dust show pronounced Curie points between 680° and 780°C. Remanent intensities of five rock fragments vary from 8.4 × 10-5 to 0.30 × 10-5 emu/gram. Upon demagnetization, two of the samples had only viscous magnetization and two other samples had stable magnetizations with remanent coercivities in excess of 50 oersteds. Partial thermal demagnetization suggests that these apparently stable moments may have been acquired in a magnetic field in excess of 1500 gammas."
https://openalex.org/W1993732321,"Although nothing of direct biologic interest was observed in the sample studied, small shaped glass particles and glazed pits resemble objects which elsewhere have been described as fossils. These features, although nonbiological, do bear on processes of lunar weathering and outgassing. The glazed pits are impact features. Fusion of their surfaces released gases. Electron microscopy of the glasses, pits, and angular microfractured mineral grains indicates a prevalence of destructive weathering processes-thermal expansion and contraction, abrasion by by-passing particles, and, of course, impact. ous at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2076808545,"Three kinds of experiments were performed in an effort to detect and identify organic compounds present in the lunar material (fines 10,086): (i) vaporization of the volatilizable components directly into the ion source of a high-resolution mass spectrometer, and (ii and iii) extraction of the material with organic solvents before and after dissolving most of the inorganic substrate in hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid. The extracts were investigated by a combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Although a number of organic compounds or compound types have been detected, none appears to be indigenous to the lunar surface."
https://openalex.org/W2081910638,"Appreciable natural thermoluminescence with glow curve peaks at about 350 degrees centigrade for lunar fines and breccias and above 400 degrees centigrade for crystalline rocks has been recognized in lunar samples. Plagioclase has been identified as the principal carrier of thermoluminescence, and the diference in peak temperatures indicates compositional or structural differences between the feldspars of the different rock types. The present thermoluminescence in the lunar samples is probably the result of a dynamic equilibrium between acquisition from radiation and loss in the lunar thermal environment. A progressive change in the glow curves of core samples with depth below the surface suggests the use of thermoluminescence disequilibrium to detect surfaces buried by recent surface activity, and it also indicates that the lunar diurnal temperature variation penetrates to at least 10.5 centimeters."
https://openalex.org/W1973491878,"The compressibilities of three lunar samples were studied at room temperature from 0 to 40 kilobars. The samples were a fine-grained vesicular crystalline rock (type A), a microbreccia (type C), and fines (type D). All samples were porous. The microbreccia and fines were quite compressible at all pressures; the compressibility of the crystalline rock was somewhat less, being 8.4 megabar(-1) at 1 atmosphere and 1.5 megabar(-1) at 35 kilobars. Some porosity appeared to remain in the samples at all pressures. Thus the pressure-volume data derived from these samples may be representative of porous surface and near-surface material in the vicinity of the Apollo 11 landing site but may not be representative of lunar material at depth."
https://openalex.org/W1987298373,The natural remanent magnetization (3.7 x 10(4) electromagnetic units per cubic centimeter) and the susceptibility per cubic centimeter (6.3 x 10(-13)) of an 18.5-gram breccia specimen were determined with instrumentation and techniques currently used in paleomagnetism. The relatively low magnetic stability of the rock in the earth's field and in alternating demagnetizing fields precludes considering it as a reliable carrier of paleomagnetism. A magnetic balance study yields an unusually high Curie temperature (750 degrees C) which is possibly diagnostic of metallic Fe containing less than 5 percent nickel. The estimated relative abundance of the iron in the sample is about 0.5 percent.
https://openalex.org/W2051136216,"We have observed a red luminescence, qualitatively similar to that of enstatite achondrites, in unsorted fines, their separated mineral phases, and rock chips. The energy efficiency of the plagioclase fraction is approximately 1 percent. At -196 degrees C the effect is enhanced by a factor between 1 and 2. All fractions except ilmenite exhibit blue thermoluminescence with a glow peak near -135 degrees C and an energy efficiency approximately 4 x 10(-6). Unlike the thermoluminescence of terrestrial and meteoritic material, it is nonrepeatable even after annealing at 200 degrees C. Similar thermoluminescence is seen in rock chips, but in unsorted fines it is masked by the opaque fractions."
https://openalex.org/W2072184964,"A 50-gram sample of lunar fines was subjected to stepwise extraction in a mixture of benzene and methanol while intact, after being pulverized, and after being digested in hydrofluoric acid. None of these three extracts contained detectable quantities of C(15) to C(30) alkanes. No C(15) to C(30) alkane was present in this lunar sample at a concentration exceeding I part per billion by weight."

https://openalex.org/W2037557776,"Fine-grained samples disrupted after exposure to oxygen and oxygen with 3.5 percent water above 2 torr. Chemical etching revealed plastic deformation in some samples, adhesion due to impact melting in others, dislocations in crystalline phases and evidence that some glasses were partially devitrified. Specimens of rock that were fractured in ultrahigh vacuum exhibited a time-dependent adhesion and a network of localized electrostatically charged areas."
https://openalex.org/W2045206668,"A highly sensitive determination of spallogenic (53)Mn (T = 2 x 106 yr) was accomplished in 0.99 g of lunar soil. The chemical yield of Mn is determined with ""carrier-free"" (52)Mn tracer. During a 23-day reactor irradiation the (53)Mn is transformed into (54)Mn (T = 300 days). Appropriate chemical recycling was done by ion exchange and distillation. Interferences of the (n,p) and the (n,2n) nuclear reactions were carefully studied. A (53)Mn disintegration rate of 30.3 +/- 5.5 dpm/kg results. This extremely economic method is proposed for further detailed lunar profile measurements. The Re content, which is of possible cosmochemical interest, was determined to be 11 ppb. Appropriate separation techniques were used. The rather weak and complex thermoluminescence properties made a more basic study advisable. Thermogravimetric analysis, mass spectroscopy, and Moessbauer spectroscopy were applied. The presence of ilmenite, metallic Fe etc., and of an unidentified Fe(2+)-containing compound was deduced. Natural thermoluminescence could not be proved with certainty in our surface sample. However, the complexity of the artificial thermoluminescence demands better defined mineral fractions. The fission track method was used to measure U distribution in glass spherules etc."
https://openalex.org/W2085265530,"Luminescence measurements were made of four lunar rocks, two terrestrial rocks (granite and gabbro), and one terrestrial mineral (willemite) by comparing the spectral curves with the curve of a barium sulfate standard. Efficiencies with 3000 angstrom excitation were ≤ 6 × 10-5 for the lunar samples, ≤ 8 × 10-5 for gabbro of very similar composition to the lunar samples, approximately 10-4 for granite, and approximately 2 × 10-2 for willemite. If these are typical values for other ultraviolet excitation wavelengths, the Apollo 11 site appears to contribute little to the observed lunar luminescence."
https://openalex.org/W2004217295,The mineral fragments that constitute the Apollo 11 microbreccia and fines show a number of shock-induced microstructural effects including multiple twinning on (001) in clinopyroxene and incipient development of lattice-controlled discontinuities in olivine. These structures coupled with the effects of shock-induced melting as manifested by spherules and angular fragments of glass and their partly to completely crystallized equivalents indicate that Apollo 11 materials were subjected to weak to moderate shocks with associated peak pressures of the order of 100 to 200 kilobars.
https://openalex.org/W2086705843,"A sample of lunar material from Apollo 11 was subjected to analysis by several techniques, which included mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance and their variations, in an effort to detect the presence of organic compounds. None were found. On the basis of the sensitivity ascribed to certain of the methods employed, it is assumed that if organic matter were present it would exist in concentrations less than 1 part per million. phere."
https://openalex.org/W2006869647,"The lunar samples were analyzed for total organic carbon content by pyrolysis at 850 degrees C and subsequent detection of the resulting volatilized organic compounds in a hydrogen flame ionization detector. The organic content ranged from 10 to 126 parts per million, depending primarily upon the handling in the sample processing. No correlation of organic content with rock type has been shown. The small quantities of organic matter are primarily contamination, and the indigenous organic content is estimated to be less than 10 parts per million."

By appropriate extraction, however, the lunar sample yields a material which exhibits absorption maxima at 310 and 350 nanometers and a fluorescence maximum at 410 nanometers."
