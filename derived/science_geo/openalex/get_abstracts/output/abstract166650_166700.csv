https://openalex.org/W2032391479,"Mice that lack all β1-class integrins in neurons and glia die prematurely after birth with severe brain malformations. Cortical hemispheres and cerebellar folia fuse, and cortical laminae are perturbed. These defects result from disorganization of the cortical marginal zone, where β1-class integrins regulate glial endfeet anchorage, meningeal basement membrane remodeling, and formation of the Cajal-Retzius cell layer. Surprisingly, β1-class integrins are not essential for neuron-glia interactions and neuronal migration during corticogenesis. The phenotype of the β1-deficient mice resembles pathological changes observed in human cortical dysplasias, suggesting that defective integrin-mediated signal transduction contributes to the development of some of these diseases."

To examine the repercussions of REST expression in neurons, we generated a neuronal cell line that expresses REST conditionally. REST expression inhibited differentiation by nerve growth factor, suppressing both sodium current and neurite growth. A novel corepressor complex, CoREST/HDAC2, was shown to be required for REST repression. In the presence of REST, the CoREST/HDAC2 complex occupied the native Nav1.2 sodium channel gene in chromatin. In neuronal cells that lack REST and express sodium channels, the corepressor complex was not present on the gene. Collectively, these studies define a novel HDAC complex that is recruited by the C-terminal repressor domain of REST to actively repress genes essential to the neuronal phenotype."

However, the underlying mechanism(s) by which stress causes these changes in HSF1 structure, activity, and subcellular localization are not understood.SUMO-1 is an 11-kDa protein with homology to ubiquitin whose conjugation to proteins appears to be involved in regulating the functional properties of these proteins, including subcellular localization and protection against degradation (6Kretz-Remy C. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T.

Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). We recently discovered that another member of the HSF family, HSF2, is constitutively modified by SUMO-1 in vivo (11Goodson M.L. Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis M.J. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18513-18518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that HSF1 may be subject to stress-regulated SUMO-1 modification and that this may be responsible for converting the factor to the DNA-binding form and/or its localization to nuclear bodies in response to stress.Here we report that in contrast to HSF2, the HSF1 protein is not constitutively modified by SUMO-1 and instead is only modified after cells are exposed to stress conditions. HSF1 colocalizes with SUMO-1 in nuclear bodies after stress treatment with kinetics that closely parallels that of heat shock treatment and recovery. We have identified lysine 298 as the site of stress-induced SUMO-1 modification in HSF1. Mutation of this residue significantly decreases stress-inducible HSF1 activation of hsp gene transcription, suggesting that SUMO-1 modification at this site is important for proper stress-induced HSF1 function. Finally, our results suggest that SUMO-1 modification modulates HSF1 function by regulating its DNA binding activity.RESULTSA number of SUMO-1-modified proteins localize in discrete structures in the nucleus including PML, HIPK2, and Sp100 (15Duprez E.

Therefore, to determine whether there is a relationship between HSF1 and SUMO-1 in stress-induced nuclear granules, we performed double labeled immunofluorescence analysis on normal and heat-treated HeLa cells using antibodies that recognize each of these proteins. The results demonstrate that the HSF1-containing nuclear granules observed in response to heat treatment colocalized with SUMO-1 protein (Fig. 1A). Analysis of cells at various times of heat treatment and following recovery indicated a tight correlation between HSF1 and SUMO-1 localization in nuclear granules (Fig. 1 B). HSF1 also colocalized with SUMO-1 in response to treatment with the heavy metal cadmium (Fig.1 C), indicating that this result is not limited to heat stress (4Cotto J.J. Fox S. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jolly C. Usson Y. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H.

The data reveal the interesting result that some of the HSF1-containing stress granules colocalized with PML although a subset did not, suggesting the existence of at least two distinct classes of HSF1-containing nuclear stress granules (Fig. 1 D).To directly test whether HSF1 is modified by SUMO-1 in vivo, we immunoprecipitated HSF1 protein from extracts of non-stressed and heat-treated cells and then subjected it to Western blot using anti-SUMO-1 antibodies. The results indicate that the heat-treated sample contained a band of ∼80 kDa, a size consistent with SUMO-1-modified HSF1 (which is not present in the non-stressed sample), indicating that HSF1 undergoes stress-induced SUMO-1 modification (Fig.2A). Western blot using anti-HSF1 polyclonal antibodies revealed the decrease in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mobility characteristic of the HSF1 protein in heat-treated cells (lower panel). In addition, gel shift assay of extracts of heat-treated cells revealed that the mobility of the HSF1-DNA complex is retarded by the addition of antibodies against SUMO-1, indicating that the active DNA-binding form of HSF1 present in heat-treated cells is modified by SUMO-1 (Fig.2 B). Antibodies that recognize the related HSF family member HSF2 (but not HSF1) did not show this effect (3Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar).Figure 2HSF1 undergoes stress-induced SUMO-1 modification.

To determine whether any of these lysines are sites of SUMO-1 modification, we transfected cells with HSF1 expression constructs in which each of these lysines was changed to arginine. We then compared the ability of each to undergo SUMO-1 modification in heat-treated cells by immunoprecipitation followed by SUMO-1 Western blot. The results indicate that mutation of lysine 298 significantly reduced the level of SUMO-1-modified HSF1, suggesting that this lysine is a site of SUMO-1 modification in vivo (Fig.3A). Western blot with anti-Myc antibodies confirmed the expression of transfected HSF1 K298R protein (lower panel). Identical results were obtained from an experiment in which wild-type or lysine-mutated HSF1 proteins were subjected to SUMO-1 modification in vitro using a reconstituted reaction system (Fig. 3 B). A comparison of the sequence surrounding lysine 298 of HSF1 with characterized SUMO-1 modification sites in other proteins is shown in Fig. 3 C. This consensus SUMO-1 modification sequence is conserved in the mouse, human, chicken, zebra fish, and Xenopus HSF1 proteins, suggesting that it is required for HSF1 function (22Sarge K.D.

Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis M.J. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18513-18518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our expectation that HSF1 should only undergo efficient modification in response to some stress signal. We suspect that the low level of HSF1 modification observed in this assay may be due to a small amount of stress induced during the harvesting of the HeLa cells that were used to make extracts for this assay (so that they contained some of this putative stress signal). Another possibility is that a small portion of thein vitro translated HSF1 used as substrate for the reaction adopts a conformation that resembles the heat-activated form, which is likely given that there must be at least some equilibrium between these two states even in the absence of stress.Stress-induced SUMO-1 modification is correlated with conversion of HSF1 from the inactive form to the DNA-binding form, and thus we hypothesized that this modification may play a role in mediating this conversion. To test this hypothesis we determined whether SUMO-1 modification in vitro had any effects on HSF1 DNA binding by performing gel shift assay on samples of wild-type HSF1 and HSF1 K298R. These were prepared identically as those shown in Fig. 3 B, except we used unlabeled methionine instead of [35S]methionine. In agreement with our previous results (22Sarge K.D. Zimarino V. Holm K. Wu C. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), in vitro translated wild-type HSF1 exhibited little or no DNA binding ability without further treatment (Fig.4). However, subjecting HSF1 to SUMO-1 modification in vitro resulted in a significant increase in its DNA binding activity. The increase was blocked by the K298R mutation, suggesting that it was mediated by SUMO-1 modification (Fig.4).Figure 4SUMO-1 modification regulates HSF1 DNA binding. Wild-type (WT) HSF1 and K298R HSF1 were subjected to SUMO-1 modification in vitro, and then the DNA binding activities of unmodified and SUMO-1-modified wild-type and mutant HSF1 were measured by gel mobility shift assay using a specific HSF-binding oligonucleotide probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also tested the effect of the Lys298 mutation on stress-induced localization of HSF to nuclear bodies by transfecting cells with wild-type or K298R mutant HSF1, subjecting them to heat treatment, and then examining HSF1 localization by immunofluorescence. Because HSF1 trimerizes upon stress treatment, we performed this experiment using an HSF1−/− cell line derived from HSF1−/− knockout mice to eliminate the possibility that mutant HSF1 could be carried to nuclear bodies by heterotrimerization with endogenous wild-type HSF1 (12McMillan D.R.

The results shown in Fig.5indicate that transfected wild-type HSF1 is found in nuclear bodies in stressed cells but that the HSF1 K298R mutant is not, and it exhibits a diffuse nuclear staining similar to that observed for HSF1 in the absence of stress treatment (as seen in Fig. 1 A). Many fields of transfected cells were examined, and we did not find any cells in which HSF1 K298R was found in nuclear bodies after heat treatment. These results suggest that stress-induced SUMO-1 modification at lysine 298 is important for localization of the HSF1 protein to nuclear bodies.Figure 5Mutation of lysine 298 prevents localization of HSF1 to nuclear bodies after heat treatment.HSF1−/− cells were transfected with pcDNA expression constructs encoding wild-type or K298R mutant HSF1.

The results show that cells containing K298R mutant HSF1 exhibited significantly lower reporter activity in heat-treated cells relative to cells transfected with wild-type HSF1, and in fact this was similar to that observed for cells containing empty vector (Fig.6A). Western blot with anti-Myc antibodies indicates similar expression of transfected wild-type HSF1 and HSF1 K298R proteins (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that SUMO-1 modification at this lysine residue is important for stress-induced HSF1 function.Figure 6Mutation of lysine 298 decreases heat-induced HSF1 activity in vivo.

Thus, we propose SUMO-1 modification as a candidate for the mechanism that regulates HSF1 DNA binding in response to stress, leading to induction of the cellular stress response.Regarding potential mechanisms by which SUMO-1 modification could regulate HSF1 DNA binding, we note that the lysine 298 SUMO-1 modification site lies between the trimerization domain of HSF1 and a C-terminal leucine zipper motif previously implicated in maintaining HSF1 in the monomeric non-DNA-binding form by interacting with and thus masking the trimerization domain (27Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). It is possible that SUMO-1 modification causes a conformational change that disrupts the ability of these two leucine zipper motifs to interact, leading to trimerization and DNA binding.Interestingly, the region of HSF1 containing lysine 298 has been implicated in negatively regulating HSF1 transactivation activity in the absence of stress, suggesting that this region may be involved in more than one mechanism of HSF1 regulation (28Green M. Schuetz T.J. Sullivan E.K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3354-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 30Shi Y. Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These studies showed that mutation of serines 303 and 307 results in derepression of the repressed phenotype, resulting in elevated basal transactivation function at non-stress temperatures, which suggests a role for basal phosphorylation of these serines in maintaining repressed transactivation. In one of these studies it was also found that mutation of lysine 298 or glutamic acid 300 to alanine also gave a derepressed phenotype and elevated transactivation (31Knauf U. Newton E.M. Kyriakis J. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2782-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The authors proposed that these charged residues may be involved in interaction with a protein that somehow blocks function of the C-terminal activation domain. If true, this suggests that stress-induced SUMO-1 modification at this site, in addition to its role in regulating HSF1 DNA binding, might have a second function by acting to disrupt this interaction and thus allow the maximal transactivation ability that would be expected by HSF1 during the stress response.Alternatively, because lysine 298 and glutamic acid 300 represent required residues in the SUMO-1 modification consensus sequence (6Kretz-Remy C. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T.

As the authors note, a known consequence of HSF1 transfection into cells is that a portion of the transfected HSF1 protein is converted to the trimeric DNA-binding form even at normal temperatures, but this HSF1 lacks the ability to activate hsp promoter transcription until the cells are heat shocked, indicating that some stress-induced change is required for full HSF1 transactivation ability in vivo (3Sarge K.D.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2782-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Similarly, we hypothesize that in this previous experiment the transfected HSF1 proteins may have undergone inappropriately regulated SUMO modification and that without the heat treatment necessary to confer full transactivation competence the presence of these SUMO groups interfered with the overall transactivation ability of HSF1. The Lys298 and Glu300 mutants unable to undergo SUMO modification would be expected to exhibit the observed higher relative transactivation ability. However, we think it unlikely that this relates to physiological HSF1-SUMO modification, as our results did not detect modification in the absence of stress, although we cannot rule out the possibility that either a small fraction of HSF1 is modified in each cell or is modified in a cell cycle-dependent manner, for example.Comparison of the results obtained in this study with those we obtained previously on SUMO-1 modification of the HSF2 protein reveals that despite the conservation of sequence and functional domains between HSF1 and HSF2, there are important differences with respect to the SUMO-1 modification of these two proteins (11Goodson M.L.

First, HSF2 is constitutively modified, whereas HSF1 is only modified after stress treatment. Second, the lysines modified by SUMO-1 in HSF2versus HSF1 are located in completely different regions of the proteins, with the modified lysine 82 in HSF2 found in a wing within the DNA-binding domain near the N terminus and the stress-modified lysine 298 of HSF1 located a substantial distance away in the C-terminal region of this protein (11Goodson M.L.

Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, despite the different locations the SUMO modifications of these two HSFs both act to alter DNA binding activity. This suggests that these SUMO-1 modification events in HSF1 and HSF2 evolved by divergent pathways and are regulated differently but serve a similar function.The activities of a number of important transcription factors, including p53, c-Jun, and androgen receptor, are regulated by SUMO-1 modification, but the exact function(s) of these proteins that are being regulated by this modification is not clear (33Muller S. Berger M. Lehembre F. Seeler J.S. Haupt Y. Dejean A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13321-13329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 34Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S.

Thus, one question for future study is whether SUMO-1 modification also regulates the DNA binding activities of some or all of these other factors or instead regulates other functions such as the ability to interact with the transcriptional machinery. SUMO modification clearly plays a role in regulating the function of HSF1 during the cellular stress response, and it will be exciting in future studies to further characterize the details of this mechanism. Exposure of cells to stress conditions results in conversion of HSF11 from an inactive monomeric form to a trimeric DNA-binding form, which then interacts with promoters of heat shock protein (hsp) genes to up-regulate transcription (1Cotto J.J.

https://openalex.org/W2145559734,"High throughput cDNA sequencing has led to the identification of interferon-κ, a novel subclass of type I interferon that displays ∼30% homology to other family members. Interferon-κ consists of 207 amino acids, including a 27-amino acid signal peptide and a series of cysteines conserved in type I interferons. The gene encoding interferon-κ is located on the short arm of chromosome 9 adjacent to the type I interferon gene cluster and is selectively expressed in epidermal keratinocytes. Expression of interferon-κ is significantly enhanced in keratinocytes upon viral infection, upon exposure to double-stranded RNA, or upon treatment with either interferon-γ or interferon-β. Administration of interferon-κ recombinant protein imparts cellular protection against viral infection in a species-specific manner. Interferon-κ activates the interferon-stimulated response element signaling pathway and a panel of genes similar to those regulated by other type I interferons including anti-viral mediators and transcriptional regulators. An antibody that neutralizes the type I interferon receptor completely blocks interferon-κ signaling, demonstrating that interferon-κ utilizes the same receptor as other type I interferons. Interferon-κ therefore defines a novel subclass of type I interferon that is expressed in keratinocytes and expands the repertoire of known proteins mediating host defense.

Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 2Maeyer E. Maeyer-Guignard J. Thompson A. The Cytokine Handbook. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 491-516Google Scholar). They are classified as type I or type II according to their structural and functional properties. Although the sole member of the type II family is IFN-γ, there are multiple members of the type I interferon class, which is divided into the IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-ω subclasses (1Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 2Maeyer E. Maeyer-Guignard J. Thompson A. The Cytokine Handbook. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 491-516Google Scholar). In humans, excluding psuedogenes, there are 13 non-allelic IFN-α genes, a single β gene, and a single ω gene. Members of the IFN-α family display greater than 80% identity to each other, IFN-ω displays ∼60% identity to IFN-α, and IFN-β is ∼40% identical to the other family members. The evolutionary conservation of the type I IFN genes is reflected in their common intron-less structure and their co-localization to the short arm of chromosome 9, which suggest that type I IFNs arose by gene duplication (3Diaz M.O. Pomykala H.M. Bohlander S.K. Maltepe E. Malik K. Brownstein B. Olapade O.I. Genomics. 1994; 22: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The subtypes were initially categorized further by their cell of origin. IFN-α and IFN-ω genes were thought to be produced predominantly by leukocytes and IFN-β by fibroblasts. However, upon appropriate induction, most human cell types can generate type I IFNs (2Maeyer E. Maeyer-Guignard J. Thompson A. The Cytokine Handbook. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 491-516Google Scholar). Exposure to a variety of agents triggers the rapid and transient production of type I IFNs, with viruses being the most efficient natural inducers (4Cavalieri R.L. Havell E.A. Vileck J. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1977; 74: 4415-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Raj N.B.K. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1983; 80: 3923-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Certain bacteria can also induce expression, as can double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and endotoxin. In contrast, trophoblast IFNs or IFN-τ, which are found only in ruminant ungulate species, are not induced by viral challenge (6Roberts R.M. Ealy A.D. Alexenko A.P. Han C.S. Ezashi T. Placenta. 1999; 20: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These genes are expressed by the embryonic trophoectoderm at a specific time during early pregnancy, and though they have the typical properties of other type I IFNs, their major function is to create conditions for the completion of pregnancy (6Roberts R.M. Ealy A.D. Alexenko A.P. Han C.S. Ezashi T. Placenta. 1999; 20: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Despite the diversity in their sequence, all type I IFNs employ a common type I IFN receptor complex (IFNAR) that is composed of two chains, a 135-kDa subunit (IFNAR1) and a 115-kDa subunit (IFNAR2c) (7Uze G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 8Soh J. Mariano T.M. Lim J.K. Izotova L. Mirochnitchenko O. Schwartz B. Langer J.A. Pestka S.

IFN-induced receptor dimerization of the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c chains initiates a signaling cascade that involves tyrosine phosphorylation of the Tyk2 and Jak1 tyrosine kinases and subsequent phosphorylation of the STAT1 and STAT2 proteins (10Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 11Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar). Association of the phosphorylated STAT proteins with the p48 DNA binding subunit forms the interferon stimulated gene factor 3 multisubunit complex, which translocates to the nucleus and binds to interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) found upstream of interferon-inducible genes. IFN signaling culminates in the modulation of a wide range of cellular responses including anti-viral activity, tumor anti-proliferation, enhancement of natural killer cell activity, and induction of major histocompatibility complex antigen expression (1Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 2Maeyer E. Maeyer-Guignard J. Thompson A. The Cytokine Handbook. 3rd Ed.

Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar). The cellular activities of IFNs have attracted much interest for clinical applications, with IFNs now being used to treat a broad range of diseases including multiple sclerosis, leukemia, and hepatitis (2Maeyer E. Maeyer-Guignard J. Thompson A. The Cytokine Handbook. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 491-516Google Scholar, 12Gutterman J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). We report here the identification and characterization of a novel subclass of the type I IFN family that we have named IFN-κ, which is expressed in keratinocytes, signals through the type I receptor complex, and mediates anti-viral activity. The Human Genome Sciences expressed sequence tag (EST) data base of ∼3 million cDNA sequences derived from over 900 human cDNA libraries was screened for homologues of the interferon family using the BLAST algorithm. A single EST (HKAPI15) with significant type I interferon homology was identified and sequenced completely to reveal an open reading frame of 207 amino acids. The amino acid sequence has been deposited in GenBankTM under accession numberAF315688. The IFN-κ genomic region was generated in two steps. The genomic sequence that contains the IFN-κ coding region was PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers (CGTCCGGGATTTTTTAGCTTGCA and GTACATTTCAGATATATTTCA) that correspond to nucleotides 472–494 and 2232–2252 in Fig. 1. The upstream promoter region was isolated by long PCR amplification from a λ-EMBL3 human genomic library using a vector-specific primer (ATGCCCGAGAAGATGTTGAGC) and nested, IFN-κ cDNA-specific primers (GCAATGAATATACCCATAAGGAT and GGTGAACGTTCAGTAAGTTA) that correspond to nucleotides 546–568 and 590–609 in Fig. 1. The nucleotide sequence of the 2659-bp IFN-κ genomic region including promoter region and intron sequence has been deposited in GenBankTM under accession number AF384048. The full-length IFN-κ open reading frame (Met1–Lys207) was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotide primer sequences that tailed the amplicon with a 5′ BamHI site, a consensus Kozak translation sequence (13Kozak M. J. Cell. Bio. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar), and a 3′ Asp718 restriction site. The amplicon was digested with BamHI/Asp718 and subcloned into like-digested pC4, a proprietary mammalian expression vector derived from pSV2-neo (14Subramani S. Mulligan R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which contains a chimeric cytomegalovirus enhancer, the Rous sarcoma virus promoter, and the 3′ intron, polyadenylation, and termination signals of the rat pre-proinsulin gene. The full-length IFNAR1 cDNA sequence was subcloned as aSalI/NotI fragment into pCMV-Sport2 (Invitrogen) whereas the IFNAR2c open reading frame was PCR-amplified, tailed withBglII and Asp718 sites, and subcloned intoBamHI/XbaI-digested pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The original cDNA clone, HKAPI15, contains the full-length IFN-κ cDNA inserted between the SalI and NotI sites of pCMV-Sport2 (Invitrogen) and was used as template for the SP6-driven transcription coupled translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturers recommendation. Chinese hamster ovary cells were stably transfected with pC4:IFN-κ using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines expressing IFN-κ mRNA as determined by Taqman analysis were expanded, and 100 ml of conditioned supernatant was collected. Secreted IFN-κ was captured by Porors HS-50 cation exchange chromatography at pH 6.0. IFN-κ was eluted using a salt gradient of 0 to 1.5m sodium chloride. By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a protein of molecular mass of ∼30 kDa was observed for samples that eluted between 0.6 and 0.8 mNaCl. Several of these samples were trans-blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the NH2 terminus sequence was determined using an ABI-494 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A panel of 24 monochromosomal somatic cell hybrids was obtained from Quantum Biotechnologies, and the G3 panels of 83 radiation hybrids were obtained from Research Genetics. The following oligonucleotides, which span a 600-bp region of the IFN-κ coding region, were used for polymerase chain reaction analysis, CGTCCGGGATTTTTTAGCTTGCA (5′ primer) and CTTCTGATTTCCACTCGGACA (3′ primer). 35 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min) were performed on 100 ng of each hybrid in a 50-µl reaction. Analysis of the radiation hybrid data was performed using the Stanford Human Genome Center radiation hybrid server. Primary keratinocytes (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) were cultured in serum-free medium (KGM-2 medium; Clonetics). Second- or third-passage keratinocytes at 70–80% confluence were used in the experiments. Cells were treated with 100 µg/ml poly(I-C) (Sigma), 2500 units/ml of human IFN-β (specific activity, 8.23 × 107 units/mg; PBL Biomedical Laboratories, New Brunswick, NJ), and 500 units/ml of human IFN-γ (specific activity, 2 × 107 units/mg; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) or infected with EMCV (2 × 105 TCID50/ml) for 1, 5, or 15 h. For RNA analysis, culture supernatants were aspirated, and keratinocytes were lysed with Trizol (Invitrogen). For ELISA measurements, the keratinocytes were cultured for 24 h in KGM-2 medium without hydrocortisone. 40 µg of total RNA isolated from keratinocytes was analyzed by Northern analysis. The cDNAs used for IFN-κ and IFN-β probes correspond to amino acids Met1–Lys207 and Met22–Asn187, respectively. Between probings, blots were stripped and exposed to film to ensure probe removal. Multiple-tissue Northern blots obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, California), which were probed for IFN-κ expression, were as follows: human I, human IV, human endocrine system, human fetal, human cancer cell line, human brain I, and human brain IV. Total RNA (50 ng) was used in a one-step, 50-µl, quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. As a control for genomic contamination, parallel reactions were set up without reverse transcriptase. The abundance of specific mRNAs was measured relative to 18 S rRNA using the Applied Biosystems Prism 7700 sequence detection system. Reactions were carried out at 48 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Reactions were performed in triplicate. Using Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), primer and probe sets were designed to target the following human sequences, where the gene name is followed by the sequences of the two primers and then the probe: IFN-κ (GCCCCAAGAGTTTCTGCAATAC, GGCCTGTAGGGACATTTCATAGA, CAACCTATGAAGAGGGACATCAAGAAGGCC), MxA (GGATCTGCTGGAGGAAGGAAA, TGATGAGCTCGCTGGTAAGTTTT, CCACGGTTCCCTGCCTGGCAG), OAS (CTTTGATGCCCTGGGTCAGT, TCGGTGCACTCCTCGATGA, TGGCAGCTATAAACCTAACCCCCAAATCTATGTC) PKR (GCGATACATGAGCCCAGAACA, TCAGCAAGAATTAGCCCCAAA, TTCGCAAGACTATGGAAAGGAAGTGGACCTCTA), STAT1 (TCAATGTGGACCAGCTGAACAT, CGTCCACGGAATGAGACCAT, AAGCTTCTTGGTCCTAACGCCAGCCC), interferon regulatory factor 1 (AGAGAAGGTATCAGGGCTGGAAT, GAAGTCCAGCCGAGATGCTAA, CCACATGACTTCCTCTTGGCCTTGCT), 18 S (CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA, GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT, TGCTGGCACCAGACTTGCCCTC). Probes were labeled at the 5′-end with the reporter dye 6-FAM and on the 3′-end with the quencher dye TAMRA (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). The mature IFN-κ coding region (Leu28–Lys207) was chemically synthesized with codons optimized for expression inEscherichia coli by PCR amplification of overlapping oligonucleotides (15Dillon P.J. Rosen C.A. Biotechniques. 1990; 9: 298-300PubMed Google Scholar). The 546-bp nucleotide sequence of the codon-optimized IFN-κ coding region that encodes amino acids Leu28–Lys207 and an initiating methionine has been deposited in GenBankTM under accession numberAF384047. The optimized IFN-κ gene was amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer (GTCAGTCATATGTGCAACCTGCTGAACGTTC) and a 3′ primer (GGTCATGGTACCTTATTATTTGCGACGGAACAGAG) that tailed the amplicon withNdeI and Asp718 restriction sites. The resulting amplicon was restriction digested with NdeI and Asp718, subcloned into like-digested pHE4, a bacterial expression vector (16Gentz, R. L., and Coleman, T. A. (2001) U. S. Patent 6,194,168, February 27, 2001.Google Scholar), and expressed in the E. coli W3110 strain. Cells were grown to the mid-logarithmic growth phase, and after a 5 h induction in the presence of 0.1 mm IPTG, 1.5 liters of fermentation broth was harvested, and 15 g of cell paste was resuspended in 200 ml of 0.1 m NaPO4, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4. The resuspended cell pellet was passed through a microfluidizer and centrifuged to obtain inclusion bodies, and IFN-κ was purified following a procedure described for IFN-β (17Lin L.S. Yamamoto R. Drummond R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 119: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Inclusion bodies were washed with 0.1m urea, 0.1 m NaPO4, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7.4, solubilized in 20 ml of 1% SDS, 0.1 mNaPO4, pH 7.4, and the solubilized pellet was extracted with 2 volumes of 2-butanol. The upper organic layer was diluted 5-fold in 0.1 m NaPO4, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4, and glacial acetic acid was added until achieving a pH value of 5.0. The resulting precipitate was centrifuged, and the dried pellet was resuspended in 0.1m NaPO4, 0.05% SDS, pH 7.4. Reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified IFN-κ revealed the presence of a major band migrating at ∼30 kDa, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing confirmed identity to IFN-κ. Normal human dermal fibroblasts were seeded to an initial density of 2 × 104 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum in flat bottom 96-well plates and were allowed to grow to 95% confluence. Serial dilutions of recombinant IFN-κ were added to the wells. Following 24 h of incubation, EMCV 2 × 104 TCID50 was added to each well. Following an additional 24 h incubation, the cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with 1% crystal violet in 15% ethanol. Scoring of the plates was accomplished by extraction of stained cells with 70% ethanol/1% acetic acid, followed by absorbance determination at 580 nm in a 96-well format ELISA plate reader. Data are expressed as absorbance versus protein concentration. Five tandem copies of the ISRE element (TAGTTTCACTTTCCC), which mediates type I interferon-inducible expression of the interferon-inducible gene ISG54 (18Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Reich N. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and a basal promoter containing a TATA box contained within the pISRE-Luc plasmid (catalog number 219089; Stratagene), was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers with the following sequences: GCTAGCGGTACCAAGCTAGTTTCACTTTCCC and TGCAGTAAGCTTTACCGGAATGCCAAGCTGG. The resulting 161-bp amplicon was digested by Asp718 and XhoI sites and sub-cloned into like-digested pSEAP2-Basic (catalog number 6049–1;CLONTECH). To facilitate selection of stable transfectants, the neomycin resistance gene cassette was introduced into pISRE-SEAP to generate pISRE-SEAP/neo. The pISRE-SEAP/neo reporter was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293F cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and neomycin-resistant transfectants were selected and screened for their responsiveness to human IFN-β and IFN-α. Cells demonstrating sensitivity were used for further study. Transfection of IFN genes and IFN receptor genes was performed by LipofectAMINE. SEAP assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates following the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and counted in a Dynax luminometer. Interferon receptor-neutralizing antibody IFNaRβ1 (catalog number MMHAR-2; Research Diagnostics, Inc.) and control antibody M1 (catalog number F3040; Sigma) were also employed in this assay. BLAST analysis of a data base of over 3 million human EST sequences identified a single EST derived from a keratinocyte library displaying novel homology to the type I interferons. Complete sequence analysis of this 1.1-kb cDNA clone revealed an open reading frame of 207 amino acids with significant homology to the other subclasses of type I IFN and that we have named IFN-κ. Although the first in-frame methionine (Met1) is designated as the initiating methionine, the possibility that the methionine at amino acid position 7 (Met7) is the initiating methionine cannot be ruled out. Neither the nucleotide context of Met1(AAAAAAAUGA) nor Met7(CCUGAUAUGA) compare favorably with the “strong” consensus Kozak translational initiating sequence (GCCACCAUGG) (13Kozak M. J. Cell. Bio. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). To confirm the sequence of the cDNA clone and to identify the genomic structure of IFN-κ, the IFN-κ gene was isolated and sequenced (Fig. 1). In addition to the gene-encoding sequences, ∼0.5 kb of upstream sequence including the putative promoter sequence and 1 kb of downstream sequence were isolated. The genomic sequence confirmed the open reading frame sequence identified in the cDNA sequence and also revealed the presence of an intron within the 3′ untranslated region immediately following the stop codon (Fig. 1). The presence of an intron in type I IFN genes has not been reported previously (1Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 2Maeyer E. Maeyer-Guignard J. Thompson A. The Cytokine Handbook. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 491-516Google Scholar). Inspection of the promoter region revealed the presence of a putative TATA element and within 200 bp of the transcriptional start site, three GAAANN elements (Fig. 1). GAAANN elements have been demonstrated to mediate the virus inducibility of the IFN-α and IFN-β genes through the binding of members of the interferon regulatory factor family (19Pitha P.M. Au W.-C. Lowther W. Juang Y.-T. Schafer S.L. Burysek L. Hiscott J. Moore P.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Comparison of the IFN-κ protein sequence with the three existing subgroups of human type I IFNs (Fig.2A) reveals homology throughout the coding region, including within the five α-helical regions defined in other type IFNs (20Senda T. Saitoh S. Mitsui Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 187-207Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Radhakrishnan R. Walter L.L. Hruza A. Reichert P. Trotta P.P. Nagabhushan T.L. Walter M.R.

A. 1997; 94: 11813-11818Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Like other IFNs, IFN-κ is predicted to be secreted based on PSORT and SignalP algorithm analysis (23von Heinje G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3692) Google Scholar) with cleavage anticipated to be between amino acids Ser27 and Leu28. In vitrotranscription and translation of the IFN-κ cDNA revealed a protein that migrates at ∼30 kDa (Fig. 2 B), somewhat larger than the anticipated molecular mass of 25.2 kDa. In the presence of microsomal membranes the IFN-κ protein is processed to remove its NH2-terminal signal peptide (Fig. 2 B). To confirm that IFN-κ is secreted from mammalian cells, the full-length IFN-κ open reading frame was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Conditioned supernatant collected from IFN-κ-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cell lines was subjected to ion exchange chromatography, and a protein of the anticipated molecular mass for IFN-κ was isolated. Amino acid sequencing of the captured protein revealed identity to IFN-κ and an NH2 terminus of LDCNL, therefore confirming that IFN-κ is secreted and that cleavage occurs between Ser27 and Leu28. Although it appears that IFN-κ utilizes a signal peptide relatively longer than other type I IFNs (Fig. 2 A), as discussed above, it cannot be ruled out that Met7 is the start methionine resulting in a signal peptide closer in length to that of the other type I interferon family members. Within the 180-amino acid mature protein (Leu28–Lys207), IFN-κ demonstrates 30–32% identity to the other type I IFNs (Fig. 2 C) and thus defines a novel subclass of type I IFN. Perhaps the most significant structural difference between IFN-κ and the other type I IFNs is the length of the CD loop region where IFN-κ has an insertion of 12 amino acids (Fig. 2 A). This also accounts for the larger size of mature IFN-κ (180 amino acids) compared with the IFN-α (165–166 amino acids), IFN-β (166 amino acids), and IFN-ω (172 amino acids) subclasses. The mature protein contains five cysteines, and on the basis of homology and modeling to other IFNs it is expected that Cys3 forms a disulfide bond with Cys102, whereas Cys32 forms a disulfide bond with Cys155, leaving Cys167 as an unpaired cysteine. Unlike human IFN-β and IFN-ω, but in common with most type I IFN-α species (22Karpusas M. Nolte M. Benton C.B. Meier W. Lipscomb W.N. Goelz S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11813-11818Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24Pestka S. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 119: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), IFN-κ does not contain a consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation. To determine the chromosomal position of the IFN-κ gene, a panel of monochromosomal somatic cell hybrids retaining individual chromosomes was screened using IFN-κ-specific primers. A PCR product was detected in chromosome 9, whereas no amplification was observed in any other sample (Fig. 3). To sublocalize IFN-κ on chromosome 9, a panel of 83 radiation hybrids was used. We observed amplicons in hybrids 13, 15, 25, 28, 35, 40, 48, 66, and 74. Analysis of this data using the Stanford Human Genome Center radiation hybrid server revealed linkage to the SHGC-36542 marker on chromosome 9, which lies between markers D9S161 and D9S1853 on the physical map of chromosome 9. Superposition of this position with the cytogenetic map of human chromosome 9 allowed the assignment of IFN-κ to chromosomal band 9p21.2. Analysis of the recently deposited human genome sequence confirmed the map position of IFN-κ to this region on chromosome 9. It has been demonstrated previously that the IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-ω genes are closely linked within 400 kb in the 9p21-p22 region (3Diaz M.O. Pomykala H.M. Bohlander S.K. Maltepe E. Malik K. Brownstein B. Olapade O.I. Genomics. 1994; 22: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Based on the radiation hybrid mapping and genomic sequence information, IFN-κ is located ∼6.5 megabases proximal to the centromere relative to the existing type I IFN cluster. Analysis of the Human Genome Sciences data base, which comprises sequences derived from ∼900 independent human cDNA libraries generated from both normal and disease tissue and cell types, revealed expression of IFN-κ only in keratinocytes suggesting that IFN-κ exhibits a restricted pattern of expression. No detectable expression of IFN-κ was observed in an analysis of a panel of Northern blots containing RNA from a wide range of human cell and tissue types including brain, kidney, spleen, liver, tonsil, heart, small intestine, colon, placenta, and testis. Real-time Taqman PCR performed on a range of purified cell populations including T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes confirmed expression of IFN-κ in keratinocytes and revealed a lower level of expression in dendritic cells and monocytes but failed to detect significant expression elsewhere (data not shown). Northern analysis performed on adult keratinocytes confirmed the expression of a 1.1-kilobase IFN-κ mRNA transcript (Fig.4A). Expression of the IFN-κ mRNA was observed in multiple independent adult keratinocyte donor populations and also in neonatal keratinocytes (data not shown). In contrast to IFN-κ expression, IFN-β mRNA was undetectable in resting keratinocytes (Fig. 4 A). Treatment of keratinocytes with dsRNA, a known inducer of IFN expression, resulted in the expected increase in IFN-β expression and also an up-regulation of IFN-κ mRNA expression (Fig. 4 A). To determine whether keratinocytes express detectable levels of IFN-κ protein, an ELISA was developed for IFN-κ. The specificity of the ELISA was demonstrated by an inability of the ELISA or the component polyclonal or monoclonal IFN-κ antibodies to cross-react with either recombinant IFN-α or IFN-β. Supernatants collected from three donor populations of adult keratinocytes cultured for 24 h revealed expression of IFN-κ at the 150–200 pg/ml level. In contrast, no IFN-κ protein was detectable in primary cell cultures of fibroblasts or in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The observation that dsRNA enhances IFN-κ expression suggests that IFN-κ will also be up-regulated upon viral infection. Real-time PCR analysis of keratinocytes infected with EMCV demonstrated that the IFN-κ mRNA is induced ∼10-fold 15 h after viral infection (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether expression of IFN-κ is regulated by other interferons, cultured human keratinocytes were treated with IFN-γ or IFN-β. As shown in Fig. 4 C, bot"
https://openalex.org/W2080787906,"The major cholesterol oxidation products in the human circulation are 27-hydroxycholesterol, 24-hydroxycholesterol, and 7α-hydroxycholesterol. These oxysterols are formed from cholesterol by specific cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP27, CYP46, and CYP7A, respectively. An additional oxysterol present in concentrations comparable with 7α- and 24-hydroxycholesterol is 4β-hydroxycholesterol. We now report that patients treated with the antiepileptic drugs phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or phenytoin have highly elevated levels of plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol. When patients with uncomplicated cholesterol gallstone disease were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid, plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol increased by 45%. Ursodeoxycholic acid, as well as the antiepileptic drugs, are known to induce cytochrome P450 3A. Recombinant CYP3A4 was shown to convert cholesterol to 4β-hydroxycholesterol, whereas no conversion was observed with CYP1A2, CYP2C9, or CYP2B6. The concentration of 4α-hydroxycholesterol in plasma was lower than the concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol and not affected by treatment with the antiepileptic drugs or ursodeoxycholic acid.

Together, these data suggest that 4β-hydroxycholesterol in human circulation is formed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. low density lipoprotein gas chromatography-mass spectrometry liver X receptor α Cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) have recently attracted great interest because of their numerous biological actions. They have been implicated in bile acid biosynthesis, cholesterol transport, and gene regulation (1Russell D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition, many oxysterols are toxic to cells and induce apoptosis (2Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 361-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 3Yin J. Chaufour X. McLachlan C. McGuire M. White G. King N. Hambly B. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 148: 365-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Nishio E. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These compounds can be formed either by cholesterol auto-oxidation or by the action of cholesterol-metabolizing enzymes. Several oxysterols can be formed by both mechanisms, i.e. 7α-hydroxycholesterol. This oxysterol is a predominant cholesterol auto-oxidation product but is also formed by the hepatic enzyme cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. Major oxysterols in the human circulation include 27-hydroxycholesterol, 24-hydroxycholesterol, and 7α-hydroxycholesterol (5Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). One additional oxysterol present in human plasma at a relatively high concentration is 4β-hydroxycholesterol (6Breuer O. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2275-2281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very little is known about its formation or metabolism. We have shown earlier that small amounts of this oxysterol are formed, together with 4α-hydroxycholesterol, duringin vitro oxidation of low density lipoprotein, and low levels of the two oxysterols were also found in human atherosclerotic plaques (7Breuer O. Dzeletovic S. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The ratio between 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol was close to one both in oxidized LDL1 and in plaques, and the amount formed in oxidized LDL was only a small percent of the dominating oxysterol, 7-oxocholesterol. These data suggested that very little 4β-hydroxycholesterol is formed by cholesterol auto-oxidation. Because relatively high levels were reported in human plasma we hypothesized that this compound is formed in vivo by an enzymatic reaction. 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol were determined in plasma from volunteers and patients, and it was found that patients treated with certain antiepileptic drugs, known to influence cytochrome P450 enzymes, had 10–20-fold higher plasma levels of 4β-hydroxycholesterol than untreated control subjects. Attempts to identify the cytochrome P450 responsible for the conversion of cholesterol into 4β-hydroxycholesterol were made using recombinant human cytochrome P450 enzymes expressed in insect cells. Chloroform, ethyl acetate, hexane, and toluene, analytical grade, and methanol (high pressure liquid chromatography grade) were obtained from Merck. 2-Propanol (high pressure liquid chromatography grade) was from Labscan Ltd. (Dublin, Ireland). Butylated hydroxytoluene was obtained from Sigma. EDTA disodium salt and potassium bromide were obtained from Merck. Solid-phase extraction cartridges (100 mg of Isolute® silica) were obtained from Sorbent (Mid Glamorgan, United Kingdom).tert-Butyldimethylsilylimidazole-dimethylformamide was obtained from Supelco Inc. (Bellefonte, PA). Testosterone, diclofenac, and phenacetin were obtained from Sigma. Microsomes (SUPERSOMES®) of recombinant human P450 (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 (with Arg144), and CYP3A4) expressed in insect cells (BTI-TN-5B1–4), together with NADPH-P450 reductase and cytochromeb5 (except CYP1A2), were purchased from Gentest (Woburn, MA). All other reagents and chemicals were high purity standard commercial products. Cholest-5-ene-3β,4β-diol (4β-hydroxycholesterol) and [26,26,26,27,27,27-2H6]4β-hydroxycholesterol were synthesized as described previously (6Breuer O. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2275-2281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blood was collected from volunteers without any known diseases, after an overnight fast, in evacuated blood collection tubes (Vacutainer, 100 × 16 mm; Becton Dickinson) containing 0.12 ml of 0.34 m EDTA K3. Blood plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 1400 × g for 10 min. Plasma samples were stored at −70 °C until use. Blood plasma from patients treated with phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproate was collected as decoded rest material from therapeutic drug monitoring, at the Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Huddinge University Hospital. Patients with uncomplicated cholesterol gallstone disease were treated with a ursodeoxycholic acid (Ursofalk® in 250-mg capsules from Dr. Falk Pharma, Freiburg, Germany) 500-mg bid for 3 weeks prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Blood samples were obtained after an overnight fast before starting the treatment and in the morning prior to operation. Blood, 70 ml, was collected from four healthy volunteers (all non-smokers), two males and two females (age 28, 30, 47, and 47) using the same conditions as described above. Part of the plasma was taken for measurement of total plasma cholesterol and total plasma 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol. Fractionation of plasma into lipoprotein fractions was done according to Havel et al. (8Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6486) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipoprotein fractions were isolated from plasma by ultracentrifugation at 250,000 × g at 2 °C. Very low density lipoprotein (0.95–1.006 g/ml) was removed after 24 h; LDL (1.006–1.0063 g/ml) and high density lipoprotein (1.0063–1.21 g/ml) were collected in consecutive spins after adjustment of the density with KBr. The plasma of each volunteer was fractionated separately. Autopsy materials were collected from different organs and tissues from a 72-year-old male patient, 44 h post-mortem, who died after cardiac insufficiency and chronic obstructive lung disease. Autopsy material of a brain was collected from a man who died at the age of 80 by auricular fibrillation and cardiac insufficiency. The post-mortem samples were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then kept frozen at −20 °C until analysis of cholesterol and 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol. To investigate whether any of the recombinant enzymes could convert cholesterol to 4β-hydroxycholesterol, 50 pmol of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, or CYP2B6 in 0.5 ml of incubation buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) were pre-incubated with 200 µm cholesterol for 5 min at 37 °C before NADPH (1 mg/ml, final concentration) was added. Cholesterol was added as a hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin solution (9Martin K.O. Budai K. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 581-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomes of insect cells without expressed P450 were incubated in the same way. Incubations were terminated after 2 h by adding 50 µl of methanol. After a rapid cooling the samples were subjected to GC-MS analysis as described for plasma samples but without alkaline hydrolysis. Incubations were performed according to the manufacturers recommendations. The formation of 4β-hydroxycholesterol by CYP3A4 was characterized in more detail by incubating cholesterol at five different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 µm) for 2 h with 25 pmol of enzyme. Incubations were also carried out with different amounts of protein (0, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 pmol), at 200 µmcholesterol, and for different times (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h) at 100 µm cholesterol. Because no conversion of cholesterol to 4β-hydroxycholesterol was observed with CYP1A2, CYP2C9, or CYP2B6, control incubations were carried out with phenacetin, diclofenac, and testosterone as substrates, respectively. All three enzymes converted the control substrates to the expected products, acetamidophenol, 4-hydroxydiclofenac, and 16β-hydroxytestosterone, respectively. Cholesterol in plasma and lipoprotein fractions was determined using a commercial enzymatic method (Roche Diagnostics/Hitachi 917 system). Total cholesterol in tissue homogenate was determined as described earlier (10Björkhem I. Blomstrand R. Svensson L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1974; 54: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) by using isotope dilution GC-MS with [26,26,26,27,27,27-2H6]cholesterol as internal standard. The procedure for alkaline hydrolysis and extraction of 4β-hydroxycholesterol in tissue homogenate and plasma has been described previously (6Breuer O. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2275-2281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to 1 ml of plasma 10 µg of butylated hydroxytoluene and 100 ng of [2H6]4β-hydroxycholesterol dissolved in 40 µl of toluene was added. Argon was flushed through the vial for 20 min to remove air. Freshly prepared 0.35 m potassium hydroxide in ethanol (10 ml) was added. The alkaline hydrolysis was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature with continuous magnetic stirring. The reaction mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel, and the pH value was adjusted to 7 with phosphoric acid. 18 ml of chloroform and 6 ml of 0.15 m NaCl were added. Thereafter the funnel was vigorously shaken. The organic phase was transferred to a round-bottom flask, and the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The residue was dried with ethanol and finally dissolved in 1 ml of toluene. A 100-mg silica solid-phase extraction column (International Sorbent Technology, Mid Glanorgan, UK) was used to separate 4-hydroxycholesterol from cholesterol. The column was conditioned with 2 ml of hexane. The sample (dissolved in toluene) was applied to the column followed by 1 ml of hexane. Cholesterol was eluted with 8 ml of 0.5% 2-propanol in hexane and by adding 5 ml of 30% 2-propanol, 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol were eluted. The solvent was evaporated under a gentle stream of argon, and the residue was derivatized. 4β-Hydroxycholesterol was converted into atert-butyldimethylsilyl ether by treatment with 100 µl oftert-butyldimethylsilylimidazole-dimethylformamide (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA) at 22 °C overnight, followed by addition of 1 ml of water and extraction twice with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. After derivatization and removal of solvent under a stream of argon, the samples were dissolved in 100 µl of hexane (6Breuer O. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2275-2281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II Plus gas chromatograph equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25-µm phase thickness), connected to an HP 5972 mass selective detector and an HP 7673A automatic sample injector. The oven temperature program was as follows: 180 °C for 1 min, 35 °C/min to 270 °C, and then 20 °C/min to 310 °C where the temperature was kept for 17.0 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Samples were splitless injected (1 µl), and the detector temperature was 270 °C. The detector transfer line temperature was set to 280 °C. The mass spectrometer was used in the selected ion monitoring mode, and the following ions (m/z) were monitored (retention times in brackets): 573,367 (4β-hydroxycholesterol [16.1 min]; 4α-hydroxycholesterol [17.0 min]) and 579,373 ([2H6]4β-hydroxycholesterol [16.0 min]). The electron ionization energy was 70 eV. All studies were approved by the Ethics Committee of Karolinska Institutet at Huddinge University Hospital (Huddinge, Sweden). Plasma concentrations of 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol were determined in 125 healthy volunteers (Table I), and the mean concentrations were found to be 6.6 and 29 ng/ml, respectively. The distribution of plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol concentrations in the volunteers is shown in Fig. 1. 4β-Hydroxycholesterol was present both in its free form and esterified to long-chain fatty acids. The degree of esterification was determined in plasma from 10 healthy volunteers. 4β-Hydroxycholesterol was present in esterified form to 83% in plasma whereas 4α-hydroxycholesterol was esterified to 70%.Table IPlasma concentrations of 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol in healthy volunteers4α-Hydroxycholesterol4β-HydroxycholesterolCholesterolng/ml1-aMean ± S.D.ng/ml1-aMean ± S.D.mmol/l1-aMean ± S.D.All volunteers (n = 125)6.6 ± 2.829 ± 104.5 ± 0.8Males (n = 49)6.8 ± 3.626 ± 114.3 ± 0.8Females (n = 76)6.5 ± 2.130 ± 104.7 ± 0.71-a Mean ± S.D.

The plasma was fractionated into very low density lipoprotein, LDL, and high density lipoprotein fractions, and cholesterol and 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol were determined in the fractions. As shown in Table II, the distribution of 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol paralleled completely the distribution of cholesterol in the lipoprotein fractions with the major part residing in the LDL fraction.Table IIMean distribution of cholesterol, 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol in plasma lipoproteinsVLDLLDLHDL%Cholesterol (n = 4)466304α-OH-cholesterol (n = 3)366314β-OH-cholesterol (n = 4)27127VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein.

The ratio of 4β-hydroxycholesterol to cholesterol was determined in several human tissues from autopsy material. As shown in TableIII this ratio did not differ much in the tissues examined except for the brain, which contained 5–6 times higher relative amounts compared with most other tissues. We can not judge how representative these results are, because autopsy material from each tissue was only obtained from one single subject.Table IIICholesterol related concentrations of 4β-hydroxycholesterol in human tissuesTissue4α-Hydroxycholesterol3-ang 4-hydroxycholesterol/mg cholesterol.

Open table in a new tab Plasma concentrations of 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol were determined in patients on monotherapy with different antiepileptic drugs. As shown in TableIV, patients treated with valproate had plasma levels of the two oxysterols very similar to those in healthy subjects (Table I). Patients treated with carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital all had significantly (p < 0.0001) increased plasma concentrations of 4β-hydroxycholesterol, 7–8-fold higher than those in healthy subjects. Some patients had a 20-fold increase in 4β-hydroxycholesterol. None of the antiepileptic drugs influenced the plasma level of 4α-hydroxycholesterol. Plasma from one patient treated with carbamazepine, with a 4β-hydroxycholesterol concentration of 600 ng/ml, was analyzed for other oxysterols (5Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Normal values were found for all oxysterols analyzed, i.e.7α- and 7β-hydroxycholesterol, cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol, 7-oxocholesterol, and 24-, 25-, and 27-hydroxycholesterol (data not shown). The identity of 4β-hydroxycholesterol was ascertained by full scan GC-MS, and the mass spectrum was found to be identical to what was published previously (7Breuer O. Dzeletovic S. Lund E.

Four different microsomal preparations containing CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9 were used. Microsomes containing CYP3A4 converted cholesterol into 4β-hydroxycholesterol with aKm of ∼50 µm whereas no conversion could be detected with CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 or CYP2B6. The 4β-hydroxylation of cholesterol by recombinant CYP3A4 was characterized in some detail. Incubations with different amounts of enzyme showed an almost linear response between 25 and 100 pmol CYP3A4/ml (Fig. 2). Substrate saturation was obtained above 100 µm (Fig. 2). Control microsomes without expressed human cytochrome P450 enzymes did not convert cholesterol into 4β-hydroxycholesterol. The major circulating oxysterols in man are 7α-, 24- and 27-hydroxycholesterol. They are all products of enzymatic reactions (11Cohen J.C. Cali J.J. Jelenik D.F. Mehrabian M. Sparkes R.S. Lusis A.J.

An additional oxysterol present in relatively high concentrations in human plasma is 4β-hydroxycholesterol (6Breuer O. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2275-2281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has not been known, however, how this oxysterol is formed. In vitro oxidation of low density lipoprotein resulted in the formation of small amounts of 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol in a ratio close to one (7Breuer O. Dzeletovic S. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suggesting that the oxysterols were formed by auto-oxidation. The high levels in the human circulation and the high ratio of 4β- to 4α-hydroxycholesterol (usually >3) indicated a potential enzymatic origin of plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol. Determination of plasma levels of 4β-hydroxycholesterol in 125 healthy volunteers invariably showed higher levels of 4β-hydroxycholesterol compared with 4α-hydroxycholesterol with a mean ratio of 4.7. One subject (not included in the group of healthy volunteers), treated with the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, had a plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol concentration over 600 ng/ml compared with 30 ng/ml in the average healthy volunteer (Table I). This led us to investigate the effect of different antiepileptic drugs on the plasma levels of 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol. Patients treated with carbamazepine, phenytoin, or phenobarbital, three drugs known to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes (14Tanaka E. J. Clin. Pharm. Ther. 1999; 24: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 15Michalets E.L. Pharmacotherapy. 1998; 18: 84-112PubMed Google Scholar), had significantly elevated plasma levels of 4β-hydroxycholesterol compared with patients treated with valproate (Table IV) whereas 4α-hydroxycholesterol levels were similar. Patients on monotherapy with valproate, a drug that does not induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, had normal plasma levels of 4β-hydroxycholesterol. This showed that epilepsy per sedoes not result in elevated plasma levels of 4β-hydroxycholesterol. Because three antiepileptic drugs known to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes elevated plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol, a number of recombinant human cytochrome P450 enzymes were tested for the ability to 4β-hydroxylate cholesterol. The major human liver P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism are CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and the CYP2C subfamily (15Michalets E.L. Pharmacotherapy. 1998; 18: 84-112PubMed Google Scholar). The CYP3A4 enzyme metabolizes the widest range of drugs and endogenous compounds of the different cytochromes (15Michalets E.L. Pharmacotherapy. 1998; 18: 84-112PubMed Google Scholar). Phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 (14Tanaka E. J. Clin. Pharm. Ther. 1999; 24: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 15Michalets E.L. Pharmacotherapy. 1998; 18: 84-112PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pascussi J.-M. Gerbal-Chaloin S. Fabre J.-M. Maurel P. Vilarem M.-J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore, these cytochromes were tested for cholesterol 4β-hydroxylase activity. The substrates for CYP2D6 are all bases, and their binding to the active site depends on ion-pair interactions (17Bertilsson L. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1995; 29: 192-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 18Anzenbacher P. Anzenbacherová E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Consequently, cholesterol is not expected to be a substrate for CYP2D6. Although CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2B6 did not metabolize cholesterol, CYP3A4 converted cholesterol into a polar compound co-chromatographing with 4β-hydroxycholesterol on GC-MS with selected ion monitoring, using an isotope-dilution technique. The identity of the product was verified by full scan GC-MS. Ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to induce murine CYP3A (19Paolini M. Pozzetti L. Piazza F. Cantelli-Forti G. Roda A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 730-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Plasma concentrations of 4β-hydroxycholesterol in patients before and after treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid was therefore determined. Three weeks of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid increased plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol by 45%. This finding is in accordance with our assumption that CYP3A4 is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of cholesterol into 4β-hydroxycholesterol. Although recombinant CYP3A4 was shown to convert cholesterol into 4β-hydroxycholesterol in vitro, it can not be excluded that another cytochrome is responsible for the normal production of this sterol. Many drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes are relatively nonspecific and may induce several enzymes. Because CYP3A4 is known to be induced by antiepileptics, is abundant in the liver, and was shown to convert cholesterol into 4β-hydroxycholesterol in vitro it is a strong candidate enzyme, but it is still possible that another enzyme is responsible for this conversion in vivo. Very little is known about the biological effects of 4β-hydroxycholesterol. It has been reported that 4β-hydroxycholesterol is almost as good an activator for the nuclear receptor liver X receptor α (LXRα) as 24S-hydroxycholesterol, 20S-hydroxycholesterol, and 22R-hydroxycholesterol (20Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). The most effective activator of LXRα, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, binds to the receptor with a Kd of ∼200 nm (21Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). In healthy volunteers the plasma concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol is 75 nm, but patients treated with carbamazepine may have 4β-hydroxycholesterol concentrations up to 1500 nm. LXRα is an important transcription factor involved in gene regulation of genes important for cholesterol homeostasis. It is possible that the highly elevated levels of 4β-hydroxycholesterol in patients treated with some antiepileptic drugs may effect transcription of genes responsive to LXRα. One such gene is sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, which controls transcription of lipogenic genes (22Schultz J.R. Tu H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C. Li L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). A known side effect of treatment with certain antiepileptic drugs is weight gain. Further research will show whether drug-induced formation of 4β-hydroxycholesterol may be related to weight increase seen in patients treated with antiepileptics. 4β-Hydroxylated bile acids have been identified in fetal gallbladder bile where they constituted 5–15% of total biliary bile acids (23Dumaswala R. Setchell K.D.R. Zimmer-Nechemias L. Iida T. Goto J. Nambara T. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Setchell K.D.R. Dumaswala R. Colombo C. Ronchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16637-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we have found evidence for an enzymatic formation of 4β-hydroxycholesterol in man. Patients treated with antiepileptics known to induce CYP3A4 had highly elevated plasma levels of 4β-hydroxycholesterol. Ursodeoxycholic acid, which has also been reported to induce CYP3A, caused an increase in plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol when given to gallstone patients. Plasma 4α-hydroxycholesterol concentrations were not influenced by treatments that elevated 4β-hydroxycholesterol, indicating that 4α-hydroxycholesterol is formed by cholesterol auto-oxidation or an enzyme not affected by carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or ursodeoxycholic acid."

However, angiostatin's mechanism of anti-angiogenic action is unclear. We found that bovine arterial endothelial (BAE) cells adhere to angiostatin in an integrin-dependent manner and that integrins αvβ3, α9β1, and to a lesser extent α4β1, specifically bind to angiostatin. αvβ3 is a predominant receptor for angiostatin on BAE cells, since a function-blocking antibody to αvβ3 effectively blocks adhesion of BAE cells to angiostatin, but an antibody to α9β1 does not. ε-Aminocaproic acid, a Lys analogue, effectively blocks angiostatin binding to BAE cells, indicating that an unoccupied Lys-binding site of the kringles may be required for integrin binding. It is known that other plasminogen fragments containing three or five kringles (K1–3 or K1–5) have an anti-angiogenic effect, but plasminogen itself does not. We found that K1–3 and K1–5 bind to αvβ3, but plasminogen does not. These results suggest that the anti-angiogenic action of angiostatin may be mediated via interaction with αvβ3. Angiostatin binding to αvβ3 does not strongly induce stress-fiber formation, suggesting that angiostatin may prevent angiogenesis by perturbing the αvβ3-mediated signal transduction that may be necessary for angiogenesis.

These endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors have a lot of therapeutic potential, but the mechanism by which they suppress angiogenesis is unclear. In the present study, we examined whether endothelial cells express cell surface receptors for angiostatin other than ATP synthase (13Moser T.L. Stack M.S. Asplin I. Enghild J.J. Hojrup P. Everitt L.

We found that bovine arterial endothelial (BAE)1 cells adhered to angiostatin in an integrin-dependent manner and that αvβ3 was a predominant receptor for angiostatin on BAE cells. We obtained evidence that the Lys-binding sites of the kringles in angiostatin may be required for the interaction with integrins. We found that other anti-angiogenic plasminogen fragments containing three or five kringles (K1–3 or K1–5) bound to αvβ3, but plasminogen (which does not express anti-angiogenic function) did not. These results suggest that the anti-angiogenic action of angiostatin may require an interaction with αvβ3. We found that angiostatin binding to αvβ3 did not strongly induce spreading or stress-fiber formation, suggesting that angiostatin may prevent angiogenesis by perturbing the αvβ3-mediated signal transduction that may be necessary for angiogenesis.

As a control, CHO cells were transfected only with vector (pBJ-1) together with neomycin gene and selected for G418 resistance (designated mock-CHO cells).

Briefly, we coated wells in 96-well Immulon-2 microtiter plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) with 100 µl of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing substrates at a concentration of 50–500 nm and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. We blocked the remaining protein binding sites by incubating with 0.2% BSA (Calbiochem) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells (105 cells/well) in 100 µl of Hepes-Tyrode buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 12 mmNaHCO3, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 0.1% glucose, 0.02% BSA) supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h unless stated otherwise. After non-bound cells were removed by rinsing the wells with the same buffer, bound cells were quantified by measuring endogenous phosphatase activity (32Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Data are shown as the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Antibodies were used at 250× dilution of ascites (SG73 and KH72) and at 4 µg/ml (AIIB2, Y9A2, 7E3, and LM609). We tested whether soluble 125I-labeled angiostatin (K1–3) would bind to αvβ3. We plated β3-CHO and mock-transfected CHO cells in wells of 48-well tissue culture plates and let them grow in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. We washed the wells three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% BSA and incubated the cells with 0.5 µm125I-labeled angiostatin (K1–3) for 1 h at 37 °C in a volume of 125 µl. Unbound angiostatin was removed by washing the wells twice with Hanks' balanced salt/BSA solution. Cell-bound radioactivity was harvested with 300 µl of 0.1% SDS solution and counted in a γ-counter. Molecules bound per cell were calculated from the specific radioactivity of125I-angiostatin. β3-CHO cells were serum-starved in 0.5% serum for 18 h and harvested. Resuspended cells (2 × 104/coverslip) in Hepes-Tyrode buffer supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 were plated and incubated on coverslips that had been coated with either 500 nm angiostatin, 50 µg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma), or 5 µg/ml fibronectin at 37 °C for 90 min. After unbound cells were removed by rinsing the coverslips with the same buffer, bound cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. After washing 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, the specimens were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (5 units/ml, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h. Staining of actin was observed under a confocal microscope (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad) equipped with an argon/krypton laser line, a scan head, and an inverted Nikon DiaPhot microscope. Fluorescein isothiocyanate was excited at a wavelength of 488 nm and detected within a band between 506 and 538 nm. Digital images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop, version 4.0. The percentage of cells with central stress-fibers was determined by examining random fields. At least 300 cells were examined in each experiment, and error bars represent standard deviation in samples obtained in three separate experiments. Flow cytometry was performed as described (33Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used adhesion assays to test whether any cell-surface receptors bind to angiostatin (K1–4). We found that BAE cells adhered to immobilized angiostatin but did not adhere to control BSA. Adhesion of BAE cells to angiostatin was dose-dependent (Fig.1A). Mg2+supported, but Ca2+ did not support, the adhesion of BAE cells to angiostatin (Fig. 1 B). EDTA completely blocked this adhesion. These results indicate that BAE cells adhere to angiostatin in a Mg2+-dependent manner. We tested whether integrins, major cation-dependent adhesion receptors, interact with angiostatin using several CHO cell lines expressing different recombinant integrins. We found that CHO cells expressing recombinant αvβ3, α9β1, and to a lesser extent α4β1 (designated β3-, α9-, and α4-CHO cells, respectively) adhered to angiostatin (Fig.2A). In contrast, CHO cells transfected with vector only (designated mock-CHO cells) and CHO cells expressing α2β1, α3β1, and α6β1(designated α2-, α3-, and α6-CHO cells, respectively) did not significantly adhere to angiostatin. Antibodies specific to integrin α4β1 (SG73), α9β1 (Y9A2), and αvβ3 (7E3) blocked adhesion of α4-, α9-, and β3-CHO cells to angiostatin, respectively. Control anti-α5 mAb (KH72) did not block adhesion of β3-, α9-, and α4-CHO cells to angiostatin under the assay conditions used (data not shown), although endogenous α5β1 is expressed on CHO cells. Adhesion of β3-, α9-, and α4-CHO cells to angiostatin was dose-dependent and reached maximum at a coating concentration of 200 nm angiostatin (Fig.2 B). These results indicate that integrins αvβ3, α9β1, and α4β1 (to a lesser extent) specifically mediate cell adhesion to angiostatin. We studied which integrins are expressed on BAE cells in flow cytometry. We found that αvβ3 and α9β1were constitutively expressed on BAE cells using anti-human integrin antibodies that cross-react with bovine integrins (anti-human αvβ3 (LM609), β1 (AIIB2), and α9 (Y9A2) mAbs) (Fig.3A). We then studied whether αvβ3 and α9β1integrins expressed on BAE cells could bind to angiostatin. LM609 completely blocked adhesion of BAE cells to angiostatin, but Y9A2 and AIIB2 had only minimal effects on adhesion of BAE cells to angiostatin. These results indicate that αvβ3 is a predominant receptor for angiostatin in BAE cells. Furthermore the RGD peptide completely blocked adhesion of BAE cells to angiostatin, whereas the control RGE peptide had no effect on adhesion (Fig.3 B). This is consistent with the idea that αvβ3 is a predominant angiostatin receptor, since αvβ3 is RGD-dependent, but α9β1 is RGD-independent (Refs. 34Yokoyama K. Erickson H.P. Ikeda Y. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16891-16898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and35Eto K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Sheppard D. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Zhang X.P. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34922-34930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar and references therein). Since the RGD sequence is not present in angiostatin, these results suggest that the angiostatin-binding sites within αvβ3 may overlap with the RGD-binding site. Consistently we found that β3-CHO cells (which do not express α9β1) adhered to angiostatin in a manner similar to that of BAE cells; that is, β3-CHO cells adhered to angiostatin in a Mg2+- and RGD-dependent manner (data not shown). It has also been reported that several other β1integrins (e.g. α2β1 and α3β1) are expressed on endothelial cells (36Gamble J. Meyer G. Noack L. Furze J. Matthias L. Kovach N. Harlant J. Vadas M. Endothelium. 1999; 7: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37Shin E.Y. Lee J.Y. Park M.K. Chin Y.H. Jeong G.B. Kim S.Y. Kim S.R. Kim E.G. Mol. Cell. 1999; 9: 138-145Google Scholar). However, we did not test α2β1 and α3β1 on BAE cells since α2- and α3-CHO cells did not show significant adhesion to angiostatin. It is unclear whether BAE cells express α4β1, since anti-α4 mAbs that cross-react with bovine α4 was not available. We tested whether synthesis of new proteins was required for adhesion of β3-CHO cells to angiostatin by treating cells with cycloheximide. Incubation of cells with 100 µmcycloheximide for 30 min before adhesion assays and during adhesion assays did not affect the adhesion capacity of β3-CHO cells to angiostatin (data not shown). This suggests that synthesis of new proteins is not required for angiostatin-αvβ3 interaction. Since αvβ3 has been implicated in angiogenesis (38Byzova T.V. Rabbani R. D'Souza S.E. Plow E.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we further characterized the angiostatin-αvβ3 interaction. We have previously shown that the CYDMKTTC sequence in the β3subunit of αvβ3 is critically involved in the ligand specificity of αvβ3 (31Takagi J. Kamata T. Meredith J. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19794-19800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The αvβ1-3-1 mutant, in which the CTSEQNC sequence of β1 was replaced with the CYDMKTTC sequence of β3, recognizes several known αvβ3 ligands, including vitronectin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and Coxsackievirus A9 VP1 capsid protein (31Takagi J. Kamata T. Meredith J. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19794-19800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 39Yokoyama K. Zhang X.P. Medved L. Takada Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5872-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40Triantafilou K. Triantafilou M. Takada Y. Fernandez N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5856-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). αvβ1 does not recognize these αvβ3 ligands. We attempted to determine whether the αvβ1-3-1 mutant could recognize angiostatin and found that β1-3-1-CHO cells (that express the αvβ1-3-1 mutant) significantly bound to angiostatin. β1-CHO cells (that express αvβ1) as negative controls did not bind to angiostatin (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that angiostatin binding to αvβ3 is similar to that of known αvβ3 ligands in that the CYDMKTTC sequence of β3 is critically involved. It has been reported that the Lys-binding sites mediate the interaction of plasminogen and its derivatives with most cells (reviewed in Ref. 41Plow E.F. Herren T. Redlitz A. Miles L.A. Hoover-Plow J.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The Lys-binding sites are associated with the kringles of plasminogen. We thus tested whether the binding of angiostatin (which includes kringles 1–4 of plasminogen) to integrins is affected by a Lys analogue, ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA). We found that angiostatin binding to β3-CHO and BAE cells was blocked by EACA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that an unoccupied Lys-binding site in angiostatin may be required for the recognition of angiostatin by αvβ3. Other plasminogen fragments containing kringle domains display differential effects on the suppression of endothelial cell growth and migration (10Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D.

The K1–3 and larger K1–5 fragments have been shown to be anti-angiogenic (10Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinas M. Folkman J. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 5728-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), but intact plasminogen does not exhibit anti-angiogenic activity (44Goretzki L. Lombardo C.R. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28625-28633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus we tested whether plasminogen, K1–3, or K1–5 could bind to αvβ3. We found that β3-CHO cells adhered to the K1–3 and K1–5 fragments but did not adhere significantly to intact plasminogen (Fig.5A). In contrast, the coating efficiency of plasminogen to the plastic surface was comparable with those of K1–3 and angiostatin using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with mAb 51 (anti-plasminogen K1–3 and K4) (data not shown). These results suggest that the αvβ3 binding sites in the plasminogen kringles are cryptic and are exposed after proteolytic cleavage of the kringle domains. It has been reported that an antibody against angiostatin (mAb 51) blocks the anti-angiogenic action of angiostatin in vitro(27Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We found that mAb 51 also blocked the interaction between αvβ3 and angiostatin in β3-CHO and BAE cells (Fig. 5 B). These results demonstrate the specificity of interaction of angiostatin with αvβ3. Also, these results are consistent with the idea that αvβ3-angiostatin interaction is related to the anti-angiogenic action of angiostatin. We tested whether soluble 125I-labeled angiostatin could bind to αvβ3. Angiostatin (K1–3) bound to β3-CHO cells at a level 27% higher than to mock-transfected CHO cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Fig. 6). The increased binding to β3-CHO cells compared with the mock-transfected cells was suppressed by the RGD peptide. RGD peptide did not affect angiostatin binding to CHO cells. Excess unlabeled angiostatin completely blocked angiostatin binding to both β3- and mock-transfected CHO cells, indicating that the binding was specific. EACA effectively blocked angiostatin binding, indicating that the Lys-binding sites in angiostatin mediated the binding. These results suggest that αvβ3-kringle interaction mediated binding of soluble angiostatin to the cell surface. Apparently at least two angiostatin-binding sites (RGD-dependent and -independent) are involved on β3-CHO cells. β3-CHO cells spread and generate stress fiber on attachment to several known αvβ3 ligands, including vitronectin, fibronectin, and fibrinogen (31Takagi J. Kamata T. Meredith J. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19794-19800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We tested whether attachment to angiostatin induces stress fiber formation in β3-CHO cells (Fig. 7A). β3-CHO cells did not appreciably spread and generate stress fibers on angiostatin, although the level of stress fiber generation was higher than on poly-l-lysine, a negative control (Fig. 7 B). This suggests that angiostatin is a unique αvβ3 ligand and is consistent with the idea that angiostatin may be a potential antagonist to other known angiogenic αvβ3 ligands that induce stress fiber formation. The present study establishes that several integrins, including αvβ3, α9β1, and to a lesser extent α4β1, specifically interact with angiostatin. We developed several lines of evidence that suggest that angiostatin binds to integrins as a ligand. First, EDTA blocked angiostatin binding to integrins. Second, the RGD peptide blocked angiostatin binding to αvβ3, but control RGE peptide did not. Third, anti-integrin α4, α9, and αvβ3 antibodies that are known to block ligand binding blocked angiostatin binding to these integrins. LM609 (anti-αvβ3) and SG73 (anti-α4) have actually been mapped within the putative ligand binding sites of integrins (45Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 46Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 47Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5542-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fourth, soluble angiostatin bound to β3-CHO cells more than to mock-transfected CHO cells, and the increased binding to β3-CHO cells was suppressed by RGD peptide, suggesting that soluble angiostatin binds to cells in an RGD- and αvβ3-dependent manner. Thus the present study is the first report that angiostatin is an adhesion molecule that interacts with integrins. We demonstrate here that αvβ3 is a dominant receptor for angiostatin in BAE cells. Integrins α2β1 and α3β1did not support angiostatin binding, although they have been reported to be expressed in endothelial cells (36Gamble J. Meyer G. Noack L. Furze J. Matthias L. Kovach N. Harlant J. Vadas M. Endothelium. 1999; 7: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37Shin E.Y. Lee J.Y. Park M.K. Chin Y.H. Jeong G.B. Kim S.Y. Kim S.R. Kim E.G. Mol. Cell. 1999; 9: 138-145Google Scholar). The contribution of α9β1 to the adhesion of BAE cells to angiostatin was much smaller than that of αvβ3, probably because α9β1 is expressed in BAE cells at a lower level than αvβ3. Although we did not show that angiostatin binding to αvβ3 on endothelial cells directly relates to its angiogenic action, the present results suggest a missing link between αvβ3 and the anti-angiogenic action of angiostatin. αvβ3 is a receptor for a wide variety of extracellular matrix ligands, including vitronectin, fibronectin, and fibrinogen. Endothelial cells exposed to growth factors or undergoing angiogenesis in tumors, wounds, or inflammatory tissue express high levels of αvβ3 (Ref. 48Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholarand references therein). Ligand binding to αvβ3 is essential for the sustained activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by angiogenic growth factors (49Eliceiri B.P. Klemke R. Stromblad S. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and suppresses the apoptotic pathway (50Stromblad S. Becker J.C. Yebra M. Brooks P.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to αvβ3 on vascular cells may mediate a signaling event that is critical for the survival and differentiation of vascular cells undergoing angiogenesis in vivo. The present results that angiostatin binds to αvβ3 on endothelial cells imply that angiostatin may perturb the critical αvβ3-mediated signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Consistent with this idea, we have shown that mAb 51 (anti-angiostatin), which blocks angiostatin's anti-angiogenic function in vitro (27Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), blocks angiostatin binding to αvβ3. We have also shown that three plasminogen fragments that have anti-angiogenic activity (K1–3, angiostatin, and K1–5) bind to αvβ3. In contrast, plasminogen, which has no anti-angiogenic function, does not bind to αvβ3. These results support the idea that the binding of plasminogen fragments to αvβ3 correlates with its anti-angiogenic function. However, it is unclear how angiostatin works as an αvβ3 antagonist, since the mode of angiostatin binding to αvβ3 is similar to that for other known αvβ3 ligands (e.g. vitronectin and fibrinogen) in that the predicted loop structure in β3 (the CYDMKTTC sequence) is critical for binding to αvβ3. Our finding that angiostatin does not induce strong spreading and stress fiber formation in β3-CHO cells may provide a clue to this question. Our observation is consistent with the idea that angiostatin works as an antagonist to αvβ3 by competing with other known αvβ3 ligands for binding to the ligand-binding site of αvβ3. It is also possible that angiostatin may induce signals through αvβ3 that are different from those with known αvβ3 ligands. Several technical issues have previously complicated the integrin binding function of angiostatin. Antibody LM609 has long been used as a reagent to identify αvβ3. LM609 recognizes an epitope within the putative ligand-binding site of β3(45Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It has also been established that LM609 blocks tumor-induced angiogenesis (51Brooks P. Clark R. Cheresh D. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar). Thus, it would not be possible as far as angiogenesis assays are currently used (e.g. chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay) to block the anti-angiogenic action of angiostatin using LM609 because angiostatin and LM609 would compete for binding to αvβ3 and because both show similar angiostatic functions. It would thus be difficult to determine whether angiostatin might block αvβ3function using in vivo angiogenesis assays. We were able to detect angiostatin-αvβ3 interaction and block this interaction with LM609 only with adhesion assays. The present study provides evidence that EACA, an Lys analogue, effectively blocks the angiostatin-αvβ3interaction. The Lys-binding sites are present in kringle domains 1, 2, 4, and 5 of plasminogen and preferentially recognize C-terminal Lys residues (for review, see Ref. 52Castellino F.J. McCance S.G. CIBA Found Symp. 1997; 212: 46-60PubMed Google Scholar). Several proteins with C-terminal Lys have been reported to be plasminogen receptors (e.g.α-enolase (53Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 54Redlitz A. Fowler B.J. Plow E.F. Miles L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), annexin II (55Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and TIP49a (56Hawley S.B. Tamura T.A. Miles L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar)). However, it is not likely that this recognition mechanism is involved in angiostatin binding to αvβ3, since neither the αv nor the β3 subunit has any known C-terminal Lys residues. We have shown that angiostatin has the characteristics of an integrin ligand as described above. It is likely that the potential αvβ3-binding site in angiostatin overlaps the Lys-binding site. Interestingly, plasminogen did not support αvβ3 binding (and does not show anti-angiogenic activity), but it does bind to Lys-affinity resin. It is likely that the integrin-binding sites in plasminogen are cryptic and are exposed when the kringle domains are cleaved by proteolysis. Thus, further characterization of integrin-binding sites within the kringle domains may be required to determine how angiostatin interacts with integrins and how the Lys-binding and integrin-binding sites are related. It has been recently reported that αv and α5 integrins are important targets for endostatin function on endothelial cells (57Rehn M. Veikkola T. Kukk-Valdre E. Nakamura H. Ilmonen M. Lombardo C. Pihlajaniemi T. Alitalo K. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Several non-collagenous domains from collagen type IV (canstatin, arrestin, and tumstatin) have been reported to have anti-angiogenic activity (18Shahan T.A. Ziaie Z. Pasco S. Fawzi A. Bellon G. Monboisse J.C. Kefalides N.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4584-4590PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y. Mier J.W. Sukhatme V.P.

Brooks P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8051-8061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). They have been shown to bind to several integrins including α6β1, αvβ3, and α1β1. Tumstatin (the NC1 domain of the α3 chain of type IV collagen) can interact with αv integrins in vitro (58Maeshima Y. Manfredi M. Reimer C. Holthaus K.A. Hopfer H. Chandamuri B.R. Kharbanda S. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15240-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore, several endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors appear to mediate their anti-angiogenic effects by direct or indirect interaction with integrins. It appears likely that many endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors may block angiogenesis by interfering with integrin-mediated endothelial cell adhesion/migration. Our observation that angiostatin specifically interacts with αvβ3 may therefore be highly relevant to its anti-angiogenic action and a key to elucidate the mechanism of the anti-angiogenic function of angiostatin.

They are covalently linked to a wide range of core protein families. The glycosaminoglycan chains are increasingly implicated as important regulators of many biological processes, such as cell proliferation and recognition, extracellular matrix deposition, and morphogenesis (for reviews see Refs. 1Kjellén L.

Recently, chondroitin sulfate as well as heparan sulfate have attracted much attention because they play an important role in neural network formation in the developing mammalian brain (for reviews see Refs. 4Ohhira A.

Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although a number of sulfotransferases involved in chondroitin sulfate synthesis as well as glycosyl- and sulfotransferases required for heparan sulfate synthesis have been molecularly cloned (for a review see Ref. 6Habuchi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), glycosyltransferases that are responsible for chondroitin sulfate have not been cloned except for a bacterial chondroitin synthase (7DeAngelis P.L. Padgett-McCue A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24124-24129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This lack of cloning has hampered vigorous investigation into the biological functions of this essential molecular species in mammalian systems.Sulfated glycosaminoglycans including chondroitin sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate have a linear polymer structure that is composed of repeating disaccharide units of glucuronic acid (GlcUA)1 andN-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) or of GlcUA and GlcNAc, respectively. Both chains are covalently attached to serine residues in core proteins via a unique tetrasaccharide structure, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1 (for reviews see Refs. 8Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A.

Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). In glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, the disaccharide units are formed by alternate monosaccharide addition from corresponding UDP sugars to the nonreducing end of the elongating chain (for reviews, see Refs. 9Rodén L.

Glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the repeating disaccharide region of heparin/heparan sulfate have been purified from bovine serum, and cDNA cloning has demonstrated that a single polypeptide catalyzes both GlcNAc and GlcUA transferase reactions, designated heparan sulfate polymerase, and that it is encoded by a member of the hereditary multiple exostoses gene family of tumor suppressors (11Lind T.

Lind T. Kitagawa H. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Hence, we hypothesized that analogous to human heparan sulfate polymerases, a single large polypeptide, namely chondroitin synthase with GlcAT-II and GalNAcT-II activities, would be responsible for chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis. To clone this putative human chondroitin synthase, we took advantage of the HUGE (humanunidentified gene-encoded large proteins) protein data base at the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, which was expected to cover various sets of large human proteins (>50 kDa) of hitherto unidentified functions. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a human chondroitin synthase.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a human chondroitin synthase and demonstrated that the single polypeptide possessed both GlcAT-II and GalNAcT-II activities. This feature is similar to heparan sulfate polymerases that have both GlcUA transferase and GlcNAc transferase activities (11Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol.

Recently, a chondroitin synthase with both GlcUA transferase and GalNAc transferase activities was molecularly cloned from bacteria, which produce chondroitin or chondroitin-like capsular polysaccharides (7DeAngelis P.L. Padgett-McCue A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24124-24129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Notably, however, the bacterial enzyme, composed of 965 amino acid residues, shows no homology with the human chondroitin synthase described here. In fact, a homologue of the human chondroitin synthase is absent in prokaryotes or yeast but present in higher eukaryotic species such as C. elegans or Drosophila (Fig.1), being consistent with the findings that chondroitin or chondroitin 4-sulfate is found in C. elegans and Drosophila, respectively (35Yamada S.

In addition, although the bacterial enzyme is 87% identical to the bacterial hyaluronan synthase at the nucleotide and the amino acid sequence levels, the human chondroitin synthase shows no homology with the three cloned human hyaluronan synthases. This seeming discrepancy is not unexpected, considering that the bacterial chondroitin synthase appears to be associated with plasma membranes in view of the production of capsular polysaccharides lacking core proteins, whereas vertebrate enzyme(s) are Golgi resident(s) and vertebrate chondroitin sulfate chains are covalently attached to core proteins. In view of the fact that the chondroitin synthesizing enzyme derived from bovine serum appears to have a molecular mass of 160 kDa as estimated by gel filtration (13Tsuchida K. Lind T. Kitagawa H. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the cloned enzyme may form a dimer, as has been observed for other Golgi glycosyltransferases (38Yamaguchi N. Fukuda M.N. J.

In this context, it is noteworthy that the GlcAT-II purified from chick cartilage microsomes has been reported to have a molecular mass of 80 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12Sugumaran G. Katsman M. Sunthankar P. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14399-14403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to evaluate whether it has GalNAcT-II activity as well. The cDNA probe for the human chondroitin synthase has now become available and will be a useful tool for investigating the biological functions of chondroitin sulfate, which is ubiquitously expressed and plays an indispensable role in many tissues, particularly the brain. It will also help investigating the possible association of the gene with any disease pathology.It is presently unknown why GlcAT-II and GalNAcT-II activities detected in the assays were low with polymer chondroitin and chondro-oligosaccharides as acceptor substrates (Table I). Incubation of polymer chondroitin with the recombinant chondroitin synthase in the presence of both UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GalNAc did not augment the chondroitin synthase activity (data not shown). Rather, it is possible that the recombinant chondroitin synthase might not be secreted well into the culture medium because the transfectant homogenates showed higher chondroitin synthase activity than the medium. More efforts to address this issue will be required. Besides, because the GlcUA or GalNAc incorporation into polymer chondroitin was proportional to the incubation time at least for 8 h (data not shown), the difference between the GlcUA and GalNAc transfer to polymer chondroitin (Table I) may reflect the abundance of nonreducing terminal GlcUA and GalNAc on polymer chondroitin.Characterization of the acceptor substrate specificity of the human recombinant chondroitin synthase revealed that the enzyme showed marked specificity for polymer chondroitin and chondro-oligosaccharides (TableI and II). Neither a trisaccharide linkage, Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1, nor α-thrombomodulin containing a tetrasaccharide linkage, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1, on the native core protein (16Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was used as an acceptor substrate. These findings demonstrate that the transfer of GlcUA to polymer chondroitin is mediated by GlcAT-II, distinct from the GlcAT-I that was previously cloned and was involved in the formation of the tetrasaccharide linkage GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl (24Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K. Ogawa T. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6615-6618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Additionally, the transfer of GalNAc to polymer chondroitin is mediated by GalNAcT-II, distinct from GalNAc transferase I involved in the initiation of chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis (40Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Hence, it is now clear that at least one other gene encoding GalNAc transferase I likely exists in the human genome. Thus, it should be emphasized that a single GalNAc transferase has been proposed to catalyze transferase reactions not only for chain elongation but also for chain initiation of chondroitin sulfate using the soluble enzyme system derived from serum-free culture medium of the human melanoma cell line (41Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357PubMed Google Scholar). Both reactions are greatly stimulated by the α-thrombomodulin core protein, which appears to be recognized by the putative chondroitin synthase. In contrast, the chondroitin sulfate-synthesizing enzyme system that was highly purified from bovine serum had GalNAcT-II and GlcAT-II activities but no GalNAc transferase I activity, even when α-thrombomodulin was used as an acceptor (13Tsuchida K. Lind T. Kitagawa H. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Hence, the chondroitin synthase identified here seems to be similar to or identical to the serum enzyme rather than the melanoma enzyme, which possibly possesses three enzyme activities: GalNAcT-II, GlcAT-II, and GalNAc transferase I. Indeed, data base searches yielded two other human genes that are homologous to the chondroitin synthase gene and had weak but significant sequence similarities and a conserved DXD motif, 2T. Uyama, H. Kitagawa, and K. Sugahara, unpublished results. suggesting that a few more enzymes may be involved in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis. Characterization of the two gene products is now in progress. Chondroitin sulfate belongs to the glycosaminoglycan family and occurs as proteoglycans that are expressed on the surface of most cells and in extracellular matrices. They are covalently linked to a wide range of core protein families. The glycosaminoglycan chains are increasingly implicated as important regulators of many biological processes, such as cell proliferation and recognition, extracellular matrix deposition, and morphogenesis (for reviews see Refs. 1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 2Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U.

Recently, chondroitin sulfate as well as heparan sulfate have attracted much attention because they play an important role in neural network formation in the developing mammalian brain (for reviews see Refs. 4Ohhira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholarand 5Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although a number of sulfotransferases involved in chondroitin sulfate synthesis as well as glycosyl- and sulfotransferases required for heparan sulfate synthesis have been molecularly cloned (for a review see Ref. 6Habuchi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), glycosyltransferases that are responsible for chondroitin sulfate have not been cloned except for a bacterial chondroitin synthase (7DeAngelis P.L. Padgett-McCue A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24124-24129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This lack of cloning has hampered vigorous investigation into the biological functions of this essential molecular species in mammalian systems. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans including chondroitin sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate have a linear polymer structure that is composed of repeating disaccharide units of glucuronic acid (GlcUA)1 andN-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) or of GlcUA and GlcNAc, respectively. Both chains are covalently attached to serine residues in core proteins via a unique tetrasaccharide structure, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1 (for reviews see Refs. 8Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier, New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar and 9Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). In glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, the disaccharide units are formed by alternate monosaccharide addition from corresponding UDP sugars to the nonreducing end of the elongating chain (for reviews, see Refs. 9Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar and 10Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the repeating disaccharide region of heparin/heparan sulfate have been purified from bovine serum, and cDNA cloning has demonstrated that a single polypeptide catalyzes both GlcNAc and GlcUA transferase reactions, designated heparan sulfate polymerase, and that it is encoded by a member of the hereditary multiple exostoses gene family of tumor suppressors (11Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In contrast, although GlcUA transferase II (GlcAT-II) and GalNAc transferase II (GalNAcT-II) that are involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate disaccharide units have been extensively purified from chick cartilage (12Sugumaran G. Katsman M. Sunthankar P. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14399-14403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and fetal bovine serum (13Tsuchida K. Lind T. Kitagawa H.

These findings demonstrate that the transfer of GlcUA to polymer chondroitin is mediated by GlcAT-II, distinct from the GlcAT-I that was previously cloned and was involved in the formation of the tetrasaccharide linkage GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl (24Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K. Ogawa T. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6615-6618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Additionally, the transfer of GalNAc to polymer chondroitin is mediated by GalNAcT-II, distinct from GalNAc transferase I involved in the initiation of chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis (40Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Hence, it is now clear that at least one other gene encoding GalNAc transferase I likely exists in the human genome. Thus, it should be emphasized that a single GalNAc transferase has been proposed to catalyze transferase reactions not only for chain elongation but also for chain initiation of chondroitin sulfate using the soluble enzyme system derived from serum-free culture medium of the human melanoma cell line (41Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357PubMed Google Scholar). Both reactions are greatly stimulated by the α-thrombomodulin core protein, which appears to be recognized by the putative chondroitin synthase. In contrast, the chondroitin sulfate-synthesizing enzyme system that was highly purified from bovine serum had GalNAcT-II and GlcAT-II activities but no GalNAc transferase I activity, even when α-thrombomodulin was used as an acceptor (13Tsuchida K. Lind T. Kitagawa H. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Hence, the chondroitin synthase identified here seems to be similar to or identical to the serum enzyme rather than the melanoma enzyme, which possibly possesses three enzyme activities: GalNAcT-II, GlcAT-II, and GalNAc transferase I. Indeed, data base searches yielded two other human genes that are homologous to the chondroitin synthase gene and had weak but significant sequence similarities and a conserved DXD motif, 2T.

https://openalex.org/W2032482731,"Fluid and macromolecule secretion by submucosal glands in mammalian airways is believed to play an important role in airway defense and surface liquid homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis. Immunocytochemistry revealed strong expression of aquaporin water channel AQP5 at the luminal membrane of serous epithelial cells in submucosal glands throughout the mouse nasopharynx and upper airways and AQP4 at the contralateral basolateral membrane in some glands. Novel methods were applied to measure secretion rates and composition of gland fluid in wild type mice and knockout mice lacking AQP4 or AQP5. In mice breathing through a tracheotomy, total gland fluid output was measured from the dilution of a volume marker present in the fluid-filled nasopharynx and upper trachea. Pilocarpine-stimulated fluid secretion was 4.3 +/- 0.4 microl/min in wild type mice, 4.9 +/- 0.9 microl/min in AQP4 null mice, and 1.9 +/- 0.3 microl/min in AQP5 null mice (p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained when secreted fluid was collected in the oil-filled nasopharyngeal cavity. Real-time video imaging of fluid droplets secreted from individual submucosal glands near the larynx in living mice showed a 57 +/- 4% reduced fluid secretion rate in AQP5 null mice. Analysis of secreted fluid showed a 2.3 +/- 0.2-fold increase in total protein in AQP5 null mice and a smaller increase in [Cl(-)], suggesting intact protein and salt secretion across a relatively water impermeable epithelial barrier. Submucosal gland morphology and density did not differ significantly in wild type versus AQP5 null mice. These results indicate that AQP5 facilitates fluid secretion in submucosal glands and that the luminal membrane of gland epithelial cells is the rate-limiting barrier to water movement. Modulation of gland AQP5 expression or function might provide a novel approach to treat hyperviscous gland secretions in cystic fibrosis and excessive fluid secretions in infectious or allergic bronchitis/rhinitis."

We have recently shown that the mammalian polo-like kinase, Plk1, is inhibited in response to DNA damage and that this inhibition may lead to cell cycle arrests at multiple points in mitosis. Here we have investigated the role of the checkpoint kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) in DNA damage-induced inhibition of Plk1. We show that inhibition of Plk1 kinase activity is efficiently blocked by the radio-sensitizing agent caffeine. Using ATM−/− cells we show that under certain circumstances, inhibition of Plk1 by DNA-damaging agents critically depends on ATM. In addition, we show that UV radiation also causes inhibition of Plk1, and we present evidence that this inhibition is mediated by ATR.

Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). One such checkpoint is the G2DNA damage checkpoint, preventing mitotic entry when DNA is damaged (2O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This checkpoint is highly conserved from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to mammalian cells and requires the function of a family of checkpoint kinases that share homology with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In yeast, this family of checkpoint kinases is comprised of scTel1, scMec1, spTel1, and spRad3 (2O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The mammalian checkpoint kinases that belong to this family are ATM, the gene mutated in ataxia telangiectasia, and ATR (ATM- andRad3-related). The ATM kinase plays a very important role in the linkage of DNA damage detecting and the induction of a subsequent cell cycle arrest. This is illustrated by the fact that ataxia telangiectasia cells were described to be defective for the G1, S, and G2-M checkpoints (3Beamish H. Lavin M.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 65: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Also, ataxia telangiectasia patients show extreme sensitivity to radiation and increased predisposition to tumor formation. In the DNA damage checkpoint, activation of ATM has been shown to result in the activation of other checkpoint kinases, such as Chk1 and Chk2/hCds1 (4Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar,5Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). At least for Chk2, this was shown to occur through direct phosphorylation by ATM in vivo (6Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In addition, ATM was also shown to be responsible for damage-induced phosphorylation of p53, MDM-2, BRCA1, and NBS1 (7Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar, 8Cortez D. Wang Y.

Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). Thus, ATM appears to sit at the top of the checkpoint signaling cascades that trigger cell cycle arrests in response to DNA damage. The cell cycle arrest that is provoked when the G2 DNA damage pathway is activated is achieved at least in part by inhibition of the cyclin B·cdc2 complex (12Rhind N. Furnari B. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 13Jin P. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Activation of this complex is critically required to enter mitosis, and this activation is brought about via dephosphorylation of cdc2, which is mediated by the Cdc25C phosphatase (14Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A. Cell. 1991; 67: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 15Gautier J. Solomon M.J. Booher R.N. Bazan J.F. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 197-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). This dual specificity phosphatase is the target of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint, and dephosphorylation of Tyr15 on cdc2 is efficiently impaired when DNA is damaged (16Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Cdc25C was suggested to be achieved by phosphorylation of Cdc25C by the serine/threonine kinases Chk1 and Chk2 (5Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 17Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Cdc25C by Chk1 or Chk2 subsequently inhibits cyclin B·cdc2 activation (18Furnari B. Blasina A. Boddy M.N. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 19Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). In contrast to the inhibitory phosphorylation by Chk1 and Chk2, Cdc25C also requires phosphorylation to become activated. Activating phosphorylation is thought to require both cyclin B·cdc2 complexes and the action of Polo-like kinases (Plks) (20Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Because depletion of Plx1, the Xenopus homologue of Polo-like kinases, from oocyte extracts, results in a block of Cdc25C activation, an essential role for Plks in the initiation of the activation-loop of Cdc25C has been suggested (22Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Recently, Plks were also shown to be regulated in response to DNA damage. Cdc5, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of Plk, was shown to be post-translationally modified in response to DNA damage (23Cheng L. Hunke L. Hardy C.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7360-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cdc5 appeared to act downstream of Rad53, the S. cerevisiae homologue of Chk2, because a loss-of-function mutant of Cdc5 could revert a Rad53 defect, and overexpression of Cdc5 resulted in a DNA damage checkpoint override (24Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that the mammalian Polo-like kinase, Plk1, is also a target of the G2-M DNA damage checkpoint (25Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the role of the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases in the inhibition of Plk1 by DNA damage. We show that inhibition of Plk1 occurs in an ATM-dependent fashion but that under certain conditions ATR can also signal inhibition of Plk1. Moreover, the data presented here demonstrate that Plk1 is also inhibited by UV irradiation, in addition to the DNA-damaging agents described previously. The human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and the ATM−/− (ATBR1 and GM05849) and ATM+/+(GM00498) fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. ATM−/− (GM05849) and ATM+/+ (GM00498) fibroblasts were purchased from the Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ). Media for all cell lines were supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To inflict DNA damage with adriamycin, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of adriamycin in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 1 h and subsequently extensively washed. For bleomycin treatment, the cells were washed twice with PBS1 containing 1 mm CaCl2 and permeabilized with 4 μg/ml ofl-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in PBS-CaCl2 for 2 min. Subsequently, the cells were treated with indicated concentrations of bleomycin for 30 min. LPC alone was taken along as a control. After treatment, the cells were extensively washed. Mouse monoclonal anti-MPM-2 and rabbit polyclonal anti-plk-1 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin B1 and protein A/G-agarose were from Santa Cruz. Protein A-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was from Becton Dickinson. Histone H1 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Adriamycin, bleomycin, LPC, wortmannin, caffeine, nocodazole, propidium iodide, and dephosphorylated α-casein were from Sigma. For Plk1 kinase assays, the cells were lysed in E1A lysis buffer (ELB, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 kallikrein-inactivating units of aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate) for 1 h at 4 °C. Total cell lysate was incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads and anti-Plk1 for overnight immunoprecipitation. Protein A-Sepharose beads were extensively washed, and subsequently kinase reactions were performed in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF) in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml dephosphorylated α-casein, 10 μm ATP, and 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. For cyclin B-associated kinase reactions, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 kallikrein-inactivating units of aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate). 5 μg of total cell lysate, in the presence of protein A/G-Sepharose and anti-cyclin B, was used for overnight immunoprecipitations. Protein A/G-Sepharose beads plus were extensively washed, and subsequently kinase reactions were performed in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 10 μg of histone H1, 50 μm ATP, and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The cells were fixed in 70% ethanol for 2 h at 4 °C. Ethanol was washed away with PBS, and subsequently the cells were incubated with anti-MPM-2 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Then the cells were washed with PBS and subsequently incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C, protected from light. Next, the cells were washed with PBS and then were incubated with RNase (0.25 mg/ml) and propidium iodide for 15 min at 37 °C. DNA content and MPM-2 positivity were analyzed using flow cytometry using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). To investigate the role of ATM in Plk1 regulation, we examined the influence of the radio-sensitizing agent caffeine on DNA damage-induced inhibition of Plk1. Work from a number of laboratories has shown that the radio-sensitizing effect of caffeine is due to specific inhibition of the ATM/ATR checkpoint kinases (26Blasina A. Price B.D. Turenne G.A. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1135-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 27Hall-Jackson C.A. Cross D.A. Morrice N. Smythe C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10342-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Because we had obtained data that indicated that the damage-induced inhibition of Plk1 was reverted by the addition of caffeine (25Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate the involvement of ATM/ATR and the effects of caffeine in more detail. As shown in Fig. 1, the activity of Plk1 is high in U2OS cells trapped in mitosis with the microtubuli-destabilizing drug nocodazole, but this activity is severely inhibited by the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin, consistent with our previous findings. The addition of caffeine completely prevented DNA damage-induced Plk1 inhibition (Fig. 1 a), suggesting a role for ATM and/or ATR in the effects of DNA damage on Plk1. To extend these findings, we investigated the effects of adriamycin and caffeine on mitotic entry in the presence of DNA-damaging agents. To this end, we analyzed the appearance of the MPM-2 phospho-epitope. The monoclonal anti-MPM-2 antibody recognizes mitosis-specific phospho-epitopes and thus can be used to specifically detect mitotic cells (30Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Cells trapped in mitosis with nocodazole showed high MPM-2 positivity, whereas adriamycin-treated cells showed a loss of MPM-2 positivity (Fig. 1 b), consistent with a block in mitotic entry. However, caffeine was able to fully rescue this effect of DNA damage, because a full restoration of the MPM-2 positivity was observed in the presence of DNA-damaging agents. These data demonstrate that caffeine can drive a very efficient checkpoint escape in these cells and suggest that inhibition of Plk1 by DNA damage depends on the ATM and/or ATR kinases. To distinguish between ATM and ATR as an upstream regulator of Plk1 activity, the activity of Plk1 was examined in fibroblast cell lines lacking functional ATM, derived from different AT patients. Indeed, we observed a clear difference in inhibition of Plk1 kinase activity in response to the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin in both ATM−/− cell lines compared with their normal counterparts (Fig. 2 a). Whereas Plk1 activity was inhibited very efficiently in the ATM+/+ cells using 0.25 μm adriamycin, no significant inhibition was seen at this concentration of adriamycin in the ATM−/−cells. This firmly supports a role for ATM in the DNA damage-induced inhibition of Plk1 activity. To further strengthen these conclusions, the effects of another radiomimetic agent, bleomycin, were examined (Fig. 2 b). Bleomycin was added in combination with LPC to facilitate the uptake of bleomycin (31Balajee A.S. Geard C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similar to the effects of adriamycin, bleomycin efficiently blocked Plk1 activity in ATM+/+ cells, whereas with ATM−/− cells a reduced inhibition of Plk1 was observed. In both these cases, the addition of LPC alone did not affect Plk1 activity (data not shown). Next, we investigated whether the observed inhibition of Plk1 correlated with a similar inhibition pattern of cyclin B/cdc2 kinase activity (Fig. 2 c). Whereas asynchronous cells showed low cyclin B-associated kinase activity, these levels were strongly elevated when cells were blocked in mitosis using nocodazole. As expected, DNA damage resulted in a loss of cyclin B/cdc2 kinase activity. This effect, however, was clearly rescued by caffeine, similar to the effect of caffeine on Plk1 kinase activity. Moreover, inhibition of cyclin B/cdc2 kinase activity by adriamycin showed a similar dependence on ATM, as demonstrated by a lack of inhibition in ATM−/− cells (Fig. 2 c). A similar difference in checkpoint response in ATM−/− versusATM+/+ cells was also seen at the level of mitotic entry in these cells (Fig. 2 d). In ATM+/+ cells, we observed a 97% inhibition in mitotic entry in the presence of adriamycin, whereas this effect was fully overcome by the addition of caffeine. In contrast, in ATM−/− cells, the addition of adriamycin could only reduce mitotic entry by 13%. We subsequently tested the effect of higher doses of adriamycin with respect to Plk1 inhibition in ATM−/− cells to explore a possible difference in dose response. Interestingly, higher doses of adriamycin did result in inhibition of Plk1 activity in ATM−/− cells (Fig.3 a), without affecting its expression levels (data not shown). Thus, high levels of DNA damage can result in ATM-independent inhibition of Plk1, indicating that other checkpoint kinases could also be involved. We noted, however, that Plk1 inhibition at high doses of adriamycin in ATM−/− cells was fully rescued by the addition of caffeine (Fig. 3 b), suggesting that the ATM-related kinase, ATR, was responsible for this inhibition. This would suggest that, in addition to ATM, ATR could also trigger inhibition of Plk1 under certain conditions. Different reports have shown that ATM is predominantly activated in response to ionizing radiation. For instance, activation of the checkpoint kinase Chk2 is observed in response to ionizing radiation only when functional ATM is present (6Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K.

Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J.

ATM and ATR share a substrate specificity for different proteins that are involved in cell cycle control, among which are BRCA1, p53, and Chk2 (6Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K.

For these proteins, activation upon ionizing radiation is dependent on ATM, whereas ATR is most likely responsible for UV-mediated activation. To further investigate whether ATR can also regulate Plk1 kinase activity, we decided to investigate the influence of UV treatment on Plk1. As is shown in Fig.4 a, UV irradiation of ATM+/+ cells results in an efficient inhibition of Plk1 kinase activity. Moreover, UV radiation causes a similar inhibition in Plk1 activity in ATM−/− cells, demonstrating that UV-mediated inhibition can occur in an ATM-independent fashion. UV-mediated inhibition of Plk1 is not due to an effect on Plk1-expression but rather due to a reduction in Plk1 enzymatic activity (Fig. 4 a). It should be noted that UV irradiation is not as efficient as adriamycin in inhibiting Plk1 in ATM+/+ cells. This could be due to the fact that adriamycin may activate both ATR and ATM, whereas UV only activates ATR, and subsequently gives rise to partial inhibition. Alternatively, it could reflect a difference in the ability of ATM and ATR to inhibit Plk1. To pinpoint the UV-mediated inhibition of Plk1 to ATR, we examined the effects of caffeine on Plk1 activity after UV treatment of ATM−/− cells (Fig. 4 b). Whereas UV-treated ATM−/− cells showed a clear inhibition in Plk1 kinase activity, the addition of caffeine completely rescued this effect, confirming the role of ATR in regulating Plk1 activity. We also examined the effects of wortmannin on ATM/ATR-mediated Plk1 inhibition. Wortmannin has been shown to potently inhibit ATM function but is far less efficient in inhibiting ATR function, when added to cells in culture (37Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). Wortmannin indeed clearly rescues the inhibitory effects of adriamycin on Plk1 activity in ATM+/+ cells; however, no clear effects on UV-induced inhibition of Plk1 activity were observed after UV treatment in A-T cells (Fig. 4 b), consistent with a role for ATM in regulating Plk1 activity in response to radiomimetic drugs. When we next assayed the block to mitotic entry, the observed pattern of inhibition by UV irradiation was similar to that of Plk1 activity (Fig. 4 c). Mitotic entry was blocked by UV radiation in ATM−/− and ATM+/+ cells, as determined by the reduction in MPM-2 positivity. Thus, inhibition of Plk1 correlates well with the block in mitotic entry seen in these cells. In this respect, it is important to note that Plk1 is also inhibited by adriamycin and UV radiation in cells that are blocked in mitosis (Fig. 4 d). Therefore, the effects of adriamycin and UV radiation on Plk1 activity are also seen in cells that have passed the G2 DNA damage checkpoint, demonstrating that inhibition of Plk1 is not an indirect consequence of a DNA damage-induced G2 arrest. Also, this indicates that DNA damage checkpoints are also active at later stages of mitosis, consistent with what we described previously (25Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The results shown here indicate that the inhibition of Plk1 kinase activity, which is seen when the DNA damage checkpoint is activated, requires functional ATM kinase: 1) because the inhibition can be rescued by the addition of caffeine, shown to interfere with the function of ATM and 2) because we were able to show that Plk1 inhibition by the radiomimetic agents adriamycin and bleomycin was impaired in cells lacking functional ATM. Only at very high doses of adriamycin we did observe a partial inhibition of Plk1 activity in ATM−/− cells. We speculate that this is due to activation of ATR under these circumstances, because the inhibition could be rescued by caffeine. Indeed, using UV irradiation to specifically activate ATR, and not ATM, we found that Plk1 was also inhibited. UV-induced inhibition of Plk1 occurred in ATM−/− and ATM+/+ cells, clearly demonstrating that UV irradiation can inhibit Plk1 in an ATM-independent fashion. Furthermore, the UV-mediated inhibition of Plk1 activity in ATM−/− cells was efficiently rescued by caffeine, a potent inhibitor of ATM/ATR. When UV-treated cells were incubated with wortmannin, a rescue of Plk1 activity was not observed. This is in good agreement with the inefficient inhibitory effects of wortmannin on ATR in vivothat was shown by others (37Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our results show that Plk1 can be regulated in an ATM- or ATR-dependent way in response to DNA damage and that the type of damage determines which one of these checkpoint kinases will be utilized. Because Plk1 was shown to function at different stages of mitosis, it would be very interesting to study at which stages of mitosis ATM and ATR can exert their checkpoint function and whether ATM or ATR can directly inhibit Plk1 activity. BRCA-1, p53, and Chk2, are phosphorylated on residues in so-called SQ/TQ cluster domains by ATM (6Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because Plk1 does not contain such a SQ/TQ cluster domain, we suggest that inhibition of Plk1 by ATM and ATR probably requires yet other checkpoint kinases, such as Chk1 or Chk2. We thank Dr. R.

https://openalex.org/W2055544911,"In developing muscle, synapse elimination reduces the number of motor axons that innervate each postsynaptic cell. This loss of connections is thought to be a consequence of axon branch trimming. However, branch retraction has not been observed directly, and many questions remain, such as: do all motor axons retract branches, are eliminated branches withdrawn synchronously, and are withdrawing branches localized to particular regions? To address these questions, we used transgenic mice that express fluorescent proteins in small subsets of motor axons, providing a unique opportunity to reconstruct complete axonal arbors and identify all the postsynaptic targets. We found that, during early postnatal development, each motor axon loses terminal branches, but retracting branches withdraw asynchronously and without obvious spatial bias, suggesting that local interactions at each neuromuscular junction regulate synapse elimination."

This relies on the formation of specialized plasma membrane domains, the sealing zone and the ruffled border, and vectorial transportation of intracellular vesicles in bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Here we show that Rab7, a small GTPase that is associated with late endosomes, is highly expressed and is predominantly localized at the ruffled border in bone-resorbing osteoclasts. The decreased expression of Rab7 in cultured osteoclasts by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides disrupted the polarization of the osteoclasts and the targeting of vesicles to the ruffled border. These impairments caused a significant inhibition of bone resorption in vitro. The results indicate that the late endocytotic pathway is involved in the osteoclast polarization and bone resorption and underscore the importance of Rab7 in osteoclast function."

Using in vitro splicing assays, we have shown that TIA-1 is directly involved in activating the 5′ splice sites of the TIAR alternative exons. Activation requires a downstream U-rich stretch of at least 10 residues. Our results confirm that TIA-1 activates 5′ splice sites followed by U-rich sequences and show that TIAR exerts a similar activity.

The process of splicing then eliminates the introns and joins adjacent exons together (1Sharp P.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). This requires precise recognition of exons and introns on the pre-mRNA, but it is not yet clear how this is achieved. Splice sites marking exon-intron junctions have specific sequence characteristics necessary for recruiting some spliceosome components: U1 snRNP at the 5′ splice site (5′ss)1 and U2AF and U2 snRNP close to the 3′ splice site (3′ss), for example (for reviews, see Refs. 1Sharp P.A.

However, additional proteins acting through exon or intron sequences distinct from the splice sites are often required for correct splice site use, particularly, but not only, in alternative splicing (for reviews, see Refs. 4Graveley B.R.

One of these sequences, IAS1, is U-rich and lies immediately downstream from the exon's 5′ss, suggesting that the protein that binds to it could interact directly with U1 snRNP bound to the adjacent 5′ss. Nam8p is one of several yeast U1 snRNP proteins that have no counterparts in mammalian U1 snRNP (15Gottschalk A. Tang J. Puig O. Salgado J. Neubauer G. Colot H.V. Mann M. Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Luhrmann R. Fabrizio P. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 374-393PubMed Google Scholar). Nam8p binds to nonconserved sequences downstream from 5′ss in yeast commitment complexes (16Puig O. Gottschalk A. Fabrizio P. Seraphin B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Zhang D. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This interaction can be important for use of some 5′ss and is most effective if the downstream sequences are U-rich (16Puig O. Gottschalk A. Fabrizio P. Seraphin B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These observations led to the suggestion that a mammalian protein functionally equivalent to Nam8p might activate weak 5′ss followed by U-rich sequences, such as the 5′ss of the K-SAM exon. The closest mammalian relatives of Nam8p are a pair of related proteins, TIA-1 (18Tian Q. Streuli M. Saito H. Schlossman S.F. Anderson P. Cell. 1991; 67: 629-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and TIAR (19Kawakami A. Tian Q. Duan X. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Martinez C. Granneman S. Seraphin B. Anderson P. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) have recently shown that TIA-1 is a splicing regulator. Splicing of the Drosophila melanogaster msl-2 pre-mRNA using a particular 5′ss followed by a U-rich sequence requires TIA-1 in vitro, to promote binding of U1 snRNP (26Forch P. Puig O. Kedersha N. Martinez C. Granneman S. Seraphin B. Anderson P. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In transient transfection assays, increasing TIA-1 levels in cells stimulates use of the FGFR-2 K-SAM exon 5′ss, and this depends on the U-rich IAS1 motif (11Del Gatto-Konczak F. Bourgeois C.F. Le Guiner C. Kister L. Gesnel M.C. Stevenin J. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6287-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), while decreasing TIA-1 levels change the 3′ss chosen for splicing to the 5′ss of thefas gene exon 5, which is followed by a U-rich sequence (26Forch P. Puig O. Kedersha N. Martinez C. Granneman S. Seraphin B. Anderson P. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These experiments linked TIA-1 to splicing. This was an important finding, as until recently, only one other non-SR protein capable of positively influencing alternative splicing, the CUG-binding protein (27Philips A.V. Timchenko L.T. Cooper T.A. Science. 1998; 280: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), was known. Relatively little is known about the recently discovered splicing regulators like TIA-1. One important question remaining to be answered is: can TIA-1 activate splicing of pre-mRNA transcribed from a normal, endogenous, chromosome-carried gene? This is not a trivial question, for a number of reasons. It is becoming increasingly clear that splicing and transcription may not be completely independent processes. Splicing factors may be delivered to splice sites during transcription (28Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and promoter swapping experiments (29Cramer P. Caceres J.F. Cazalla D. Kadener S. Muro A.F. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 251-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) have shown that splicing of an exon can depend on the promoter used for its transcription. The C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II could even help exon definition (30Zeng C. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8290-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This transcriptional link could clearly be important for splicing regulation, but might not be taken adequately into account in in vitro splicing tests nor in transient transfection assays using only portions of genes under control of heterologous promoters. Characterizing the effect of TIA-1 on splicing of endogenous pre-mRNAs is thus important. Another point to be cleared up concerns the sequence motifs through which TIA-1 can act. The mammalian K-SAM exon and fasexon 5 5′ss identified as possible targets for TIA-1 are followed by U-rich sequences. However, these particular splice sites were chosen to be tested for the effect of TIA-1 precisely because they were followed by U-rich sequences. This choice was motivated by the similarity of TIA-1 to Nam8p and the identification of sequences containing runs of U as good TIA-1 binding sites by the SELEX approach (31Dember L.M. Kim N.D. Liu K.Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2783-2788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It is quite possible, however, that TIA-1 will activate splicing through other sequence motifs. A sequence-independent approach to searching for 5′ss activable by TIA-1 was needed to investigate this possibility. We set out to address the points described above by testing the effect of increasing the levels of TIA-1 on the splicing of a number of endogenous pre-mRNAs. As there was no data available on the possible involvement in splicing of the TIA-1-related protein TIAR, we tested TIA-1 and TIAR in parallel. While neither protein has any significant effect on splicing of several endogenous pre-mRNAs tested, both proteins exert a similar effect on splicing of TIA-1 and TIAR pre-mRNAs, activating specifically the splicing of novel TIA-1 and TIAR gene alternative exons. All the exons have 5′ss which are followed by U-rich sequences. Our results thus validate previousin vitro and transient transfection work on TIA-1, as well as identifying TIAR as a similar splicing regulator. In as far as splicing of the novel exons leads to mRNAs with premature termination codons, our results also suggest that the TIA-1 and TIAR genes are under negative feedback regulation.

The migration of input RNA is shown (pre-mRNA), as well as the migrations of spliced RNAs using the DTIAR 5′ss (DTIAR/A), or the adenoviral D2 5′ss (D2/A) or the cryptic 5′ss (cryptic mRNA). The starindicates RNA resulting from premature termination of transcription in the U-rich stretch downstream from the TIAR 5′ss.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We wanted to determine whether TIA-1 overexpression has an effect on the splicing of endogenous pre-mRNAs. To this end, we cotransfected 293-EBNA cells with a TIA-1 expression vector (pTIA-1) and pHook-1, an expression vector for a cell surface-displayed, single-chain antibody. pTIA-1-transfected cells have an ∼10-fold overexpression of TIA-1 (data not shown) and can be recovered using hapten-coated magnetic beads. For control experiments, we replaced pTIA-1 either by the expression vector phnRNP C, which codes for hnRNP C1, another protein binding to U-rich sequences, or by the empty expression vector pCI-neo. RNA from recovered cells was analyzed by RT-PCR, using primers from several different genes whose pre-mRNAs are known to undergo alternative splicing. The FGFR-2 gene contains several alternative exons, some of which are shown in Fig. 1. The K-SAM (S) and BEK (B) exons are mutually exclusive exons. 293-EBNA cells normally splice the BEK exon (11Del Gatto-Konczak F. Bourgeois C.F. Le Guiner C. Kister L. Gesnel M.C. Stevenin J. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6287-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) between exons 7 and 8. We have shown previously (11Del Gatto-Konczak F. Bourgeois C.F. Le Guiner C. Kister L. Gesnel M.C. Stevenin J. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6287-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) that in 293-EBNA cells TIA-1 overexpression, but not hnRNP C overexpression, activated splicing of the FGFR-2 gene K-SAM exon in pre-mRNA from a transiently transfected minigene. This led to splicing of the K-SAM exon to the BEK exon. As expected, in cells transfected with pCI-neo or the hnRNP C expression vector, the endogenous pre-mRNA was spliced using the BEK exon: the RT-PCR products observed using primers in exons 7 and 8 (Fig.2, lanes 1–3 for pCI-neo andlanes 4–6 for phnRNP C) corresponded to the R2-B product whose structure is shown in Fig. 1. Note that the BEK and K-SAM exons can be distinguished by restriction enzyme mapping: the BEK exon contains an HpaI site (H in Fig. 1), while the K-SAM exon contains an AvaI site (A in Fig. 1). In cells transfected with the TIA-1 expression vector, a very small amount of product R2-SB (Fig. 1) corresponding to splicing of the K-SAM exon to the BEK exon was observed (Fig. 2, lane 7) in addition to the R2-B product. Thus TIA-1 overexpression does not lead to significant activation of K-SAM exon splicing on the endogenous pre-mRNA, while such overexpression does activate K-SAM exon splicing on pre-mRNA from a transiently transfected minigene (see Fig. 8 in Ref. 11Del Gatto-Konczak F.

While one possible explanantion for this difference is that TIA-1 is not involved in splicing of the endogenous FGFR-2 pre-mRNA, there are other possible explanations. For example, K-SAM exon splicing is repressed in cells that normally splice the BEK exon (13Del Gatto F. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2017-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If this repression is more effective on pre-mRNA transcribed from the endogenous gene, TIA-1 overexpression could tip the balance in favor of K-SAM exon splicing from transiently transfected minigene pre-mRNA, but not from endogenous pre-mRNA.Figure 2Effect of TIA-1 or hnRNP C1 overexpression on splicing of some endogenous pre-mRNAs. 293-EBNA cells were cotransfected with pHook-1 and either an empty expression vector (pCI-neo), a TIA-1 expression vector (pTIA-1), or an hnRNP C1 expression vector (phnRNP C). Transfected cells were recovered and RT-PCR carried out on RNA purified from them using the primers shown in Fig. 1. RT-PCR products are identified by names introduced in Fig. 1. For the FGFR-2 gene, two primer pairs were used (1-7 and 7-8). RT-PCR products obtained using primer pair 7-8 were not digested (0) or digested byHpaI (H) and AvaI (A) to test for BEK or K-SAM exon splicing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Exons 3 and 4 of the FGFR-2 gene are optional exons. When primers in exons 1 and 7, as shown in Fig. 1, were used to test for splicing of exons 3 and 4, three RT-PCR products were obtained from cells transfected with the control vector pCI-neo (Fig. 2, lane 10). These products (for structures, see Fig. 1) are R2, representing splicing of exons 3 and 4; Δ3, representing skipping of exon 3; and Δ34, representing skipping of both exons 3 and 4. Neither hnRNP C nor TIA-1 overexpression had any significant effect on the relative amounts of these products (compare lanes 11 and12 with lane 10). The CD44 gene contains 10 alternative exons, marked v1–10 in Fig. 1(35Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). In 293-EBNA cells, none of these are usually spliced, and the RT-PCR product (data not shown) obtained from untransfected cells corresponds to the H form of CD44, whose structure is shown in Fig. 1. The single RT-PCR product obtained from cells transfected with the control vector pCI-neo also corresponds to the H form (Fig. 2,lane 13). Neither hnRNP C nor TIA-1 overexpression had any significant effect on CD44 pre-mRNA splicing (compare lanes 14 and 15 with lane 13; inclusion of v exons would have resulted in the appearance of products larger than the H form). In as far as TIA-1 has been linked to apoptosis (20Tian Q. Taupin J. Elledge S. Robertson M. Anderson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 21Taupin J.L. Tian Q. Kedersha N. Robertson M. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1629-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it seemed worthwhile to analyze the effect of TIA-1 overexpression on splicing of some pre-mRNAs that code for proteins involved in apoptosis and that are known to undergo alternative splicing (36Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 64-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thebcl-x gene exon 2 has two alternative 5′ss (37Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar), allowing generation of two forms of bcl-x, -xL, and -xS (Fig. 1). Overexpression of hnRNP C or TIA-1 had no significant effect on the L/S ratio (comparelanes 17 and 18 with lane 16, Fig. 2). The caspase-9 gene contains a block of four optional exons, resulting in production of two isoforms of caspase-9 (38Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Guo Y. Zhan Y. Lazebnik Y. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 999-1002PubMed Google Scholar),9L and 9S (Fig. 1). Overexpression of hnRNP C or TIA-1 had no significant effect on the isoform ratio (comparelanes 20 and 21 with lane 19, Fig. 2). The caspase-2 (or ich-1) gene contains an optional exon (39Jiang Z.H. Zhang W.J. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), allowing generation of two forms of caspase-2,2L and 2S (Fig. 1). Once again, overexpression of hnRNP C or TIA-1 had no significant effect on the ratio of the S and L forms (compare lanes 23 and 24 with lane 22, Fig. 2). In conclusion, TIA-1 overexpression has no significant effect on splicing of the various endogenous pre-mRNAs tested above. We also analyzed the effect of TIA-1 overexpression on splicing of the TIAR pre-mRNA. The TIAR gene contains 13 exons, one of which, exon 3 (21Taupin J.L. Tian Q. Kedersha N. Robertson M. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1629-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), is optional (Fig.3A). RNA from cells transfected with pTIA-1 and selected as above was analyzed by RT-PCR using primers covering different parts of the TIAR sequence. With primers covering exons 2–8, two RT-PCR products are expected, corresponding to splicing (+3) or skipping (−3) of optional exon 3 (Fig. 3A). These were indeed observed in cells transfected with pCI-neo or phnRNP C (Fig. 3B,lanes 1 and 2, respectively; we have not identified the third, shorter product seen in lane 2). However, in cells transfected with pTIA-1, two pairs of additional products were observed (lane 3, marked α and β). They were identified by cloning and sequencing of the products, followed by comparison of the obtained sequences with that of the TIAR gene. The longer member of each pair was found to include optional exon 3, while the shorter member did not (no significant effect of TIA-1 overexpression on splicing of optional exon 3 was detected). In addition the “α” product pair includes two novel exons (6A and 6B, Fig. 3C) spliced between exons 6 and 7. In the other pair of products (β), the intron between exons 6A and 6B was retained. With primers covering exons 8–11, no effect of TIA-1 or hnRNP C overexpression was detected (a single RT-PCR product was seen; Fig.3B, lanes 4–6). With primers covering exons 11–13, one major RT-PCR product was obtained in cells transfected with pCI-neo (lane 7) or phnRNP C (lane 8), corresponding to splicing of exons 11, 12, and 13. Two minor products were also seen whose identities were elucidated by sequencing cloned fragments. One of these (marked by an asterisk in Fig. 3,A and B) corresponds to retention of the intron between exons 11 and 12. The other minor product in cells transfected with pCI-neo or phnRNP C became the major product in cells transfected with pTIA-1 (marked γ in Fig. 3B, lane 9). This product corresponds to splicing of a novel exon (11A) between exons 11 and 12 (Fig. 3C). A similar analysis was carried out to investigate the effect of TIA-1 overexpression on splicing of the TIA-1 pre-mRNA. This analysis was possible as a mouse TIA-1 cDNA was used for overexpression, while the effect of the overexpression was tested on the human TIA-1 gene. The TIA-1 gene contains 13 exons, one of which, exon 5 (40Kawakami A. Tian Q. Streuli M. Poe M. Edelhoff S. Disteche C.M. Anderson P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4937-4945PubMed Google Scholar), is optional, but spliced efficiently in 293-EBNA cells (Fig.4A)."

BK channels show considerable diversity and plasticity in their regulation by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases. The underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear but may involve expression of splice variants of the BK channel α subunit. Three isoforms, BKA, BKB, and BKC, which were cloned from tracheal smooth muscle, differed only in their C terminus. When expressed in HEK293 cells, cGMP kinase (cGK) but not cAMP kinase (cAK) stimulated the activity of BKA and BKB by shifting the voltage dependence of the channel to more negative potentials.

Mutation of this motif in BKA switched channel regulation from cGK to cAK. Furthermore, inhibition of PKC in excised patches from cells expressing BKA abolished the stimulatory effect of cGK but allowed channel stimulation by cAK. cAK and cGK phosphorylated the channel at different sites.

Alternatively, spliced mRNA transcripts and reversible protein phosphorylation of the BK channel α subunit or closely associated proteins have been shown as major mechanisms for the diversity of channel regulation by protein kinases (13Tian L.

Particularly, the large C-terminal domain of the BK channel α subunit has been suggested as the target for phosphorylation by several serine/threonine-directed kinases (14Butler A. Tsunoda S.

The molecular requirements at the BK channel level, however, that are necessary for modulation by specific cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases have not yet been resolved. Recently, phosphorylation sites for cAK (15Nara M. Dhulipala P.D. Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Biol.

Since these sites are fully conserved in all mammalian alternative splice variants known so far, regulation of BK channels via both the cGK and cAK would be expected. However, in most reports on cyclic nucleotide-dependent channel stimulation, effects from either cGK (3Stockand J.D. Sansom S.C. Am. J.

In particular, it is not clear whether cGK and cAK can substitute for each other as channel regulators, whether they have additive effects, or whether specific requirements are needed that allow distinct regulation by either kinase. The elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying BK channel regulation is even more complicated by the fact that BK channels apart from cGK and cAK are presumably modulated by additional protein kinases such as PKC (22Shipston M.J. Armstrong D.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 665-672Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and Src (21Wang J. Zhou Y. Wen H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These protein kinases may interact with each other in modifying channel activity. Thus, BK channels seem to integrate the output from several signaling cascades. With respect to channel regulation by protein kinases, it has been an important issue in recent years to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms (13Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond M.S. Coghill L.S.

In this study, we first analyzed whether distinct mRNA transcripts in tracheal smooth muscle represent the molecular basis for differential regulation of BK channel by cAK and cGK. We identified three C-terminal isoforms of the BK channel α subunit that are presumably generated by alternative splicing at cryptic intron sites within a C-terminal exon. All of the isoforms showed similar single channel conductance and Ca2+sensitivity. The presence of the C-terminal tandem phosphorylation site for PKC in two isoforms allowed stimulation of channel activity by cGK, suggesting the involvement of PKC in cGK-dependent channel regulation. However, the absence of this motif in another splice variant resulted in a loss of stimulation via cGK but led to activation by cAK. The hypothesis of phosphorylation by PKC as a prerequisite for the stimulatory effect of cGK was proved by mutation of respective serines and the use of specific PKC inhibitors. The results suggest that constitutive phosphorylation by PKC at the C terminus allows conditional activation by cGK. In turn, stimulation by cAK occurs at the dephosphorylated channel and at splice variants lacking the C-terminal PKC motif. The mechanisms identified here may contribute to the relaxation induced by NO and β2-adrenoreceptor agonists in smooth muscle. BK channel α subunits were cloned from a bovine tracheal smooth muscle oligo dT-primed cDNA library. About 800,000 clones of the library were screened with theEcoRV/HaeII fragment corresponding to the region between the S0 and S6 segment. The probe (nucleotides 400–989) was isolated from the human BK channel α subunit cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. L. Toro (GenBankTMU11058) (24Wallner M. Meera P. Ottolia M. Kaczorowski G.J. Latorre R. Garcia M.L. Stefani E. Toro L. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 185-199PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated full-length clones were sequenced and constructed into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), which directed expression of BK channel α subunits in HEK293 cells starting translation from the M1 methionine (24Wallner M. Meera P. Ottolia M. Kaczorowski G.J. Latorre R. Garcia M.L. Stefani E. Toro L. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 185-199PubMed Google Scholar). The GenBankTM accession numbers for the BK channel isoforms are AY033472 (BKA), AY033473(BKB), AY033474 (BKC). Mutants were generated by extended overlap polymerase chain reaction using the primer pairs as indicated. The resulting amplicons were digested with the given restriction enzymes and cloned into pcDNA3 containing the respective isoform of the BK channel. All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. Primer sequences are as follows (mutated bases in bold letters): BKA S1151A, M1/SP6, F8/M2, template BKA, ApaI; BKA S1154A, M3/SP6, F8/M4, template BKA, ApaI; BKA S1151A/S1154A, M5/SP6, F8/M6, template BKA, ApaI; BKA S1134A, M7/SP6, F8/M8, template BKA, ApaI; BKC S1134A, M7/SP6, F8/M8, template BKC, ApaI; BKAS1134A/S1151A/S1154A, M7/SP6, F8/M8, template BKAS1151A/S1154A, ApaI; BKA S922A/S1151A/S1154A, M9/R12, F6/M10, template BKA S1151A/S1154A,AflII and SacII.

HEK293 cells were transfected with the channel cDNA plasmids by calcium phosphate precipitation for 18 h at 35 °C and 3% CO2. The transfection efficiency varied between 40 and 70%. Macroscopic currents were recorded 48 h after transfection from inside-out patches excised from HEK293 cells by using a List EPC 7 amplifier connected via a 16-bit analog-to-digital interface to a Pentium IBM clone computer (25Hamill O.P.

Signals were filtered at 1 kHz by a 10-pole Bessel filter and sampled at 3 kHz. Data acquisition and analysis was performed with an ISO-3 patch-clamp program (MFK, Niedernhausen, Germany). The patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (fiber-filled) with a resistance of 3–4 megaohms and were filled with physiological saline solution containing 127 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 2.4 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The bath solution (cytosolic surface of the patch) contained 134 mm KCl, 6 mm NaCl, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 11 mm glucose, 3 mm dipotassium ATP, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Depending on the experiment, the free Ca2+concentration of the bath solution was changed from 0.3–10 μm by changing the Ca2+ concentration in the corresponding solution. The appropriate amounts of CaCl2were added, and the pH was adjusted according to a computer program on the basis of the binding constants of Fabiato and checked by fura 2 fluorescence (for details see Ref. 19Zhou X.-B.

Experiments with iberiotoxin (Latoxan, Rosans, France) were carried out on outside-out patches, and bath and pipette solution were opposite to those used in inside-out experiments. A multi-barreled perfusion pipette placed 200 μm away from the patch was used to switch the superfusion solution. Electrophysiological experiments were performed at 20–22 °C, the holding potential was −20 mV. Conductance (G) values were calculated as G= I/V m. Usually, each experiment was normalized by dividing G values by Gmax, whereGmax was defined as the largest Gvalue obtained in each experiment.G/Gmax voltage curves were fitted with a Boltzmann equation of the formG/Gmax = (1 + exp((V1/2 −V m)/k])−1 with the use of Origin (version 6; Microcal Software, Northampton, MA).

The cGK and cAK were applied to the membrane patches at a concentration of 300 nm. The cGK was consistently used in the presence of 10 μm cGMP. The PKC inhibitor peptide PKC19–31 was from Calbiochem and was applied at a concentration of 5 μm. The non-peptide PKC inhibitor Ro31–8220 was obtained from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany) and was used at a concentration of 1 μm. The BK channels in native tracheal smooth muscle cells show diversity in modulation by cGK and cAK (4Kume H. Takai A. Tokuno H. Tomita T.

To analyze whether additional yet unidentified mRNA transcripts code for BK channels that might be specifically regulated by either cGK or cAK, we cloned BK channel α subunits from smooth muscle tissue of bovine trachea. In total, nine full-length clones containing the M1 methionine (24Wallner M. Meera P. Ottolia M. Kaczorowski G.J. Latorre R. Garcia M.L. Stefani E. Toro L. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 185-199PubMed Google Scholar) and poly(A)+ tails of different length were isolated. In general, the bovine BK channel primary structure is identical with that from human (24Wallner M. Meera P. Ottolia M. Kaczorowski G.J. Latorre R. Garcia M.L. Stefani E. Toro L. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 185-199PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D. Krause J.D. Mertz R. Godinot N. DiChiara T.J. Reinhart P.H.

The nine clones obtained by cloning from tracheal smooth muscle consisted of three populations differing only at their C terminus (Fig. 1). Four clones of 6.1–6.6 kb were grouped into class BKA. The BKA isoform has been identified in a variety of species including human (24Wallner M. Meera P. Ottolia M. Kaczorowski G.J. Latorre R. Garcia M.L. Stefani E. Toro L. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 185-199PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D. Krause J.D. Mertz R. Godinot N. DiChiara T.J. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1315-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). One clone of 4.4 kb differed from the BKA clones in amino acids 1160–1166 at the C terminus and was classified as BKB. This clone contained a 3′-untranslated region of 0.6 kb that was different from the 3′-untranslated region of 3 kb from BKA. The BKB-specific C terminus was recently also identified in rat (GenBankTMU40603) and chicken (29Navaratnam D.S. Bell T.J. Tu T.D. Cohen E.L. Oberholtzer J.C. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1077-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Another four clones (BKC) of 3.3 kb were lacking the last 26 amino acids at the C terminus of BKA. The C-terminal sequence1137HSIP1140, which is common to all isoforms, is followed by the sequence 1141PQT1143 in BKC before the stop codon and the poly(A)+tail. BKC does not contain a 3′-untranslated region, and the poly(A) tail directly follows the stop codon. Since the analysis of the genomic structure of the BK channel in rat (30Huelsemann S. Cloning and Characterization of a Gene Coding for Ca2+-activated K+ channel.Doctoral dissertation. Cuvillier Verlag Göttingen, 1999Google Scholar) revealed a single exon encoding the C-terminal part of the BKA isoform (amino acids 1085–1166), the BKB and BKC isoforms may be generated by alternative splicing at cryptic intron splice sites within this exon. In fact, inspection of the nucleotide sequence at the junction sites reveals the presence of consensus motifs of intron 5′ donor splice sites (31Dietrich R.C. Incorvaia R. Padgett R.A. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) in BKA, namely GT at the junction of BKA to BKB (site 2 in Fig. 1 B) and AT at the junction of BKA to BKC (site 1 in Fig. 1 B). The consensus motifs GT and AT are conserved at the respective splice site in mammalian BK channel nucleotide sequences (Fig. 1 B). Apart from BKB, additional C-terminal isoforms have been identified from others that probably result from splicing at site 2 including Rat1BK, Rat2BK, and MouseBK (for details see the legend of Fig. 1 B). Thus, the GT and AT consensus motifs at sites 1 and 2 may serve as cryptic 5′ donor splice sites within the C-terminal exon. Membrane currents of nontransfected native HEK293 cells were measured in inside-out patches. Depolarizing steps from a holding potential of −20 mV to positive potentials resulted in a small outward current that showed no inactivation and exhibited no Ca2+sensitivity. The steady-state current at +80 mV was 27.1 ± 2.5 pA (n = 30). The amplitude of outward currents in HEK293 cells expressing BKA was considerably larger than in native HEK cells. Mean current amplitude obtained under steady-state conditions at +80 mV in cells expressing BKA was 1851.3 ± 176.0 pA (n = 34). Typical examples of outward currents obtained from a native and a transfected cell are shown in Fig. 2, A andB. The results demonstrate that the outward current of transfected cells was contaminated by an endogenous current component by <2%. In some inside-out patches with low channel density, single channel conductance was determined in the presence of symmetrically high potassium of 140 mm. Channel openings could be detected at membrane potentials from −60 mV to +80 mV (Fig.2 C shows an example from a cell transfected with BKA). The current-voltage relations of the three C-terminal splice variants were linear in the voltage range between −60 and +60 mV and showed reversal potentials close to 0 mV (Fig. 2 D). The mean unitary conductances were 276 ± 8.1 picosiemens (BKA; n = 6), 260 ± 12.3 picosiemens (BKB; n = 6), and 272 ± 16.3 picosiemens (BKC; n = 7). To further determine the basic channel properties of the BKCa channel isoforms, Ca2+ dependence was investigated in inside-out patches. When the Ca2+ concentration was increased from 0.3 to 10 μm, a shift to the left of the normalized conductance-voltage relations by ≈100 mV was observed (Fig.3 A). In eight patches from clones BKA and BKB and in 10 patches from clone BKC, the mean half-maximal activating voltage (V1/2) was 100 ± 5, 95 ± 5, and 113 ± 9 mV in 0.3 μm Ca2+ and 2 ± 2.1, 0 ± 5.4, and 4 ± 8 mV in 10 μmCa2+-containing solution, respectively. There was a slight increase of the slope factor between 0.3 and 1 μmCa2+ in all three isoforms, but no significant change was observed between 1 μm (BKA 16.5 ± 1.9 mV, BKB 17.4 ± 1.8 mV, BKC 16.2 ± 2.0 mV) and 10 μm Ca2+ (BKA18.8 ± 2.1 mV, BKB 20.3 ± 2.4 mV, BKC 20.6 ± 2.1 mV). By plottingV1/2 values obtained from the curves in Fig.3 A as a function of [Ca2+], a linear relation was obtained with a reduction of V1/2 by 59 ± 6.7 (BKA), 55 ± 6.5 (BKB), and 68 ± 8.3 mV (BKC) per 10-fold increase of [Ca2+] (Fig. 3 B). The difference between theV1/2 values was not statistically significant (p > 0.1). To determine the sensitivity of the BK channel isoforms to the specific peptide blocker iberiotoxin, outside-out patches in the presence of 1 μm[Ca2+] i were exposed to increasing concentrations of the toxin (Fig. 3 C). Mean half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of iberiotoxin were 5.8 ± 0.7 nm(BKA; n = 5), 5.7 ± 0.7 nm (BKB; n = 7), and 8.3 ± 2.0 nm (BKC; n = 7).Figure 3Identical Ca2+ and iberiotoxin sensitivities of BK channel isoforms expressed in HEK293 cells. A, normalized conductance-voltage relations from inside-out patches expressing BKA (n = 8), BKB (n = 8), and BKC(n = 10) isoforms. The values of membrane conductance were first normalized to the maximal value and then averaged. Each patch represents a different cell. Currents were evoked by applying a 200-ms depolarizing pulse every 5 s in 20-mV increments from a holding potential of −20 mV to ± 160 mV. After each current-voltage relation, [Ca2+] was raised stepwise from 0.3 to 10 μm. The curves represent the fits of experimental points to the Boltzmann equation. B, plot of the voltage required for half-maximal channel activation (V1/2) as a function of [Ca2+] (same data as in A). Straight lines are calculated from linear regression (r = −0.96 to −0.99). C, concentration-dependent inhibition of the BK channel current (IKCa) by iberiotoxin (IbTX) in outside-out patches. Currents were evoked by voltage steps of 200 ms from −20 to +40 mV. Means ± S.E. of five patches from BKA and of seven patches from BKB and BKC, respectively, are shown. [Ca2+] was 1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The activity of BK channels is modulated in native cells by cAK and cGK. To investigate whether the C-terminal splice variants expressed in HEK293 cells are also regulated by the kinases, either the catalytic subunit of cAK or cGK plus cGMP were applied to the cytosolic face of excised inside-out membrane patches (Fig. 4). In the presence of cGK (upper panels), a 26- and 31-mV shift to the left of the normalized conductance-voltage relation was observed in splice variants BKA (V1/2 before, 57.9 ± 5.9 mV; V1/2 after, cGK 32.2 ± 3.5 mV; n = 7) and BKB(V1/2 before, 54.8 ± 6.1 mV;V1/2 after, cGK 24.1 ± 2.8 mV;n = 8). Membrane conductance of splice variant BKC, however, did not respond significantly to cGK,V1/2 was 54.5 ± 5.8 mV before and 47.5 ± 5.1 mV after application of the kinase. Opposite to cGK, cAK (lower panels) had no significant influence on BKA (V1/2 before, 46.2 ± 5.3 mV; V1/2 after, cAK 43.7 ± 4.8 mV;n = 8) and BKB (V1/2before, 51.0 ± 5.6 mV; V1/2 after, cAK 49.4 ± 5.1 mV; n = 8) but induced a 35-mV shift to the left of the normalized conductance-voltage relation obtained from BKC (V1/2 before, 62.3 ± 6.9 mV; V1/2 after, cAK 27.8 ± 3.1 mV;n = 6). The results of Fig. 4 suggest that the C-terminal amino acids determine whether the channel is responsive to cGK or cAK. Inspection of the C terminus revealed the tandem motif RXKS 1151RX S 1154RXK (32Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for phosphorylation by PKC, which was present in BKAand BKB but not in isoform BKC (Fig.1 A). To study the possible influence of this site on the channel regulation by cGK and cAK, a mutant BKA was created in which Ser1151 and Ser1154 were replaced by alanine (S1151A/S1154A). Inside-out patches excised from HEK293 cells expressing the double mutant construct proved insensitive to stimulation by cGK but became responsive to cAK, similar as the BKC isoform with its truncated C terminus (Fig.5 A).V1/2 obtained from conductance-voltage relations was 53.6 ± 6.2 mV before (control) and 49.7 ± 5.4 mV after the application of cGK (n = 8; not significant). In contrast, cAK shifted V1/2 by 31 mV from 40.6 ± 4.3 to 9.7 ± 1.3 mV (n = 12). These results indicate that the intact putative tandem PKC motif is a prerequisite for the channel to become regulated by cGK. To evaluate whether cAK stimulated the activity of the mutant BKAisoform by phosphorylation of Ser1134, the site phosphorylated by cGK (16Alioua A. Tanaka Y. Wallner M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Meera P.

As expected, the single mutation S1134A in BKA resulted in loss of stimulation of channel activity by cGK (Fig. 5 B). The inability of cAK to activate wild-type BKA channels was unaffected by mutation S1134A (Fig. 5 B), demonstrating that the mutation of the tandem PKC site in BKA was responsible for the specific activation by cAK. Mean V1/2values in Fig. 5 B were 58.9 ± 6.1 mV (control) and 60 ± 6.3 mV (cGK; n = 6) and 48.9 ± 5.3 mV (control) and 51.0 ± 5.5 mV (cAK: n = 8). When the double mutation in BKA S1151A/S1154A was combined with the mutation S1134A, a channel was created that failed to respond to cGK (not shown) but was activated by cAK, indicating that cAK phosphorylates a different site of the BK channel than cGK (Fig.5 C). Cyclic AK produced a shift to the left by 30 mV; the mean V1/2 values were 55.8 ± 5.9 mV before and 25.4 ± 3.2 mV (n = 10) in the presence of cAK. Similarly, mutation of the cGK site S1134A in splice variant BKC had no influence on the stimulatory action of cAK;V1/2 was shifted to the left by 34 mV from 45.4 ± 5.2 mV (control) to 1.7 ± 2.2 mV in the presence of cAK (n = 6; data not shown). Since phosphorylation of Ser869 of the human BK channel has been suggested to account for the stimulatory effect of cAK (15Nara M. Dhulipala P.D. Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1977425426,"During late stages of neural development, synaptic circuitry is edited by neural activity. At neuromuscular synapses, the transition from multiple to single innervation is modulated by the relative pattern of activity among inputs competing for innervation of the same muscle fiber. While experimental perturbations of activity result in marked changes in the timing of neuromuscular synaptic competition, little is known about the patterns of activity present during normal development. Here, we report the temporal patterning of motor unit activity in the soleus muscle of awake, behaving neonatal mice, and that patterning is modulated by gap-junctional coupling. Our work suggests that neuromuscular synaptic competition is modulated by surprisingly low levels of activity and may be triggered by the disappearance of temporally correlated activity among inputs competing for innervation of the same muscle fiber."

In order to generate Swiss 3T3 cells stably overexpressing PKD, cultures of these cells were infected with retrovirus encoding murine PKD and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed as two separate proteins translated from the same mRNA. GFP was used as a marker for selection of PKD-positive cells. PKD overexpressed in Swiss 3T3 cells was dramatically activated by cell treatment with bombesin or PDBu as judged by in vitrokinase autophosphorylation assays and exogenous substrate phosphorylation.

There are multiple related PKC isoforms, which can be classified into three distinct subgroups on the basis of structural and regulatory differences as follows: the conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), which are stimulated by calcium, diacylglycerol (DAG), and phospholipids; the novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, and θ), which are activated by DAG and phospholipids; and the atypical PKCs (ζ and λ), whose regulation is less characterized but that have been proposed to be regulated by D-3 phosphoinositides (13Dekker L.V.

Despite the recognized importance of PKCs in mitogenic signal transduction, the downstream targets that mediate PKC-induced cell proliferation remain largely undefined. Protein kinase D (PKD)/protein kinase Cµ is a serine/threonine protein kinase with structural, enzymological, and regulatory properties different from the PKC family members (20Valverde A.M.

The most distinct characteristics of PKD are the presence of a catalytic domain distantly related to Ca2+-regulated kinases, a pleckstrin homology region that regulates enzyme activity, and a highly hydrophobic stretch of amino acids in its N-terminal region (22Rozengurt E.

Furthermore, cotransfection of PKD with constitutively active mutants of PKC ε and η dramatically increased the catalytic activity of PKD (24Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

These findings revealed a link between PKCs and PKD and implied that PKD lies downstream of PKCs in a novel signal transduction pathway activated by multiple growth-promoting factors (22Rozengurt E.

PKD has been implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions including EGF receptor and c-Jun signaling (44Bagowski C.P. Stein-Gerlach M. Choidas A. Ullrich A.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4440-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of PKD in neuropeptide-induced DNA synthesis and cell proliferation has not been elucidated. In the present study, we examined whether increased PKD expression potentiates the proliferative response to the GPCR agonists bombesin and vasopressin and the biologically active phorbol ester PDBu. We used high efficiency retroviral mediated transfer of PKD into Swiss 3T3 cells, a cell line that undergoes reversible arrest in the G0 phase of the cell cycle and has been used extensively as a model system to elucidate signal transduction pathways in the action of mitogenic GPCR agonists (1Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 2Rozengurt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Rozengurt E. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 21: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Our results show that PKD overexpression strikingly and selectively potentiates the stimulation of DNA synthesis and cell division induced by bombesin, vasopressin, or PDBu in Swiss 3T3 cells. These findings support the hypothesis that PKD mediates neuropeptide-induced mitogenesis in these cells. Stock cultures of untransfected and transfected Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air. For experimental purposes, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish or 35-mm dishes at 1 × 105 cells/dish and grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 7–9 days until they became confluent and quiescent (51Seufferlein T. Withers D.J. Mann D. Rozengurt E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phoenix packaging cells (kindly provided by Dr. G. Nolan, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) were cultured in the same media in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. pMSCVneo retroviral vector was engineered to include a single cassette that expresses the murine PKD and green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the same promoter. The MSCV-IRES-GFP plasmid was constructed by substituting theneo gene in the vector with the IRES-GFP fragment. PKD cDNA (spanning from position +50 to +2910, from the published GenBankTM sequence) was inserted into EcoRI site of the MSCV-IRES-GFP plasmid, upstream of IRES. This fragment of PKD cDNA, which contains all coding sequences but lacks the polyadenylation signal, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction was initiated from bipartite primers 5′-CTGGAATTCCTCCCGGAAAGTTTGGTGGTT (sense) and 5′-ATCGAATTCGTGTTTTGACAGATTAGAGG (antisense) that introducedEcoRI restriction sites at 5′- and 3′-ends of the fragment. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified PKD coding region was confirmed by sequencing which revealed the presence of A and not T at position 2172, correcting previously published data. This correction leads to the appearance of Arg rather than Trp at position 606 in the amino acid sequence of the wild-type PKD. For retrovirus production, logarithmically growing Phoenix ecotropic cells were transfected with either MSCV-PKD-IRES-GFP or MSCV-IRES-GFP using Fugene 6 Transfection Reagent as per protocol of the manufacturer. Virus-containing supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and used immediately. Logarithmically growing Swiss 3T3 cells were incubated with the virus-containing supernatants in the presence of 5 µg/ml Polybrene for 5 h. Cells were collected 48–72 h later, and GFP-positive fractions were FACS-sorted using a Becton Dickinson FACStar PLUS machine. GFP-positive cells were propagated, and multiple aliquots were frozen. A fresh batch of cells was restarted every 2 months. Following sorting, GFP-positive Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained as described above. Confluent, quiescent Swiss 3T3-GFP cells and Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells were lysed in 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and boiled for 10 min. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes as described previously (31Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and blocked by overnight incubation with 5% non-fat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.2. Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with antisera specifically recognizing either the C terminus of PKD at a dilution of 1 µg/ml or the phospho-specific pS916 antibody recognizing PKD phosphorylated at Ser916 (1:500), or the phospho-specific pS748 antibody recognizing PKD phosphorylated at Ser748 (1:500), in PBS containing 3% non-fat dried milk, or the phospho-specific pSpS744/748 antibody recognizing PKD phosphorylated at Ser744 and Ser748 (1:1000) in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Our recent results indicate that the phospho-specific pSpS744/748 antibody recognizes primarily PKD phosphorylated at Ser744 (52Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence methods. Autoradiograms were scanned using a GS-710 scanner (Bio-Rad), and the labeled bands were quantified using the Quantity One software program (Bio-Rad). Cultures of Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells, treated as described in the individual experiments, were washed and lysed in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 1% Triton X-100 (lysis buffer A). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. PKD was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2–4 h with the PA-1 antiserum (1:100), as described previously (31Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The immune complexes were recovered using protein-A coupled to agarose. The immune complexes were then washed twice with lysis buffer and then twice with kinase buffer consisting of 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Autophosphorylation reactions were initiated by combining 20 µl of immune complexes with 5 µl of a phosphorylation mixture containing 100 µm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 400–600 cpm/pmol) in kinase buffer. Following incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reactions were terminated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold kinase buffer and placed on ice. Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation, and the proteins were extracted for SDS-PAGE analysis by addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). Dried SDS-PAGE gels were subjected to autoradiography to visualize radiolabeled protein bands. For assays of exogenous substrate phosphorylation, immune complexes were processed as for autophosphorylation reactions, and then substrate (syntide-2, final concentration 2.5 mg/ml) was added in the presence of 100 µm [γ-32P]ATP (400–600 cpm/pmol) in kinase buffer (final reaction volume, 30 µl). After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reactions were terminated by adding 100 µl of 75 mm H3PO4, and 75 µl of the mixed supernatant was spotted to Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Papers were washed thoroughly in 75 mmH3PO4, dried, and radioactivity incorporated into syntide-2 was determined by detection of Cerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter. Confluent and quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells or Swiss 3T3-GFP cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with DMEM/Waymouth's medium (1:1, v/v) containing [3H]thymidine (0.2 µCi/ml, 1 µm) and various agonists as described in the figure legends. After 40 h of incubation at 37 °C, cultures were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 20 min to remove acid-soluble radioactivity, washed with ethanol, and solubilized in 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH, 0.1% SDS. The acid-insoluble radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting in 6 ml of Beckman Readysafe. Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells, Swiss 3T3-GFP cells, and untransfected Swiss 3T3 cells were seeded in 35-mm Nunc Petri dishes at a density of 2 × 104 with 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS. At day 0 (24 h after plating), cultures were washed twice with DMEM and replaced with DMEM/Waymouth's medium (1:1, v/v) containing 1% FBS and 1 µg/ml insulin (to preserve cell viability in low serum) and supplemented with bombesin, vasopressin, PDBu, or EGF, as described in the legend to Fig. 6. Cell number was determined by removing the cells from the dish with a trypsin/EDTA solution (0.5% trypsin in a Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS with EDTA) and counting a portion of the resulting cell suspension in a Coulter counter. Cell counts were obtained at day 0 (24 h after plating) and at days 3, 5, and 7 after plating. pMSCVneo retroviral vector was fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Fugene 6 Transfection Reagent was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Polybrene was from Aldrich. PD 98059, SB202190, rapamycin, wortmannin, PP-2, HA 1077, and Ro 81-3220 were from Calbiochem. Insulin, EGF, vasopressin, bombesin, PDBu, GF I (also known as GF109203X), and cytochalasin D were obtained from Sigma. [3H]Thymidine and [γ-32P]ATP (370 MBq/ml) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein A-agarose was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. PA-1 was produced as described previously (53Van Lint J.V. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). pS916 and pS748 antisera were generously provided by Dr. Doreen Cantrell, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK. Phospho-PKD/PKCµ Ser744/748antibody (catalog number 2054) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA. All other materials were of the highest grade available. In order to generate Swiss 3T3 cells stably overexpressing PKD, cultures of these cells were infected with MSCV retrovirus encoding murine PKD linked via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to GFP. This bicistronic retroviral vector expresses PKD and GFP as two separate proteins. Since transcription of both genes is driven by the same promoter, cells expressing higher levels of GFP also express higher levels of PKD. Consequently, GFP was used as a marker for selection of PKD-positive cells (termed Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells). After infection, cells expressing higher levels of GFP were sorted by FACS, collected, and propagated for further studies (Fig.1A, left). A major advantage of this expression system is that it eliminates phenotypic variation(s) resulting from clonal selection. As a control, parallel cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were infected with MSCV retrovirus encoding only GFP and then FACS-sorted, collected, and propagated to generate Swiss 3T3-GFP cells (Fig. 1 B, right). As expected, both Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells and Swiss 3T3-GFP cells express GFP, as revealed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 B). In order to examine the expression of PKD in the FACS-sorted cells, lysates of these cell populations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an antibody directed against the C-terminal region of this enzyme. As shown in Fig. 1 C, lysates of Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells exhibited a marked increase (8.7 ± 1.8-fold increase; n = 12) in the expression of an immunoreactive band of 115 kDa, which corresponds to the molecular mass of PKD (20Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), as compared with Swiss 3T3-GFP cells. The detection of this band was completely blocked when the immunoblots were incubated with the antibody in the presence of the immunizing peptide EEREMKALSERVSIL that corresponds to the C-terminal region of the predicted amino acid sequence of PKD. A prominent PKD band was also obtained when lysates from Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells were immunoprecipitated with the PA-1 antiserum (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using a different antibody directed against PKD (results not shown). Detection of this 115-kDa band was blocked by the inclusion of the immunizing peptide during the immunoprecipitation. Thus, using high efficiency retrovirally mediated transfection we generated Swiss 3T3 cells overexpressing PKD. We reported that cell stimulation with neuropeptide agonists that signal through heptahelical receptors coupled to Gαq, including bombesin and vasopressin, induces rapid PKC-dependent conversion of PKD from an inactive to an active state (32Zugaza J.L.

Here, we examined whether the activity of PKD overexpressed in Swiss 3T3 cells is regulated in a similar manner. To determine whether bombesin induces PKD activation in intact Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells, cultures of these cells were treated with increasing concentrations of this agonist for 10 min and lysed, and PKD was immunoprecipitated with PA-1 antiserum. The resulting immunocomplexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, and the incorporation of 32P into PKD was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.2A, PKD isolated from unstimulated Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells had very low catalytic activity, indicating that overexpression did not lead to constitutive activation of this enzyme. Stimulation of these cells with bombesin induced a striking dose-dependent increase in PKD kinase activity that was maintained during cell lysis and immunoprecipitation. Half-maximal and maximal increases in catalytic PKD activity were achieved at 0.3 and 3 nm. PKD activation was also induced when Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells were stimulated with PDBu instead of bombesin. Next, we examined whether PKD activation induced by bombesin or PDBu in Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells occurs through a PKC-dependent pathway. Cultures of these retrovirally transfected cells were treated with either Ro 31-8220 or bisindolylmaleimide GF I, selective inhibitors of phorbol-ester sensitive isoforms of PKC (55Yeo E.J.

https://openalex.org/W2048822395,"Abstract Ca2+ enters pituitary and pancreatic neuroendocrine cells through dihydropyridine-sensitive channels triggering hormone release. Inhibitory metabotropic receptors reduce Ca2+ entry through activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins leading to activation of K+channels and voltage-sensitive inhibition of L-type channel activity. Despite the cloning and functional expression of several Ca2+ channels, those involved in regulating hormone release remain unknown. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction we identified mRNAs encoding three α1(α1A, α1C, and α1D), four β, and one α2-δ subunit in rat pituitary GH3 cells; α1B and α1Stranscripts were absent. GH3 cells express multiple alternatively spliced α1D mRNAs. Many of the α1D transcript variants encode “short” α1D (α1D-S) subunits, which have a QXXER amino acid sequence at their C termini, a motif found in all other α1 subunits that couple to opioid receptors. The other splice variants identified terminate with a longer C terminus that lacks the QXXER motif (α1D-L). We cloned and expressed the predominant α1D-S transcript variants in rat brain and GH3 cells and their αlD-L counterpart in GH3 cells. Unlike α1A channels, α1D channels exhibited current-voltage relationships similar to those of native GH3 cell Ca2+channels, but lacked voltage-dependent G protein coupling. Our data demonstrate that alternatively spliced α1Dtranscripts form functional Ca2+ channels that exhibit voltage-dependent, G protein-independent facilitation. Furthermore, the QXXER motif, located on the C terminus of α1D-S subunit, is not sufficient to confer sensitivity to inhibitory G proteins."

Although a variety of biological roles have previously been described, the cellular and molecular function of species-specific PBPs remains unclear. The plant PBP orthologues TERMINAL FLOWER 1, SELF-PRUNING, and CENTRORADIALIS were shown to be involved in the regulation of flowering signaling and meristem growth (1Ohshima S. Murata M. Sakamoto W.

In nematodes PBPs were found to be part of secreted cell-surface proteins and proposed to function as a protective mechanism against host immunological response (10Gems D. Ferguson C.J.

TheDrosophila PBP homologues were decribed as putative odorant-binding effector molecules, expressed in different subsets of olfactory hairs (11Pikielny C.W. Hasan G. Rouyer F. Rosbash M.

This undecapeptide is released of the N-terminal region of PBP (12Tohdoh N. Tojo S. Agui H. Ojika K. Brain Res. Mol.

The S. cerevisiae PBP orthologue TFS1 (for TWENTY-FIVE SUPPRESSOR1) was demonstrated to act as a dose-dependent suppressor of CDC25 mutations (4Robinson L.C. Tatchell K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CDC25 acts as a GTP/GTP exchange factor for Ras and is implicated in Ras activation (18Innocenti M. Zippel R. Brambilla R.

In contrast human RKIP (for Raf kinaseinhibitor protein), which is identical to hPBP, has been characterized as an inhibitor of Ras-mediated signaling cascade and AP1- dependent transcription (21Yeung K.

Analysis of the family of PBPs revealed high structural homology between PBPs from different species (22Banfield M.J. Barker J.J. Perry A.C. Brady R.L.

Mammalian PBPs consist of 187 amino acids and show a significant degree in sequence similarity (12Tohdoh N. Tojo S. Agui H. Ojika K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The central region of these proteins constituted by residues 60–126 appears to be best conserved and contains a region believed to play an essential role in PBP function and to be responsible for binding to G proteins (25Schoentgen F. Jolles P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In fact, bovine PBP was shown to associate with small GTP-binding proteins but failed to bind GTPs themselves (26Bucquoy S. Jolles P. Schoentgen F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To date, known data about PBPs implicate an involvement in multiple signaling mechanisms (22Banfield M.J. Barker J.J.

Interestingly, the rat PBP homologue could be isolated by morphine affinity chromatography from rat brain membranes, suggesting an association with the G protein-coupled µ opioid receptor (MOR) (27Grandy D.K. Hanneman E. Bunzow J. Shih M. Machida C.A. Bidlack J.M. Civelli O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The postulated association of PBP with MOR prompted us to test whether hPBP is involved in receptor-mediated heterotrimeric G protein signaling. In the present work we investigated the influence of human PBP on G protein signaling mediated by hMOR and other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (human δ opioid receptor, hDOR; human somatostatin receptor, hSSTR2) in Xenopus laevis as well as in HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells.

Clamped oocytes were superfused with either ND96, with a moderate potassium solution (K16: 82 mm NaCl, 16 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) with K16 containing receptor-specific agonist (1 µm) or K16/BaCl2 solution (K16 with 300 µmBaCl2) (see scheme in Fig. 1).

Kroslak T. Averbeck M. Mayer P. Schroder H. Raulf E. Hollt V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Selection of stable clones was performed by addition of either 500 µg/ml Geneticin (pcDNA3.1/hPBP) or 1 µg/ml puromycin (pEAK10/rMOR1). For coexpression of rMOR1 and hPBP in HEK293 cells, stable rMOR1-expressing clones were transfected with pcDNA3.1/hPBP and cells selected with Geneticin and puromycin. Sequences of cloned inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Control NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1(−) (without cloned insert). [35S]GTPγS binding was performed as described previously (29Koch T. Kroslak T. Averbeck M. Mayer P. Schroder H. Raulf E. Hollt V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Stock [35S]GTPγS was diluted 10-fold in 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use. For each assay, 28 µg of membrane protein were incubated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 µm GDP, 0.05 nm [35S]GTPγS. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 µm GTPγS. After 30 min at either 4 or 20 °C, membranes mixtures were washed three times with ice-cold 50 µm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, on GF/B filters using a Inotech cell harvester. Bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. For hPBP dose-response curves, 20 µg of membrane protein from HEK293 cells were incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant hPBP (0.01–1000 ng) in 50 µl at 4 °C for 90 min. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (sigmoidal dose-response curve fit analysis; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). [35S]GTPγS binding to soluble Gαi1 was performed according to Ref. 32Carty D.J. Iyengar R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar at 30 °C in 50 µl of HEPES buffer (pH 7.9, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 12.5 ng of Gαi1 or with Gαi1 and 100 ng of His-hPBP. Reaction was stopped by filtration on nitrocellulose filters at indicated time points and filters washed five times with ice-cold stop buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mmNaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). Bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. 1.5 × 105cells were seeded in 22-mm 12-well dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Nut-F12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. On the day of assay, media were removed from the individual wells and were replaced with 0.5 ml of serum-free medium containing 25 µm forskolin or a combination of forskolin (25 µm) and DAMGO (1 µm). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by removing the medium and sonicating the cells in 1 ml of ice-cold HCl/EtOH (1 volume of 1 n HCl/100 volumes of EtOH). After centrifugation, the supernatant was evaporated, the residue dissolved in TE buffer and cAMP content measured. X. laevis oocytes were incubated in ND96 containing 20 µmisobutylmethylxanthine for 20 min and then injected with His-hPBP and incubated for additional 20 min. Buffer was rapidly aspirated, and oocytes were sonicated and assayed for cAMP content as described above. ANdeI-EcoRI DNA fragment, containing the hPBP reading frame, was generated from pT7/T3(hPBP) by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and subcloned into pET28a(+). Bacterial strain BCL1(DE3) was transformed with pET28a(+)(hPBP). Cloned sequence was proofed by sequencing. 100 ml of LB medium supplemented with glucose (1% final concentration) were inoculated and grown to anA 595 nm of 0.6. Cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and harvested 4 h after induction by centrifugation according to the Novagen protocol. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold HIS·BIND® buffer (500 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.9) and sonicated. Purification of His-tagged hPBP with His·BIND® Quick 900 cartridges was performed according to Novagen's protocol and elution buffer (500 mm NaCL, 25 mm HEPES, 1 m imidazole) was used to elute hPBP. A 4-ml sample was further dialyzed five times in 2 liters of hPBP storage buffer (100 mm, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9). Protein concentration was determined, and aliquoted stocks (200 ng/µl) were frozen (−70 °C) in storage buffer. As reported previously, superfusion of oocytes expressing G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels (rKir3.1; rKir3.4) with potassium solution led to an increase in potassium conductance, that could be blocked by BaCl2 (28Koch T. Kroslak T. Mayer P. Raulf E. Hollt V. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1767-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 29Koch T. Kroslak T. Averbeck M. Mayer P. Schroder H. Raulf E. Hollt V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This basal channel-mediated current (IKir-basal) could be further enhanced (IKir-activated) by application of a specific opioid agonist (e.g. DAMGO or morphine) to oocytes coexpressing human µ opioid receptor (hMOR) (see scheme in Fig.1). In this study we tested influence of hPBP on basal and agonist-induced Kir currents. Coexpression of hPBP, hMOR and Kir channels resulted in a significant enhancement of both IKir-basal (∼1.3-fold) and IKir-activated (∼1.6-fold) compared with oocytes expressing hMOR and Kir channels (Fig.2A). In oocytes coexpressing hPBP and Kir channels, only no effect on IKir-basal could be detected (data not shown). In addition, the EC50 values were not found to be significantly different for morphine-treated hMOR- and hMOR/PBP-expressing oocytes (∼52 and ∼63 nm, respectively) (Fig. 2 B). To evaluate whether the stimulatory effect on the Kir channel activity is restricted to the presence of hMOR, we coexpressed hPBP with either hDOR or hSSTR2. Similar to hMOR, the agonist-induced current IKir-activated in both hSSTR2- and hDOR-expressing oocytes was significantly increased after stimulation with a specific agonist (hSSTR2: octreotide, 1 µm; hDOR: DADLE, 1 µm) when hPBP was coexpressed (Fig. 2 C). In case of hSSTR2, receptor-mediated current (IKir-activated) was stimulated less efficiently (∼1.2-fold) than hDOR-mediated IKir-activated (∼2-fold). Although the extent of stimulation differed, these data indicate that the effect of hPBP on G protein-dependent coupling of receptors to Kiris not only restricted to the presence of the µ opioid receptor. To test whether the influence of hPBP on Kir-mediated conductance is directly mediated by the presence of hPBP and not due to long term expression-induced intracellular changes, purified histidine-tagged hPBP was injected inX. laevis oocytes, expressing either Kirchannels and hMOR or Kir channels only. Control oocytes were injected with heat-inactivated hPBP. Changes in IKir-basal and/or IKir-activated were measured 1–2 min after injection. PBP injection in hMOR-expressing oocytes resulted in an significant enhancement of both IKir-basaland IKir-activated as described previously in coexpression experiments. In contrast to the hPBP coexpression experiments, injection of His-hPBP was more potent to stimulate IKir-basal (1.6-fold) than IKir-activated(1.3-fold) (Fig. 3A). In addition, hPBP injection could directly stimulate basal Kirconductance (IKir-basal) ∼2.2-fold, even in the absence of a coexpressed receptor (Fig. 3 B). This effect could be blocked by PTX (60% inhibition). A comparable inhibition could be detected in PTX-treated DAMGO-stimulated oocytes expressing hMOR (85% inhibition), indicating that hPBP could stimulate Kirchannels and G protein coupling of hMOR to Kir channels in a direct and acute Gi/o protein-dependent fashion (Fig. 3 C). In order to evaluate the potency of hPBP to influence other G protein-coupled systems (e.g. adenylate cyclase), cAMP levels of oocytes injected with hPBP were compared with that of mock-injected ones. As cAMP levels varied in X. laevis oocytes isolated from different frogs (1.3–2.9 pmol of cAMP), data from independent experiments were normalized. Injection of hPBP led to an ∼38% reduction of the intracellular cAMP level (Fig.3 D). The results obtained suggest that hPBP injection may influence adenylate cyclase activity. In order to specify hPBP-mediated cAMP reduction, forskolin-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase was studied in HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells overexpressing hPBP, rMOR1, or both hPBP and rMOR1. Forskolin stimulation of HEK293 cells stably expressing rat µ opioid receptor (rMOR1) and hPBP resulted in a significant reduction in cAMP level (55% of control) compared with control HEK293 cells expressing rMOR1 only (Fig.4A). Basal cAMP content was not found to be significantly different. In addition, coexpression of hPBP and rMOR1 also led to a significantly enhanced DAMGO (1 µm)-mediated reduction of forskolin-induced cAMP level compared with rMOR1-expressing cells (4.5 and 14% for rMOR1/hPBP- and rMOR1-expressing cells, respectively). Thus, as shown for G protein-coupled Kir conductance in Xenopusoocytes, expression of hPBP in HEK293 significantly amplified receptor-mediated G protein-coupled signaling of rMOR1, indicating a stimulatory effect of hPBP on opioid receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Moreover, in mouse NIH3T3 cells stably expressing hPBP (Fig. 4 B), stimulation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin led to an significant decrease of cAMP levels (∼60%) compared with pcDNA3.1-transfected control cells, indicating a direct involvement of hPBP in reduction of adenylate cyclase-mediated cAMP formation. Basal cAMP levels were not significantly changed in both cell lines. PBPs were shown to be associated with cellular membranes and therefore could be implicated in G protein-dependent signaling in a membrane-dependent fashion. To prove the hypothesis of an involvement of hPBP in GTP-binding of G proteins, we used [35S]GTPγS-binding assay. We tested [35S]GTPγS-binding on membrane preparations of either hPBP-expressing or mock-transfected NIH3T3 cells. Binding was performed at two different temperatures (4 and 20 °C). As shown in Fig.5A, basal [35S]GTPγS binding (performed at 4 °C) to membranes of hPBP-expressing cells showed a significant ∼2.1-fold increase in specific [35S]GTPγS binding (208.8%) compared with control cells, indicating a stimulatory effect of hPBP on GTP binding to cellular membranes. A weaker but still significant increase of only ∼1.2-fold (120.2%) could be measured at room temperature (20 °C). Unspecific binding was not altered by hPBP at given temperatures (data not shown). This stimulatory effect on [35S]GTPγS binding could be also detected on membranes of untransfected HEK293 cell if recombinant His-hPBP was used for stimulation. His-hPBP dose-dependently stimulated specific [35S]GTPγS binding with an apparent EC50 of 3.6 nm (Fig.5 B). Stimulation of membrane-bound G proteins is obviously due to binding to heterotrimeric Gi proteins, as hPBP facilitated GTP binding to soluble rat Gαi1 in vitro in a time-dependent manner (Fig.5 C). Gq-coupled receptors have been shown to stimulate a Ca2+-activated chloride current inXenopus oocytes (33Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels result from phospholipase C/inositol trisphosphate-dependent Ca2+ release from internal stores and Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium. To test whether hPBP could also stimulate PLC-dependent pathways, we tested effects of hPBP injection in oocytes on the Ca2+ release-activated outwardly rectifying Cl− current (ICl1) (Fig.6, A and B). GTPγS injection as well as CaCl2 injection (60 pmol) resulted in a significant stimulation of ICl1 (maximum induced change in current ΔICl1: GTPγS, ∼1100 nA; CaCl2, ∼296 nA). The CaCl2-mediated effect could be mimicked by injection of 10 ng/oocyte hPBP (ΔICl1 ∼ 210 nA), indicating that hPBP leads to an release of Ca2+ from internal stores. In previous studies PBPs were shown to affect regulation of cellular signaling and growth. They were found to associate with G proteins but failed to bind GTP themselves (26Bucquoy S. Jolles P. Schoentgen F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate the involvement of hPBP in heterotrimeric G protein-dependent signaling. According to oocyte studies, hPBP acted like an enhancer of G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of inwardly rectifying Kir3 channels. The Kir-mediated potassium conductance is stimulated directly by free β-γ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (34Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 35Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed effect of an enhanced conductance in the presence of hPBP might be explained by an increased liberation of free β-γ subunits from heterotrimeric G proteins, resulting from a direct interaction of hPBP with heterotrimeric G proteins themselves. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that stimulation was not restricted to the presence and stimulation of a specific GPCR and that direct hPBP injection resulted in a comparable PTX-sensitive stimulation even in the absence of coexpressed receptors. As hPBP mimicked the effect of an activated Gi/Go protein, it could be assumed that hPBP activates heterotrimeric G proteins. Such an activity would further explain the ability of hPBP to reduce cAMP levels in oocytes as well as HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells, since adenylate cyclase activity is inhibited by activated GTP-bound Gi/Go α subunits. In addition hPBP also seems to be involved in other G protein-dependent pathways, as hPBP was able to elicit a stimulatory effect on the Ca2+ release-activated Cl− current in oocytes comparable to that seen after CaCl2 injection. Although PLC-mediated Ca2+release in oocytes is Go-dependent, it is important to note that receptors that couple to Gq in native tissue regularly couple to Xenopus Go. In agreement with this finding, we could show that the presence of hPBP stimulates [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that hPBP led to an activation of membrane-bound G proteins. PBP is a major protein component (∼18%) in detergent extracts and plasma membrane preparations of rat epididymal spermatozoa (36Jones R. Hall L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Analysis of overall protein and mRNA expression in different rat tissues (15Frayne J. Ingram C. Love S. Hall L. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 298: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) displayed comparable amounts of hPBP in epididymis, liver, adrenal gland, and brain. PBP is predominantly expressed at highest levels in distinct cell types and specific brain regions (37Taiji M. Tohdoh N. Ojika K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 202-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) including neuronal cell layers. The high efficiency (EC50 values ∼3.6 nm; ∼8.3 ng (hPBP)/20 µg (membrane protein)) of hPBP mediated [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes strikingly indicate that hPBP would play a role in membrane-associated heterotrimeric G protein-coupled signaling in this cell region. In recent years, several proteins regulating G protein activity have been described. GDP dissociation inhibitors were shown to act as negative modulators of G protein activity by inhibiting GDP release from the G protein (38De Vries L. Fischer T. Tronchere H. Brothers G.M.

Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). GTPase-activating proteins accelerate GTPase activity on G proteins, thus leading to a GDP-bound inactive G protein (41Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 42Settleman J. Albright C.F. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast, GTP exchange factors mediate nucleotide exchange of GDP, resulting in an active GTP-bound G protein (19Overbeck A.F. Brtva T.R. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Huff S.Y. Khosravi-Far R. Quilliam L.A. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 43Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by hPBP is unclear, our observations make it reasonable to speculate that hPBP activates heterotrimeric G protein coupling by elevating GDP/GTP exchange on Gα subunits, as described for GTP exchange factors. This is in good agreement with our data showing that hPBP stimulates GTP binding to soluble Gαi1 subunit in vitro. Surprisingly, comparison between injection and expression experiments in oocytes further revealed that injection of recombinant hPBP more potently stimulated basal Kir conductance than receptor-mediated Kir conductance; moreover, in the absence of coexpressed receptors, hPBP injection resulted in a GPCR-like PTX-sensitive stimulation. These results suggest that, under given circumstances, injected hPBP lacking eukaryotic posttranslational modifications represents a functional activated form of the protein and that intracellular activity of expressed hPBP is regulated in the presence and after stimulation of given GPCRs. In the absence of such receptors, hPBP coexpression in oocytes had no effect on Kir channels (data not shown). For an interaction with the membrane-bound heterotrimeric G protein, it is necessary that hPBP is located near the plasma membrane. As PBPs were mostly found to be cytosolic, regulation of both the hPBP potency to bind to phospholipids like phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine (26Bucquoy S. Jolles P. Schoentgen F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the targeting of PBPs to the cell membrane could lead to a modulation of the activity of heterotrimeric G proteins. Consistent with this model, Yeung and co-workers (21Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosch P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) reported that both Raf1 and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase bind to a highly conserved region of hPBP described as phosphatidylethanolamine-binding domain (see Fig.7; accession no. PS01220) and that targeting of hPBP to the cell membrane occurred after mitogenic stimulation (21Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosch P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Nature. 1999; 401: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 44Yeung K. Janosch P. McFerran B. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In this context it is interesting to note that a second highly conserved region (proline 112 to tyrosine 125) described as a putative nucleotide binding domain within hPBP overlaps with an amino acid region (valine 107 to leucine 123) that shares a significant homology (94%) to a sequence pattern also known as G protein-coupled receptor signature (Fig. 7) (22Banfield M.J. Barker J.J. Perry A.C. Brady R.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 1245-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Schoentgen F. Jolles P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The 17-amino acid consensus sequence signature (Prosite accession no. PS00237, Fig. 7 C) is found in the second intracellular loop of GPCRs and contains a conserved acidic-arginine-aromatic triplet (arginine conserved to 100%) shown to be important for interaction and coupling of GPCRs to heterotrimeric G proteins (45Seibold A. Dagarag M. Birnbaumer M. Receptors Channels. 1998; 5: 375-385PubMed Google Scholar, 46Zhu S.Z. Wang S.Z. Hu J. el-Fakahany E.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar). As shown by amino acid sequence analysis/alignment (Fig. 7 B), this signature as well as the arginine (signature position 13) is also highly conserved within specific PBPs. Although a proline present in PBP sequences is not found in the consensus G protein-coupled receptor signature (signature position 6), its high conservation within most animal and plant PBPs (data not shown) indicates an essential role in PBP function. This suggests that the mechanism of hPBP-mediated effects could be closely related to that elicited by GPCRs. The nature of this mechanism is currently under investigation. The identification of hPBP as a novel modulator involved in heterotrimeric G protein signaling could offer new insights into PBP function and regulation of receptor-dependent heterotrimeric G protein-coupled signaling.

CAB International, Wallingford, UK1993: 33-72Google Scholar), so that l-arabinose catabolism is of relevance for micro-organisms using plant material as a carbon source. The bacterial pathway for l-arabinose catabolism is well established. It consists of an isomerase, a kinase, and an epimerase that sequentially convert l-arabinose tol-ribulose, l-ribulose 5-phosphate, andd-xylulose 5-phosphate. d-Xylulose 5-phosphate is an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway (2Stryer L. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1988: 805-807Google Scholar). There is also a hypothetical pathway for fungi. In this pathwayl-arabinose is also converted to d-xylulose 5-phosphate but through different intermediates (see Fig. 1). This pathway uses two reductases, two dehydrogenases, and a kinase (3Chiang C. Knight S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 46: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Witteveen C.F.B. Busink R. Van de Vondervoort P.J.I. Dijkema C. Swart K. Visser J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 2163-2171Google Scholar). While the genes of the bacterial pathway have been known for decades, little is known about the fungal pathway. A fungal pathway for l-arabinose utilization was described by Chiang and Knight (3Chiang C. Knight S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 46: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for Penicillium chrysogenum and by Witteveen et al. (4Witteveen C.F.B. Busink R. Van de Vondervoort P.J.I. Dijkema C. Swart K. Visser J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 2163-2171Google Scholar) for Aspergillus niger. It consists of an NADPH-linked reductase, which formsl-arabinitol, an NAD-linked dehydrogenase, which formsl-xylulose, an NADPH-linked reductase, which forms xylitol, an NAD-linked dehydrogenase, which forms d-xylulose and a xylulokinase. This pathway was described only for filamentous fungi, but there are indications that it also exists in yeast species. Shiet al. (5Shi N.Q. Prahl K. Hendrick J. Cruz J. Lu P. Cho J.Y. Jones S. Jeffries T. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2000; 84–86: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) described a mutant of Pichia stipitisthat was unable to grow on l-arabinose. Overexpression of the NAD-linked xylitol dehydrogenase could restore growth onl-arabinitol indicating that xylitol is an intermediate in the l-arabinose pathway. With l-arabinose as the sole carbon source various yeast strains producedl-arabinitol and small amounts of xylitol (6Dien B.S. Kurtzman C.P. Saha B.C. Bothast R.J. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1996; 57–58: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which are intermediates of the postulated fungal pathway in Fig.1 but not of the bacterial pathway. The ability to ferment l-arabinose is not a common feature of yeast species. Many yeast species merely convertl-arabinose to l-arabinitol (7McMillan J.D. Boynton B.L. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1994; 45–46: 569-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Only recently yeast species have been identified that are able to fermentl-arabinose to ethanol (6Dien B.S. Kurtzman C.P. Saha B.C. Bothast R.J. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1996; 57–58: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The fungal l-arabinose pathway has similarities to the fungal d-xylose pathway. In both pathways the pentose sugar goes through reduction and oxidation reactions where the reductions are NADPH-linked and the oxidations are NAD-linked. d-Xylose goes through one, and l-arabinose goes through two pairs of reduction and oxidation reactions. The process is redox neutral, but different redox cofactors, i.e. NADPH and NAD are used, which have to be regenerated in other metabolic pathways. In thed-xylose pathway an NADPH-linked reductase convertsd-xylose into xylitol, which is then converted tod-xylulose by an NAD-linked dehydrogenase and tod-xylulose 5-phosphate by xylulokinase. The enzymes of thed-xylose pathway can all be used in thel-arabinose pathway. The first enzyme in both pathways is an aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21). The corresponding enzymes inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (8Kuhn A. van Zyl C. van Tonder A. Prior B.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1580-1585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and P. stipitis (9Verduyn C. van Kleef R. Frank J. Schreuder J.H. van Dijken J.P. Scheffers W.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 668-677Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar) have been characterized. They are unspecific and can use eitherl-arabinose or d-xylose with approximately the same rate to produce l-arabinitol or xylitol, respectively. Genes coding for this enzyme are known e.g. for P. stipitis (10Amore R. Kötter P. Kuster C. Ciriacy M. Hollenberg C.P.

The xylitol dehydrogenase (also known as d-xylulose reductase, EC 1.1.1.9) and xylulokinase (EC 2.7.1.17) are the same in the d-xylose and l-arabinose pathway of fungi. Genes for the d-xylulose reductase are known from P. stipitis (15Kötter P Amore R. Hollenberg C.P. Ciriacy M. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), S. cerevisiae (11Richard P. Toivari M.H. Penttilä M.

Biotechnol. 1998; 14: 179-185PubMed Google Scholar). The gene for a fungal xylulokinase is only known for S. cerevisiae (17Ho N.W.Y. Chang S.-F. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1989; 11: 417-421Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Genes coding for l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.12) or l-xylulose reductase (EC 1.1.1.10) are not known. We chose the mold T. reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) to identify the gene coding for l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase because this mold can efficiently use l-arabinose as a carbon source. The standard procedure to measure l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase activity was to add the enzyme preparation to a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm NAD. The reaction was then started by addingl-arabinitol or other sugar alcohols if specified to a final concentration of 10 mm. The activity was calculated from the increase in NADH absorbance at 340 nm. In the reverse reaction the activity was measured by adding the enzyme preparation to a buffer containing 200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 200 µm NADH.l-Xylulose was then added as the start reagent. The activity was calculated from the changes in NADH absorbance at 340 nm. To measure the Michaelis-Menten constants at neutral pH the enzyme was added to a reaction mixture containing 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm NAD when the Km for sugar alcohols was measured or 100 mml-arabinitol when theKm for NAD was measured. One katal (kat)1 produced 1 mol of NADH/s. All enzyme assays were done at 37 °C in a Cobas Mira automated analyzer (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). T. reesei (Rut C-30) was grown in a medium containing 40 g/liter l-arabinose, 2 g/liter proteose peptone, 15 g/liter KH2PO4, 5 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 0.6 g/liter Mg2SO4·7 H2O, 0.8 g/liter CaCl2·2H2O, and trace elements (18Mandels M Weber J. Adv. Chem. Ser. 1969; 95: 391-414Crossref Google Scholar) at 28 °C, pH 4.0 and 30% dissolved oxygen in a fermenter (Chepmap CF2000). The fermentation was stopped when the l-arabinose was about 10 g/liter. The mycelium was harvested with a plastic mesh sieve and washed with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. 500 g of the mycelium was frozen in liquid nitrogen in 100-g portions. After thawing and sonifying with a tip sonifier, dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the suspension was centrifuged (Sorvall SS34, 40 min, 20,000 rpm). The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against a 10-fold volume of buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol). The retentate was then centrifuged (Sorvall SS34, 40 min, 20,000 rpm). All steps were performed at 4 °C. The crude extract had a protein content of 7 g/liter and anl-arabinitol dehydrogenase activity of 0.7 nkat/mg of extracted protein. 500 ml of this crude extract were loaded to a column with 200 ml of DEAE-cellulose and eluted with a linear gradient from buffer A to buffer A supplemented with 100 mm NaCl. The highest activity (16 nkat/mg, 5 g/liter protein) eluted at about 80 mm NaCl. 600 µl of the fraction with the highest activity after the DEAE-cellulose column were then run by native PAGE (12% acrylamide, Bio-Rad). The gel was then stained in a Zymogram staining solution (19Suomalainen I. Londesborough J. Korhola M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1537-1545Google Scholar) containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 100 mml-arabinitol, 0.25 mm nitroblue tetrazolium, 0.06 mm phenazine methosulfate, and 1.5 mm NAD. The only band that appeared in the staining was cut out and eluted by overnight incubation in 2 ml of 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.1% SDS. It was then concentrated to about 80 µl in a Centricon tube (Amicon). This gave an enzyme preparation with a major band at about 38 kDa in SDS-PAGE. This 38-kDa band was then used for N-terminal and internal fragment sequence analysis. SDS-PAGE was performed in 12% (w/v) gels by the method of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and the band was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For N-terminal sequencing the protein was electroblotted on a ProBlott® membrane and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (21Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems 494A Procise® sequencer (PerkinElmer). Peptide sequencing was performed on a glass fiber disc pretreated with 1.5 mg of BioBrene® (PerkinElmer). The stained protein band from SDS-PAGE was digested in-gel, and the peptides were extracted essentially according to the method of Rosenfeld et al. (22Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.G. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). The peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography on a 0.3- × 150-mm PepMapTM(3 µm, 300 Å, C18, LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) column using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (4–40% in 160 min) in 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was 3 µl/min, and detection was at 214 nm. Selected peaks were collected in tubes containing 10 µl of 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and subjected to sequence analysis. Mass map fingerprinting of the protein digest and the purified peptides were performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described by Nymanet al. (23Nyman T.A. Matikainen S. Sareneva T. Julkunen I. Kalkkinen N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4011-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The internal peptide sequences were used to design degenerate primers for PCR. The template in the first approach was genomic DNA from T. reesei (H. jecorina). A sense DNA sequence (ARCCIAAYATHGGIGTITTYACIAAYCC) corresponding to the amino acid fragment ATGAAISVKPNIGVFTNPK and an antisense DNA sequence (GGRTCIGCIGAIGTYTCRAAIGC) corresponding to the amino acid fragment AFETSADPK were used. The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation 30 s at 96 °C; annealing 30 s, first two times at 37 °C and then 27 times at 42 °C; extension 2 min at 72 °C; final extension 5 min at 72 °C. This procedure gave a PCR product of about 1 kb. The resulting fragment of about 1 kb was then cloned to a TOPO vector (Invitrogen). This construct was then used for sequencing. A cDNA library of T. reesei(H. jecorina) in a yeast expression vector (24Margolles-Clark E. Tenkanen M. Nakari-Setälä T. Penttilä M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3840-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to clone the residual parts of the gene. In this expression vector the cDNA is located between a PGK promoter and terminator. To clone the part of the gene that corresponds to the N terminus of the protein a PCR reaction was carried out with the cDNA library as a template and one primer (TCAAGTTCTTAGATGCTT) in the PGK promoter region and an antisense primer (CCTTTCCTCCAAACTTGCTGG) from the gene fragment of thel-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase. The part of the gene that corresponds to the C terminus of the protein was cloned in a similar way with a primer (CTGCATTGGGCCCATGAT) from the gene fragment and an antisense primer (TAGCGTAAAGGATGGGG) from the PGKterminator. The PCR conditions were as described above except that the annealing was 30 times at 50 °C. The N terminus gave a PCR product of about 0.8 kb; the C terminus gave a PCR product of about 0.9 kb. The PCR products were cloned to TOPO vectors, and the resulting vectors were used for sequencing. With the information of the C terminus and the N terminus the open reading frame was then cloned by PCR from the cDNA library. The primer for the N terminus (AGAATTCACCATGTCGCCTTCCGCAGTC) contained an additionalEcoRI restriction site (underlined). The primer for the C terminus (ACGGATCCTCTACCTGGTAGCACCTCA) contained an additional BamHI restriction site (underlined). The annealing in the PCR was 30 times at 60.5 °C; otherwise the conditions were as described above. This gave a fragment of 1.1 kb, which was then cloned to a TOPO vector and used for sequencing. T. reesei (Rut C-30) was grown in the standard medium (18Mandels M Weber J. Adv. Chem. Ser. 1969; 95: 391-414Crossref Google Scholar) with l-arabinose, lactose, or glucose as a carbon source. Total RNA was isolated according to Chirgwin et al.(31Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochem. J. 1979; 18: 251-256Crossref Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). Samples of 5 µg of RNA were separated on an agarose gel and blotted to positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by capillary transfer using 10× SSC as transfer buffer. Blotted filters were cross-linked in an UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene). Prehybridization was performed at 42 °C for 1 h in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 1m NaCl, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 mg of herring sperm DNA/ml. Hybridization was done under the same conditions for 18 h. The labeled probe had an activity of about 0.5 × 106 cpm/ml. The filter was washed twice for 15 min with 1× SSC, 1% SDS and twice for 15 min with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, all at 42 °C. The incorporated radioactivity was then visualized with a photographic film. The probe was labeled with [γ-32P]CTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a commercial kit for the DNA labeling (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Unincorporated label was displaced with a Neb column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 1.1-kb EcoRI, BamHI fragment from the TOPO vector from above was cut out and ligated to the corresponding sites of the pYX242 vector (R&D Systems). Plasmid pYX242 is a multicopy expression vector for S. cerevisiae with aTPI promoter and terminator and LEU2 for selection. This plasmid was then transformed to the S. cerevisiaestrain CEN.PK2 (VW1b). The recombinant yeast cells were grown on selective medium with glucose as carbon source, harvested, and extracted by vortexing with glass beads. The extract was then analyzed for l-arabinitol dehydrogenase activity. The recombinant cells of S. cerevisiaewere grown and extracted as described above. The extract was then subjected to a fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation. The fraction precipitating between 0.22 and 0.44 g/ml (NH4)2SO4 was then applied to a Sephacryl S300 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The active fractions were then loaded to a DEAE column and eluted with a salt gradient similar to the purification from T. reeseiexcept that a gradient from 0 to 300 mm NaCl was used. The highest activity eluted at around 225 mm NaCl. The enzyme purified fromS. cerevisiae was also used for the product identification. A solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, 6 mm sugar alcohol, 5 mm NAD, 0.5 mmMgCl2 and the partially purified recombinant protein at a concentration of 44 mg/liter was incubated overnight at room temperature. 20 µl of this solution were then analyzed by HPLC. An Animex HPX-87H (Bio-Rad) column was used at 35 °C and a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min with 5 mm H2SO4. The sugar alcohols were detected by a Waters 410 RI detector. The filamentous fungus T. reesei (H. jecorina) was grown onl-arabinose (40 g/liter) and harvested whenl-arabinose was still present (about 10 g/liter) to ensure that the l-arabinose pathway was expressed and active. 500 g of mycelium were extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The crude extract obtained in this way had l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase activity of 0.7 nkat/mg using our standard protocol for enzyme activity measurement. The extract was purified with a DEAE anion exchange column. 2.45 µkat were loaded to the column and eluted with a sodium chloride gradient from 0 to 100 mm. The fractions with the highest activity (16 nkat/mg) eluted at around 80 mm sodium chloride,i.e. this led to a 20-fold purification. 240 nkat with an activity 16 nkat/mg were collected. In the second step the preparation was fractionated by native PAGE. 60 nkat (3 mg of protein) were applied to a native polyacrylamide gel, and the active enzyme in the gel was identified by Zymogram staining as described under “Experimental Procedures” using l-arabinitol and NAD as substrates. In this staining one band appeared, which was then carefully cut out. This active band was then eluted from the gel, concentrated, and applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. On the SDS-polyacrylamide gel four to five protein bands were visible with a major band with a molecular mass of 38 kDa. This protein band was then first subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis after electroblotting. No signals were obtained from about 50 pmol of protein suggesting that its N terminus is blocked. For internal sequencing the protein band was digested in-gel with trypsin, and the formed peptides were eluted from the gel. Peptide mass fingerprinting of the digest was performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and the peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography. Selected peptides were subjected to sequence analysis with results as shown in Table I.Table IInternal peptide sequences1:ATGAAISVKPNIGVFTNPK2:YSNTWPR3:AFETSADPK4:HDLWISEAEP… Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequences of the peptides were then used to design degenerate primers for PCR. The template in the first approach was genomic DNA. A sense DNA sequence corresponding to the amino acid fragment ATGAAISVKPNIGVFTNPK and an antisense DNA sequence corresponding to the amino acid fragment AFETSADPK gave a PCR product of about 1 kb. The PCR product contained sequences that coded also for the other two amino acid sequences from Table I (see Fig.2). To find the missing DNA sequences coding for the N terminus and the C terminus of the protein a cDNA library from T. reesei was used in which the cDNA library was ligated between the PGK promoter and terminator from the yeast S. cerevisiae (24Margolles-Clark E. Tenkanen M. Nakari-Setälä T. Penttilä M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3840-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To find the N terminus, PCR primers were chosen from the PGK promoter sequence and from the sequence of the first PCR product. The C terminus was found in a similar approach with primers from the sequence of the first PCR product and the PGK terminator sequence. The sequences were then combined, and a potential open reading frame was identified. This open reading frame was then amplified by PCR by using the cDNA library as a template and sequenced. The amino acid sequence of this open reading frame contained all four peptide sequences of the purified protein in Table I. The results from mass fingerprinting was also compared with the deduced protein sequence, and it further confirmed that the cloned gene is the gene that codes for the purified protein (Table II).Table IIPeptide masses observed by MALDI-TOF mass fingerprinting from the in-gel digest of T. reesei l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase together with the predicted masses and sequences of peptides underlined in Fig. 2Observed massPredicted massPeptide sequence1883.761884.05ATGAAISVKPNIGVFTNPK1766.581766.85HDLWISEAEPSADAVK1511.621511.83SGADLKPGEVTIAVR2185.702186.03VAIEPNIICNACEPCLTGR1409.451409.67YVNHPAVWCHK2556.872556.28IGNMSWENGALLEPLSVALAGMQR1105.401105.56NEISIPFMR1162.401162.60EVDIQLQYR922.33922.43YSNTWPR964.50964.45AFETSADPKBefore digestion the protein was alkylated with iodoacetamide. Open table in a new tab Before digestion the protein was alkylated with iodoacetamide. Comparison of the cDNA sequence with the genomic DNA sequence revealed one intron of 69 base pairs (Fig. 2). We also amplified by PCR and sequenced the whole genomic open reading frame and found no further introns. The cDNA sequence was deposited at GenBankTMand has the GenBankTM accession number AF355628. The partially purified enzyme from T. reesei (after the DEAE column) was tested for activity also with other sugar alcohols under standard conditions at a 10 mmsugar alcohol concentration. Activity was found withl-arabinitol, adonitol (ribitol), and xylitol. The activity with adonitol was about 80%, and that with xylitol was 20% of the activity found with l-arabinitol. No activity was found with d-arabinitol. No activity with either sugar was found when NADP was used as a cosubstrate. In the reverse reaction we found an activity of 0.8 nkat/mg with 2 mml-xylulose and 200 µm NADH. This compares to 6.4 nkat/mg for the same preparation in the forward direction at 2 mm NAD and 10 mml-arabinitol and 5 nkat/mg when at 2 mm NAD and 10 mm adonitol. RNA that was isolated from mycelia of T. reeseigrown on different carbon sources was used for Northern analysis. The gene for the l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase gave a signal in the Northern blot only when the mycelia were grown onl-arabinose (Fig. 3). The gene for the l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase was ligated to a yeast expression vector with the constitutive TPI promoter and transformed to the S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK2. The intracellular proteins were then extracted from the recombinant yeast after growth on glucose, and the extract was analyzed for l-arabinitol dehydrogenase activity. We found an l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase activity of 0.2–0.3 nkat/mg of extracted protein when using our standard conditions at pH 9.0 and 10 mm sugar alcohol. The activity with adonitol was about 80% of the activity withl-arabinitol under these conditions, and that with xylitol was 20%. These ratios are the same as with the partially purified enzyme from T. reesei. We also testedd-arabinitol, d-sorbitol, andd-mannitol, but we found no activity. In the control strain where no l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase was expressed, we found no activity with any of the sugar alcohols tested. The kinetic properties of thel-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase were measured with crude extracts of the S. cerevisiae strain with thelad1 gene in an expression vector and with a protein preparation partially purified from this extract (Fig.4). As a control for the crude extract we used a crude extract of the corresponding yeast strain without thelad1 gene. The control strain had no activity with any of the sugar alcohols tested. To measure the Michaelis-Menten constants we used a pH of 7.0 to be closer to the in vivo conditions. Earlier we used pH 9.0 because we expected this pH to be thermodynamically favorable. The Vmax was 27 nkat/mg at pH 9.0 and 10 nkat/mg at pH 7. With the partially purified protein at pH 7.0 and an NAD concentration of 2 mm we found a Km forl-arabinitol of about 40 mm (Fig.5A). Under similar conditions but with an l-arabinitol concentration of 200 mm the Km for NAD was 180 µm (Fig. 5B). We also tested the affinities for adonitol and xylitol (Fig. 5A). Adonitol had Michaelis-Menten constants similar to those forl-arabinitol. For xylitol the affinity and theVmax were lower (Km about 200 mm and Vmax about 6 nkat/mg of protein). The partially purified recombinant protein was also used to identify the product of the enzymatic reaction. For this purpose the enzyme was incubated in the presence of NAD with l-arabinitol, adonitol (ribitol), and xylitol, and the reaction products were analyzed by HPLC. This is summarized in Fig.6. From l-arabinitol xylulose was formed, from adonitol ribulose ws formed, and from xylitol xylulose was formed. The retention times for xylulose and ribulose were 9.9 and 10.9 min, respectively. In the controls without enzyme no xylulose or ribulose was detected. l-Arabinose is a major constituent of plant material, the main carbon source for many fungi. Thel-arabinose-degrading pathway of fungi is therefore a significant pathway for the carbon utilization of these eukaryotes. The genes of this pathway are still partly unknown. We could identify one of the two missing genes of the pathway, i.e. a gene for thel-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.12) leaving thel-xylulose reductase (EC 1.1.1.10) as the only gene in thel-arabinose pathway unidentified. We named the gene coding for the l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase lad1. In T. reesei lad1 is not constitutively expressed. It is expressed in the presence of l-arabinose but not in the presence of d-glucose or l-lactose as shown by Northern analysis (Fig. 3). This corresponds to enzyme activity measurements of cell extracts. l-Arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase activity was only observed after growth on l-arabinose, not after growth on glucose or the other carbon sources (data not shown). The gene was cloned by PCR with degenerative primers designed according to the peptide sequences of the purified protein. To make sure that there are no mistakes in the sequence, e.g. introduced by PCR, the PCR and sequencing of the PCR products were done repeatedly. In addition to that the PCR product was hybridized to a λ phage cDNA library (data not shown). The cDNA gene identified in the hybridization was also sequenced and compared with the PCR product. The sequence from these two approaches is in Fig. 2, except for the intron sequence, which was derived from PCR against genomic DNA. This is the only intron in this coding region. The open reading frame codes for a protein with 377 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 39,822 Da. This is in good agreement with the protein purified from T. reesei, which had a molecular mass of 38 kDa as estimated by SDS-PAGE. All four determined peptide sequences (Table I) could be found in the deduced protein sequence indicating that the identified gene corresponds to the purified protein. This was also confirmed by the results from peptide mass fingerprinting as shown in Fig. 2 and Table II. The protein belongs to the protein family of zinc-binding dehydrogenases (25Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). When comparing the amino acid sequences of known genes, this protein showed highest homology to sorbitol dehydrogenases (l-iditol 2-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.14)). The next highest homology is to xylitol dehydrogenases. In Fig.7the amino acid sequences of the sorbitol dehydrogenase from mouse and the xylitol dehydrogenase fromS. cerevisiae and the LADI protein are compared. Despite the similarity to sorbitol dehydrogenase the LADI does not have activity with d-sorbitol. However, it has some activity with xylitol. The lad1 gene was ligated to a yeast expression vector under a strong and constitutive yeast promoter. The expression vector was then transformed to S. cerevisiae, and the LADI enzyme activity was confirmed in a yeast cell extract. The activity in the yeast cell extract was about 0.3 nkat/mg of extracted protein, which is comparable to the activity in the extract of T. reesei, which was 0.7 nkat/mg when grown on l-arabinose. The enzyme purified from T. reesei and the recombinant protein purified from the S. cerevisiae strain had the same kinetic properties; however, a difference appeared during the purification. The T. reesei protein eluted from the DEAE column at 80 mm NaCl, whereas the recombinant protein eluted at 225 mm NaCl. This may indicate a secondary modification, such as phosphorylation, when thel-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase is expressed in S. cerevisiae. The product of the enzyme activity from l-arabinitol is xylulose as shown by HPLC analysis, and the product from adonitol is ribulose (Fig. 6). This means that the oxidation must be at the fourth carbon and the productsl-xylulose and d-ribulose. However, it cannot be excluded that e.g. small amounts ofl-ribulose are formed from l-arabinitol since ribulose and arabinitol are not well separated in the HPLC analysis. The Km for l-arabinitol at pH 7.0 was 40 mm. The same Km was found for adonitol. This similar affinity might be due to the similar chemical structure ofl-arabinitol and adonitol. It has probably no physiological relevance since adonitol is not a usual substrate or metabolite. Xylitol, however, is an intermediate of the d-xylose and the l-arabinose catabolic pathway and can accumulate in the cytosol. However, the affinity for xylitol is, with aKm of 180 mm, low. The xylitol dehydrogenases, where the affinities are known, have higher affinities for xylitol (Km 25 and 26 mm forS. cerevisiae (11Richard P. Toivari M.H. Penttilä M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and P. stipitis (26Rizzi M. Harwart K. Erlemann P. Bui-Thanh N.-A. Dellweg H. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1989; 67: 20-24Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar), respectively), so that the activity of l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase with xylitol might be not very important under normal conditions. Even if this reaction occurs, the product of the oxidation of xylitol is xylulose (d-xylulose if the oxidation is in the same configuration as with l-arabinitol and adonitol), which is an intermediate in the pathway. With other sugar alcohols such as d-arabinitol, d-mannitol, andd-sorbitol we found no activity. The enzyme is strictly NAD-dependent (Km 180 µm) with no activity being observed with NADP. A eukaryotic pathway forl-arabinose was first described by Chiang and Knight (27Chiang C. Knight S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1960; 3: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Until now none of the genes that are specific for this pathway were identified. Only the genes that also form the d-xylose pathway are known. Two genes of the l-arabinose pathway remained unidentified. In this work we identified one, the gene coding for l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase (lad1). The identification of this gene gives further support for the function of this pathway in fungi. Also the finding that it is only expressed when growing on l-arabinose suggests that this is the route forl-arabinose catabolism. The gene for thel-xylulose reductase is now the only unknown gene in the pathway. With only one enzyme missing in the pathway it should be now relatively easy to identify the corresponding gene and complete the pathway. Knowing all genes of the l-arabinose pathway would make it possible to engineer a yeast strain that can catabolizel-arabinose, which is of biotechnological relevance sincel-arabinose is a major component of plant material,i.e. it is a cheap raw material. An attempt to express the bacterial l-arabinose pathway in S. cerevisiaedid not lead to an active pathway (28Sedlac M. Ho N.W.Y. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2001; 28: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To express the fungal pathway in S. cerevisiae is another strategy. An expected problem in the fungal pathway is the imbalance of redox cofactors. The two reduction steps are NADPH-linked: the aldose reductase is NADPH-specific, or in the case of P. stipitis, has a preference for NADPH (9Verduyn C. van Kleef R. Frank J. Schreuder J.H. van Dijken J.P. Scheffers W.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 668-677Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The l-xylulose reductase, which was purified from A. niger, was also shown to be NADPH-specific (29Witteveen C.F.B. Weber F. Busink R. Visser J. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1679-1685Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The two oxidation steps are NAD-linked. For thel-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase this was shown in this work. All known d-xylulose reductases are also NAD-specific. This means that the overall process is redox neutral, but different redox cofactors are required. A transhydrogenase reaction could help to balance the cofactors, but such an activity has not been reported forS. cerevisiae or for any other fungal organism (30Bruinenberg P.M. Jonker R. van Dijken J.P. Scheffers W.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 142: 302-306Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2128171257,"The development of precise connections in the mammalian brain proceeds through refinement of initially diffuse patterns, a process that occurs largely within critical developmental windows. To elucidate the molecular pathways that orchestrate these early periods of circuit remodeling, we have examined the role of a calcium- and cAMP-regulated transcriptional pathway. We show that there is a window of CRE/CREB-mediated gene expression in the developing thalamus, which precedes neocortical expression. In the LGN, this wave of gene expression occurs prior to visual experience, but requires retinal function. Mutant mice with reduced CREB expression show loss of refinement of retinogeniculate projections. These results suggest an important role of the CRE/CREB transcriptional pathway in the coordination of experience-independent circuit remodeling during forebrain development."

We stably overexpressed SOX9 cDNA in the rat chondrocytic cell line CFK2. Compared with the vector control, a greater proportion of SOX9-transfected cells accumulated in the G0/G1 phase. This was associated with an increase in mRNA and protein expression of p21cip1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase activity. SOX9 enhanced p21cip1 promoter activity in a luciferase reporter assay. CFK2 cells overexpressing SOX9 became more elongated and adhesive and demonstrated a shift in cytoplasmic F-actin distribution.

SOX9 is also expressed in testis, brain, and heart and is a relative of the mammalian Y-linked sex-determining gene, SRY. In humans, inactivating mutations in the SOX9 gene cause campomelic dysplasia, a malformation syndrome associated with sex reversal and severe abnormalities in skeletal development resulting in neonatal death (15Foster J.W.

To explore the mechanism of SOX9 function in chondrocyte development, we overexpressed SOX9 in the chondrocytic cell line CFK2 and examined its effect on cell proliferation and differentiation. Our results demonstrate an effect of SOX9 on cell cycle regulation and identify several key genes that may be modulated by SOX9 activity and contribute to its capacity to enhance chondrocyte differentiation.DISCUSSIONSOX genes are evolutionarily conserved and play critical roles in decisions of cell fate in a variety of developmental processes. SOX9 is a master regulator of cartilage formation and may act cooperatively with SOX5 and SOX6 to regulate chondrogenesis (29Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). To assess effects of SOX9 on chondrocyte development, we overexpressed this transcription factor in a rat chondrocytic cell line (CFK2) that normally expresses low levels of SOX9 as well as SOX5. SOX9-overexpressing CFK2 cells exhibited increased levels of the endogenous transcript, suggesting that SOX9 may feed back to enhance its own gene transcription.During initial stages of chondrocyte differentiation, pre-chondrocytic mesenchymal cells aggregate and turn on cartilage-specific genes, but presumably must also undergo growth arrest. SOX9 is known to control the initial steps of chondrocyte differentiation, and recent studies have emphasized the role that cell cycle regulators play in the coordination of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (30Beier F. Taylor A.C. LuValle P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30273-30279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of SOX9 on the cell cycle distribution of transfected CFK2 cells. We demonstrate here for the first time the role of SOX9 as a cell cycle regulator and provide a molecular mechanism for this action.In SOX9-overexpressing cells, a greater proportion of the cells accumulated in the G0/G1 phase, although some increase in the S phase was also observed. Although the retinoblastoma protein level remained unchanged between the vector- and SOX9-transfected cells, the level of p53 was significantly reduced (Fig. 3), suggesting that p53 is negatively regulated by SOX9 in chondrocytes. The tumor suppressor gene p53 plays a major role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, stalling cells at the G1phase when DNA is damaged and allowing it to be repaired before progression through the cell cycle resumes (31Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 32Weber J.D. Jeffers J.R. Rehg J.E. Randle D.H. Lozano G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Zambetti G.P.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2434-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Consequently, the decreased p53 level may have contributed to the enhanced proportion of SOX9-overexpressing cells in S phase. However, the major alteration observed was the increase in cells in G0/G1 together with increased expression of the cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip1. Similar to other SOX and high mobility group proteins (34Connor F. Cary P.D. Read C.M. Preston N.S. Driscoll P.C. Denny P. Crane-Robinson C. Ashworth A.

Using a luciferase reporter construct, we showed that SOX9 can activate transcription via a p21cip1 promoter sequence. The 2.5-kb promoter region of p21 that we used contains three consensus sequences of the type described above, one or more of which may bind the high mobility group box of the SOX9 protein, facilitating the observed transactivation. The action of increased p21cip1expression may then promote G0/G1 arrest of increased numbers of the chondrocytic cells and, as with transforming growth factor-β (37Boumediene K. Felisaz N. Pujol J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), facilitate their enhanced differentiation.Human SOX9, which is 96% identical to the mouse protein, has 509 amino acids. Functional domains include a high mobility group DNA-binding motif at positions 104–182 and a COOH-terminal transactivation domain at positions 402–509 that is SPQ-rich (15Foster J.W. Dominguez-Steglich M.A. Guioli S. Kwok C. Weller P.A. Stevanovic M. Weissenbach J. Mansour S. Young I.D. Goodfellow P.N. Brook J.D. Schafer A.J.

There is a PQA domain at positions 339–379, the function of which is unknown. Signal-dependent nuclear transport of proteins (38Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E.

Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We noted that two putative bipartite nuclear localization sequences at positions 104–120 and 163–176 are present in the human SOX9 protein (Table I). Our studies demonstrate the importance of these sequences for nuclear import of the protein (Fig. 5), which is a prerequisite for SOX9 to exert its role as a transactivator (Fig. 9).CFK2 cells overexpressing SOX9 altered their cell shape, becoming more adhesive; and the distribution of the cytoskeletal protein actin changed. Previous studies have shown the importance of a number of adhesion molecules during condensation of chondroprogenitor mesenchymal cells, including N-cadherin, neural cell adhesion molecule, and fibronectin (41Oberlender S.A. Tuan R.S. Development. 1994; 120: 177-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Tavella S. Bellese G. Castagnola P. Martin P. Piccini D. Doliana R. Colombatti A. Cancedda R. Tacchetti C. J.

We therefore examined the possible role of N-cadherin as a downstream target of SOX9. N-cadherin is one of a family of calcium-dependent intracellular cell adhesion molecules that, through their interaction with the cytoskeleton, physically link cells with each other and with the extracellular matrix and play a critical role in development (45Vleminckx K. Kemler R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). N-cadherin protein and mRNA levels were elevated in the SOX9-transfected CFK2 cells. In contrast, the levels of the adhesion molecule β-catenin were unchanged. We noted several putative SOX9-binding motifs in the chicken N-cadherin gene promoter, and we examined the capacity of SOX9 to transactivate the N-cadherin gene. SOX9 markedly increased promoter activity, and nuclear extracts from SOX9-transfected CFK2 cells specifically bound an oligonucleotide encoding a SOX9-binding motif derived from the N-cadherin promoter sequence. Consequently, N-cadherin may be an important downstream target of SOX9 in altering chondrocytic cell adhesion.SOX9 accelerated the differentiation of the CFK2 cells along the chondrocyte pathway (Fig. 10). Previous studies have implicated the modulation of ERK1 in chondrogenesis (27Chang S.H. Oh C.D. Yang M.S. Kang S.S. Lee Y.S. Sonn J.K. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and we assessed the effect of SOX9 on this protein. Both transcript and protein levels of ERK1 were reduced in SOX9-overexpressing cells, but this was not observed with ERK2. ERK1 down-regulation may lie in the pathway of SOX9-induced chondrocyte differentiation. Interestingly, fibroblast growth factor-induced SOX9 expression has been reported to be associated with stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (46Murakami S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Reciprocal modulation of the activity of this pathway may therefore be critical in sustaining the levels of SOX9 necessary for differentiation and the capacity of SOX9 to act as a differentiating agent.Our results show that SOX9 can act both as a transcriptional activator and a repressor of gene expression in chondrocytic cells. This is fully consistent with the recent demonstration that SOX9 regulates target genes by pairing with specific partners (47Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Thus, a transcription factor (αA-crystallin-binding protein-1 with a zinc finger domain) has been shown to interact with SOX9 to negatively regulate a chondrocyte-specific enhancer of the type II collagen gene (48Tanaka K. Matsumoto Y. Nakatani F. Iwamoto Y. Yamada Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4428-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas the interaction between SOX9 and steroidogenic factor-1 leads to the activation of the AMH gene (49De Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Sudbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). It will be important to investigate whether any of the co-regulators identified to date interact with SOX9 to modulate the reduction we identified in ERK1 or the increase in p21 or N-cadherin expression.Our studies have identified several additional mechanisms and downstream modulators that are important for the function of SOX9 as a master regulator of chondrogenesis. They emphasize some of the pleiotropic effects that SOX9 exerts to coordinate the complex series of events inherent in chondrocyte differentiation. Skeletal morphogenesis begins with the induction of undifferentiated mesenchyme to form regions of high cell density or condensations that represent the outlines of future components of the skeleton. Cells in the center of these condensations change their phenotype to form pre-chondrocytes and then chondrocytes capable of producing cartilaginous matrix and forming the cartilage anlage of developing bone (1Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A cassette of cytokines and growth factors is involved in the stepwise development and maturation of the cartilaginous growth plate and includes, among others, bone morphogenetic protein, fibroblast growth factor, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, and Indian hedgehog (2Karaplis A.C.

Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors such as HOX and PAX family members are involved in the patterning of skeletal primordia (4LeClair E.E. Bonfiglio L. Tuan R.S. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 214: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Martin J.F. Bradley A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1237-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 6ten Berge D. Brouwer A. Korving J. Martin J.F. Meijlink F. Development. 1998; 125: 3831-3842PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, SOX9, a transcription factor containing a high mobility group DNA-binding domain, has been implicated in commitment of mesenchymal cells to the chondrogenic lineage and to chondrocyte differentiation. Its expression in all pre-chondrocytic and chondrocytic cells during embryonic development is consistent with this role (7Ng L.J. Wheatley S. Muscat G.E. Conway-Campbell J. Bowles J. Wright E.

SOX9 binding and activation of chondrocyte-specific enhancer elements in the chondrocyte-specific Col2a1 and Col11a2 genes has been demonstrated (11Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S.

Consequently, the decreased p53 level may have contributed to the enhanced proportion of SOX9-overexpressing cells in S phase.

Previous studies have implicated the modulation of ERK1 in chondrogenesis (27Chang S.H. Oh C.D. Yang M.S. Kang S.S. Lee Y.S. Sonn J.K. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and we assessed the effect of SOX9 on this protein. Both transcript and protein levels of ERK1 were reduced in SOX9-overexpressing cells, but this was not observed with ERK2. ERK1 down-regulation may lie in the pathway of SOX9-induced chondrocyte differentiation. Interestingly, fibroblast growth factor-induced SOX9 expression has been reported to be associated with stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (46Murakami S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Reciprocal modulation of the activity of this pathway may therefore be critical in sustaining the levels of SOX9 necessary for differentiation and the capacity of SOX9 to act as a differentiating agent.Our results show that SOX9 can act both as a transcriptional activator and a repressor of gene expression in chondrocytic cells. This is fully consistent with the recent demonstration that SOX9 regulates target genes by pairing with specific partners (47Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Thus, a transcription factor (αA-crystallin-binding protein-1 with a zinc finger domain) has been shown to interact with SOX9 to negatively regulate a chondrocyte-specific enhancer of the type II collagen gene (48Tanaka K. Matsumoto Y. Nakatani F. Iwamoto Y. Yamada Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4428-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas the interaction between SOX9 and steroidogenic factor-1 leads to the activation of the AMH gene (49De Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Sudbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). It will be important to investigate whether any of the co-regulators identified to date interact with SOX9 to modulate the reduction we identified in ERK1 or the increase in p21 or N-cadherin expression.Our studies have identified several additional mechanisms and downstream modulators that are important for the function of SOX9 as a master regulator of chondrogenesis. They emphasize some of the pleiotropic effects that SOX9 exerts to coordinate the complex series of events inherent in chondrocyte differentiation. SOX genes are evolutionarily conserved and play critical roles in decisions of cell fate in a variety of developmental processes. SOX9 is a master regulator of cartilage formation and may act cooperatively with SOX5 and SOX6 to regulate chondrogenesis (29Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). To assess effects of SOX9 on chondrocyte development, we overexpressed this transcription factor in a rat chondrocytic cell line (CFK2) that normally expresses low levels of SOX9 as well as SOX5. SOX9-overexpressing CFK2 cells exhibited increased levels of the endogenous transcript, suggesting that SOX9 may feed back to enhance its own gene transcription. During initial stages of chondrocyte differentiation, pre-chondrocytic mesenchymal cells aggregate and turn on cartilage-specific genes, but presumably must also undergo growth arrest. SOX9 is known to control the initial steps of chondrocyte differentiation, and recent studies have emphasized the role that cell cycle regulators play in the coordination of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (30Beier F. Taylor A.C. LuValle P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30273-30279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of SOX9 on the cell cycle distribution of transfected CFK2 cells. We demonstrate here for the first time the role of SOX9 as a cell cycle regulator and provide a molecular mechanism for this action. In SOX9-overexpressing cells, a greater proportion of the cells accumulated in the G0/G1 phase, although some increase in the S phase was also observed. Although the retinoblastoma protein level remained unchanged between the vector- and SOX9-transfected cells, the level of p53 was significantly reduced (Fig. 3), suggesting that p53 is negatively regulated by SOX9 in chondrocytes. The tumor suppressor gene p53 plays a major role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, stalling cells at the G1phase when DNA is damaged and allowing it to be repaired before progression through the cell cycle resumes (31Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 32Weber J.D. Jeffers J.R. Rehg J.E. Randle D.H. Lozano G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Zambetti G.P.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2434-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Consequently, the decreased p53 level may have contributed to the enhanced proportion of SOX9-overexpressing cells in S phase. However, the major alteration observed was the increase in cells in G0/G1 together with increased expression of the cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip1. Similar to other SOX and high mobility group proteins (34Connor F. Cary P.D. Read C.M. Preston N.S. Driscoll P.C. Denny P. Crane-Robinson C. Ashworth A.

Using a luciferase reporter construct, we showed that SOX9 can activate transcription via a p21cip1 promoter sequence. The 2.5-kb promoter region of p21 that we used contains three consensus sequences of the type described above, one or more of which may bind the high mobility group box of the SOX9 protein, facilitating the observed transactivation. The action of increased p21cip1expression may then promote G0/G1 arrest of increased numbers of the chondrocytic cells and, as with transforming growth factor-β (37Boumediene K. Felisaz N. Pujol J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), facilitate their enhanced differentiation. Human SOX9, which is 96% identical to the mouse protein, has 509 amino acids. Functional domains include a high mobility group DNA-binding motif at positions 104–182 and a COOH-terminal transactivation domain at positions 402–509 that is SPQ-rich (15Foster J.W.

Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We noted that two putative bipartite nuclear localization sequences at positions 104–120 and 163–176 are present in the human SOX9 protein (Table I). Our studies demonstrate the importance of these sequences for nuclear import of the protein (Fig. 5), which is a prerequisite for SOX9 to exert its role as a transactivator (Fig. 9). CFK2 cells overexpressing SOX9 altered their cell shape, becoming more adhesive; and the distribution of the cytoskeletal protein actin changed. Previous studies have shown the importance of a number of adhesion molecules during condensation of chondroprogenitor mesenchymal cells, including N-cadherin, neural cell adhesion molecule, and fibronectin (41Oberlender S.A. Tuan R.S. Development. 1994; 120: 177-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Tavella S. Bellese G. Castagnola P. Martin P. Piccini D. Doliana R. Colombatti A. Cancedda R. Tacchetti C. J.

We therefore examined the possible role of N-cadherin as a downstream target of SOX9. N-cadherin is one of a family of calcium-dependent intracellular cell adhesion molecules that, through their interaction with the cytoskeleton, physically link cells with each other and with the extracellular matrix and play a critical role in development (45Vleminckx K. Kemler R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). N-cadherin protein and mRNA levels were elevated in the SOX9-transfected CFK2 cells. In contrast, the levels of the adhesion molecule β-catenin were unchanged. We noted several putative SOX9-binding motifs in the chicken N-cadherin gene promoter, and we examined the capacity of SOX9 to transactivate the N-cadherin gene. SOX9 markedly increased promoter activity, and nuclear extracts from SOX9-transfected CFK2 cells specifically bound an oligonucleotide encoding a SOX9-binding motif derived from the N-cadherin promoter sequence. Consequently, N-cadherin may be an important downstream target of SOX9 in altering chondrocytic cell adhesion. SOX9 accelerated the differentiation of the CFK2 cells along the chondrocyte pathway (Fig. 10). Previous studies have implicated the modulation of ERK1 in chondrogenesis (27Chang S.H. Oh C.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and we assessed the effect of SOX9 on this protein. Both transcript and protein levels of ERK1 were reduced in SOX9-overexpressing cells, but this was not observed with ERK2. ERK1 down-regulation may lie in the pathway of SOX9-induced chondrocyte differentiation. Interestingly, fibroblast growth factor-induced SOX9 expression has been reported to be associated with stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (46Murakami S. Kan M.

In vitro studies have revealed that upstream caspases are activated in response to apoptotic stimuli, and the active caspases in turn process downstream effector caspases that are involved in the destruction of cellular structure. Caspase-9 is an upstream caspase that can become active in response to cellular damage, including deprivation of growth factors and exposure to oxidative stress in vitro. Little is known, however, about how activation of caspase-9 is temporally and spatially regulated in vivo, e.g. during development. We have identified vimentin as the first example of a caspase-9 substrate that is not a downstream procaspase. Immunohistochemical analysis, using a specific antibody against the vimentin fragments generated by caspase-9, showed that caspase-9 cleaves vimentin in apoptotic cells in the embryonic nervous system and the interdigital regions.

All members of the caspase family are synthesized in a precursor form that requires specific processing for activation (1Lazebnik Y. Thornberry N.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar, 2Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). These enzymes can be broadly divided into two groups: initiator caspases (such as caspase-8, -9, and -12) and effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7). The main function of initiator caspases is to activate effector caspases, which are responsible for dismantling cellular structures. Cell biological studies have identified three main apoptotic pathways (the death receptor, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 stress, and mitochondrial pathways) that are activated by caspase-8, -12, and -9, respectively. Caspase-8 is recruited for activation to a death-inducing signaling complex only when death receptors such as Fas or the tumor necrosis factor receptor are oligomerized after the binding of specific ligands (3Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Caspase-12 is specifically activated by ER stress (4Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar), although the mechanism of its activation remains to be elucidated. In response to various death stimuli, mitochondria release cytochromec, which forms a complex with Apaf-1 to induce the aggregation and processing of procaspase-9 (5Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar, 6Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). In vitrostudies have shown that processed caspase-9 can activate effector caspases through direct processing (5Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). The importance of mitochondria in the apoptotic signaling pathway has increasingly become recognized because recent studies suggest that signals from both the death receptor and the ER pathways may converge onto the mitochondrial pathway (8Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar). These three pathways have mainly been studied in vitro using cultured cells (5Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar), so that little is known about how and when activation of the caspase cascade is triggered in vivo, e.g. during development. We have recently found that one of the major components of intermediate filaments, vimentin, can be a substrate for an initiator caspase (9Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Vimentin is cleaved at the Asp85, Asp259, and Asp429 residues by caspases during apoptosis of human T cells (9Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence, including the order of the multiple cleavages on the vimentin polypeptide, indicate that the initial cut is made at Asp259 by an initiator caspase, probably either caspase-8 or caspase-9. The Asp259 cleavage occurs in the absence of the activities of effector caspases (9Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The sequence around the cleavage site (Ile-Asp-Val-Asp259-Val) matches the sequence preferences of both caspases-8 and -9 in having an aliphatic amino acid residue at the P4 position (10Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 and caspase-6 likely cleave vimentin at Asp85 and Asp429, respectively, at a later stage in the cascade. In this study, we have further analyzed vimentin cleavage in apoptosis to identify the caspase responsible for the cleavage at Asp259. We prepared antibodies that specifically recognize the cleaved ends at Asp259, but not the intact form of vimentin. The antibodies detected the specific cleavage products of vimentin in cultured cells at an early stage of apoptosis. Treatment of cells with a specific inhibitor for caspase-9 suppressed such specific cleavage, whereas caspase-8 was active, cleaving Bid, a Bcl-2 family member (11Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar, 12Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar) in the presence of the inhibitor. Null mutation of caspase-8 did not affect the vimentin cleavage at Asp259. These results strongly suggest that caspase-9 is responsible for the cleavage of vimentin at Asp259. The major role of caspase-9 has been considered to be the transmission of the apoptotic signal from mitochondria to the downstream effector caspases. Our results suggest that caspase-9 can also function as an effector caspase that is involved in dismantling the cytoskeleton. Since vimentin is almost ubiquitously expressed in cells of developing tissues (13Lane E.B. Hogan B.L.M. Kurkinen M. Garrels J.I.

Neurosci. 1984; 4: 2080-2094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we expected that caspase-9 activation in many developing tissues could be detected through the cleavage of vimentin by the protease. We have taken advantage of the specificity of the antibodies for in situ detection of caspase-9 activation. Binding of the specific antibodies was detected in the embryonic nervous system and the interdigital regions, consistent with previous observations that gene knockouts of either caspase-9 (17Kuida K.

Briefly, an anti-V1 antibody and an anti-V2 antibody were generated by immunization of rabbits with synthetic peptides, V1 (CQIDVD) and V2 (VSKPDC), which were obtained from Bio-Synthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). In order to enhance antigenicity, the peptides were covalently attached to activated hemocyanin (Pierce) prior to immunization. The same peptides were immobilized on an FMP-Cellulofine resin (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) for affinity purification of the peptide-specific antibodies. Immunoglobulins adsorbed to the peptide resin were eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.6) and then neutralized by adding 1 m Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane. Jurkat and SKW6.4 cells (ATCC) were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). A caspase-8-deficient mutant of Jurkat cells (I9-2) and its parental cells (A3) were kindly provided by Dr. John Blenis (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Bcl-2-overexpressing Jurkat cells, Jurkat/HB2–8 and Jurkat/HB2–10, were gifts from Drs. Y. Eguchi and Y. Tsujimoto (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Apoptosis induction was performed as described previously (9Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were treated with 200 ng/ml anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (clone CH-11, Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) and 20 µg/ml cycloheximide (Calbiochem) or 1 µm staurosporine (Calbiochem). For the inhibitor experiment, cells were pretreated with 10 µm peptide inhibitor (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) for 1 h, and then they were induced to die with Fas activation. Cell lysates were prepared by washing cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspending the cell pellet in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6m urea, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.003% bromphenol blue, 5% mercaptoethanol). The sample was sonicated on ice for 20 s to break DNA, then incubated for 15 min at 65 °C immediately before loading onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol). An anti-vimentin mouse monoclonal antibody (V9, Sigma-Aldrich) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) were used to detect intact vimentin as well as its fragments. The anti-V1 and anti-V2 antibodies were used in combination with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) to specifically detect the cleaved fragments. An anti-Bid polyclonal antibody was purchased from R&D Systems. For detection of vimentin fragments in developing limbs, either forelimbs or hindlimbs were excised from E13.5 embryos, followed by sonication on ice for 1 min. Cell debris was pelleted down, and cleared lysates were used for protein concentration determination and Western blot analysis. Protein concentration was measured with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), using purified bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) as a standard. Immunostaining and detection were done using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Vimentin proteins were prepared byin vitro transcription and translation using a TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Either the wild-type or D259N mutant vimentin (0.5 µl) was incubated at 37 °C with purified caspase-9 (1 unit, Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) for 6 h. The reaction mixture contained 20 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 19 µg/ml aprotinin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 100 µm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich). For the inhibitor experiment, 10 µm LEHD-FMK (Medical and Biological Laboratories) was included in the reaction mixture. Cleavage products were analyzed by 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Detection of proteins was done by Western blot analysis with the anti-V1 antibody as described above. BL6/J mice were mated at night, and the following morning was designated gestational day 0.5 (E0.5). Pregnant mice were sacrificed at E10.5, E13.5, or E18.5 by cervical dislocation. Embryos were dissected free of extra-embryonic membranes and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Embryos were then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 µm on a microtome, and mounted in series. For immunohistochemistry, sections were rehydrated through a graded series of alcohols. Sections were rinsed in PBS, then blocked in PBS containing 1.5% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories). Rabbit anti-V1 antibody (1:1,000) was added in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) and used to immunostain the sections. After overnight incubation of the sections with the antibody at 4 °C, immunoreactivity was detected using biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories), and then indirectly fluorescently labeled with Alexa594-conjugated streptavidin (1:200; Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's protocol. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed by using an apoptosis detection kit (Takara Biomedicals, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich) was used to counterstain nuclei in the sections. For analysis of vimentin cleavage in apoptotic cells, human B cells (SKW6.4) were induced to die by treatment with an anti-Fas antibody, and then both intact and cleaved vimentin were extracted from the cells. A commercially available anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody (V9) detects both intact vimentin (58 kDa) and its cleavage products (47, 41, 28, and 22 kDa) (Fig. 1A and Ref.9Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with our previous observation that vimentin was cleaved at Asp85, Asp259 and Asp429 in a human T cell line, Jurkat (9Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To raise antibodies that specifically recognize the cleaved ends at Asp259, but not the intact form of vimentin, we immunized rabbits with oligopeptides whose sequences corresponded to either Gln255-Ile-Asp-Val-Asp259 (peptide V1) or Val260-Ser-Lys-Pro-Asp264 (peptide V2). Since these sequences are conserved in the vimentin of several mammals (e.g. human, mouse, and rat), the specific antibodies raised against these peptides could be versatile tools for the detection of vimentin cleavage. The antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography from the antisera. To determine the specificity of these antibodies, they were used to probe Western blots of extracts from apoptotic cultured cells. The anti-V1 antibody specifically recognized 31- and 21-kDa fragments, whereas the anti-V2 antibody detected 28- and 22-kDa fragments in extracts of dying cells (Fig. 1B). Neither antibody recognized the 58-kDa intact form, indicating that these antibodies are specific to the cleaved ends. The 31-kDa (V1-positive) and 28-kDa (V2-positive) fragments transiently appeared during early apoptosis, whereas the smaller fragments (21-kDa fragment for V1, 22-kDa fragment for V2) appeared no earlier than the larger fragments and persisted afterward. According to the proposed model of apoptotic signaling, activation of initiator caspases is followed by activation of downstream caspases including caspase-3 and caspase-6 (reviewed in Ref.22Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 is predicted to efficiently cleave vimentin at Asp85 within the 31-kDa V1-positive fragment, whereas caspase-6 is expected to cleave at Asp429 in the V2-positive fragment of 28 kDa (Fig. 1C and Ref. 9Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Among caspase family members, caspase-8 (3Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar) and caspase-10 (23Vincenz C. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6578-6583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) are the cell surface death receptor-associated proteases whose activation has been observed in response to stimulation of the death receptors. To examine the possible involvement of these receptor-associated caspases in the vimentin cleavage at Asp259, we used a caspase-8-deficient mutant of Jurkat cells (I9-2, Ref. 24Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Fig.2A shows that vimentin cleavage at Asp259 did not occur in I9-2 cells that were treated with anti-Fas antibody. Since the caspase-8-dependent apoptotic pathway from the death receptor to the mitochondria is impaired in this cell line, activation of caspase-9 is also expected to be suppressed. In this cell line, however, caspase-10 is expressed at wild-type levels (24Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The absence of the V1-positive signal thus suggests that caspase-10 is not involved in the vimentin cleavage. We next examined vimentin cleavage in Jurkat cells, either wild type or the caspase-8-deficient mutant, after apoptotic induction of cells with staurosporine, a general kinase inhibitor which can induce apoptosis regardless of death receptor stimulation. Fig. 2B shows that the V1-specific signals (31 and 21 kDa) were detected in both wild-type and mutant cells when treated with staurosporine. This result indicates that vimentin can be cleaved in cells without caspase-8, leaving caspase-9 as the best candidate for the Asp259cleavage. We have previously detected the Asp259 cleavage of vimentin in a Bcl-2-overexpressing cell line, Jurkat/HB2–8, after induction of apoptosis through Fas stimulation (9Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is expected to inhibit the caspase cascade at the mitochondrial step. Activation of caspase-3 and caspase-6 was almost completely suppressed in the cell line, supporting the idea that caspase-9 upstream of these effector caspases is responsible for the Asp259 cleavage. The cleavage was much less prominent than that in the parental cell line (9Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), probably due to marginal activation of caspase-9. To confirm that caspase-9, located downstream of the mitochondrial step in apoptotic signaling, was responsible for the cleavage, we examined vimentin cleavage in another Bcl-2-overexpressing cell line, Jurkat/HB2–10. This cell line showed higher resistance to Fas stimulation than did Jurkat/HB2–8. Fas stimulation did not induce apoptosis, and we detected no vimentin cleavage (Fig. 2C), consistent with the idea that the Asp259 cleavage is an event downstream of the mitochondrial step. To examine if the vimentin cleavage at Asp259 is dependent on caspase-9, we induced apoptosis of wild-type Jurkat cells in the presence of a peptide inhibitor specific for caspase-9 (LEHD-FMK, Ref.25Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar). Fig. 2D shows that LEHD-FMK significantly suppressed generation of the V1-specific fragments (31 and 21 kDa) of vimentin in Jurkat cells. Control experiments showed that a caspase-3-specific inhibitor (DEVD-CHO) did not reduce the cleavage at Asp259, whereas a general inhibitor for caspases (Z-VAD, Ref. 26Koonz D.J. Abruzzese R.V. Miller R.E. Pagani K.A. Dolle R.E. Ator M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1331-1338PubMed Google Scholar) did. The 31-kDa fragment was stable in the presence of the caspase-3-specific inhibitor, because the fragment was not further digested due to lack of the caspase-3 activity. Caspase-8 was still active in the presence of LEHD-FMK, as shown by cleavage of a caspase-8 substrate, Bid (Fig.2E). These results indicate that the vimentin cleavage at Asp259 is dependent on caspase-9, whereas active caspase-8 does not cleave vimentin in apoptotic cells. The suppression of the V1-specific vimentin cleavage by LEHD-FMK, the absence of vimentin cleavage in Jurkat/HB2–10 cells, and the independence of the Asp259 cleavage from caspase-8 strongly suggest that caspase-9, and not caspase-8 or caspase-10, cleaves vimentin at Asp259 in apoptotic cells. To examine whether caspase-9 can, in fact, cleave the Asp259 site, we performed a cleavage assay of vimentin with purified caspase-9. Preliminary experiments showed that vimentin had multiple cleavage sites for caspase-9 in vitro, the major one being Asp-Ser-Val-Asp85 (data not shown). Fig.3shows that caspase-9 cleavage generated a 21-kDa fragment that was detected by the V1 antibody, whereas LEHD-FMK suppressed the generation of the V1-specific fragment. Mutation at Asp259 (D259N) in the vimentin polypeptide abolished the cleavage, indicating that the caspase-9 cleavage occurred at the Asp259 site within wild type vimentin. Taken together with the results of vimentin cleavage in cultured cells, we conclude that caspase-9 cleaves vimentin at Asp259 during the early stage of apoptosis. This is the first example of a caspase-9 substrate that is not a precursor form of a caspase family member. The cleavage site-directed antibodies were used to stain apoptotic Jurkat T cells. After 6 h of incubation with the anti-Fas antibody, over 80% of Jurkat cells in culture showed either condensed or fragmented nuclei with DAPI staining, a morphology typical of dying cells (Fig. 4A,arrowheads). These apoptotic cells were intensely labeled by the anti-V1 antibody, which was visualized by a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (Fig. 4B). The same antibody barely detected cells in the same culture containing normal nuclei (Fig.4B, arrow). A similar staining pattern was also obtained from the anti-V2 antibody (data not shown). Control experiments, in which the anti-Fas antibody was omitted, showed that growing Jurkat cells were stained by anti-V1 only at a background level (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that the cleavage site-directed antibodies can be used for the staining and detection of apoptotic cells in which vimentin is cleaved by caspase-9. Vimentin cleavage by caspase-9 starts at an early stage of apoptosis, preceding the changes in nuclear morphology that can be visualized with DAPI staining (9Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We next examined the time course of the appearance of the V1 positive signals, in comparison with that of TUNEL (27Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9100) Google Scholar). It has been established that digestion of chromosomal DNA occurs at a late stage of apoptosis, after the DNase responsible for the fragmentation of DNA, CAD, becomes active through proteolysis of its specific inhibitor (ICAD) by a downstream caspase, caspase-3 (28Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). One can thus expect that the reactivity of dying cells to the V1 antibody and TUNEL would change according to the following order: (i) V1-negative, TUNEL-negative; (ii) V1-positive, TUNEL-negative; (iii) V1 and TUNEL double-positive. Phase I would occur before and at the earliest onset of apoptosis. Following a 3-h treatment of cells with the anti-Fas antibody to induce apoptosis, more than 50% of the cells were V1-positive, about half of which were also TUNEL-positive (Fig.4D); this corresponds to an overlap of phase II and phase III. After a 6-h treatment, almost all of the V1-positive cells (over 80% of cells in the culture) were also stained by TUNEL (phase III; Fig. 4E). These results suggest that cells first become V1-positive due to the cleavage of vimentin by caspase-9 and then suffer chromosomal DNA digestion. It should be noted that the percentage of V1-positive cells in the culture significantly decreased after a longer treatment with the anti-Fas antibody, probably because of the disintegration of the filamentous structure of vimentin (9Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After an 18-h incubation with anti-Fas, most TUNEL-positive cells showed only faint signals with V1 staining (Fig. 4F), whereas fewer than 10% of apoptotic cells still exhibited intense labeling with the V1 antibody. These results indicate that the cleavage-specific antibody can recognize the vimentin fragments during early stages of apoptosis, after which apoptotic cells lose the immunoreactivity. This suggests the presence of a fourth phase (phase IV) in which the cells are V1-negative and TUNEL-positive. We have detected these staining patterns in mouse embryos, which will be described in the following sections. We did not further use the V2 antibody for the staining of embryos because it did not label cells in paraffin-embedded sections (data not shown). Neuronal cell death in both the central and peripheral nervous systems is a paradigm of developmental apoptosis, which involves the loss of a significant number of neurons in a given population (e.g. 20–80%; Ref. 29Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2744) Google Scholar). We immunostained E10.5 mouse embryos with the anti-V1 antibody and detected clusters of V1-positive signals in the lamina terminalis of the forebrain (Fig.5A). The lamina terminalis was also stained by TUNEL (Fig. 5B), consistent with previous observations by others (30Raff M.C. Nature. 1993; 356: 397-400Crossref Scopus (2486) Google Scholar, 31Kuan C.-Y. Roth K.A. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 291-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Although some apoptotic cells in the lamina terminalis were stained by both the V1 antibody and TUNEL (Fig.5C, arrowheads), most apoptotic cells were either V1-positive (phase II) or TUNEL-positive (phase IV). This result could be explained if phase III persists for only a short time, thereby making the transition from phase II to phase IV too short to detect. Alternatively, chromosomal DNA digestion may start after the V1 immunoreactivity of dying cells is lost, so that apoptotic cells are never in phase III (see “Discussion”).

The envelope protein of each HIV/SIV is synthesized first as a gp160 polyprotein precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum. Post-translational modification processes include glycosylation, oligomerization, and cleavage into gp120 and gp41 by a furin-like enzyme in the Golgi network, with subsequent transport to the surface of the infected cells (6Allan J.S.

Hence, after gp120 on the virus surface binds with its receptor, CD4, on the T cell, a conformational change occurs within the envelope inducing gp120 to bind to cellular chemokine coreceptors, typically CCR5 or CXCR4 (see Refs. 14Choe H.

This second binding event triggers gp41 fusion between the virus and the cell membranes with additional conformational transitions permitting viral genome entry into the infected cells. There are two proteolytic cleavage sites within gp160 necessary for its processing to generate the mature gp120 and gp41 subunits (17McCune J.M. Rabin L.B. Feinberg M.B. Lieberman M. Kosek J.C.

Apparently, certain of the aforementioned conformational changes fail to occur when the gp120 and gp41 components are tethered together by a covalent linkage. The propensity for HIV envelope proteins to undergo oligomerization has been reported in previous studies. For example, mammalian cell-expressed gp160 as well as various truncation variants (22Earl P.L. Doms R.W. Moss B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or gp140 (a gp160 ectodomain lacking gp41 transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments) (23Hallenberger S. Tucker S.P. Owens R.J. Bernstein H.B.

Likewise, gp140s of three primary macrophage tropic HIV-1 isolates expressed in BHK-1 cells consisted of heterogeneous oligomers (25Staropoli I. Chanel C. Girard M. Altmeyer R. J. Biol.

A stable HIV gp140 trimer was obtained using protein engineering, substantially modifying the envelope by introducing cysteines to create intersubunit disulfide bonds, eliminating gp120/gp41 cleavage sites and adding GCN4 trimeric helices (27Yang X.

The gp41 ectodomain comprises a fusion peptide, an N-terminal α-helical segment, a glycosylated loop region, a C-terminal α-helical segment, and a short, tryptophan-rich membrane linker. The N-terminal helix of each gp41 subunit forms a central parallel trimeric coiled-coil, whereas the C-terminal helix packs against this core in an antiparallel manner to create a six-helix bundle in the postfusion state. Based upon this result, the structure of gp160 was predicted to be a trimer as well. The crystal structure of a monomeric gp120 core, albeit with variable loop deletions and truncation of both N- and C termini, has been determined in complex with CD4 and an anti-gp120 mAb 17b Fab fragment (15Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). While extremely important, this structure of the gp120 monomer includes only 60% of gp120 residues and represents the structure of the remaining gp120 after conformational change has been induced by CD4 binding. The structure of gp120 prior to CD4 binding remains unknown, although the pre-CD4 contacted envelope state might represent the most critical structural information for design of fusion inhibitors or the development of protective anti-HIV vaccines. In this regard, a detailed structural understanding of the intact HIV envelope oligomer is a worthwhile goal. We report here the expression and purification of stable trimeric gp140 of the macrophage-tropic, CCR5-dependent ADA strain of HIV (35Lai J.P. Ho W.Z. Zhan G.X. Yi Y. Collman R.G. Douglas S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3970-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Westervelt P. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3097-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and an ADA/SIV chimera produced in a Lec3.2.8.1 derivative of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Both gp140 proteins are secreted into culture supernatants in 4–5 mg/liter quantities and are trimeric as assessed by analytical ultracentrifugation. The recombinant envelopes are correctly folded based upon CD analysis, reactivity with mAbs, and nanomolar sCD4 binding activity. In contrast to SIV gp140, which shows weaker binding than its monomeric gp120 counterpart, ADA gp140 and ADA/SIV gp140 chimeras bind sCD4 with affinities comparable with the ADA gp120 monomer. The implications of these differences and future potential to investigate HIV envelope glycoprotein trimers in structural terms are discussed. The pEE14-GS vector (37Bebbington C.R. Rennder G. Thomson S. King D. Abrams D. Yarranton G.T. Biotechnology. 1992; 10: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) containing a Kozak sequence and encoding the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader peptide in lieu of the endogenous viral sequence upstream of the mature gp140 coding sequence was used for all expression constructs. A stop codon was incorporated at the C terminus of the truncated gp41 ectodomain. The pEE14-ADA140 construct contained HIV-1 ADA gp140 coding sequence truncated after Lys632(numbered beginning from the first amino acid residue of the mature ADA envelope protein). Briefly, PCR-1, consisting of a Kozak cassette, the tPA leader sequence, and ADA gp120 mature coding sequence, was amplified by Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using a pair of amplimers (5-GCTCTAGAAGGGACGCTGTGAAGCAATC-3′ and 5′-CACAAAGACCCCTCTTTTTTCTCTCTGCACCAC-3′) with pEE14-ADA120 as a template, itself derived by PCR from P009, which contains the HIV-1 ADA cDNA (36Westervelt P. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3097-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). 2C. W-H. Zhang, Y. Chishti, R. E. Hussey, and E. L. Reinherz, unpublished results. PCR-2, which contains truncated ADA gp41 coding sequence, was amplified by a pair of primers (5′-AGACCTGGGGGAGGAGATATGAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCTCACTTATCTAATG-3′) using the same P009 plasmid template (36Westervelt P. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3097-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Both PCR-1 and PCR-2 were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) to create pCR-1 and pCR-2. After DNA sequencing, pCR-1 and pCR-2 were digested with XbaI plus MunI orMunI plus EcoRI, respectively. The digested fragments were gel-purified and ligated into theXbaI/EcoRI double-digested pEE14-GS vector at XbaI and EcoRI cloning sites to generate the recombinant expression plasmid pEE14-ADA140. The HIV/SIV chimeric gp140, which fuses the HIV-1 ADA gp120 mature coding sequence to a truncated SIV Mac 32H gp41 sequence was expressed in pEE14-ADA/SIV140. The SIV gp41 is truncated at Ser626(numbers starting from the first amino acid residue of the mature ADA gp120). To amplify the SIV gp41 ectodomain-encoding fragment, PCR-3 was generated by a pair of primers (5′-AGAGAAAAAAGAGGGGTCTTTGTGCTAGGGTTC-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCTCAGCT ATTCAACTTTTGTAATTCATAC-3′) using pSIV-M as template (29Chen B. Zhou G. Kim M. Chishti Y. Hussey R.E. Ely B. Skehel J.J. Reinherz E.L. Harrison S.C. Wiley D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34946-34953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PCR-4 was created using a pair of primers (5′-AGACCTGGGGGAGGAGATATGAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCTCAGCTATTCAACTTTTGTAATTCATAC-3′) and PCR-1 and PCR-3 as templates, fusing a segment of the HIV-1 gp120 C terminus with the truncated SIV gp41. The resulting PCR-4 was cloned into pCR2.1 vector as well to generate pCR-4 and sequenced. pCR-1 and pCR-4 were digested with XbaI plus MunI and MunI plusEcoRI, respectively, and the two resulting DNA fragments were then cloned into XbaI/EcoRI double-digested pEE14-GS to generate the expression plasmid pEE14-ADA/SIV140 (Fig.1). To introduce a mutation in the gp160 primary cleavage site in pEE14-ADA140, the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) employing Pfu polymerase was employed. Briefly, two mutagenesis primers (5′-GTGGTGCAGAGAGAAAAAAGCGCAGTGGGAACGATAGGAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTCCTATCGTTCCCACTGCGCTTTTTTCTCTCTGCACCAC-3′) were used to convert Arg477 to Ser477, extending nicked, circular PCR DNA with pCR-1 as a template. Following PCR, the products were treated with DpnI so that the parental DNA template would be digested. After transformation, the mutant double-stranded DNA plasmid, pCR-1m, was created. Subsequently, the digested pCR-1m (XbaI and MunI) and pCR-2 (MunI and EcoRI) were ligated intoXbaI/EcoRI double-digested pEE14-GS to generate the expression vector pEE14-ADA140C1. All of the above constructs were verified by DNA restriction digest analysis and DNA sequencing. Stable envelope-expressing CHO-Lec3.2.8.1 cell lines were established as previously described (38Liu J. Tse A.G. Chang H.C. Liu J. Wang J. Hussey R.E. Chishti Y. Reinhold B. Spoerl R. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Reinherz E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33639-33646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using constructs of pEE14-ADA140, pEE14-ADA/SIV140, and pEE14-ADA140C1. Briefly, 10 µg of plasmid DNA was transfected into the CHO-Lec3.2.8.1 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Transfection MBS Mammalian Transfection Kit; Stratagene). Under the selection pressure of 25 µmmethionine sulfoximine in GMEM culture media (Life Technologies, Inc.), clones with the highest expression level of secreted gp140 were selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). For ELISA, Immulon plates (Dynatech Laboratory Inc.) were coated with 1A3 mAb (mouse mAb produced against HIV-1 SF-2 gp120 and mapping to the V3 loop of both gp120SF2 and gp120ADA) at a concentration of 4 µg/ml in PBS at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 2 h, 50 µl of culture supernatant of each transfected clone was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following washes with PBS plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2 µg/ml biotinylated 16F10 mAb (mouse mAb raised against HIV-1 ADA gp120 reactive with an epitope distinct from that of the 1A3 mAb) was applied at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Plates were washed extensively and developed by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Sigma). The highest expressing clones were selected and rescreened again. The protein products of selected clones were confirmed by immunoprecipitation using 1A3 mAb GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and further verified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing (DFCI Molecular Biology Core Facility). Large scale production of soluble gp140 was carried out as previously described in 175-cm2 flasks (Falcon) using confluent cultures with 4 mm sodium butyrate induction for 6 days (38Liu J. Tse A.G. Chang H.C. Liu J. Wang J. Hussey R.E. Chishti Y. Reinhold B. Spoerl R. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Reinherz E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33639-33646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To prevent protease cleavage, a mixture of protease inhibitors including leupeptin (0.5 µg/ml), chymostatin (0.5 µg/ml), antipain (0.5 µg/ml), pepstatin A (0.5 µg/ml), trypsin inhibitor (0.02 µg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.25 mm) was added to the postproduction supernatants. After centrifugation and subsequent filtration through a Corning filter (0.22 µm), the soluble gp140 protein in 2–3 liters of culture supernatant was purified through a 1A3 mAb affinity column (5-ml beads) created by cross-linking GammaBind Plus Sepharose with 1A3 mAb at a concentration of 5 mg/ml using dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce). The supernatants were loaded onto the affinity column at a speed of 0.5 ml/min, and the bound gp140 was eluted using 0.5 m acetic acid at pH 3.0 and immediately neutralized to pH 7.2 by the addition of 1 m Tris, pH 9.0. Fractions that contained the gp140 protein were pooled, concentrated to 2 ml, and further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (1.6 × 60 cm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in PBS on FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The CD spectra were collected on an Aviv circular dichroism spectrometer model 62DS at 25 °C. The concentrations of purified trimeric gp140ADAC1 and gp140ADA/SIV proteins were each 0.35 mg/ml in PBS. The molar ellipticity (θ) was monitored as the average of 12 scans with 0.5-nm bandwidth and 1.0-nm wavelength increments from 200 to 260 nm. The resulting spectra were corrected according to the base line by using PBS buffer alone. The affinity-purified and sized gp140ADAC1 and gp140ADA/SIV proteins in PBS were analyzed by centrifugation at speeds of 6000 and 8000 rpm on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifugation at 4 °C. The concentrations of both proteins were 0.19 and 0.35 mg/ml, respectively, with the data fitted to a single-species model. All glycans from CHO-Lec3.2.8.1 cells expressing gp140 were calculated according to the composition GlcNAc2-Man5 based on prior mass spectroscopy determination (39Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and with the assumption that all of the potential glycosylation sites are occupied. The collected data of both protein sample sets were processed and calculated according to Laue et al. (40Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry at 280 nm using specific extinction coefficient factors of 0.60 (gp140ADA and gp140ADAC1), 0.63 (gp140ADA/SIV), 0.72 (gp120ADA), 0.71 (intact mAb and Fab fragments), and 0.71 (sCD4), respectively. These factors were calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (41Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar) based on the tryptophan, tyrosine, and cysteine contents of each protein. The results agree well with parallel determination made using quantitative amino acid analysis (data not shown). mAbs were purified as previously described using GammaBind Sepharose (38Liu J. Tse A.G. Chang H.C. Liu J. Wang J. Hussey R.E. Chishti Y. Reinhold B. Spoerl R. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Reinherz E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33639-33646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Each antibody was digested with immobilized papain (Pierce) overnight at 37 °C, and the undigested antibody and the Fc fragment were separated from the Fab fragment using a protein A kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The binding buffer was removed by desalting with a Sepharose G-25 column (75 ml). The purity of the Fab fragment was checked by both reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE. A mixture of purified trimeric gp140ADAC1envelope plus antibody Fab fragments (1A3, 16F10, or 1A3 plus 16F10 at a molar envelope/Fab ratio of 1:4) was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The resulting complexes were then individually purified by gel filtration chromatography on an analytical Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For gp140ADA/SIV, the purified trimeric protein was mixed with 1A3 Fab fragment and 9G3 (mAb against SIV mac32H gp41) Fab fragment (63Kim, M., Chen, B., Hussey, R. E., Chishti, Y., Montefiori, D., Hoxie, J. D., Byron, O., Campbell, G., Harrison, S. C., and Reinherz, E. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in press.Google Scholar) or both 1A3 and 9G3 Fab fragments and analyzed by gel filtration chromatography and SDS-PAGE. sCD4 (the human 4 domain CD4 protein expressed in CHO cells and purified as described) (43Xiong Y. Kern P. Chang H. Reinherz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5659-5667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was also mixed with both trimeric gp140 proteins, and binding was similarly analyzed. A BIAcore 1000 instrument (BIAcore) was employed in all of the experiments with binding analyses performed at 25 °C in HBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P-20, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Envelope proteins were individually coupled to the Sensor Chip CM5 (Biacore) surface using standard amine coupling procedures. For trimeric gp140ADAC1 and gp140ADA/SIV, the immobilization levels were 2800–3000 RU (response units), whereas for monomeric gp120 the level was 900–1000 RU. Association and dissociation were measured by passing serial dilutions of sCD4 (20–50 nm) over each ligand surface at a flow rate of 20–50 µl/min. The sensor chip surface was regenerated between each cycle by an 18-s pulse of 50 mm HCl at a flow rate of 20 µl/min. Identical injections over control surfaces (bovine serum albumin) were subtracted from the data for kinetics analysis. BIAevolution 3.0 software (BIAcore) was used for data analysis. Kinetic data fitting was performed using a Langmuir 1:1 binding model. To assess envelope conformational change induced by sCD4 binding, the 17b mAb (human neutralizing mAb against HIV, recognizing a CD4-induced epitope on gp120) (44Thali M. Moore J.P. Furman C. Charles M. Ho D.D. Robinson J. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3978-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was coupled (500–1000 RU) to the Sensor Chip CM5 surface using standard amine coupling procedures on a BIAcore 1000 instrument (BIAcore). Association rates were measured by passing serial dilutions of different envelope proteins with or without sCD4 at a flow rate of 20–50 µl/min at 25 °C in HBS buffer. The molar ratio of envelope to sCD4 in complex experiments was 1:4 with components mixed at room temperature for at least 1 h before analysis. The sensor chip surface was regenerated as above between each cycle. Trimeric gp140 proteins were deglycosylated by endoglycosidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (1 mg of protein digested by 250 milliunits of endoglycosidase H) at 30 °C for 6 h in 50 mm NaAc, pH 6.0, in the presence or absence of Fab fragments of the indicated mAbs. The deglycosylated protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography using an analytic Superdex 200 column on an AKTA FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to produce soluble trimeric HIV or HIV/SIV chimeric envelope proteins by recombinant eukaryotic expression, four constructs were made in pEE-14 (Fig. 1). A Kozak cassette and tPA leader sequence were introduced into all four constructs 5′ of the coding sequence of a mature ADA gp120 in order to maximize secreted protein expression from the eukaryotic host. Lec3.2.8.1 cells (39Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) were chosen as the expression cells to reduce heterogeneity of glycan adducts as discussed below. pEE14-ADA140 contains the entire ADA gp120 protein and the extracellular domain of its gp41 segment, terminating after Lys632. A site-directed mutation, Arg477 to Ser, was introduced in pEE14-ADA140C1 to eliminate the ADA gp120 primary cleavage site and prevent the processing of gp140 into gp120 and gp41. To create a chimeric HIV/SIV gp140 protein, the complete ADA gp120 mature coding sequence was fused with the extracellular domain of the SIV mac32H gp41 coding sequence terminating after Ser626. Since trimeric SIV gp140 envelope can be expressed in this system (29Chen B. Zhou G. Kim M. Chishti Y. Hussey R.E. Ely B. Skehel J.J. Reinherz E.L. Harrison S.C. Wiley D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34946-34953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that if HIV gp140 might be less favorably disposed to form stable trimers, resulting oligomer heterogeneity could be obviated by engineering an SIV gp41 fragment into the chimeric HIV/SIV construct. Each of the four constructs was transfected into Lec3.2.8.1 cells, and transfectant supernatants were screened by ELISA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Approximately 50% of clones were ELISA-positive. The 10 clones with the highest expression level of soluble gp140 were selected, expanded, and reexamined by ELISA. Cultural supernatants of representative positives were immunoprecipitated by 1A3, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2(left panel), gp140ADAC1 and gp140ADA/SIVproteins produced from both pEE14-ADA140C1- and pEE14-ADA/SIV140-transfected clones, respectively, migrated at about 110 kDa. The theoretical molecular masses of monomeric, nonglycosylated gp140ADAC1 and gp140ADA/SIVproteins are each 71 kDa. Since in Lec3.2.8.1 cells, all of the potential N-linked glycosylation sites of the produced protein are modified with simple carbohydrate adducts GlcNAc2-Man5 and there is noO-linked glycosylation modification (39Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the predicted molecular masses of monomer gp140ADAC1 and gp140ADA/SIV (110 and 108 kDa, respectively) are in close agreement with those observed.

In addition to cisplatin-modified DNA, 15-base pair DNA probes modified by {Pt(1R,2R-diaminocyclohexane)}2+,cis-{Pt(NH3)(cyclohexylamine)}2+, {Pt(ethylenediamine)}2+,cis-{Pt(NH3)(cyclobutylamine)}2+, and cis-{Pt(NH3)(2-picoline)}2+were examined. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that both the A and B domains of HMGB1 as well as TBP discriminate between different platinum-DNA adducts. HMGB1 domain A is the most sensitive to the nature of the spectator ligands on platinum. The effect of the spectator ligands on protein binding also depends highly on the base pairs flanking the platinated d(GpG) site. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the AG*G*C sequence, where the asterisks denote the sites of platination, with different spectator ligands are only moderately discriminated by the HMGB proteins and TBP, but the recognition of dsTG*G*A is highly dependent on the ligands. The effects of HMGB1 overexpression in a BG-1 ovarian cancer cell line, induced by steroid hormones, on the sensitivity of cells treated with [Pt(1R,2R-diaminocyclohexane)Cl2] andcis-[Pt(NH3)(cyclohexylamine)Cl2] were also examined. The results suggest that HMGB1 protein levels influence the cellular processing ofcis-{Pt(NH3)- (cyclohexylamine)}2+, but not {Pt((1R,2R)-diaminocyclohexane)}2+, DNA lesions. This result is consistent with the observed binding of HMGB1a to platinum-modified dsTG*G*A probes but not with the binding affinity of HMGB1a and HMGB1 to platinum-damaged dsAG*G*C oligonucleotides.

Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar). The clinical efficacy of cisplatin is severely undermined, however, by dose-limiting side effects and the intrinsic or acquired resistance of some tumors (2Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 787-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cisplatin analog,cis-diammine-1,1′-cyclobutanedicarboxylatoplatinum(II), or carboplatin, was introduced into the clinic because of its reduced toxicity relative to cisplatin, but it is usually ineffective against cisplatin-resistant tumors (3Misset J.L. Bleiberg H. Sutherland W. Bekradda M. Cvitkovic E. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2000; 35: 75-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recently, new platinum compounds have emerged that demonstrate promising anticancer activities and a lack of cross-resistance with cisplatin (4Kelland L.R. Sharp S.Y. O'Neil C.F. Raynaud F.I.

Soc. 1996; 118: 12309-12321Crossref Scopus (405) Google Scholar) that are recognized by a number of cellular proteins (1Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar). Specific interactions between cisplatin 1,2-intrastrand cross-links and cellular proteins modulate the sensitivity of tumor cells to the drug. In particular, protein-DNA interactions induced by cisplatin inhibit replication (10Comess K.M. Burstyn J.N. Essigmann J.M. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3975-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), shield the adducts from nucleotide excision repair (11Zamble D.B. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10004-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and interfere with transcription by recruiting transcription factors from their native binding sites (12Zhai X.Q. Beckmann H. Jantzen H.M. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16307-16315Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Vichi P. Coin F. Renaud J.P. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Moras D. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7444-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Such interactions may also modulate the different cellular responses to platinum compounds with varying spectator ligands, ligands that remain bound to platinum after formation of Pt-DNA adducts. As with cisplatin-DNA damage, the 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) and d(ApG) cross-links formed by these closely related platinum compounds most likely contribute to their cytotoxicity. For example, oxaliplatin forms mainly 1,2-intrastand d(GpG) cross-links both in vitro and in cells (14Saris C.P. van de Vaart P.J.M. Rietbroek R.C. Blommaert F.A. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2763-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Woynarowski J.M. Faivre S. Herzig M.C.S. Arnett B. Chapman W.G. Trevino A.V. Raymond E. Chaney S.G. Vaisman A. Varchenko M.J., P.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding how these spectator ligands, ammonia in the case of cisplatin and 1,2-diaminocyclohexane in the case of oxaliplatin, affect the binding of cellular proteins to platinated DNA may help to distinguish the manner by which the processing of their lesions in the cell can differ from that of cisplatin-damaged DNA.HMGB1 and TBP are abundant nuclear proteins that bind tightly to cisplatin-modified DNA, although they share no sequence or structural homology (13Vichi P. Coin F. Renaud J.P. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Moras D. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7444-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Pil P.M. Lippard S.J. Science. 1992; 256: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). HMGB1 is a chromosomal protein that functions in a number of biological processes, probably by modulating DNA architecture and facilitating formation of higher order nucleoprotein complexes (17Calogero S. Grassi F. Aguzzi A. Voigtlander T. Ferrier P. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). TBP is one member of the transcription factor IID protein assembly involved in eukaryotic transcription initiation (18Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Both proteins have been implicated in the biological activity of cisplatin. Cisplatin-modified DNA can divert TBP from its natural binding site, the TATA box, thus inhibiting transcription initiation (13Vichi P. Coin F. Renaud J.P. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Moras D. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7444-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). When binding to platinum-DNA adducts, HMGB1 can interfere with repair of the damaged DNA (11Zamble D.B. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10004-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 19He Q. Liang C. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5768-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). HMGB1 contains two HMG box domains (HMGB1a and HMGB1b), 80-amino acid DNA-binding motifs that recognize bent DNA structures (20Read C.M. Cary P.D. Crane-Robinson C. Driscoll P.C. Carrillo M.O.M. Norman D.G. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 222-250Google Scholar, 21Baxevanis A.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The binding interactions between HMG box proteins and cisplatin-modified DNA were revealed by an x-ray crystal structure determination of HMGB1a in complex with a 16-bp oligonucleotide duplex containing a single cisplatin 1,2-intrastand d(GpG) cross-link (22Ohndorf U.M. Rould M.A. He Q. Pabo C.O. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). HMGB1a binds to the minor groove of the DNA double helix and uses a phenylalanine residue to intercalate into the hydrophobic notch between the two platinated guanine bases. The domain makes no contact with the major groove of the DNA, where the ammine ligands reside. A recent study demonstrated that HMGB1 binds less tightly to the platinum-DNA adducts formed by [Pt(dach)Cl2] andcis-[Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)Cl2] (23Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because structural details of full-length HMGB1 bound to platinum-DNA adducts are not yet available, it remains uncertain how the spectator ligands affect binding by individual HMG box domains and what characteristics of the ligands are responsible for the effects. Furthermore, whether proteins without HMG box domains differentiate between platinum adducts having different spectator ligands has yet to be investigated.In the present study, we determined the binding of HMGB1a, HMGB1b, and TBP to duplex DNA 15-mers containing 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) cross-links formed by platinum compounds with various spectator ligands. In addition to cisplatin, five other platinum complexes were examined. Two complexes with bidentate chelating ligands were chosen, [Pt(dach)Cl2], which forms the same lesions as those of oxaliplatin (23Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and [Pt(en)I2], a complex frequently used to model cisplatin activity (12Zhai X.Q. Beckmann H. Jantzen H.M. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16307-16315Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Three mixed ammine-platinum complexes were also evaluated,cis-[Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)Cl2], which forms the same lesions as JM216 (24Hartwig J.F. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5646-5654Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar),cis-[Pt(NH3)(NH2Cba)Cl2], another previously reported cytotoxic platinum complex (25Wong E. Giandomenico C.M. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2451-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar), andcis-[Pt(NH3)(2-pic)I2], which forms the same adducts as ZD0473 (6Judson I. Kelland L.R. Drugs. 2000; 59: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The relationship between cellular HMGB1 levels and sensitivity to cisplatin (19He Q. Liang C. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5768-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), [Pt(dach)Cl2], andcis-[Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)Cl2] was also determined. The results indicate that the spectator ligands affect the recognition of platinum-DNA adducts by both HMG box domains and TBP. Furthermore, the bases flanking the damaged d(GpG) site strongly influence the degree to which proteins selectively bind adducts with different ligands. cis-DDP,cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin),1 one of the most effective anticancer drugs, is widely used to treat a variety of malignancies (1Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar). The clinical efficacy of cisplatin is severely undermined, however, by dose-limiting side effects and the intrinsic or acquired resistance of some tumors (2Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 787-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cisplatin analog,cis-diammine-1,1′-cyclobutanedicarboxylatoplatinum(II), or carboplatin, was introduced into the clinic because of its reduced toxicity relative to cisplatin, but it is usually ineffective against cisplatin-resistant tumors (3Misset J.L. Bleiberg H. Sutherland W. Bekradda M. Cvitkovic E. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2000; 35: 75-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recently, new platinum compounds have emerged that demonstrate promising anticancer activities and a lack of cross-resistance with cisplatin (4Kelland L.R. Sharp S.Y. O'Neil C.F. Raynaud F.I. Beale P.J. Judson I.R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 77: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several compounds are now in various stages of clinical testing and have exhibited impressive results for the treatment of certain tumors. Oxaliplatin (Fig. 1) has been approved in Europe, in combination with 5-fluorouracil, for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.cis-trans-cis-Ammine(cyclohexylamine)diacetatodichloroplatinum(IV) (JM216; Fig. 1), an orally active platinum(IV) compound, is currently in phase III clinical trials for prostate cancer (5Ferrante K. Winograd B. Canetta R. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 43: S61-S68Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).cis-Amminedichloro(2-methylpyridine)platinum(II) (ZD0473 or AMD473; Fig. 1) has recently entered phase III clinical trials for ovarian cancer (6Judson I. Kelland L.R. Drugs. 2000; 59: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Despite the large amount of clinical data, there are relatively few attempts to understand why these new platinum complexes might be effective. The cytotoxicity of platinum compounds derives from the formation of DNA adducts, the major ones being 1,2-intrastrand cross-links at the d(GpG) and d(ApG) sites (7Lepre C.A. Lippard S.J. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1990: 29-38Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2154487371,"Serum response factor (SRF) is a key regulator of a number of extracellular signal-regulated genes important for cell growth and differentiation. A form of the SRF gene with a double mutation (dmSRF) was generated. This mutation reduced the binding activity of SRF protein to the serum response element and reduced the capability of SRF to activate the atrial natriuretic factor promoter that contains the serum response element. Cardiac-specific overexpression of dmSRF attenuated the total SRF binding activity and resulted in remarkable morphologic changes in the heart of the transgenic mice. These mice had dilated atrial and ventricular chambers, and their ventricular wall thicknesses were only 1/2 to 1/3 the thickness of that of nontransgenic mice. Also these mice had smaller cardiac myocytes and had less myofibrils in their myocytes relative to nontransgenic mice. Altered gene expression and slight interstitial fibrosis were observed in the myocardium of the transgenic mice. All the transgenic mice died within the first 12 days after birth, because of the early onset of severe, dilated cardiomyopathy. These results indicate that dmSRF overexpression in the heart apparently alters cardiac gene expression and blocks normal postnatal cardiac growth and development."

Previous studies have shown that the expression of ΔEGFR can transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts and that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK2 signaling is necessary for this effect (7Moscatello D.K.

In addition to ΔEGFR, de novo GBMs frequently contain numerous other genetic alterations including the mutation or deletion of the tumor suppressor genes PTEN and INK4A (reviewed in Refs. 1Holland E.C.

U87MG cells express very low levels of wild type EGF receptor, and the introduction of ΔEGFR significantly enhances the growth of tumor xenografts in nude mice (9Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C.

This enhanced tumorigenicity correlates with enhanced cellular proliferation and reduced apoptosisin vivo (12Nagane M. Coufal F. Lin H. Bogler O. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5079-5086PubMed Google Scholar) and is dependent on the PTK activity and the autophosphorylation of tyrosines at the C terminus of ΔEGFR (10Huang H.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K.

T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) is an intracellular tyrosine-specific protein phosphatase that is expressed ubiquitously (reviewed in Ref. 13Ibarra-Sanchez M. Simoncic P.D. Nestel F.R. Duplay P. Lapp W.S. Tremblay M.L. Semin Immunol. 2000; 12: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The human TCPTP transcript is alternatively spliced to generate two variants: a 48-kDa form, which localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum by virtue of a hydrophobic C terminus, and a 45-kDa form (TC45), which lacks the hydrophobic C terminus and under basal conditions localizes to the nucleus. Despite its nuclear localization, TC45 can exit the nucleus in response to certain stimuli to recognize specific substrates in the cytoplasm (14Tiganis T. Kemp B.E. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27768-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell.

When TC45 is transiently overexpressed in COS1 cells it dephosphorylates the wild type EGF receptor and inhibits the growth factor- or integrin-induced and EGF receptor-mediated activation of PI3K/Akt (14Tiganis T. Kemp B.E. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27768-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the potential of TC45 to modulate the biological outcomes of EGF receptor activation and to suppress EGF receptor function in cancer. We have generated stable TC45-producing cell lines in ΔEGFR-expressing U87MG glioblastoma cells to examine whether TC45 can suppress ΔEGFR-mediated growth and tumorigenicity. TC45 dephosphorylated ΔEGFR to inhibit the ΔEGFR-mediated proliferation of glioblastoma cells and the growth of tumor xenografts in nude mice. Although TC45 inhibited the activation of both PI3K/Akt and ERK2, our studies indicate that the suppression of ERK2 may be sufficient to inhibit the proliferation of ΔEGFR-expressing U87MG cells in vitro and in vivo. Our studies highlight the importance of the MAPK ERK2 in ΔEGFR-mediated proliferation and shed light on the ΔEGFR-mediated signaling cascades that promote GBM growth. PD98059 and monoclonal anti-EGFR Ab-1 were purchased from Calbiochem Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA), AG1478 from Sigma, polyclonal anti-EGFR used for immunoblotting from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal PI3K p85 antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), and monoclonal phospho-ERK2, polyclonal phospho-Akt (Ser-473), and Akt antibodies from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). ERK2 1B3B9 antibody was provided by M. Weber (University of Virginia) and the monoclonal phosphotyrosine G104 and TCPTP CF4 antibodies by N. K. Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). The TC45 and TC45-D182A cDNA-pBluescript constructs (17Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol.

Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) constructs encoding TC45 and TC45-D182A were generated by PCR using cloned Pfu or PfuTurbo® DNA polymerases, respectively (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the TC45 and TC45-D182A pBluescript constructs as templates. For generating the TC45 and TC45–182A pCG constructs, the oligonucleotides incorporated aSpeI site immediately 5′ to the initiating codons and aBamHI site immediately 3′ to the termination codons. The 5′ oligonucleotide used was 5′-GGCTCCCACTAGTATGCCCACCACCAT CGAGCGGGAG-3′, and the 3′ oligonucleotide was 5′-CCCAGTCATGGATCCTTA GGTGTCTGTCAATCTTGGCCT-3′.SpeI/BamHI-digested PCR products were cloned into the XbaI/BamHI site of the mammalian expression vector pCG. To generate the TC45 and TC45-D182A pWZL(Hygro) constructs, the TC45 and TC45-D182A cDNAs were excised withSalI and EcoRI from the respective pBluescript constructs and cloned into the same sites of the retroviral expression vector pWZL(Hygro). To generate the ΔEGFR-pCDNA3.1 construct, the ΔEGFR pBluescript construct was digested with SacII, blunt-ended, digested with XhoI, and cloned into theEcoRV and XhoI sites of pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The structures of the recombinant plasmids generated were confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and the fidelity of the cloned cDNAs confirmed by sequencing. 293 cells (ATCC) and human U87MG glioblastoma cells (ATCC) were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. ΔEGFR-expressing U87MG glioblastoma cells (ΔEGFR-U87MG) have been described previously (9Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Where indicated, cells were serum-starved for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. 293 cells were electroporated as described previously (14Tiganis T. Kemp B.E. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27768-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with 1 μg of ΔEGFR-pCDNA3.1 and 20 μg of either pCG, TC45-pCG, or TC45-D182A-pCG and processed at 24 h post-transfection. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed using propidium iodide (Sigma)-stained cells. pWZL(Hygro) vector control, TC45, and TC45-D182A-encoding retroviruses were generated as described previously (19Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3811-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, the BING amphotropic virus-packaging cell line was electroporated with pWZL(Hygro) vector control, TC45-pWZL(Hygro), or TC45-D182A-pWZL(Hygro) DNA. Virus-containing supernatants were harvested and added to cultures of U87MG or ΔEGFR-U87MG cells. Drug selection was in medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Life Technologies, Inc.) for U87MG cells and into the same medium plus 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for the ΔEGFR-U87MG cells. Drug-resistant colonies were selected 10–16 days after infection. Cellular proliferation was measured using the MTT assay as described by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and soft agar assays were performed as described previously (20Li D.M. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). After 3–4 weeks, colonies in soft agar were stained with crystal violet and photographed. For tumorigenicity and survival studies, TC45 (clones 8 and 16 pooled) or TC45-D182A (clones 11 and 14 pooled) ΔEGFR-U87MG cells (5 × 105) were inoculated into the brains of 4–5-week-old female BALB/c nude mice as described previously (10Huang H.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K. Lin H. Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Huang C.M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. Cavenee W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2927-2935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). For tumorigenicity studies the brains were resected at 14 days post-implantation, and frozen sections were stained with hematoxylin. Cells were collected in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, leupeptin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and processed as described previously (15Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TCPTP was immunoprecipitated with CF4 antibody in the presence of 5 mm iodoacetic acid, whereas ΔEGFR was immunoprecipitated from serum-starved cells with anti-EGFR Ab-1 in the presence of 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. All protein tyrosine phosphatases contain an Asp residue that is essential for catalysis and mutation of this residue (Asp-182 in TC45) to alanine generates mutants that can form stable complexes with tyrosine phosphorylated substrates (15Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Using the TC45-D182A substrate-trapping mutant, we have shown previously that the tyrosine-phosphorylated wild type EGF receptor is a substrate for TC45 (15Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether TC45 can also recognize ΔEGFR as a cellular substrate, we transiently co-expressed ΔEGFR with either wild type TC45 or the D182A mutant in 293 cells. We assessed the ability of TC45 to dephosphorylate ΔEGFR and whether TC45-D182A was capable of forming a stable complex with the tyrosine-phosphorylated ΔEGFR. As seen in lysates of these co-transfected cells, TC45 dephosphorylated ΔEGFR, whereas TC45-D182A protected ΔEGFR from dephosphorylation by endogenous phosphatases (Fig. 1). Moreover, the tyrosine phosphorylated ΔEGFR could be co-immunoprecipitated with the TC45-D182A mutant but not with wild type TC45 (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the TC45-D182A-trapping mutant and the tyrosine-phosphorylated ΔEGFR interact through the active site of the phosphatase. Similar results were also obtained when ΔEGFR and TC45 were co-expressed in U251MG glioblastoma cells (data not shown). These results are consistent with ΔEGFR being a direct substrate of TC45, as we have demonstrated previously for the wild type EGF receptor (14Tiganis T. Kemp B.E. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27768-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,15Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the ability of TC45 to regulate ΔEGFR signaling and function, we stably expressed TC45 or the TC45-D182A mutant in either U87MG human glioblastoma cells or in U87MG cells that had been generated previously to stably express ΔEGFR (ΔEGFR-U87MG) to levels similar to those of GBMs (10Huang H.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K. Lin H. Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Huang C.M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. Cavenee W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2927-2935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 11Prigent S.A. Nagane M. Lin H. Huvar I. Boss G.R. Feramisco J.R. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25639-25645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To increase the gene delivery efficiency and to attain stable gene integration, vector control amphotropic retroviruses or those expressing TC45 or TC45-D182A were used to infect U87MG or ΔEGFR-U87MG cells. After approximately 2 weeks of selection in hygromycin B, very few colonies were observed in the TC45 or TC45-D182A retrovirus-infected ΔEGFR-U87MG cells relative to vector control (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, no significant difference was observed for the vector control, TC45, or TC45-D182A infected U87MG cells (Fig. 2 A). The infection of the U87MG and ΔEGFR-U87MG cells was undertaken at the same time, with the same retroviral preparations, and similar levels of TC45 and TC45-D182A were expressed in the pooled colonies (data not shown). These results indicate that TC45 and TC45-D182A may inhibit the proliferation of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells. To further analyze the effects of TC45 and TC45-D182A on cellular proliferation, at least three hygromycin B-resistant clones from vector control, TC45, or TC45-D182A U87MG and ΔEGFR-U87MG populations were isolated and characterized. U87MG and ΔEGFR-U87MG cells express relatively high amounts of the endogenous 48-kDa TCPTP variant but low levels of endogenous TC45 (Fig. 2 B). The U87MG and ΔEGFR-U87MG stable clones overexpressed similar amounts (∼5-fold) of either TC45 or TC45-D182A (Fig. 2 B). Indeed, the level of TC45 overexpression was similar to the amount of endogenous 48-kDa TCPTP in these cells (Fig. 2 B) and was similar to the endogenous levels of TC45 in other cell types such as HepG2 hepatoma cells (data not shown). The results presented hereon are from one clone for each of the vector control, TC45 or TC45-D182A U87MG, or ΔEGFR-U87MG cell lines; similar results were obtained for at least two other clones for each of the cell lines generated. We found that expression of either TC45 or the TC45-D182A substrate-trapping mutant significantly inhibited the proliferation of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells as compared with parental or vector control cells (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, neither TC45 nor TC45-D182A had any significant effect on the proliferation of U87MG cells not expressing ΔEGFR (Fig.2 C). These results are consistent with the observations made after retroviral infection (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, consistent with an effect on cellular proliferation we found that the expression of TC45 or TC45-D182A altered markedly the cell cycle progression of the ΔEGFR-U87MG cells (Fig. 3). Expression of either TC45 or TC45-D182A in ΔEGFR-U87MG cells led to a reduction of S and G2/M cell populations and a concomitant increase in Go/G1 populations as compared with parental or vector control cells (Fig. 3). The results indicate that the expression of either TC45 or TC45-D182A leads to a delay in G1/S cell cycle progression. Previous studies have shown that the pharmacological inhibition of ΔEGFR can suppress the proliferation of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells (22Han Y. Caday C.G. Nanda A. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3859-3861PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we find that the treatment of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells with AG1478, a pharmacological inhibitor of ΔEGFR, also results in decreased S and G2/M and increased Go/G1 cell populations (Fig. 3). As such, TC45 and TC45-D182A may exert their selective effects on the proliferation of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells by acting specifically on ΔEGFR or ΔEGFR-induced signaling cascades to cause a delay in G1/S progression. We examined the tyrosine phosphorylation status of ΔEGFR in the lysates of TC45 and TC45-D182A ΔEGFR-U87MG stable cell lines. Consistent with our co-transfection experiments in 293 cells (Fig. 1), we found that TC45 almost completely dephosphorylated ΔEGFR in the ΔEGFR-U87MG cells (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were obtained when cells were lysed directly in Laemmli sample buffer (to prevent any post-lysis dephosphorylation) (data not shown) indicating that the dephosphorylation was occurring in a cellular context. In contrast, the TC45-D182A substrate-trapping mutant formed a complex with the tyrosine-phosphorylated ΔEGFR and protected it from dephosphorylation (Fig. 4 A), as we found in the 293 cells (Fig. 1) and as we have reported previously for the wild type EGF receptor (14Tiganis T. Kemp B.E. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27768-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that ΔEGFR is a substrate for TC45 and that the wild type and mutant phosphatases have the potential to regulate cellular proliferation via the modulation of ΔEGFR signaling. Previously we have shown that transiently expressed TC45 and TC45-D182A act on endogenous wild type EGF receptor in COS1 cells to inhibit the recruitment of the PI3K p85 regulatory subunit and consequent activation of PI3K and downstream Akt (14Tiganis T. Kemp B.E. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27768-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The wild type TC45 dephosphorylates the EGF receptor to inhibit recruitment, whereas TC45-D182A forms a complex with the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor and inhibits recruitment in a competitive manner (14Tiganis T. Kemp B.E. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27768-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We assessed the status of PI3K recruitment and downstream activation of Akt in the TC45 and TC45-D182A ΔEGFR-U87MG stable cell lines. Effects on PI3K recruitment were assessed by monitoring for the presence of p85 in ΔEGFR immunoprecipitates. We found that TC45 inhibited almost completely the association of p85 with ΔEGFR, whereas the TC45-D182A mutant had no significant effect on p85 recruitment (Fig.4 B). The activation of protein kinase Akt was then monitored in cell lysates using antibodies specific for Akt phosphorylated on Ser-473. Consistent with the effects on PI3K recruitment, we found that TC45 but not TC45-D182A inhibited significantly the activation of Akt (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that TC45 inhibits the ΔEGFR-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. The inability of TC45-D182A to do the same suggests that the mutant may not be expressed at high enough levels to compete for the recruitment of PI3K to ΔEGFR. Nevertheless, the ability of TC45 to inhibit the ΔEGFR-mediated activation of PI3K/Akt is not likely to account for its effects on the proliferation of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells because both TC45 and TC45-D182A inhibited proliferation (Fig. 2), but only TC45 inhibited PI3K/Akt (Fig. 4). The MAPK pathway is central to the proliferation of cells downstream of growth factor receptors, cytokine receptors, and integrins (23Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar, 24Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar), and in many tumor cells, the activation of the MAPK ERK2 is essential for cellular proliferation (25Hoshino R. Tanimura S. Watanabe K. Kataoka T. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2686-2692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We examined whether ΔEGFR-mediated ERK2 activation was necessary for the proliferation of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells (Fig. 5). First, we found that pharmacological inhibition of ΔEGFR with AG1478 ablated ΔEGFR PTK activity and consequent autophosphorylation and diminished the activation of ERK2 (Fig. 5 A). These results indicate that the activation of ERK2 in ΔEGFR-U87MG cells is dependent on ΔEGFR activity. Second, we found that pharmacological inhibition of ERK2 with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited significantly cellular proliferation (Fig. 5 B). These results demonstrate that the ΔEGFR-mediated activation of ERK2 is necessary for the proliferation of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells (Fig. 5 C). We determined whether the wild type and mutant phosphatases exerted their effects on ΔEGFR-U87MG proliferation by inhibiting the ΔEGFR-mediated activation of ERK2. We assessed the activation state of ERK2 in lysates of TC45- and TC45-D182A-expressing ΔEGFR-U87MG cells using both ERK2 phosphorylation specific antibodies and by monitoring the shift in ERK2 electrophoretic mobility that occurs upon phosphorylation and activation. We found that both TC45 and TC45-D182A inhibited significantly the activation of ERK2 (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, TC45 and TC45-D182A had no effect on the activation of ERK2 in U87MG parental cells (data not shown). These results indicate that TC45 and TC45-D182A may act on ΔEGFR to inhibit the downstream activation of ERK2 and the consequent proliferation of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells. We next determined the effects of TC45 and TC45-D182A on the anchorage-independent growth of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells by ascertaining the ability of our stable cell lines to form colonies in soft agar (Fig.6). Although no significant difference was observed between ΔEGFR-U87MG parental and pWZL vector control cells (data not shown), the expression of TC45 inhibited completely the formation of colonies in soft agar (Fig. 6). However, TC45 had no effect on the formation of colonies by U87MG cells that do not express ΔEGFR (data not shown). In contrast to the effects of TC45 in ΔEGFR-U87MG cells, expression of TC45-D182A did not appear to have any significant effect on the number of colonies formed, although the colonies were smaller than either ΔEGFR-U87MG parental or vector control cells (Fig. 6). These results indicate that TC45 but not TC45-D182A inhibits the anchorage independence of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells and correlates with the differential effects of TC45 and TC45-D182A on the ΔEGFR-mediated activation of PI3K. As such, these results suggest that the ΔEGFR-mediated activation of PI3K may be necessary for the anchorage-independent growth of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells. ΔEGFR enhances the tumorigenicity of U87MG glioblastoma cells in vivo and ΔEGFR PTK activity, autophosphorylation, and signaling are required for this growth advantage (10Huang H.S. Nagane M.

To examine the relative importance of these pathways in vivo, we assessed the tumorigenicity of our TC45- and TC45-D182A-expressing ΔEGFR-U87MG cell lines. The glioblastoma cells were injected stereotactically into the brains of nude mice. We found that the expression of either TC45 or TC45-D182A in the ΔEGFR-U87MG cells prolonged similarly the survival of mice implanted with these tumor cells as compared with parental or vector control ΔEGFR cells. Consistent with these results we found that TC45- and TC45-D182A-expressing tumors were smaller than those generated by either ΔEGFR-U87MG parental or vector control cells (Fig.7). These results indicate that TC45 has the potential to inhibit the growth of ΔEGFR-expressing glioblastomasin vivo. Despite the fact that the ΔEGFR oncogene is expressed in roughly half of all de novo GBMs, little is known about the signal transduction processes that ΔEGFR utilizes to increase cellular proliferation and enhance tumor growth (1Holland E.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Constitutive ΔEGFR PTK activity and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling are necessary for the ΔEGFR-mediated growth of glioblastoma cellsin vivo (10Huang H.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K. Lin H.

As such, the dephosphorylation of ΔEGFR by tyrosine-specific phosphatases would negate the contribution of ΔEGFR to gliomagenesis. In this study we have demonstrated that TC45 dephosphorylates and suppresses the tumorigenic potential of ΔEGFR in glioblastoma cells. ΔEGFR autophosphorylates on at least five tyrosines in the intracellular C-terminal portion of the receptor (10Huang H.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K. Lin H. Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Huang C.M. Gill G.N.

As for many other receptor PTKs, including the wild type EGF receptor, these phosphotyrosines act as docking sites for the recruitment of Src homology 2 and phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing proteins for the activation of downstream signaling cascades (26Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar). Whereas the wild type TC45 dephosphorylated ΔEGFR in human glioblastoma cells, the TC45-D182A mutant formed a complex with the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor. We found that both TC45 and TC45-D182A inhibited the activation of ERK2 in ΔEGFR-expressing U87MG cells, but neither had any effect on the activation of ERK2 in U87MG cells not expressing ΔEGFR. ΔEGFR activity was necessary for the activation of ERK2, and this was essential for the proliferation of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells. These results indicate that TC45 and the D182A mutant may exert their selective effects on ERK2 because of their specific recognition of ΔEGFR as a cellular substrate. Previous studies have shown that in COS1 cells, TC45 does not inhibit the EGF-induced activation of ERK2 (14Tiganis T. Kemp B.E. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27768-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy may occur because different cell types were used for the respective studies. Alternatively, these differences may result from the wild type EGF receptor and ΔEGFR utilizing different mechanisms for the activation of ERK2. The manner by which ERK2 is activated may depend on the extent of EGF receptor activation (27Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and although constitutive, the level of ΔEGFR autophosphorylation is significantly lower than that observed for EGF-stimulated wild type receptor (9Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 28Ekstrand A.J. Longo N. Hamid M.L. Olson J.J. Liu L. Collins V.P. James C.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2313-2320PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, consistent with their effects on ERK2, we found that TC45 and TC45-D182A suppressed significantly the proliferation of ΔEGFR-expressing U87MG glioblastoma cells and caused a delay in G1/S cell cycle progression. Previous studies have demonstrated that ΔEGFR activity is necessary for the proliferation of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells in vitro (22Han Y. Caday C.G. Nanda A. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3859-3861PubMed Google Scholar). We report that the pharmacological inhibition of ΔEGFR causes a delay in G1/S cell cycle progression similar to the effects of TC45 and TC45-D182A expression. Previous studies have also shown that the expression of ΔEGFR in U87MG cells enhances Ras activation, which is upstream of the MAPK ERK2, and G1/S progression as measured by BrdUrd incorporation (11Prigent S.A. Nagane M. Lin H. Huvar I. Boss G.R. Feramisco J.R. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25639-25645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As such ΔEGFR would appear to mediate the progression of cells through G1/S via the activation of ERK2. Thus, we propose that TC45 may inhibit selectively the G1/S progression and proliferation of ΔEGFR-expressing U87MG cells by dephosphorylating and maintaining the ΔEGFR in an inactive state and suppressing the downstream activation of ERK2. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that at least part of the suppression of the ΔEGFR-mediated activation of ERK2 may occur downstream of ΔEGFR. We have shown previously that TC45 can recognize the adaptor protein p52Shc as a cellular substrate (15Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In ΔEGFR-U87MG cells the ΔEGFR protein associates constitutively with the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2, which can allow for the recruitment of Ras and the activation of MAPK signaling cascades (11Prigent S.A. Nagane M. Lin H. Huvar I. Boss G.R. Feramisco J.R. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25639-25645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We have yet to determine whether p52Shc is necessary for the ΔEGFR-mediated activation of ERK2 or whether p52Shc may serve as a substrate for TC45 in the ΔEGFR-U87MG cells. The PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway has been implicated in many receptor PTK-mediated processes including the regulation of cellular proliferation, migration and survival (29Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar, 30Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). We found that in addition to inhibiting ERK2 activation, TC45 also inhibited the recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and the downstream activation of the protein kinase Akt in ΔEGFR-U87MG cells. As in the case of wild type EGF receptor signaling (14Tiganis T. Kemp B.E. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27768-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37700-37707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we propose that TC45 acts upstream of PI3K on ΔEGFR to inhibit PI3K recruitment and the concomitant activation of PI3K and Akt. In contrast, the TC45-D182A substrate-trapping mutant had no effect on the recruitment of PI3K or the activation of Akt. That the D182A mutant was unable to inhibit PI3K recruitment can most likely be attributed to substrate trapping by TC45-D182A being less efficient than dephosphorylation. Since TC45 and TC45-D182A suppressed equally the proliferation of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells, these results suggest that the proliferation of ΔEGFR-U87MG cells may be independent of ΔEGFR-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling. Although ΔEGFR-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling may not be essential for proliferation, our studies indicate that it may be required for anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. We found that expression of TC45 inhibited completely the formation of ΔEGFR-U87MG colonies in soft agar. In contrast to TC45, we found that the D182A mutant had no effect on the number of colonies formed by the ΔEGFR-expressing cells. Given that TC45-D182A had no effect on PI3K/Akt activation, these results suggest that the inhibition of PI3K/Akt may be responsible for the dramatic effect of TC45 on anchorage-independent growth. Consistent with this conclusion, others have shown that PI3K signaling is necessary for the anchorage independent growth of glioblastoma cells (20Li D.M. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and that ΔEGFR-mediated PI3K signaling in NIH3T3 cells is necessary for anchorage independence (7Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Montgomery R.B. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that the colonies formed by the TC45-D182A-expressing cells were smaller than those of vector control ΔEGFR-U87MG cells, indicating that ERK2 signaling and cellular proliferation may also contribute to the growth of cells in soft agar. Our studies indicate that TC45 and TC45-D182A differentially regulate ΔEGFR-mediated signaling processes in glioblastoma cells. Whereas TC45 inhibited both ERK2 activation and PI3K/Akt signaling, the TC45-D182A mutant suppressed only ERK2. Ultimately, the real contribution of a signaling pathway to the tumorigenic potential of ΔEGFR can only be assessed in vivo. We found that in intracerebral xenografts of our stable ΔEGFR-U87MG cell lines, TC45 and TC45-D182A suppressed similarly the growth of tumors and prolonged similarly the survival of mice. Taken together with our in vitro studies, these results indicate that the ΔEGFR-mediated activation of ERK2 and the consequent cellular proliferation contribute to the growth of glioblastomas in vivo. Holland et al. (31Holland E.C. Celestino J. Dai C. Schaefer L. Sawaya R.E. Fuller G.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) have shown recently that constitutively active Ras, and hence the activation of MAPK signaling cascades, together with constitutively active Akt can induce, in mice, high grade gliomas with features of GBMs. Although our studies do not preclude a role for the PI3K/Akt pathway in tumorigenicity, they certainly indicate that the inhibition of ΔEGFR-mediated PI3K, in addition to ERK2, does not add considerably to the suppression of tumorigenicity. As such, our findings suggest that the inhibition of ERK2 may be sufficient to impede the growth of ΔEGFR-expressing GBMs, and rational GBM therapies may include inhibitors of ERK2. Moreover, agents that stimulate the expression, activation, or constitutive cytoplasmic localization of TC45 may also provide an alternative strategy for the treatment of ΔEGFR-expressing GBMs. We thank J. Heierhorst for critical reading of the manuscript."

Like most members of the NR superfamily, VDR consists of several functional domains including the highly conserved DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal ligand binding domain. The multifunctional ligand binding domain mediates dimerization of VDR with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and contains the ligand-dependent activation function-2 (AF-2) domain. A ligand-induced conformational change of AF-2 on the surface of the VDR ligand binding domain results in the formation of a binding interface that allows protein-protein contacts between the receptor and various coactivator proteins (2Shiau A.K.

A general property of these transcriptional cofactors is their ability to selectively interact with liganded receptors and modulate their transcriptional activity.

Each member of this family has a centrally located receptor interaction domain containing three copies of a consensus leucine-rich motif, LXXLL, with conserved spacing between the motifs (14Heery D.M.

Crystallographic and biochemical studies reveal that the surface of a single LXXLL motif directly contacts the ligand-activated AF-2 domain of NRs, thereby providing a molecular basis for NR-coactivator recruitment (2Shiau A.K.

Although the precise mechanism is unclear, these coactivators may function as bridging proteins that link the receptor to RNA polymerase II and the basal transcription machinery and potentially recruit limiting components into preinitiation complex assembly. Indeed, SRC-1 interacts with general transcription factors such as transcription factor IIB and TATA-binding protein (18Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Misiti S. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3594-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). SRC-1 also interacts with the general transcriptional activator CBP/p300 through a distinct C-terminal domain, most likely as part of a large multi-protein complex assembled at the target gene promoter (19Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Furthermore, coactivator proteins such as SRC-1 and CBP/p300 possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, suggesting that ligand-activated receptors may recruit coactivators that function to remodel chromatin structure, thus permitting greater accessibility of the transcriptional machinery to DNA (21Bannister A.J.

A novel coactivator protein termed NCoA-62 was isolated in our laboratory as a VDR-interacting protein (24Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16434-16441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). NCoA-62 enhances VDR and other NR-mediated gene transcription. Although NCoA-62 is not related to the SRC coactivator family, it is highly related to BX42, aDrosophila melanogaster nuclear protein putatively involved in ecdysone-stimulated transcription (25Wieland C. Mann S. Besser H. Saumweber H. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 101: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). NCoA-62 was independently isolated as a protein that interacts with the v-Ski oncoprotein, and it was termed Ski-interacting protein, SKIP (26Dahl R. Wani B. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Ski is a potent cellular differentiation factor that has been shown to function in part through NR-signaling pathways (27Dahl R. Kieslinger M. Beug H. Hayman M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11187-11192Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, these studies also imply a role for NCoA-62/SKIP in cellular differentiation pathways including steroid hormone-mediated cellular differentiation. The mechanisms through which NCoA-62/SKIP function and the potential interplay between distinct coactivators such as NCoA-62/SKIP and the SRC coactivators in VDR-mediated transcription are unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate a preferential, ligand-mediated interaction of NCoA-62/SKIP with the VDR-RXR heterodimer as compared with the VDR monomer or homodimer. Moreover, we show cooperative interactions between VDR, NCoA-62/SKIP, and SRC coactivators and a resulting synergistic effect of these two distinct coactivators in VDR-mediated transcription. These cooperative interplays are mediated through interactions of the SRCs and NCoA-62/SKIP coactivators with distinct domains of the VDR that permit ternary complex formation between the liganded VDR/RXR heterodimer and the NCoA-62/SKIP and SRC coactivator proteins. GST-VDR contains the ligand binding domain of human VDR from leucine 116 to serine 427 inserted into the pGEX-KT expression vector (28Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal.

GST-NCoA-62 (157) was expressed in the DH5-α strain of Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (29Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D.

NR Box II (KHKILHRLLQDSS) and NR Box III (ENALLRYLLDKDD) peptides were purchased from Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Deletion mutants of NCoA-62 were generated by polymerase chain reaction. Primers with unique restriction site sequences were used to amplify selected regions of the NCoA-62 and were cloned into the SG5 expression plasmid. 5′ primers contained a strong Kozak consensus sequence for efficient translation. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. [35S]Methionine-labeled protein was synthesized in a TNT T7 coupled in vitrotranscription-translation system using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI). 10 µg of GST or GST fusion protein was bound to 50% glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and equilibrated with 2× GBB (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4.0 µg/ml aprotinin, 2.0 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 µg/ml pepstatin A)). Equivalent volumes of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were incubated with the immobilized GST fusion proteins in 100 µl of 2× GBB for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking in the presence or absence of 10−8m 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Histidine-tagged baculovirus-expressed human VDR was added in select experiments to examine ternary protein complex formation. Several experiments examined the effect of NR Box II and III peptides as competitors for protein complex formation. The beads were washed twice with 0.3 ml of 1× GBB and once with 0.3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 35 µl of 20 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Human VDR cDNA was subcloned into the pVL-1392 polyhedrin transfer plasmid containing a polyhistidine tag and a protein kinase A consensus site at the N terminus. Recombinant baculovirus was isolated and plaque-purified by standard methods. A 1-liter culture of Sf-9 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) was infected for 48 h with the VDR-expressing recombinant baculovirus (multiplicity of infection = 3). Whole cell extracts were prepared, and recombinant, His-tagged VDR was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The vitamin D-responsive (VDRE)4-TK-GH growth hormone reporter plasmid contains four copies of the rat osteocalcin VDRE upstream of the viral thymidine kinase promoter. The (VDRE)4-TATA-GH construct utilizes the rat osteocalcin TATA region (−30 to +10) as the basal promoter. The pSG5 human VDR expression plasmid was described previously (24Baudino T.A.

All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped, heat-inactivated calf bovine serum for 4 days before transfection as well as throughout the entire transfection protocol. COS-7 cells were transfected by standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedures as described previously (32MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Haussler C.A. Ozato K.

After a 16-h incubation, the precipitate was removed with two washes of phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were replenished with fresh media containing 5% charcoal-stripped, heat-inactivated serum. The cells were treated with ligand or ethanol vehicle as indicated for 24 h, and the amount of secreted growth hormone was determined with an immunoassay kit (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). Baudino et al.(24Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol.

In that study, Far Western analysis and GST pull-down assays revealed a direct interaction of NCoA-62 with monomeric VDR. Here, we directly compared the abilities of NCoA-62 and SRC coactivators (GRIP-1/SRC-2) to interact with the VDR-VDR homodimer or the VDR-RXR heterodimer complexes using an in vitro ternary complex assay. As illustrated in Fig. 1,35S-labeled NCoA-62 interacted weakly with the GST-VDR fusion protein (lane 5). The addition of purified baculovirus-expressed VDR modestly enhanced NCoA-62 interaction with the GST-VDR protein (lane 6). This modest increase likely is the result of weak homodimerization of the immobilized GST-VDR with the baculovirus expressed VDR (BEVS-VDR) and subsequent stronger interaction of NCoA-62 with dimeric VDR. This is supported by the observations that additional BEVS-VDR had no effect on interaction with the GST control matrix (lane 4), and unrelated proteins such as bovine serum albumin or ovalbumin had no effect on NCoA-62 binding to GST-VDR (data not shown). NCoA-62 interaction with the homodimer was independent of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 ligand (comparelanes 6 and 7). In contrast,35S-labeled GRIP interacted with the VDR complexes in a strict, ligand-dependent manner (compare lanes 6and 7, middle panel). NCoA-62 also interacted weakly with the GST-RXR fusion protein (lane 8). Again, the addition of the purified baculovirus VDR to the binding reaction enhanced NCoA-62 interaction with GST-RXR (compare lanes 8and 9), indicating that VDR-RXR heterodimerization promoted NCoA-62 interactions. Importantly, the addition of 10−8m 1,25-(OH)2D3 further increased NCoA-62 interaction with the heterodimer (lane 10). NCoA-62 interaction with the liganded heterodimer was ∼4-fold higher than with the liganded VDR homodimer complex (compare lanes 7 and10). In contrast, GRIP showed no significant difference between its ability to interact with the heterodimer or with the homodimer (middle panel, compare lanes 7 and10). As expected, no interaction was observed for calcium-binding protein (CaBP) in any of these binding conditions (lower panel in Fig. 1). These data suggest that NCoA-62 selectively binds to the VDR-RXR heterodimer, and its interaction with the heterodimer is enhanced by the 1,25-(OH)2D3 ligand. The selective interaction between NCoA-62 and the VDR-RXR heterodimer was also indicated in transient expression studies in COS-7 cells transfected with a VDR expression vector and the 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive VDRE1-TATA-GH reporter construct. As illustrated in Fig.2, NCoA-62 and RXR expression, each, resulted in a modest 2–3-fold increase in 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent growth hormone reporter expression under these conditions. Coexpression of NCoA-62 and RXR resulted in a 6-fold increase in VDR-mediated transcription, suggesting that both NCoA-62 and RXR expression were important for the maximal responsiveness in this system. A series of NCoA-62 deletion constructs was used to define the region of NCoA-62 that is involved in mediating interactions with the VDR-RXR heterodimer. This was assessed using the in vitro ternary complex assay (Fig.3A and summarized in Fig.3B). Deletions of N-terminal residues 1–309 (N1, N2, N3, and N4) had no effect on the ability of the NCoA-62 proteins to bind to the VDR/RXR heterodimer. Moreover, the formation of the ternary complexes was enhanced by the addition of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 ligand, as observed with the wild type protein. Further deletions of amino acids 309–341 (mutant N5) resulted in the loss of formation of the ternary complex. C-terminal deletion mutants containing amino acids 87–309, 87–342, and 87–395 (C2, C3, and C4, respectively) each retained the ability to interact with VDR/RXR. In contrast, mutant C1, containing amino acids 87–274, did not bind to VDR/RXR. These results suggest the presence of two binding sites on the NCoA-62 protein. One site is located between amino acids 274 and 309, and the other is located between residues 309 and 342. The presence of either binding site is sufficient to promote binding to the heterodimer in vitro. The ability of the NCoA-62 deletion mutants to bind to a VDR monomer was examined in a yeast 2-hybrid system (Fig. 3B). The N1-N3 N-terminal deletion mutants were each active in this system. Further deletion of the amino acids 274–309 in N4 resulted in a loss of interaction with VDR. Likewise, the C-terminal mutants C2-C4 were active, whereas the loss of amino acids 274–309 in C1 abolished binding activity. These results support the in vitro data and demonstrate that amino acids 274–309 are necessary for binding to the VDR monomer. Taken together, these data further suggest that amino acids 309–342 are involved in binding to either the RXR monomer or to the VDR/RXR heterodimer but are not sufficient for binding to the VDR monomer. SRC coactivators such as GRIP-1 and SRC-1 interact with NRs in a ligand-dependent and AF-2 (helix H12)-dependent manner. Several signature LXXLL motifs (referred to as NR boxes) within the SRC coactivator primary sequence are necessary and sufficient for coactivator interaction with a hydrophobic cleft on the surface on the NRs consisting of helices H3, H4, H5, and H12, the AF-2 domain (5Feng W. Ribeiro R.C. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 14Heery D.M.

However, NCoA-62 lacks any of the signature LXXLL or NR-box motifs, and the interaction between NCoA-62 and VDR is independent of the AF-2 domain of helix H12 (24Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M.

These observations suggest that NCoA-62 and SRC coactivators utilize different interaction domains on the VDR-RXR heterodimer to influence VDR-mediated transcription. To test this hypothesis, synthetic LXXLL-containing peptides were used as competitors for the binding of GRIP-1 or NCoA-62 to the VDR-RXR heterodimer complex in GST pull-down assays (Fig. 4). Peptides containing either NR Box II (KHKILHRLLQDSS) or NR Box III (ENALLRYLLDKDD) of mouse GRIP-1 were used. As shown in Fig. 4, both NCoA-62 and GRIP-1 formed a ligand-enhanced ternary complex with the GST-RXR-VDR heterodimer (compare lanes 4 and 5). When increasing concentrations of NR Box III peptide were added, there was a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of 35S-GRIP that complexed with the heterodimer (lanes 6–10). Importantly, no competition of the NR Box III peptide for binding of NCoA-62/SKIP to the liganded GST-RXR-VDR heterodimer was observed (lanes 6–10). Similar results were obtained using 35S-SRC-1 in this assay (data not shown). In contrast to NR Box III, the NR Box II peptide did not compete with either GRIP, SRC-1, or NCoA-62 in the formation of ternary complex (data not shown), thus confirming the results of Chen et al.(34Chen S. Cui J. Nakamura K. Ribeiro R.C. West B.L. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15039-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) who showed that VDR selectively interacts with NR Box III peptides. The data in Fig. 4 clearly indicate that NCoA-62 and SRC coactivators dock with distinct regions of the VDR-RXR heterodimer. The observation that NCoA-62 and SRC coactivators interact with the VDR-RXR heterodimer through distinct domains suggests that these proteins have the potential to form a complex. To test this possibility, purified GST-NCoA-62 was bound to glutathione-agarose incubated with 35S-labeled, full-length GRIP-1, and protein-protein complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 5,lanes 1–5, GRIP did not interact directly with GST-NCoA-62 in this assay (lane 3), and unliganded VDR did not affect the ability of GRIP to coprecipitate with GST-NCoA-62 (lane 4). However, the addition of the 1,25-(OH)2D3-liganded VDR dramatically increased coprecipitation of GRIP and GST-NCoA-62 (lane 5). This ternary complex was also observed using GST-GRIP and35S-labeled, full-length NCoA-62 (lanes 6–10). As expected, GST-GRIP did not interact directly with NCoA-62 in this assay (lane 8). However, GST-GRIP efficiently interacted with 35S-labeled NCoA-62 in a liganded VDR-dependent manner (lane 10). Full-length SRC-1 also formed a ternary complex with VDR and NCoA-62 in a manner similar to GRIP-1 (data not shown). These data indicated that although NCoA-62 does not interact directly with SRC coactivators, it forms a 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent ternary complex with VDR and SRC coactivators. To address the functional consequences of this interaction, NCoA-62 and SRC coactivators were examined in a VDR-mediated reporter gene assay (Fig.6). Expression of GRIP-1 or SRC-1 augmented VDR-mediated transcription by ∼2-fold, a level of enhancement similar to that observed with NCoA-62 expression under these conditions of reduced expression vectors (Fig. 6). Strikingly, coexpression of NCoA-62 and either GRIP or SRC-1 resulted in a synergistic enhancement in 1,25-(OH)2D3-activated expression of the reporter gene construct (8- or 7-fold, respectively). As expected, coexpression of GRIP and SRC-1 resulted in merely an additive effect on vitamin D-mediated transcription compared with each coactivator alone. This observation shows that there is synergistic interplay between NCoA-62 and SRC coactivators in VDR-mediated transcription. To address the relative functional importance of the cooperative actions of NCoA-62 or SRC coactivators in vitamin D-mediated transactivation, protein inhibitors were developed based on the SRC receptor interaction domain (RID) and the NCoA-62 RID. A similar system was used previously to define NR-box peptides that selectively compete for nuclear receptor transactivation in transient expression studies (35Tetel M.J. Giangrande P.H. Leonhardt S.A. McDonnell D.P. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 910-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Norris J.D. Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Chang C.Y. Huacani M.R. Fan D. Hamilton P.T. Fowlkes D.M. McDonnell D.P. Science. 1999; 285: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The SRC RID consisted of residues 595–780 of mouse GRIP-1 (SRC-2) containing the 3 NR-box motifs. The NCoA-62 inhibitor consisted of residues 87–342 of human NCoA-62 containing the NCoA-62 RID between residues 274 and 342. The NCoA-62 (87) derivative binds to both the VDR monomer and the VDR-RXR heterodimer (see Fig. 3). As illustrated in Fig. 7, the SRC RID selectively interfered with VDR-activated transcription, inhibiting 1,25-(OH)2D3-activated transcription by ∼90%. This presumably occurs by interfering with native SRCs and blocking their interaction with the VDR in this cell system. As expected, coexpression of intact GRIP-1 with this inhibitor completely rescued the VDR response in this system. However, coexpressing intact NCoA-62 had little, if any, effect. These data indicate that NCoA-62 lacks s"

We previously showed that Syts I, II, VII, and VIII form a stable SDS-resistant, β-mercaptoethanol-insensitive, and Ca2+-independent oligomer surrounding the transmembrane domain (Fukuda, M., and Mikoshiba, K. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 28180–28185), but little is known about the molecular mechanism of the Ca2+-independent oligomerization by the synaptotagmin family. In this study, we analyzed the Ca2+-independent oligomerization properties of Syt I and found that it shows two distinct forms of self-oligomerization activity: stable SDS-resistant self-oligomerization activity and relatively unstable SDS-sensitive self-oligomerization activity. The former was found to be mediated by a post-translationally modified (i.e. fatty-acylated) cysteine (Cys) cluster (Cys-74, Cys-75, Cys-77, Cys-79, and Cys-82) at the interface between the transmembrane and spacer domains of Syt I. We also show that the number of Cys residues at the interface between the transmembrane and spacer domains determines the SDS- resistant oligomerizing capacity of each synaptotagmin isoform: Syt II, which contains seven Cys residues, showed the strongest SDS-resistant oligomerizing activity in the synaptotagmin family, whereas Syt XII, which has no Cys residues, did not form any SDS-resistant oligomers. The latter SDS-sensitive self-oligomerization of Syt I is mediated by the spacer domain, because deletion of the whole spacer domain, including the Cys cluster, abolished it, whereas a Syt I(CA) mutant carrying Cys to Ala substitutions still exhibited self-oligomerization. Based on these results, we propose that the oligomerization of the synaptotagmin family is regulated by two distinct mechanisms: the stable SDS-resistant oligomerization is mediated by the modified Cys cluster, whereas the relatively unstable (SDS-sensitive) oligomerization is mediated by the environment of the spacer domain.

Syt consists of a single transmembrane domain and two Ca2+-binding domains (the C2A domain and C2B domain) that are highly homologous to the C2 regulatory region of mammalian Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C (5Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar). To date, thirteen Syt isoforms have been identified in the mouse and rat (6, 7, and reviewed in Ref. 1Marquèze B. Berton F.

Syt I is an abundant synaptic vesicle and multifunctional protein that regulates three distinct steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle (i.e. docking, fusion, and recycling). The WHXL motif in the carboxyl terminus of Syt I is involved in docking of synaptic vesicles to active zones in the squid giant synapse (8Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Liu V. Sugimori M. Mikoshiba K.

Our previous study showed that the Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization via the C2B domain of Syt I (or II) occurs only when the two molecules are preassembled at the amino-terminal domain (21Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ca2+-independent oligomerization of Syt I is crucial for rapid Ca2+-dependent clustering via the C2B domain in response to rapid increases in Ca2+ions entering through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels during neurotransmitter release. Although the key amino acids responsible for Ca2+-dependent multimerization (the so-called C2B effector domain) have been thoroughly investigated (25Chapman E.R. Desai R.C. Davis A.F. Tornehl C.K. J.

However, this information is quite important in terms of identifying the number of Syt I clusters that need to cooperate during synaptic vesicle exocytosis. In this study, we attempted to determine the structural basis of the SDS-resistant Ca2+-independent clustering of the Syt family. We show by site-directed mutagenesis that post-translational modification of the Cys cluster of Syt I at the interface between the transmembrane domain and the spacer domain is essential for stable SDS-resistant homo- and hetero-oligomerization. We also show that differences in oligomerization activity among the member of the synaptotagmin family results from the number of Cys residues in each isoform. Based on these findings, we discuss the mechanisms of Ca2+-independent homo- and hetero-oligomerization in the synaptotagmin family.

Reactions were terminated with the addition of 150 mm Tris to quench the cross-linking reagent. Proteins were homogenized in 1% SDS with a 27-guage syringe, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. Solubilized proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and then immunoblotted with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody, as described previously (31Fukuda M. Kanno E.

The extracts were applied to a Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration column (1 × 120 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with buffer 1 containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2. Fractions were collected in 750 µl, and each fraction was analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody, as described previously (31Fukuda M. Kanno E.

The blots shown in this paper are representative of at least two or three independent experiments. Multiple sequence alignment of the amino-terminal domain of the mouse synaptotagmin family was first performed using the PILEUP program of the GCG software package, as described previously (31Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and then manually modified to optimize similarities. We previously showed that a subclass of Syts (Syts III, V, VI, and X) form homo- and heterodimers via the conserved amino-terminal Cys motif in the extracellular domain and that Syts I, II, VII, and VIII form stable SDS- and β-mercaptoethanol-resistant homodimers on SDS-PAGE by unknown mechanisms (21Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The first step in understanding the structural basis of the Ca2+-independent oligomerization of Syt I is to determine the key amino acids (or effector domain) for oligomerization. To identify the domain responsible for the SDS-resistant Ca2+-independent self-oligomerization of Syt I, we produced various T7-tagged Syt I deletion mutants (Fig.1A), then co-expressed each T7-tagged mutant with the FLAG-Syt I in COS-7 cells and evaluated the associations between the T7- and FLAG-tagged proteins by immunoprecipitation, as described previously (21Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In brief, T7-Syt proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose in the presence of 2 mm EGTA. The co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-Syt I proteins were first detected by HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 1 B, upper panel), and the same blot was then stripped and reprobed with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibodies (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). With the exception of T7-Syt IΔspacer (deletion of the whole spacer domain; Fig. 1 B, upper panel,lane 5), all the deletion mutants interacted with FLAG-Syt I, although the T7-Syt IΔcyto (deletion of the cytoplasmic domain) weakly interacted with FLAG-Syt I (Fig. 1 B, upper panel, lane 2). Consistent with this, we could not detect any SDS-resistant homodimer band of T7-Syt IΔspacer, whereas the other T7-tagged mutant proteins formed SDS-resistant homo-oligomers (Fig. 1 B, lower panel, asterisks). This finding indicated that the amino-terminal spacer domain (or interface sequence between the transmembrane and spacer domains) is essential for Ca2+-independent self-oligomerization of Syt I. Because five Cys residues are present in this region (Fig.1 A, boldface letters) and they are thought to be fatty-acylated (Fig. 1 A, arrow and Refs. 37Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar and38Chapman E.R. Blasi J. An S. Brose N. Johnston P.A. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we first focused on the possible involvement of these Cys residues in Ca2+-independent self-oligomerization of Syt I, and indeed, found a close correlation between the number of Cys residues in the Syt I deletion mutants and their capacity for self-oligomerization (Fig. 1 A). Ala-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed to investigate whether the Cys residues are directly involved in the Ca2+-independent self-oligomerization capacity of Syt I (Fig. 2A). Substitution of Ala for the five Cys residues (CA mutant) resulted in a shift in molecular weight to a smaller value than that of the wild-type protein on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2), whereas the molecular weight shift in full-length Cys to Ala single mutant (C74A, C75A, C77A, C79A, or C82A) was so small that we could not determine whether each of the Cys residues was fatty-acylated (Fig.2 B, lanes 3–7). To clarify the post-translational modification of each Cys residue, T7-Syt IΔN/ΔC2AB proteins lacking both the amino-terminal domain and two C2 domains were used (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig.2 C, T7-Syt IΔN/ΔC2AB(CA) mutant proteins yielded a single band (lane 2, arrowhead), whereas the other proteins showed broad bands (two major bands, seearrows and arrowhead). Because the lowest band of the wild-type and the single Cys to Ala mutants correspond to the band of the CA mutant (arrowhead in Fig. 2 C), they are probably unmodified proteins. The apparent molecular weight of the highest band of the single Cys to Ala mutants was clearly smaller than that of the wild-type protein (compare open andclosed arrows in Fig. 2 C). When the wild-type protein bands were analyzed in a higher magnification, six bands could be detected (two major and four minor bands; arrowheads in Fig. 2 D), indicating that all five Cys residues are post-translationally modified (fatty-acylated), as described previously (37Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 38Chapman E.R. Blasi J. An S. Brose N. Johnston P.A. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the SDS-resistant oligomer of CA mutants was not detected even when the x-ray film was overexposed (Fig.2 C, left panel) and that the SDS-resistant oligomerizing activity of single Cys to Ala mutants (dimer/monomer ratio is about 0.05) was significantly reduced as compared with the wild-type proteins (dimer/monomer ration, about 0.25). Under our experimental conditions, we could detect the SDS-resistant pentamer of Syt I on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2 C, left panel). These results strongly suggest that the strength of the SDS-resistant oligomer depends on the number of Cys residues that are fatty-acylated. To further examine whether Syt I oligomers form in intact membranes, a cross-linking experiment was performed (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) (39Schivell A.E. Batchelor R.H. Bajjalieh S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27770-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Following treatment of membrane fractions with either water-soluble, cleavable, homobifunctional cross-linker (Sulfo-BSOCOES) or water-soluble, noncleavable, heterobifunctional cross-linker (Sulfo-MBS), the Syt IΔN/ΔC2AB and Syt I shifted from the monomer range to thetop of the gel (Fig. 2 E, asterisk and data not shown), suggesting that Syt I forms a large complex. Interestingly, we could detect a monomer to decamer shift of Syt I only after treatment with Sulfo-BSOCOES (Fig. 2 E, lane 2), which may be due to partial cleavage of the cross-linker in the gels. By contrast, in the control experiment (addition of water alone or cross-linking of Syt IΔN/ΔC2AB(CA)), we could not detect such a large oligomer (Fig. 2 E, lanes 1,4, and 5). Thus, we concluded that Syt I proteins indeed form a large oligomer even in the membranes. The Cys cluster at the interface between the transmembrane and spacer domains is known to be present in all Syt isoforms except Syt XII, but the number of Cys residues differs with each isoform (parentheses in Fig. 3). If the results obtained from Syt I Cys to Ala mutants are applied to other isoforms, SDS-resistant oligomer formation by other Syt isoforms should depend on the number of Cys residues at the interface between the transmembrane and spacer domains. As expected, we could easily detect the SDS-resistant dimer of Syt II (seven Cys), Syt I (five Cys), and Syt VIII (five Cys) (Fig. 4 A). The SDS-resistant dimers of Syt VII (three Cys) also could be detected, but its activity was weaker than that of Syts I, II, and VIII (their apparent oligomerizing potencies were in the following order: Syt II > Syt I = Syt VIII > Syt VII ≫ Syt IV). By contrast, only a weak SDS-resistant dimer of Syt IV (two Cys) was detected even after prolonged exposure of the x-ray film, and no dimer band of Syt XII was detected (zero Cys). To further confirm that the number of Cys residues determines SDS-resistant oligomer formation by the synaptotagmin family, we artificially introduced additional Cys residues into Syt IX at the interface between the transmembrane and spacer domains (named Syt IX+C1 and +C2; Fig. 4 B). As expected, the potency of SDS-resistant dimer formation significantly increased as the number of Cys residues increased. It is noteworthy that an SDS-resistant trimer band was only observed with the Syt IX+C2 proteins (Fig. 4 C, lane 3). In the next set of experiments, we investigated whether the Cys residues at the interface between the transmembrane and spacer domains of Syt I are the sole mechanism of oligomerization, because we could not rule out the possibility that Syt I also contains a second site that is involved in SDS-sensitive self-oligomerization. To determine whether it does, we performed a T7 and FLAG dual-tag co-immunoprecipitation assay, as described above. As shown in Fig. 5A, the self-oligomerization activity of the CA mutant was dramatically reduced as compared with the wild-type (lanes 1 and 3), but the CA mutant still showed oligomerization activity. Since the T7-Syt IΔspacer proteins did not show Ca2+-independent oligomerization (Fig.1 B), the spacer domain must also be involved in SDS-sensitive Ca2+-independent oligomerization. We previously showed that Syt I hetero-oligomerizes with Syts I and VII when transiently co-expressed in COS-7 cells (16von Poser C. Zhang J.Z. Mineo C. Ding W. Ying Y. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30916-30924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since the Cys to Ala substitution of Syt I almost completely abolished the hetero-oligomerization of Syt I with Syts II and VII (Fig. 5B, third panel), the Cys cluster of Syt I was found to be essential for both stable Ca2+-independent homo- and hetero-oligomerization. In the final set of experiments, we used gel filtration column chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) to determine how many Syt I molecules assemble via the Cys cluster or around the spacer domain. As shown in Fig.6(upper panel), the Syt IΔN/ΔC2AB proteins were eluted at around 60–100 kDa. The SDS-resistant oligomer (dimer or trimer) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel seemed to be eluted faster than the monomer (arrows in upper panel), whereas the mutant Syt IΔN/ΔC2AB(CA) proteins were eluted significantly slower than the wild-type protein on the same gel filtration column (Fig. 6, lower panel; around 80–40 kDa), consistent with the results of immunoprecipitation described above. Because the calculated molecular weight of both the wild-type and mutant Syt IΔN/ΔC2AB proteins is about 10,000, a maximum of six to ten molecules of Syt IΔN/ΔC2AB is estimated to have clustered, as opposed to a maximum of four to eight mutant proteins. These results, together with the immunoprecipitation results described above, strongly indicate that the spacer domain is essential for oligomerization of Syt I molecules (four to eight molecules) and that the fatty-acylated Cys cluster augments their oligomerization capacity, enabling them to form higher oligomers (six to ten molecules). In the early 1990s, Syt I was shown to form an SDS-resistant oligomer, and it was hypothesized that it functioned in an oligomerized state during neurotransmitter release based on the results of a genetic analysis of Drosophila synaptotagmin mutants (18Littleton J.T. Bellen H.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 19Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several potential mechanisms for Syt I oligomerization (e.g.amphipathic α-helix in the spacer domain or disulfide bonding) (19Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

In this study, we first demonstrated that the post-translationally modified (i.e. fatty-acylated (37Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E.

Commun. 1996; 225: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) Cys residues (Cys-74, Cys-75, Cys-77, Cys-79, and Cys-82) at the interface between the transmembrane and spacer domains of Syt I are essential for stable SDS-resistant self-oligomerization by Ala-based site-directed mutagenesis (Figs. 2 and 5). Our finding, that the number of modified Cys residues determines the strength of SDS-resistant oligomerization by Syt I, provides an explanation for the distinct self-oligomerization activity of the synaptotagmin family, as described previously (21Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The number of Cys residues in the mouse synaptotagmin isoforms (Syts I-XIII) at the interface between the transmembrane and spacer domains differs from zero to seven (Fig. 3). Syts I, II, VII, and VIII form stable SDS-resistant Ca2+-independent oligomers via the modified Cys clusters (more than three Cys residues), whereas Syts IV, IX, and XI form rather weak SDS-resistant Ca2+-independent oligomers, because they contain only two or three Cys residues, and Syt XII, which completely lacks Cys residues, did not form any SDS-resistant oligomers. Syts III, V, VI, and X are exceptional, because Syts III, V, and VI stably oligomerize by forming disulfide bonds in the extracellular domain rather than by their few fatty-acylated Cys residues (only two Cys residues) (31Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and both disulfide bonding and three Cys residues at the interface between the transmembrane and spacer domains equally contribute to oligomer formation by Syt X. 2M. Fukuda, unpublished observations. We also demonstrated that the spacer domain of Syt I is involved in SDS-sensitive oligomerization by gel filtration column chromatography (Fig. 6). Due to the relatively weak interaction, such SDS-sensitive oligomers probably dissociate into monomers after extensive washing of the immunoprecipitants (Fig. 5 A). Because the spacer domain is a highly diversified region among the synaptotagmin family (1Marquèze B. Berton F. Seagar M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we speculate that it is unlikely to be a common module that contributes to homo- and hetero-oligomerization in the synaptotagmin family. Because the synaptotagmin isoforms, except Syt XII, have Cys clusters at the interface between the transmembrane and spacer domains, are they (Syts I-XI, and XIII) able to form stable hetero-oligomers via the modified Cys residues in all possible combinations? Although certainly possible even in vivo, we noted certain limitations to hetero-oligomerization in the synaptotagmin family. First, once oligomerization occurs via fatty-acylated Cys clusters, it is highly stable, because T7-Syt and FLAG-Syt associations are only observed by co-transfection assay, not in mixtures in which they are expressed separately (21Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because of this, hetero-oligomerization via the fatty-acylated Cys cluster should occur in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane immediately after two newly synthesized proteins are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and are fatty-acylated (41Rizzolo L.J. Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9520-9525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because the spatio-temporal expression of several synaptotagmins is different (42Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 43Berton F. Cornet V. Iborra C. Garrido J. Dargent B. Fukuda M. Seagar M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18290-18296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), hetero-oligomerization of the isoforms may be limited in vivo. Second, synaptotagmin isoforms containing a high number of Cys residues seem to preferentially assemble with their own isoforms rather than with synaptotagmin isoforms having a low number of Cys residues. For instance, hetero-oligomerization of Syt I (five Cys) with Syt II (seven Cys) can easily be detected both in the brain (26Osborne S.L. Herreros J. Bastiaens P.I.H. Schiavo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 59-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and as a result of overexpression in COS-7 cells (22Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas hetero-oligomerization of Syt I (five Cys) with Syt IV (two Cys) was difficult to detect even in the overexpression study (22Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Third, relative expression of each isoform is another important factor for hetero-oligomerization, because oligomerization is a concentration-dependent reaction. In our preliminary experiments, hetero-oligomerization of the synaptotagmin family proved to be more limited than we expected (22Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,27Desai R.C. Vyas B. Earles C.A. Littleton J.T. Kowalchyck J.A. Martin T.F.J. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), because Syts I and II are the predominant isoforms in the brain and the others are minor components.2 Further work is necessary to elucidate whether hetero-oligomerization of Syt I with other isoforms (e.g. Syt VII) can modulate the Ca2+-sensing function of Syt I. In summary, we have shown that fatty-acylation of Cys clusters at the interface between the transmembrane and spacer domains of Syt I is essential for stable homo- and hetero-oligomerization and that the number of the Cys residues is the primary determinant of the SDS-resistant oligomerization activities of the synaptotagmin family. This stable oligomerization enables efficient Ca2+-dependent C2B clustering in response to rapid increases in Ca2+ ions. We thank Chika Saegusa for technical assistance."

Serial C-terminal truncation of CCR5 resulted in progressive loss of cell surface expression; mutants truncated at the 317th position and shorter were not detected at the cell surface. Alanine substitution of basic residues in the membrane-proximal domain (residues 314–322) in the context of a full-length C-tail resulted in severe reduction in surface expression. C-terminal truncation that excised the three cysteines in this domain reduced surface expression, but further truncation of upstream basic residue(s) abolished surface expression. Substituting the carboxyl-terminal domain of CXCR4 for that of CCR5 failed to rectify the trafficking defect of the tailless CCR5. In contrast, tailless CXCR4 or a CXCR4 chimera that exchanged the native cytoplasmic domain for that of wild type CCR5 was expressed at the cell surface. Deletion mutants that expressed at the cell surface responded to chemokine stimulation and mediated human immunodeficiency virus entry. Substitution of all serine and threonine residues in the C-terminal tail of CCR5 abolished chemokine-mediated receptor phosphorylation but preserved downstream signaling (Ca2+ flux), while substitutions of tyrosine residues in the C-tail affected neither phenotype. CCR5 mutants that failed to traffic to the plasma membrane did not exhibit obvious changes in metabolic turnover and were retained in the Golgi or pre-Golgi compartments(s). Thus, the basic domain (-KHIAKRF-) and the cysteine cluster (-CKCC-) in the C-terminal tail of CCR5 function cooperatively for optimal surface expression.

In addition, as members of GPCR family, they share a common three-dimensional architecture composed of seven transmembrane (TM) domains arranged in a counter-clockwise toroidal conformation, which defines multiple extracellular and intracellular loops (10Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 11Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol.

They possess extracellular N termini of variable length and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain containing unique motifs critical for ligand-dependent receptor signaling, internalization, and desensitization (13Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 14Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Manes S. Martinez A.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 397-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These architectural requirements and the need to interact precisely with cellular components pertinent to receptor function may subject them to post-translational regulatory mechanisms. Specifically, intracellular trafficking of some GPCRs may reflect the need for specific cellular helper proteins to facilitate maturation and transport that may underlie their tissue-specific expression. Transport of some chemokine receptors such as CCR2A is restricted by cis-negative retention signals in the receptor tail (15Wong L.M. Myers S.J. Tsou C.L. Gosling J. Arai H. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1038-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This may not be the case for CCR2B, CXCR2, or CXCR4, since C-terminal truncation of these receptors has little or no effect on cell surface expression (16Arai H. Monteclaro F.S. Tsou C.L. Franci C.

The role of the C-tail of CCR5 in surface expression, signaling and HIV usage has also been examined more directly. Truncation of the terminal carboxyl-tail to eight amino acids blocked chemokine-dependent activation of intracellular calcium flux and the cellular response of chemotaxis but not the ability to act as HIV-1 co-receptor (36Gosling J.

Another report showed that a CCR5 mutant lacking the last 45 amino acids of the cytoplasmic C terminus (CCR5306) was expressed on transfected cells and displayed normal chemokine binding affinity and HIV co-receptor activity.

In contrast, Shioda et al. (40Shioda T. Nakayama E.E. Tanaka Y. Xin X. Liu H. Kawana-Tachikawa A. Kato A. Sakai Y. Nagai Y. Iwamoto A. J.

In this report, we have examined the structural elements in the carboxyl-terminal domain of CCR5 required for optimal surface expression.

Some of the mutants were also cloned into FLAG vector (Sigma) that appended a FLAG epitope at the N terminus of the indicated receptors. Monolayers were transfected by the CaCl2 method (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) or by lipofection using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The JJK line of Jurkat T cells (contributed by Dan Littman, Columbia University) in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS was transfected by use of a Bio-Rad electroporator (Bio-Rad) at a setting of 250 V and 960 microfarads. Pseudotyped HIV stocks expressing firefly luciferase in place of Nef were prepared by transfecting 293-T cells (by CaCl2 precipitation) with 5 µg each of defective HIV provirus, pNL4–3 Env(−), vpR(−), luciferase(+), and plasmids encoding HIV-JRFL or avian myeloblastosis virus env (obtained through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Rockville, MD). Virus collected in the culture supernatants was quantified by reverse transcriptase assay and adjusted to constant reverse transcriptase units/ml. 293-T cells were transfected (by the CaCl2 method) with CD4 alone or with a mixture of CD4 and the indicated CCR5 plasmid and harvested 36 h later. After checking the transfection efficiency by FACS analysis, CD4+ cells were purified by binding to and elution from CD4 antibody-coated magnetic beads using a commercial kit (Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY) that resulted in recovery of >90% CD4+ cells. Eluted cells were seeded into 48-well plates (0.5–1 × 105 cells/well) and infected in triplicate with the respective pseudotyped luciferase-expressing HIVs. About 24–30 h after infection, cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using a commercial kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and a microplate luminometer (Multex, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). The following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or rabbit antisera were used to identify the various chemokine receptors: 1) for CCR2, mAb, clone 48607 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); 2) for CCR3, FITC- or PE-conjugated rat mAb, clone 61828 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), mouse mAb 7B1 (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program); 3) for CCR5, FITC- or APC-conjugated mAb 2D7, PE-conjugated mAb 3A9 (BD-Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), FITC-conjugated mAbs 181 and 182 (R & D Systems), unconjugated mAbs 2D7, 3A9, 5C7, 180, 181, 182, and 183 (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), and rabbit antibody against the N-terminal end of CCR5 (38Alkhatib G. Locati M. Kennedy P.E. Murphy P.M. Berger E.A. Virology. 1997; 234: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); 4) for CXCR1, FITC- or PE-conjugated mAb, clone 42705 (R & D Systems), or unconjugated anti-CXCR1 antibody CDw128 (BD-Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); 5) for CXCR2, FITC- or PE-conjugated mAb, clone 48311 (R & D Systems) or unconjugated mAb, IL-8-Rb (BD-Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); and 6) for CXCR4, FITC-, PE-, or APC-conjugated mAb 12G5 (R & D Systems and BD-Pharmingen), FITC-conjugated mAb 173 (R & D Systems), and unconjugated mAbs 12G5, 171, 172, and 173 (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). For detecting CD4, FITC- or PE-conjugated mAb Leu 3A (BD-Pharmingen) or APC- or TC (tricolor)-conjugated mAb S3.5 (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used. For CD8 detection, FITC- or PE-conjugated mAb Leu 2A (BD-Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) or mAb 3B5 conjugated with APC or TC (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used. In some cases, a commercial kit was used to conjugate primary antibodies with fluorescein or one of the Alexa dyes (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). For secondary staining, dye-conjugated purified Fab fragments with the relevant species specific reactivity were obtained from commercial sources (Molecular Probes and Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). For determination of cell surface antibody binding, 105cells from the respective transfections were collected by centrifugation and washed with PBS. They were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the respective fluorochrome-conjugated or -unconjugated monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibodies in 50 µl of PBS containing 3% BSA or 2% FCS and 0.02% sodium azide. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing BSA or FCS and then resuspended in 50 µl of PBS with BSA or FCS and incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (as indicated) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. For detection of internal antigens, the cells were permeabilized and fixed prior to staining by use of a commercial kit (BD-Pharmingen). Flow cytometric data acquisition was by using a two-laser, four-color Becton Dickinson FACSortTM flow cytometer. Data analysis was done using CELLQUESTTM version 3.3 (BD-Pharmingen) and FlowJo version 3.3.4 (The Treestar Inc., San Diego, CA) software. For metabolic labeling experiments, 293-T cells (106 to 107) at 24–30 h after transfection (as described in the appropriate figure legends) were rinsed three times with and incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% dialyzed FCS (0.2 ml per sample) for 10 min. Cells were labeled for 1 h by the addition of 35S Trans-label (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) to 1 mCi/ml. For measuring the kinetics of protein biosynthesis, 2 × 107 cells were labeled for 15 min in 500 µl of labeling medium (1 mCi/ml). At the end of the labeling, the cells were diluted with 10 volumes of complete RPMI medium. Aliquots were removed immediately after labeling and at the indicated periods during the chase (from 0 to 12 h). The cells were rinsed twice in PBS and processed for SDS-PAGE analysis. The cells were disrupted by three cycles of freeze-thawing in 500 µl of extraction buffer containing 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40 (or CHAPS), 0.25% Triton X-100, and one tablet of protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by extraction at 4 °C for 1 h. The extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation, supernatants were precleared by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with 30 µl of immobilized protein G-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) coated with preimmune rabbit or mouse sera. Labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated for 3 h at 4 °C with protein G-agarose beads prebound to the corresponding anti-rabbit polyclonal or anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies. Following specific antibody binding, the immunobeads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with 10–20 volumes of extraction buffer lacking protease inhibitors, and the labeled proteins were eluted by boiling in 50 µl of a buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, glycerol (10%, v/v), and bromphenol blue (0.1%, w/v). The radiolabeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, visualized by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and quantified. For immunofluorescence detection of receptors on live cells, transfected cells plated on coverslips were rinsed with PBS and reacted with receptor-specific antibodies in PBS containing 0.3% BSA for 30 min at 4 °C. For CCR2B, unconjugated CCR2 mAb (R & D Systems) was used; for CCR3, FITC-conjugated rat anti-CCR3 or unconjugated rat anti-CCR3 (R & D Systems) was used; for CCR5, FITC- or APC-conjugated 2D7 (BD-Pharmingen) or FITC-conjugated 182 (R & D Systems) mAbs were used. CCR5 transfections were also checked with rabbit serum against N-terminal peptide of CCR5. CDw168 and IL8-Rb mAbs (BD-Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) were used to stain for CXCR1 and CXCR2, respectively. For staining CXCR4, APC-conjugated 12G5 (BD-Pharmingen) or FITC-conjugated 12G5 or 173 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) mAbs were used. In cases where first antibodies were unlabeled, the coverslips were rinsed five times with PBS and stained with Alexa 488 or Texas Red-conjugated second antibodies (Fab fragments, Molecular Probes) in PBS containing 0.3% BSA for 30 min at 4 °C. After rinsing five times with PBS, the coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnologies, Birmingham, AL). For detecting intracellular antigens, cells were fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C, rinsed five times with PBS, permeabilized by 15 min of treatment with 0.25% Triton X-100 (or Nonidet P-40) in PBS at 25 °C, and reacted as above with the respective antibody combinations. The following organelle-specific antibodies were used to detect co-localization of the receptors with various subcellular compartments: 1) for ER, mAbs (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) or rabbit sera (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, BC) against calnexin or calreticulin, anti-heme oxygenase mAb or rabbit anti-BiP (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada), or anti-protein-disulfide isomerase mAb (from Affinity Bioreagents); 2) rabbit anti-β-COP (Sigma); 3) for Golgi, Deng mAb or mannosidase (donated by Nelson Cole of NHGRI, NIH; and Juan Bonifacino of CBMB, NICHD, NIH); 4) for TGN, anti-TGN 38 mAb (Affinity Bioreagents) or sheep anti-TGN 46 (Serotec Inc., Raleigh, NC); and 5) for plasma membrane, anti-transferrin receptor (CD71, from Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA), Na+/K+ ATPase (Affinity Bioreagents), or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor mAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Images were collected on a Leica TCS-NT/SP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Exton, PA) using a × 63 or × 100 oil immersion objective NA 1.32 and digital zoom up to × 2.2. Fluorochromes were excited using an argon laser at 488 nm for Alexa 488 or FITC and a krypton laser at 568 nm for Alexa 568 or Texas Red and helium/neon laser at 633 nm for APC. Detector slits were configured to minimize any cross-talk between the channels, or the channels were collected separately and later superimposed. Differential interference contrast images were collected simultaneously with the fluorescence images using the transmitted light detector. Images were processed using the Leica TCS-NT/SP software (version 1.6.551), Imaris 3.0.2 (Bitplane AG, Zurich Switzerland), and Adobe Photoshop 6.01 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Cells (∼107/ml) were incubated in Hanks' balanced saline solution and 2.5 µm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 30–60 min at 37 °C in the dark. The cells were then washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution and suspended at 107cells/ml. 4 × 106 cells were stimulated with the indicated chemokines (purchased from Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) or ATP in a total volume of 2 ml in a continuously stirred cuvette at 37 °C in a fluorimeter (Photon Technology Inc., South Brunswick, NJ). Data were recorded every 200 ms as the relative ratio of fluorescence emitted at 510 nm after sequential excitation at 340 and 380 nm. To identify the carboxyl-terminal domains of CCR5 required for cell surface expression, we first engineered a C-terminal set of deletion mutants shown schematically in Fig. 1A. Deletions labeled Δ1 through Δ4 were also tagged at the 5′-end with a FLAG epitope, and for comparison we used a WT CCR5 carrying an identical epitope. Steady-state cell surface expression was examined following transfection of primate epithelial cell lines including 293-T, HeLa, and COS-1 cells and Jurkat T-lymphocytes. To normalize for transfection efficiencies, CD8 was co-transfected, and the distribution of CD8 and CCR5 was examined by two-color FACS using respective monoclonal antibodies directly conjugated with nonoverlapping chromophores (i.e. FITC and TC or PE and APC). Representative results using 293-T cells are illustrated in Fig.2A. Cells transfected with CD8 or WT CCR5 alone set the distinct population boundaries for cells staining positively for CCR5 or CD8. A dot plot of cells transfected with WT CCR5 and CD8 showed a double positive diagonal population with almost equivalent staining for both receptors. C-terminal truncations resulted in a progressive decrease in the relative surface density of CCR5 in the transfected populations that had equivalent CD8 expression. Mean fluorescence values (MFVs) for CCR5 were computed for the transfected population (gated for CD8) and normalized to constant CD8 values. MFVs decreased from 452 for the FLAG-WT CCR5 to 140 (a 66% reduction) for a truncation to the 320th residue. The Δ4 mutant that lacked the entire C-tail from truncation at the 306th residue was essentially negative for surface expression in this assay. Truncation to the 320th residue lacking three cysteine residues that are targets of palmitoylation (KRFX) displayed a modest decrease when compared with the Δ3 (KCCX) mutant of 324 residues (MFV of 110versus 161 for Δ3). Further truncation (HIAXmutant) that eliminated the upstream lysine and arginine at positions 318 and 319 was severely restricted for surface expression. The significant drop (50–60%) from the WT expression levels for the KCCX mutant prompted us to inquire whether the serines and threonines in the C-tail, which may be targeted by GPCR kinase(s) or arrestin, are critical for surface expression. A mutant named S/T → A, which exchanged all of the serines and threonines for alanines exhibited a WT phenotype. Mutating the tyrosines at 307 or 339 was also without effect as was excision of the -DRY- motif (ΔDRY) in the second ICL of CCR5,"

Thus, the formation of interactions between activators and target proteins is critical for the regulation of all cellular genes. Despite extensive investigations, the molecular basis of activation domain function is still poorly understood, and thus activation domains are still classified according to their amino acid composition as acidic, glutamine-rich, or proline-rich. One of the reasons for slow progress may be that many existing observations appear intrinsically paradoxical. For example, mutagenesis studies of several highly acidic activation domains have revealed a predominant importance of hydrophobic amino acids (43Almlof T. Wallberg A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1220-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, although transactivation domains apparently need to make specific interactions with several different target factors, they are usually composed of short amino acid segments with a poor intrinsic propensity for structure formation (21Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Campbell K.M. Terrell A.R.

Indeed, fortuitous activation domains have even been found within proteins that are not involved in transcription (49Ruden D.M. Ma J. Li Y. Wood K. Ptashne M. Nature. 1991; 350: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Early models suggested that the unstructured acidic activation domains (“acid blobs”) recruited components of the transcriptional machinery via nonspecific ionic interactions (50Ptashne M. Gann A.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These models, however, do not account for the important role of hydrophobic residues, and more recently it has been shown that some activation domains are structured when bound to target factors (18McEwan I.J.

We show that TBP needs an extended c-Myc sequence for interaction. Binding proceeds in two steps, where an initial weak complex forms rapidly by electrostatic interactions. This weak complex slowly converts to a more stable form in a reaction that has the thermodynamic characteristics of protein folding. We present two alternative models in which single-copy transactivators bind their target proteins in a stepwise fashion, whereas multicopy transactivators might bind in a simple one-step reaction. Taken together, these results provide a molecular framework for understanding how transcriptional activator proteins can make apparently specific interactions with a large number of different target proteins. All standard laboratory chemicals were obtained from Sigma or through Merck Eurolab (Stockholm, Sweden). Plasmid pT7yD (53Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Diane Hawley (University of Oregon). Plasmid pGEXTNBZ was obtained by replacing theBamHI/SalI fragment of pGEX4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a double-stranded oligonucleotide of the following sequence.GATCACCGCATATGGAATTCCCGGGATCCTGACTGGCGTATACCTTAAGGGCCCTAGGACTGAGCTSEQUENCE1 Plasmids pGSTTmyc41 and pGSTT66myc127, encoding the GST fusion protein of c-Myc amino acids 1–41 and 66–127, respectively, were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the corresponding fragments of c-Myc, including NdeI andBamHI restriction sites in the amplification primers. The polymerase chain reaction fragments were ligated intoBamHI/NdeI restricted pGEXTNBZ. These modifications add six extra amino acids, G-S-P-H-M-A, between the GST and the Myc part of the fusion protein, as well as two amino acids, G-S, to the C terminus. Plasmid pGSTTmyc143 was constructed by cloning theNdeI/BamHI fragment from pET19myc (18McEwan I.J. Dahlman-Wright K. Ford J. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9584-9593Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) intoNdeI/BamHI restricted pGEXTNBZ. The identity of all fusion plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing. Yeast TBP was overexpressed in Escherichia coliBL21/DE3(pLysS) transformed with pT7yD and initially purified on heparin-agarose and DEAE-cellulose as described previously (53Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified on CM-Sepharose (linear gradient 75–400 mm KCl) and phosphocellulose. Purified TBP was dialyzed into TC100 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mmKCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. GST fusion proteins were overexpressed from the corresponding plasmids in E. coli BL21/DE3(pLysS). Cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), lysed by freeze-thawing and sonication, and the fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) according to standard protocols. GSTmyc143 was further purified and separated from shorter proteolytic products (mainly free GST) by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), where GST is in the flow-through fraction, and GSTmyc143 can be eluted from the column with 300 mm KCl. The GST fusion proteins were dialyzed into TC100 and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. GST was overexpressed from plasmid pGEXTNBZ, purified on glutathione-agarose, dialyzed into TC100, and stored at −80 °C. His-tagged Myc143 was purified as described previously (18McEwan I.J. Dahlman-Wright K. Ford J. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9584-9593Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured with Coomassie Protein Reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as a standard, and by UV absorption. Both techniques gave similar results. All proteins were at least 95% pure, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SPR analysis of binding was performed using a BIAcore2000 instrument under the control of BIAcore control 3.0 software (BIACORE, Uppsala, Sweden). This setup allows to simultaneously monitor the binding of one protein dissolved in the mobile phase to four different proteins immobilized onto different areas of the sensor chip. Anti-GST antibodies were immobilized onto all four measuring areas of a Pioneer B1 sensor chip (both from BIACORE) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the flow rate and dual-injection modifications described by Wu and co-workers (54Wu Y. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3951-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For the initial binding experiments, about 3000 RU of antibody were immobilized. For the kinetic experiments, areas 1 and 2 were targeted with 500 RU and areas 3 and 4 with 1000 RU of antibody. The binding capacity of the antibodies was tested by capturing GST protein. Unless otherwise noted, all binding studies were carried out at 25 °C with HBS-EP (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mmEDTA, 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20; BIACORE) supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 as running buffer. For kinetic experiments, the measuring areas were regenerated with two short (1 min) pulses of regeneration buffer (10 mm glycine, pH 2.2; BIACORE). Subsequently, GST was captured onto areas 1 and 3, and freshly thawed GSTmyc143 was captured onto areas 2 and 4. TBP was thawed on ice, diluted with running buffer to the appropriate concentration, and injected over all four measuring areas at a flow rate of 20 µl/min. The recorded data were on-line corrected for background binding to GST (area 2-area 1, area 4-area 3). Data analysis was performed with BIAevaluation 3 software (BIACORE), except for the calculation of rapid equilibrium constants. Here, Kaleidagraph 3.0 (Abelbeck Software) was used to fit the binding data to the following equation,θ=[Tt]KD+[Tt]Equation 1 where θ is the fractional saturation and [Tt] is the total concentration of TBP. Sensorgrams were simulated using Hopkinsim (Johns Hopkins University), which is based on the kinsim algorithm (55Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Fluorescent analysis of binding was performed using a Shimadzu RF5000 spectrofluorimeter in a buffer similar in composition to SPR running buffer, except that it did not contain any detergent. The slitwidth for both excitation and emission was set to 4 nm. The excitation wavelength was set to 270 nm, and the emission spectrum from 305 to 400 nm was recorded at a scan speed of 0.8 nm/s. Assuming a 1:1 binding stoichiometry, an equilibrium constant was estimated using the equation of Swillens (56Swillens S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1197-1203PubMed Google Scholar). Many TADs can interact with their target factors via short stretches of amino acids (54Wu Y. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3951-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 57Svetlov V. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7644-7652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To find the minimal sequence of c-Myc that interacts with TBP, we tested shorter fragments of the c-Myc TAD. In a yeast transactivation assay, two such constructs, residues 1–41 and 66–127, were able to activate transcription, whereas residues 42–65 and 128–149 did not. 2E. Flinn and A. P. Wright, manuscript in preparation. We therefore prepared GST fusion proteins containing residues 1–41 and 66–127, respectively, as well as the full TAD (1), and tested them for their ability to interact with TBP, monitoring the interaction in real time by SPR (Fig. 1). To our surprise, while TBP interacted efficiently with the full TAD, no significant interaction with the shorter fragments could be detected. This suggests that an extended range of residues is needed for efficient interaction of Myc with TBP and that efficient interaction requires more than an abundance of acidic residues and/or glutamines within the TAD. When analyzing the data presented in Fig. 1, we noticed that the interaction appeared to be biphasic, a very fast initial binding followed by a much slower increase in response signal. To determine whether the fast phase had any significance or was an artifact caused by the bulk signal subtraction (58Ober R.J. Ward E.S. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we captured different concentrations of GSTmyc143 onto two measuring areas and corresponding amounts of GST onto the remaining measuring areas. TBP was injected over all four measuring areas at an increased flow rate to minimize the time delay. The differential signal GSTmyc143-GST still showed a fast phase (Fig.2A). Moreover, the magnitude of the fast phase was proportional to the surface concentration of GSTmyc143, indicating that it was indeed caused by the interaction between the immobilized Myc protein and TBP. In addition, the wash-out phase also exhibited a biphasic behavior: a rapid initial drop followed by a slower reduction. The magnitude of the fast signal loss was consistently slightly smaller than the fast binding (Fig. 2 Aand data not shown). Such a biphasic response can have several causes. For example, heterogeneity in the immobilized surface protein, i.e. a population of GSTmyc143 that binds fast and a population that binds slowly or a population that binds strongly (slow off-rate) and a population that binds weakly (fast off-rate) would lead to the observed behavior. Alternatively, a conformational change in the c-Myc-TBP complex, transforming it from a fast-dissociating into a slow-dissociating complex, could also explain the binding data. To distinguish between these possibilities, we repeatedly injected TBP over the surface, with the shortest intervening time interval permitted by the instrument (Fig. 2 B). The closer the response approached saturation, the smaller the relative magnitude of the fast phase became, both for the binding and the wash-out phases. Such a behavior is consistent with a conformational change model, but not with models relying on surface heterogeneity. Importantly, the response extrapolates to a numeric value consistent with a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. To be able to estimate rate constants for the reaction, we monitored the binding of TBP to GSTmyc143 at various TBP concentrations (Fig.3A). Global analysis using BIAevaluation, and the pre-defined conformational change model did not give reliable results, since minor changes in various reaction parameters caused major changes in the rate constants calculated for the fast phase. To circumvent this problem, we treated the binding reaction as a rapid equilibrium followed by a slow conversion step.TBP+Myc⇄KACinitial⇄k−2k2CfinalEquation 2 To estimate an equilibrium constant K A for the fast phase, we recorded the magnitude of the fast phase, approximated by the response 10 s after injection, as a function of TBP concentration. Since Fig. 2 B showed a 1:1 stoichiometry, indicating that all the Myc molecules on the surface are available for binding, the fast phase response could be converted to a fractional saturation θ (Fig. 3 B) and an equilibrium constant calculated according to Equation 1. An off-rate for the slow phase can be calculated directly from the data using a simple binding model (d[C final]/dt =k −2 × [C final]). An estimate for the rate constant of the slow binding phase can be obtained with the following differential equation.dCfinaldt=k2×KA×[TBP]×[Myc]−k−2×CfinalEquation 3 Finally, K 0, the equilibrium constant for the overall reaction, can be calculated from the equilibrium constant for the fast step and the kinetic constants for the slow step. The parameters thus obtained are K A = 1.1 × 105 liters/mol, k −2 = 2.6 × 10−4 s−1, k 2 = 4.7 × 10−3 s−1 andK 0 = 1.9 × 106 liters/mol. To test the validity of this approach, we simulated this model (Equation2) using the thermodynamic and kinetic constants obtained above (Fig.3 C). The simulated curve correlates very well with the data, indicating that the model is a close approximation of reality, whereas a simple one-step Langmuir binding isotherm does not fit the data (Fig.3 C). One potential disadvantage of using SPR to monitor binding is that it is a method in which one reaction partner has to be immobilized close to a surface. This might change the binding parameters due to steric hindrance or other problems. While Fig. 2 B extrapolates to the predicted saturation value, indicating that all GSTmyc143 immobilized onto the surface is available for binding, it was still a formal possibility that the binding characteristics were influenced by the immobilization. We therefore wanted to monitor the interaction with an independent method. The fluorescence emission spectrum of TBP undergoes spectral changes upon binding to DNA (59Perez-Howard G.M. Weil P.A. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8005-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A preliminary test showed that the interaction of TBP with c-Myc also lead to spectral changes, although of minor magnitude (data not shown). We utilized these spectral changes to monitor the binding of c-Myc to TBP. A constant amount of TBP was titrated with small aliquots of His-tagged c-Myc143, and after waiting for equilibrium, the emission spectra were recorded. Two mock-titrations were performed, where TBP was titrated with buffer and where buffer was titrated with c-Myc. The differential emission between 305 and 315 nm was averaged and plottedversus the total c-Myc concentration (Fig. 3 D). When analyzed analagous to Swillens (56Swillens S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1197-1203PubMed Google Scholar), an overall apparent equilibrium constant of 2.3 × 106 liters/mol was calculated. This corresponds very well with theK 0 value calculated from the SPR results, and thus we conclude that the c-Myc-TBP interaction is not seriously affected by immobilization of c-Myc to a surface. To further characterize the interaction between c-Myc and TBP, we monitored the binding at various temperatures and salt concentrations and analyzed the data as shown in Fig. 3. These and the previous results are summarized in Table I. It is obvious that the complex is favored at elevated temperatures and that it is mainly the second step that is affected by temperature (Fig.4A). The initial binding, the rapid equilibrium, is not influenced. For the second step, the conversion from an unstable to a stable complex, van't Hoff analysis, reveals positive enthalpic and entropic contributions (ΔH = 133 kJ/mol, ΔS = 479 J mol−1 K−1), indicating that this entropy-driven reaction involves hydrophobic interactions. In contrast, the initial binding step is less stable at elevated salt concentration (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that polar and ionic interactions play a predominant role.Table ISummary of the measured affinity constantsTemperature[NaCl]K 1K 2K 0°Cmmliters/molliters/mol51502.1 ± 0.5 × 1052.3 ± 0.74.8 × 105101506 ± 3 × 1052.0 ± 0.61.2 × 106151503 ± 1 × 1053.4 ± 0.41.0 × 106251501.1 ± 0.5 × 10518 ± 21.8 × 106301506 ± 1 × 105376 ± 2002 × 10825504.7 ± 0.9 × 10522 ± 21 × 107253001.2 ± 0.9 × 104105 ± 431.3 × 106Room temperature150Fluorescence2.3 × 106 Open table in a new tab The minimal TAD of some activator proteins has been defined as a very short stretch of continuous amino acids. Examples of such simple transactivators include the yeast transcriptional activators Gal4p, where 17 residues are sufficient to activate transcription (54Wu Y. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3951-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and Gln3p, whose minimal transactivation domain has been mapped to 13 residues (57Svetlov V. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7644-7652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, there are more complex TADs like those from the mammalian transactivator pax 6 (60Tang H.K. Singh S. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7210-7221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or the human glucocorticoid receptor (61Dahlman-Wright K. Almlof T. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) for which a larger stretch of amino acid residues is necessary for efficient transactivation. Our results indicate that c-Myc is likely to belong to the second class of transactivators, since an extended activation domain is required for efficient interaction with TBP (Fig. 1). The interaction with TBP does not seem to be solely ionic, as has been suggested for some acidic TADs, since the two shorter fragments that do not interact efficiently have a net acidity that is higher than the intact TAD. The apparent contradiction with the finding that the shorter Myc fragments interact poorly if at all with TBP, yet can nonetheless activate transcription in yeast cells,2 may be reconciled if the relative intracellular protein concentration is taken into account. The short fragments were present in concentrations that were orders of magnitude above the concentration of the construct carrying the full c-Myc TAD due to the lack of protein degradation signals that are present in the latter protein (13Flinn E.M. Busch C.M. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5961-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This overexpression is likely to lead to increased occupancy of the c-Myc DNA binding sites in the reporter construct and thereby to a reduced dependence on high affinity interactions with at least some target proteins. Thus the findings presented here together with unpublished work2 strongly suggest that at least two distinct regions within the c-Myc activation domain contribute to efficient target factor interaction. Generally, TADs have little, if any, secondary or tertiary structure when they are isolated in solution (19Lee H. Mok K.H. Muhandiram R. Park K.H. Suk J.E. Kim D.H. Chang J. Sung Y.C. Choi K.Y.

However, a small number of complexes between TADs and their target factors have been studied at atomic resolution, and all show that the TAD has a distinct tertiary structure in the complex (20Parker D. Jhala U.S. Radhakrishnan I. Yaffe M.B. Reyes C. Shulman A.I. Cantley L.C. Wright P.E. Montminy M. Mol.

Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In many other cases, including c-Myc, the adoption of secondary structure has been suggested based on spectral changes or mutational studies (18McEwan I.J. Dahlman-Wright K. Ford J. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9584-9593Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Baert J.L. Monnot M. de Launoit Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The question that has been unresolved so far is, when this postulated folding of the TAD takes place. Our results (Figs. 3 and 4) suggest that initial binding precedes the folding of the TAD. According to the model shown in Fig. 5A, the initial contact with target proteins occurs by electrostatic interactions, presumably between acidic residues of the TAD and positive charges on the target. This unstable complex has a dissociation constant in the supermicromolar range. It slowly converts to a more stable form in a process that involves folding of the TAD into a defined structure and presumably formation of specific contacts between the TAD and its target. Supporting evidence for this model comes from mutational analysis of the VP16 and glucocorticoid receptor (τ1) TADs. These studies revealed that individual acidic residues were of minor importance, but that the total acidity of the protein was important for activity (46Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 65Almlof T. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17535-17540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, substitutions of individual hydrophobic amino acids did affect activity (46Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 66Almlof T. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a group of such mutants that altered the activity of the τ1 TAD had similar effects on its interactions with a variety of target proteins (43Almlof T. Wallberg A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9586-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that the mutations affect a common mechanism such as protein folding that is an essential prerequisite for stable interaction of the TAD with all target proteins (43Almlof T. Wallberg A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9586-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). TADs frequently interact with more than one target factor. A strategy where the TAD does not fold into a specific structure until it encounters a target factor can be thermodynamically advantageous. The intermolecular protein-protein interaction surface can then be fitted closely to many structurally diverse target proteins, unrestricted by a pre-formed structure, thus increasing the stability of the complexes (67Tsai C.J. Xu D. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1793-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A “bind then fold” strategy can also be advantageous kinetically, utilizing a postulated pathway that Shoemaker and co-workers (68Shoemaker B.A. Portman J.J. Wolynes P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8868-8873Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) have termed the “flycasting mechanism. ” According to this model an unstructured protein has a larger interaction radius and thus encounters its target faster than a fully folded protein. The target can subsequently be “reeled in” through protein folding. It may be that not all TADs rely on the mechanism proposed in Fig.5 A, despite its potential thermodynamic, kinetic, and specificity advantages. When an activator binds in multiple copies to its target genes, as is often the case with artificial reporter gene systems, multiple weak interactions could be sufficient to stabilize the complex and thus achieve transactivation (Fig. 5 B). In such cases folding of the TAD into a specific three-dimensional structure might not be required. This mechanism might be physiologically relevant in enhancers of metazoan promoters, where many transactivators often bind adjacently. Transactivators working through this latter mechanism of multiple weak interactions might have a kinetic advantage, since they might be able to bind target proteins faster than transactivators relying on the bind then fold mechanism. However, they would lose the specificity achieved by specific hydrophobic interactions. On naturally occurring promoters, a “healthy” mixture of fast (but not very specific) and slow (but specific) activator-target interactions may contribute to the appropriate balance required for regulated gene expression.

These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that immunophilin dFKBP59 is part of the TRPL-INAD signaling complex and plays an important role in modulation of channel activity via interaction with conserved leucyl-prolyl dipeptides located near the cytoplasmic mouth of the channel. protein responsible for the transient receptor potential Drosophilamutant cells heterologously expressing the human B2 bradykinin receptor cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration Drosophila immunophilin p48 FK506-binding protein glutathione S-transferase protein responsible for the inactivation-no-after-potential Drosophila mutant 4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid Na+-H+ exchange regulatory factor number of channels × probability of opening phospholipase C ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Spodoptera frugiperda store-operate channel Drosophila TRP-like protein cell heterologously expressing TRPL channels calmodulin polymerase chain reaction fluorescein isothiocyanate MES-buffered saline leucyl-prolyl isoleucyl-prolyl valyl-prolyl In Drosophila eye, photostimulation of rhodopsin leads to activation of the Ca2+-permeable transient receptor potential(TRP)1 andtrp-like (TRPL) channels (1Montell C.

This response, which depends on phospholipase C, is extremely rapid and results in depolarization of the photoreceptor cell followed by Ca2+-mediated feedback regulation of the visual signaling cascade. The biochemical or biophysical link between stimulation of PLC and channel activation remains unknown. Originally it was proposed that TRP and TRPL were store-operated channels (SOC) (2Hardie R.C. Minke B. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 371-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), i.e.channels activated by depletion of Ca2+ from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-sensitive internal Ca2+ stores. More recent studies (4Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 5Estacion M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 530: 1-19Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) suggest that hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5,-bisphosphate and the concomitant generation of diacylglycerol play a direct role in channel activation. Heterologous expression of TRPL gives rise to Ca2+-permeable, non-selective cation channels that are unaffected by depletion of internal stores but are activated following stimulation of membrane receptors linked to phosphoinositide turnover (6Dong Y.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5833-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, recombinant TRP is more selective for Ca2+ and is activated by depletion of internal stores by thapsigargin (9Vaca L. Sinkins W.G. Hu Y. Kunze D.L. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1501-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Xu X.Z.S. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These studies strongly support the hypothesis that TRP and TRPL proteins form the essential subunit structure of the channels responsible for light-induced conductance change inDrosophila photoreceptor cells. Studies in photoreceptor cells have shown that TRP channels are held in a signaling complex (i.e. a signalplex) by a scaffolding protein called INAD (13Shieh B.H. Niemeyer B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C.

Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). INAD contains five tandem PDZ domains that are thought to act as protein-binding modules mediating the clustering of membrane and membrane-associated proteins. INAD has been shown to interact through the PDZ domains with itself and with a number of proteins involved in the phototransduction cascade including PLC, protein kinase C, rhodopsin, TRP, and TRPL, thus potentially creating clusters of signaling complexes (17Xu X.S. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Studies have also shown that calmodulin (CaM) associates with the signalplex possibly by direct binding to INAD and/or TRP and TRPL. In Drosophila this signalplex appears to be an essential structural feature necessary for a normal photoresponse. When the TRP-INAD interaction is disrupted by a point mutation in the third PDZ domain of INAD, TRP is no longer spatially restricted to its normal subcellular compartment,i.e. the rhabdomere (14Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and stimulation by light reveals a defect in deactivation of the light-induced current (13Shieh B.H. Niemeyer B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic disruption of TRP-INAD interaction results in retinal degeneration (14Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In trp mutant flies, INAD is also mislocalized within the photoreceptor cell suggesting that TRP-INAD interaction is necessary for mutual localization (18Li H.-S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 19Tsunoda S. Sun Y. Suzuki E. Zuker C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 150-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, ∼25% of the INAD seen in the rhabdomere of wild-type flies remains associated with the rhabdomere in trp mutants. This residual INAD may be necessary for light activation of TRPL channels observed in trp mutant photoreceptor cells (19Tsunoda S. Sun Y. Suzuki E. Zuker C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 150-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably through INAD-mediated association of TRPL with the other members of the signalplex. The biochemical similarity between Drosophilaphototransduction and receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling in mammalian cells led to the cloning of mammalian TRP genes. To date, seven primary mammalian TRP homologs have been identified (TRPC1–C7) that appear to be activated by receptor-dependent mechanisms at least when heterologously expressed (20Zitt C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A mammalian gene bearing some homology to Drosophila INAD has also been identified and cloned (27Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but there are no data to suggest that it interacts with mammalian TRP proteins. However, murine TRP4 and TRP5 bind to the first PDZ domain of the Na+-H+exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) (28Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has also been shown that PLCβ1 and PLCβ2 bind to the same PDZ domain indicating that NHERF may be capable of bringing together signaling molecules. Although the functional implications of NHERF interaction with either PLC or TRP channel proteins remain unknown, it seems reasonable to speculate that PDZ-containing proteins will form the scaffolding necessary for signalplex formation and localization in mammalian cells expressing the TRP channels. In this regard, the TRP channel signalplex may be localized to caveolar structures present in the plasmalemma of some mammalian cell types (29Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, the number or identity of accessory proteins associated with the signalplex in either mammalian or Drosophila cells remains unknown. In the present study, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify other proteins involved in regulation of TRP channels. By using INAD as bait to screen a Drosophila head cDNA library, the Drosophila immunophilin dFKBP59 was identified. To elucidate the possible role of dFKBP59 in channel regulation, TRPL and dFKBP59 were co-expressed in Sf9 insect cells using recombinant baculovirus, and Ca2+ influx via TRPL was measured using the fura-2 fluorescence assay. The effect of purified recombinant dFKBP59 on single TRPL channel activity was monitored in excised inside-out patches from TRPL-expressing Sf9 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were employed to demonstrate physical interaction between recombinant TRPL, INAD, and dFKBP59. Finally, to test for interactions in vivo, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations of endogenous proteins were done from lysates of Drosophila S2 cells and fly heads. The results suggest that Drosophila immunophilin dFKBP59 is part of the TRPL-INAD signalplex and may be an important modulator of channel activity. MES-buffered saline (MBS) contained the following: 10 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 17 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 4 mmd-glucose, 110 mm sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm MES, pH adjusted to 6.2 at room temperature with Trizma (Tris base). The total osmolarity of MBS was ∼340 mosm. Thapsigargin and bradykinin (BK) were obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-GST antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-FLAG from Sigma, and anti-VR1 from Chemicon. Anti-FKBP59 and anti-FKBP12 were from Affinity BioReagents and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Note that although the anti-FKBP antibodies are designated as specific, we have found that both commercially available antibody preparations recognize both FKBP12 and FKBP59. Anti-TRPL and anti-INAD antibodies were generous gifts from Dr. Craig Montell (The Johns Hopkins University) and Dr. Bih-Hwa Shieh (Vanderbilt University), respectively. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured as described previously (30Hu Y. Rajan L. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1736-C1743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,31O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar) using Grace's Insect Medium supplemented with 2% lactalbumin hydrolysate, 2% yeastolate solution, 2 mml-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). The LexA interaction trap system was employed as described previously (32Finley R.L. Brent R. Hames B.D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning 2, Expression Systems: A Practical Guide. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 169-203Google Scholar). Briefly, InaD was cloned as a LexA fusion into pEG202 and introduced into yeast strain EGY48 harboring the pSH18-34 LacZ reporter plasmid. InaD did not activate transcription of the LEU2 and LacZ reporters by itself and was also shown to enter the nucleus in a repression assay. To screen for potential interactors, an activation-taggedDrosophila head cDNA library in pJG4-5 vector (a generous gift from Dr. Michael Rosbash, Brandeis University) was transformed en masse into the EGY48 selection strain and plated onto −Ura/−His/−Trp drop-out media to select for all three plasmids. Approximately 106 colony-forming units were plated onto each 100-mm galactose/raffinose −Ura/−His/−Trp/−Leu plate to induce expression of activation-tagged proteins and to select for Leu+ potential interactors. After shutting off expression on glucose master plates, individual colonies were replica-patched onto selection media. Library transformants showing galactose-dependent Leu+ and LacZ phenotypes were picked for further characterization. Rescued library plasmids were re-introduced into the original selection strain and into strains harboring irrelevant baits to verify specificity of interaction. All plasmids and yeast strains were obtained from Dr. Roger Brent (Harvard University). A forward primer was designed to incorporate the nine amino acids missing from the amino terminus of dFKBP59 partial cDNA clone. The sequence of the primer pairs used are as follows: forward, 5′-CA CCA TGGATGCCGGAAGGGAATAAAATCGACTTG TCC GGG GAC GGT GGC GTC CTA AAG G-3′; reverse, 5′-GAG CGG CCG CTT AGA TCA TGA TTA TAT TGT CGC GCT CCA GCG TCA ATT CTG CTT CG-3′. Plasmids containing the partial cDNA of dFKBP59 were purified and used as a template for the PCR. The amplified product was subcloned into pGEMT easy (Promega) and sequenced to verify structure and to confirm that no errors were introduced during amplification. Full-length dFKBP59 cDNA was subcloned in-frame with the GST start codon of the bacterial expression vector pET42a (Novagen) between the BamHI and NotI restriction sites and transformed into the protease-deficient BL21 Escherichia coli strain. Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and incubating for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. Both soluble and particulate fractions were assessed for presence of fusion proteins by SDS-PAGE. The fusion protein, which was found mainly in the soluble fraction, was affinity-purified using the B-PER His6 fusion protein purification kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The GST-dFKBP59 fusion protein was further purified using the B-PER GST fusion purification kit (Pierce). The dFKBP59 was cleaved from the fusion protein by factor Xa digestion. The cleaved dFKBP59 was concentrated and dialyzed against a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using a Ultra-free BioMax spin 30,000 filter. The final protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent, and protein purity was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Mutants were generated by two-step PCR method as described previously(33Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used for mutagenesis are as follows: P702Q, 5′-GACAGTGCCACCCTGCAACCACCCTTCAATGTCCTGCCCTCCGTCAAGTGGGTC-3′; P709Q, 5′-GACAGTGCCACCCTGCCGCCACCCTTCAATGTCCTGCAATCCGTCAAGTGGGTC-3′. The corresponding PCR products were digested with restriction enzymesAflI1 and DraI11 and subcloned into pVL1393 containing full-length TRPL cDNA cut with the same enzymes. Mutations were verified by sequence analysis. For bacterial expression, the COOH-terminal domains of TRPL, TRPL:(P702Q) and TRPL:(P709Q) were PCR-amplified using primer pairs as follows: forward, 5′-CTCGTACAGCGTCATTAACGTGATTG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGGCCGCTTAGTTTCGATGCTTTGGCCGCTGGGGAC-3′. The primers amplified a region encompassing nucleotides 1951–3375 base pairs that encode amino acids 651–1124 of TRPL. The PCR fragments were purified and cloned in-frame with the GST start codon of the bacterial expression vector pET42a between EcoRI and NotI restriction sites. Clones in the correct orientations were transformed into BL21, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and isolated using a glutathione affinity column. The cDNAs encoding Drosophila TRPL, human B2 bradykinin receptor, dFKBP59, INAD, and the rat vanilloid receptor, VR1, were individually subcloned into baculovirus transfer vectors, pVL1393 and pAcGHLT, using standard techniques. The cDNA for INAD and VR1 were generous gifts from Drs. Bih-Hwa Shieh (Vanderbilt University) and David Julius (University of California, San Francisco), respectively. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced using BaculoGoldTM Transfection Kit (PharMingen, San Diego) as described in the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Recombinant viruses were plaque-purified and -amplified to obtain a high titer viral stock solution. The virus was stored at 4 °C under sterile conditions and used for infection of Sf9 cells as described previously (30Hu Y. Rajan L. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1736-C1743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hu Y. Schilling W.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells in Grace's medium were plated into 100-mm plastic tissue culture dishes or onto glass coverslips (∼105 cell/cm2). Following incubation for 30 min, an aliquot of viral stock was added (multiplicity of infection was ∼10), and the cells were maintained at 27 °C in a humidified air atmosphere. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were used at 24–32 h post-infection. FrozenDrosophila heads were homogenized in 0.5 ml of buffer A (30 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, plus protease inhibitors), using a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 4000 × gfor 1 min. A microsomal fraction was isolated from the resultant supernatant by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 (fly head lysate). Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus or S2 cells were lysed in 1 ml of buffer containing 0.2% n-dodecyl-β-maltoside, 0.2 mmsodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The protein extracts from Sf9 and S2 cells and fly head lysates were centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to remove the cell debris and partially solubilized membrane fragments. Lysates (∼400 µg of protein) were precleared by adding control IgG together with protein A/G-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Pre-cleared lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 3 h. Immunocomplexes were captured by incubating with protein A/G-agarose beads at 4 °C for 12 h. Beads were pelleted, washed four times with buffer A, resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer (100 µl), and boiled for 3 min. Cell lysates and immunocomplexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (5 µg of lysate protein or 10 µl of immunoprecipitate per lane) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (100 V for 1 h) in Tris glycine buffer. Blots were probed with the indicated primary antibody at 1:2000 to 1:7000 dilution and detected using ECL-Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Heads from wild-type Drosophila were fixed in Bouin's fixative (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 3 h at room temperature. After dehydration by consecutive incubation in 50, 70, and 90% acetone, the heads were embedded in paraffin. Cross-sections of 10-µm thickness were cut and placed on microscope slides. The slides were subsequently treated with xylene to dissolve the paraffin. Following the rehydration by consecutive incubations in 90, 70, and 50% ethanol, the sections were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with anti-FKBP antibodies (1:300) overnight at 4 °C. For negative controls, the sections were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300). The sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated 1 h with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) at room temperature, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence was visualized using a FITC-HYQ filter cube (excitation and emission wavelength 480/505 nm) on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. The images were obtained using Spot RT camera and analyzed using spot advanced software (Spot Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). [Ca2+]i was measured in Sf9 cells using the fluorescent indicator, fura-2, as described previously (30Hu Y. Rajan L. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1736-C1743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hu Y. Schilling W.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were dispersed, washed, and resuspended at a concentration of 1.5–2 × 106cell/ml in MBS containing 2 µm fura-2/AM. Following 30 min of incubation at room temperature (22 °C), the cell suspension was subjected to centrifugation, resuspended in an equal volume of MBS, and incubated for an additional 30 min. The cells were washed twice, and fluorescence was measured using an SLM 8100 spectrophotofluorimeter. Excitation wavelength alternated between 340 and 380 nm, and fluorescence intensity was monitored at an emission wavelength of 510 nm. All measurements on Sf9 cells were performed at 22 °C. Calibration of the fura-2 associated with the cells was accomplished using Triton lysis in the presence of a saturating concentration of Ca2+ followed by addition of EGTA (pH 8.5). [Ca2+]i was calculated by the equation of Grynkiewicz et al. (35Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using aKd value for Ca2+ binding to fura-2 of 278 nm for 22 °C (36Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1410-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, the results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. The patch clamp technique was utilized in cell-attached and excised inside-out recording modes (9Vaca L. Sinkins W.G. Hu Y. Kunze D.L. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1501-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed on single Sf9 cells at room temperature (∼22 °C). Unless otherwise indicated, the bath and pipette solutions contained 100 mm sodium gluconate, and 10 mm MES, pH 6.5. The osmolarity was adjusted to 340 mosm with mannitol. Free Ca2+ concentration in this solution, determined using fura-2 fluorescence, was 1.6 µm. Data were obtained using an Axopatch 1-D amplifier (Pacer Scientific, Los Angeles), using pClamp 8.0 software, and recorded on VCR tape via a VR-10B Digital Data Recorder interface (Instrutech Corp., Great Neck, NY) for subsequent computer analysis. Single channel records were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized, and analyzed using pClamp8 and EDA (Event Dynamic Analysis Utility (38Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar)). Open probability of multichannel patches are calculated from the idealized events binned at 1-s intervals. Where indicated, n equals the number of cells examined under each condition. Statistical differences were determined by t test with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons where appropriate (39Winer B.J. Statistical Principles in Experimental Design. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1962Crossref Google Scholar);p < 0.05 was considered significant. To identify novel proteins involved in regulation of TRP channels, INAD was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Yeast harboring LexA-INAD fusion and LacZ reporter plasmids were transformed with an activation-tagged Drosophila head cDNA library. Screening of 105 individual clones for galactose-dependent leucine phototrophy and β-galactosidase activity resulted in more than 40 positive clones. Library plasmids were rescued from positive clones and individually retransformed into the original yeast selection strain or into strains harboring irrelevant baits to confirm specificity of interaction with INAD. This secondary screening step identified 10 positive clones. The 10 clones were partially sequenced and compared with known proteins in the data base. Sequence analysis revealed that one of the identified INAD-binding clones was a novel Drosophila protein homologous to mammalian immunophilin-p59. Immunophilin-p59 belongs to a large family of proteins that bind the immunosuppressant drug, FK506, and has been designated as FK506-binding protein-59 or FKBP59 (the mammalian protein is currently designated FKBP52 (40Marks A.R.

https://openalex.org/W2109886704,"The first crystallographic structure of human type 3 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD3, AKR1C2), an enzyme playing a critical role in steroid hormone metabolism, has been determined in complex with testosterone and NADP at 1.25-Å resolution. The enzyme’s 17β-HSD activity was studied in comparison with its 3α-HSD activity. The enzyme catalyzes the inactivation of dihydrotestosterone into 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (3α-diol) as well as the transformation of androstenedione into testosterone. Using our homogeneous and highly active enzyme preparation, we have obtained 150-fold higher 3α-HSD specificity as compared with the former reports in the literature. Although the rat and the human 3α-HSDs share 81% sequence homology, our structure reveals significantly different geometries of the active sites. Substitution of the Ser222 by a histidine in the human enzyme may compel the steroid to adopt a different binding to that previously described for the rat (Bennett, M. J., Albert, R. H., Jez, J. M., Ma, H., Penning, T. M., and Lewis, M. (1997) Structure5, 799–T812). Furthermore, we showed that the affinity for the cofactor is higher in the human 3α-HSD3 than the rat enzyme due to the presence of additional hydrogen bonds on the adenine moiety and that the cofactor is present under its reduced form in the active site in our preparation.

These isozymes catalyze the inactivation of androgens, estrogens, progestins, and glucocorticoids. However, the inactivation of the most potent androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT) to 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (3α-diol) is its best known function (1Liao S. Liang T. Fang S. Castaneda E. Shao T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6154-6162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These isoenzymes thus play a major role in the regulation of the intracellular concentration of 3α-DHT in peripheral tissues, especially in the androgen-sensitive prostate that is susceptible to benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Testosterone, after entering prostatic cells, is transformed to 5α-DHT by 3-oxo-5α-steroid-4-dehydrogenase (2Bruchovsky N. Wilson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2012-2021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wilson J.D. Gloyna R.E. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1970; 26: 309-336PubMed Google Scholar). 5α-DHT is a more potent androgen than testosterone in stimulating prostate cancer growth (4Fang S. Anderson K.M. Liao S. J. Biol.

Wilson J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1970; 49: 1737-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Elevation of 5α-DHT content in prostate has been associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia in humans (6Siiteri P.K. Wilson J.D. J. Clin.

The action of 5α-DHT may be terminated by 3α-HSD, which catalyzes the inactivation of 5α-DHT to 3α-androstanediol (a weak androgen;Kd for the androgen receptor of 10−6m) (1Liao S. Liang T. Fang S. Castaneda E. Shao T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6154-6162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that, by catalyzing the reverse reaction, 3α-HSD may function as a molecular switch and, in this manner, may regulate the amount of 5α-DHT available for androgen receptor binding and activation. Three isoforms of 3α-HSD have been described in human tissues (10Deyashiki Y. Taniguchi H. Amano T. Nakayama T. Hara A. Sawada H. Biochem.

At least two related 3α-HSD isoforms (type 2 and type 3) have been detected in the human prostate (13Lin H.K. Jez J.M. Schlegel B.P. Peehl D.M. Pachter J.A. Penning T.M. Mol.

Thus, 3α-HSD3 may increase the pool of active androgens in the prostate. Through its action on allopregnenolone, 3α-HSD also regulates the GABAA receptor (Kd = 10−9m), a membrane-bound chloride ion-gated channel, and may have profound effects on the receptor function (15Majewska M.D. Harrison N.L.

It is reported that the type 1 enzyme is the most efficient in DHT reduction, with its substrate specificity (expressed in kcat/Km) being 10- to 40-fold higher than the other members of the family. The type 2 enzyme (AKR1C3) shows a significantly higher activity in catalyzing the transformation of androstenedione (4-dione) to testosterone than the other two types of 3α-HSD. In this regard, it is more similar to 17β-HSD and therefore was first named type 5 17β-HSD (17Labrie F. Luu-The V. Lin S.-X. Labrie C. Simard J. Breton R. Belanger A.

The human type 3 3α-HSD, cloned in our laboratory (12Dufort I. Soucy P. Labrie F. Luu-The V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), is the only member of the 3α-HSD family that converts 3α-diol to the most active androgen 5α-DHT, despite the functional plasticity of members of the family (14Penning T.M.

This enzyme shows a much higher amino acid sequence identity to human 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20α-HSD) than to the type 1 and 2 3α-HSDs. There are only seven amino acid differences over the 323 residues between the type 3 3α-HSD and 20α-HSD (AKR1C1) (12Dufort I. Soucy P. Labrie F. Luu-The V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

At the difference of the rat enzyme, human 3α-HSDs are present in different isoforms with varying steroid specificities. Our structure represents the first structure of a prostatic 3α-HSD.Detailed studies of prostatic 3α-HSD3 are required to understand its role in androgen metabolism and action. In this paper, we describe the structure of the human 3α-HSD3 at near atomic resolution, in complex with NADP and testosterone. With such resolution, we are able to describe in detail the interactions occurring between the different partners. This is critical to understand the mechanism of recognition of these multispecific enzymes. Description of the detailed interactions between the enzyme, NADP, and the steroid constitutes an important step that may lead to rational drug design. The search of inhibitors for the oxidative activity of 3α-HSD3 based on structural evidence would be a step forward in the treatment of prostate cancer. In our study, the same preparation with high specificity was used for both kinetics and crystallization. The kinetic results are also reported and compared with the structural information.

Pmr1 co-localized with the Golgi-specific 58K protein and was targeted to a Ca2+ store that was less leaky for Ca2+ than the endoplasmic reticulum and whose inositol trisphosphate receptors were less sensitive to inositol trisphosphate and ATP than those in the endoplasmic reticulum. ATP-stimulated Pmr1-overexpressing cells responded after a latency to extracellular Ca2+ with a regenerative Ca2+ signal, which could be prevented by caffeine.

The role of this latter organelle in the generation of cytosolic Ca2+ signals is not well known, partly because the mechanism by which the Golgi complex takes up Ca2+ is less well understood compared with the Ca2+ transport into the endoplasmic reticulum mediated by the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). The Golgi apparatus expresses a specific Ca2+ pump belonging to the Pmr1 family of Ca2+-transport ATPases (13Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Pmr1 is insensitive to the inhibitor thapsigargin (14Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), in contrast to the SERCA Ca2+pumps in the sarco- and endoplasmic reticulum (15Lytton J. Westlin M.

We demonstrate that a Ca2+ store filled by the Pmr1 Ca2+ pump and probably belonging to the Golgi compartment can set up baseline Ca2+ spiking. COS-1 cells and HeLa cells were cultured as described previously (12Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol.

The cells were plated at a density of 2500 cells/cm2 in Coverglass Chambers (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) or at a density of 10,000 cells/cm2 in 12-well clusters (Costar, MA). Four days after plating, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with Pmr1 from C. elegans or with the rabbit SERCA1a in pMT2 vector and investigated 3 days later (12Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J.

The antiserum against SERCA2a was described previously (19Eggermont J.A. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The antibody against the 58K protein of the Golgi apparatus (clone 58K-9) was purchased from Abcams (Cambridge, UK). Fluxes were performed on saponin-permeabilized cells at 25 °C as described previously (20Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. Nature. 1992; 357: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The cells were permeabilized by treating them for 10 min with 20 µg/ml saponin at 25 °C in a medium containing 120 mmKCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP and 1 mm EGTA. The non-mitochondrial Ca2+ stores were loaded for 45 min in loading medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mmimidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.44 mm EGTA, 10 mmNaN3, and 150 nm free Ca2+ (23 µCi/ml). Thapsigargin (2 µm) was added to the loading medium if inhibition of pumping by the SERCA Ca2+ pumps was needed. Efflux was performed in a medium containing 120 mmKCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), and 1 mmEGTA. Free [Ca2+] was calculated by the Cabuf program (available on the Web at ftp.cc.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/droogmans/cabuf.zip) and based on the stability constants given by Fabiato and Fabiato (21Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the experiment the 45Ca2+remaining in the stores was released by incubation with 1 ml of a 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution for 30 min. [Ca2+]i was measured in single indo-1-loaded cells at 25 °C using an MRC-1024 (Bio-Rad) system as described (16Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Oike M. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5817-5823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were superperfused with 135 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11.6 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 11.5 mm glucose, and either 1.5 mmCa2+ or 2 mm EGTA. Some cells were pretreated for 1 h with 2 µm thapsigargin. Total microsomal fractions from non-transfected control COS-1 cells and from Pmr1- and SERCA-transfected COS-1 cells as well as from CHO cells were essentially prepared as previously described (22Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Bootman M.D. Sienaert I. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). CHO cells were chosen as positive control for IP3 receptor expression, because we previously reported the presence of the three IP3 receptor isoforms in those cells (23De Smedt F. Missiaen L.

Microsomal preparations were boiled for 2 min in sample buffer, analyzed on 3–12% Laemmli-type linear gradient gels, transferred to Immobilon-P, and probed with isoform-specific antibodies against IP3 receptor type 1 (Rbt04), type 2 (Rbt02), or type 3 (MMAtype3, Transduction Laboratories, KY) (22Parys J.B.

The expression levels of Pmr1 and SERCA2b were measured in the same microsomal fractions using the previously described antibodies against Pmr1 (12Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L.

Analysis of the immunoreactive bands after incubation with secondary antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase, detection using Vistra ECF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) and fluorescence imaging were performed exactly as described before (27Vanlingen S. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 58K protein is a Golgi-specific protein (28Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1A shows a double labeling of the 58K protein (Fig. 1Aa) and Pmr1 (Fig. 1Ab) in COS-1 cells transfected with the cDNA of Pmr1 of C. elegans. The superimposed image (Fig. 1Ac) reveals that Pmr1 was mostly expressed in the same compartment as the 58K protein. Labeling of SERCA2a in COS-1 cells transfected with the cDNA of pig SERCA2a was used to immunolocalize the endoplasmic reticulum. Double labeling of the 58K protein (Fig. 1Ba) and SERCA2a (Fig.1Bb) reveals that the subcellular distribution of SERCA2a differed from that of the Golgi marker (Fig. 1Bc). Although these data clearly show that Pmr1 is targeted to the Golgi apparatus and has a different subcellular distribution than the endoplasmic reticulum marker, the technique of immunocytochemistry does not allow to prove that Pmr1 was exclusively present in the Golgi complex. Therefore, the functional properties of the Pmr1-induced Ca2+ store were compared with those of the endoplasmic reticulum in control and SERCA-overexpressing cells. The ATP-driven uptake of Ca2+in non-mitochondrial Ca2+ stores was measured in COS-1 cells with permeabilized plasma membrane. In non-transfected control COS-1 cells, Ca2+ accumulation was fully inhibited by 2 µm thapsigargin (Fig.2A, open bars), indicating that all this Ca2+ uptake was SERCA-mediated and occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum. This conclusion is confirmed by the observation that the [Ca2+]i rise induced by addition of 100 µm of extracellular ATP as an agonist in intact non-permeabilized cells incubated in Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 3A) also disappeared in the presence of thapsigargin (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Intracellular Ca2+ release and capacitative Ca2+ entry in COS-1 cells.A, effect of 100 µm ATP on [Ca2+]i in non-transfected control cells.

An additional Ca2+ uptake was also induced by transfection with SERCA1, which was, however, completely inhibited by 2 µm thapsigargin (Fig. 2A, hatched bars). The Pmr1-induced thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+ store was also available for agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling, because it could be released by 100 µm extracellular ATP in intact non-permeabilized cells pretreated with 2 µm thapsigargin (Fig.3C). Fig. 2B shows the passive leak of Ca2+ from non-transfected control cells loaded with Ca2+ in the absence of thapsigargin and from Pmr1-overexpressing cells loaded with Ca2+ in the presence of 2 µm thapsigargin in an efflux medium containing 2 mm EGTA and no added Ca2+ or ATP. Unidirectional Ca2+ efflux occurred under these conditions, because (i) the calculated free [Ca2+] (<10 nm) was below the threshold to stimulate the SERCA or Pmr1 Ca2+ pumps and (ii) no ATP to fuel the pumps was included in the efflux medium. It is clear that the rate of Ca2+loss from the Pmr1-induced compartment (closed circles,full line) was much lower than that from the endoplasmic reticulum (open circles, dotted line). To compare the [IP3] dependence of the IP3receptors in the Pmr1-induced Ca2+ store and in the endoplasmic reticulum, both types of stores were loaded with45Ca2+ and then challenged with IP3in efflux medium. The open circles and dotted line in Fig. 2C illustrate the Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum as a function of the [IP3]. The closed circles and full line are the values for the Pmr1-induced Ca2+ store. The EC50 was 1.1 µm IP3 for the endoplasmic reticulum (dotted arrow) and 2.3 µm IP3 for the Pmr1-induced Ca2+store (solid arrow). A maximal [IP3] released 88% of the ionophore-releasable Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum but only 33% from the Pmr1-induced Ca2+ store. There are two possible explanations for this incomplete Ca2+ release. First, the IP3 receptors may be only expressed in a subcompartment of this store. Alternatively, feedback by the decreasing luminal [Ca2+] could prevent complete Ca2+ release from a more homogeneous compartment, as has also been reported for the IP3-induced Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (20Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. Nature. 1992; 357: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 30Nunn D.L. Taylor C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 115-119PubMed Google Scholar). Submillimolar ATP concentrations ensure a more efficient coupling between the IP3 binding at the N terminus of the IP3 receptor and the opening of the channel at its C terminus (31Ferris C.D.

Fig. 2D illustrates the effect of increasing concentrations of ATP on the IP3-induced Ca2+ release from the Pmr1-induced Ca2+ store (closed circles, full line) and from the endoplasmic reticulum (open circles, dotted line). Ca2+ release from the former Ca2+store differed from that in the endoplasmic reticulum by its insensitivity to ATP. In conclusion, the Ca2+ store induced by overexpression of Pmr1 in COS-1 cells differed in its functional properties from the endoplasmic reticulum. These data are compatible with the different subcellular localization, as revealed by the immunocytochemistry in Fig. 1. Control and SERCA1- and Pmr1-overexpressing cells incubated in Ca2+-free solution in the presence of 100 µm ATP dramatically differed in their response to re-addition of 1.5 mm extracellular Ca2+. The addition of extracellular Ca2+ to control COS-1 cells incubated in the presence of 100 µm ATP produced an immediate, but relatively slow rise in [Ca2+]i, both in the absence (Fig. 3A) and presence of 2 µm thapsigargin (Fig. 3B). It was somewhat surprising that the addition of Ca2+ to control COS-1 cells stimulated with ATP gave a similar rise in [Ca2+]i in the presence and absence of thapsigargin, as the presence of the inhibitor was expected to result in a faster and larger Ca2+ signal because Ca2+ buffering by the endoplasmic reticulum would be inhibited. However, 300 µm IP3 released almost all of the releasable Ca2+ in permeabilized COS-1 cells (Fig. 2C), indicating that a maximal [ATP] resulted in the emptying of almost the entire endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store. SERCA1-overexpressing cells also responded to Ca2+ in the presence of thapsigargin with an immediate slow [Ca2+]i rise (Fig. 3D). In contrast, Pmr1-overexpressing COS-1 cells stimulated with 100 µm ATP in the presence of 2 µm thapsigargin did not show an immediate response to re-addition of Ca2+, but reacted after a latency of variable duration with a sudden and fast [Ca2+]i rise, characteristic of a regenerative Ca2+ release (Fig. 3C). The [Ca2+]i rise upon re-addition of Ca2+ to non-transfected control COS-1 cells in a medium containing 100 µm ATP and 2 µm thapsigargin was very similar in the absence (Fig.4A) and presence of 10 mm caffeine (Fig. 4B), an inhibitor of the IP3 receptor (35Parker I. Ivorra I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 433: 229-240Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 36Missiaen L. Taylor C.W. Berridge M.J. J. Physiol.

Inhibition of the IP3receptor therefore had no effect on capacitative Ca2+ entry in COS-1 cells. In contrast, 10 mm caffeine prevented the regenerative [Ca2+]i rise in Pmr1-overexpressing cells, whereas washing out of the caffeine resulted in an immediate all-or-none [Ca2+]i rise (Fig. 4, Cand D). This finding indicates that the IP3receptor might be involved in the sudden and fast [Ca2+]i rise after the latency (see “Discussion”). Immunofluorescence showed that about 30% of the transfected COS-1 cells expressed the worm Pmr1 (data not shown). These transfected cells were easily detectable during Ca2+-imaging experiments, because only the transfected cells responded to ATP in the presence of thapsigargin (Fig.3C), whereas non-transfected cells never responded under these conditions (Fig. 3B). The majority (i.e. 57%) of the Pmr1-overexpressing COS-1 cells, when challenged with 1 µm ATP in the presence of 2 µm thapsigargin, set up remarkably stable baseline Ca2+ oscillations (Fig.5A). The shape of the Ca2+ spikes differed among the cells (Figs. 5Aaand 6A). They could be abortive (Fig.6B) or appear after a long latency of sometimes 10 min (data not shown). The frequency of the oscillation increased when the [ATP] was increased from 1 to 10 µm (Fig. 6C).Figure 6Baseline Ca2+ oscillations in Pmr1-overexpressing COS-1 cells.A and B, typical baseline Ca2+ spikes recorded in cells stimulated with 1 µm ATP in the presence of 2 µmthapsigargin. C, effect of increasing the [ATP] from 1 to 10 µm in a medium containing 2 µmthapsigargin. D, a thapsigargin-pretreated Pmr1-overexpressing cell was incubated in Ca2+-free medium from 1 min before starting the recording for the time period indicated by the gray bar and stimulated with 1 µm ATP, after which the extracellular [Ca2+] was increased to 1.5 mm in the continuous presence of ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) [Ca2+]i transients induced by 1 µmATP in Pmr1-overexpressing cells persisted for some time in Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 6D), indicating that the Ca2+ was released from an intracellular source and that this Ca2+ store contained enough Ca2+, or was sufficiently efficient in Ca2+ re-accumulation, to set up a few [Ca2+]i rises. Sustained Ca2+oscillations, however, depended on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 6D). The Golgi-disturbing agent ilimaquinone (20 µm) profoundly influenced the Ca2+ spikes. Ilimaquinone could inhibit (Fig. 7A) or stimulate the oscillation induced by 1 µm ATP (Fig. 7B), or it could reversibly modify the shape of the spikes (Fig.7C). Ilimaquinone could also convert a sustained [Ca2+]i rise in response to 1 µmATP into a baseline Ca2+-spiking pattern (Fig.5Ad). Brefeldin A (5 µg/ml) was unable to mimic the effects of ilimaquinone (Fig. 7D). Baseline Ca2+ spiking persisted in 46% of the Pmr1-overexpressing COS-1 cells when the [ATP] was increased to 100 µm ATP (Fig.8A). Endoplasmic reticulum-derived Ca2+ was not sufficient to support regular baseline Ca2+ spiking in COS-1 cells, because only 8% and 1% of non-thapsigargin-pretreated control cells responded with baseline-like spikes to, respectively, 1 µm (Fig. 5B) and 100 µm ATP (Fig. 8B); moreover, these oscillations always quickly decreased both in frequency and amplitude. Ca2+ oscillations can often more easily be elicited in cells stimulated with low agonist concentrations (5Berridge M.J. Galione A. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 3074-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In control COS-1 cells, 0.2 µm ATP was a near-threshold concentration, because 37% of the cells did not respond to this low agonist concentration (Fig. 9). But also here, only 6% of the cells set up irregular low amplitude Ca2+spikes when incubated in 0.2 µm ATP. The percentage of Pmr1-overexpressing cells that did not react to 0.2 µmATP was similar (50%, data not shown), indicating that the sensitivity to ATP was not affected by overexpressing Pmr1. The non-mitochondrial Ca2+ stores in Pmr1-overexpressing cells stored twice as much Ca2+ than those in control cells (Fig.2A). To exclude that the induction of baseline Ca2+ oscillations may have been due to this increasing Ca2+-removing capacity from the cytosol, we have as a control overexpressed SERCA1 in COS-1 cells. In the absence of thapsigargin, permeabilized SERCA1-overexpressing and Pmr1-overexpressing cells accumulated about the same amount of Ca2+ in their respective Ca2+ stores (Fig.2A). Whereas Pmr1-overexpressing cells could easily be identified by their [Ca2+]i response to ATP in the presence of thapsigargin, cells transfected with SERCA1 could not be detected in a similar manner. Therefore, immunocytochemical staining was performed on the same population of cells as used for the collection of the data on [Ca2+]i responses. Fig. 8Ca shows a typical immunocytochemical staining of a population of COS-1 cells exposed to the SERCA1 expression vector. About 50% of the cells overexpressed SERCA1. In contrast to what was observed for Pmr1-overexpressing cells, baseline Ca2+ oscillations induced by 1 µmATP occurred in only 3% of the total population of cells exposed to the SERCA1 transfection vector (Fig. 5C). These Ca2+ spikes quickly decreased both in frequency and amplitude. None of the SERCA1-overexpressing cells oscillated in response to 100 µm ATP (Fig. 8C). Overexpression of an intracellular Ca2+ pump per se was therefore not sufficient to set up baseline Ca2+ spiking. To exclude that the induction of baseline Ca2+ oscillations in Pmr1-containing cells would have been due to possible effects of the presence of this pump on the level of IP3 receptor expression, we have measured the levels of the three IP3receptor isoforms in microsomes of control, of Pmr1-overexpressing and of SERCA-overexpressing COS-1 cells. The levels of the three isoforms were not affected by the overexpression of Pmr1 or SERCA (Fig.10, A–C). Neither was the endogenous level of SERCA2b affected by the overexpression of Pmr1 (Fig. 10E). HeLa cells were pretreated with 2 µmthapsigargin to eliminate the endoplasmic reticulum as a functional Ca2+ store and stimulated with 100 µmhistamine. About 86% of the cells maintained a stable [Ca2+]i (Fig.11A), and 14% responded with abortive Ca2+ spikes (Fig. 11B andC). These oscillations had a remarkably long latency, which was often in the range of 30 to 60 min. These oscillations depended on the presence of histamine and disappeared when histamine was removed. Interestingly, removal of the agonist often resulted in a transient increase in the amplitude (Fig. 11B) or the frequency of the spikes (Fig. 11C), after which the [Ca2+]i returned to its pre-stimulation level. Ilimaquinone stopped the histamine-induced Ca2+oscillations (Fig. 11D). Cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations are due to cycles of release and subsequent re-uptake of internally stored Ca2+. The experimental data we have obtained fully support the hypothesis that baseline Ca2+ oscillations can be initiated by a SERCA-independent, probably Pmr1-replenished Ca2+ store. In COS-1 cells, the endogenous Ca2+-storage capacity of non-mitochondrial organelles other than the endoplasmic reticulum was small, because, in the presence of the SERCA-specific inhibitor thapsigargin, permeabilized COS-1 cells failed to accumulate Ca2+ at detectable levels. They did so, however, after transfection with Pmr1 (Fig. 2A) (12Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, intact non-transfected COS-1 cells did not produce changes in [Ca2+]i when stimulated with ATP in the presence of thapsigargin, whereas Pmr1-overexpressing cells were responsive. These cells thus made possible the study specifically of the effect of overexpression of the Pmr1 Ca2+ pump of the Golgi on the setting up of intracellular Ca2+ signals. ATP-stimulated COS-1 cells that overexpressed the Pmr1 Golgi Ca2+ pump produced very stable baseline Ca2+spikes, even after incubation in thapsigargin to inhibit the SERCA Ca2+ pumps in the endoplasmic reticulum. Such stable oscillatory responses never occurred in control cells with a functioning endogenous Ca2+ pump in the endoplasmic reticulum or in cells overexpressing the reticulum-targeted SERCA1 Ca2+ pump. These oscillations had all the typical characteristics of baseline cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations: (i) The spikes had a cell-specific shape; (ii) they could be abortive; (iii) the first [Ca2+]i rise was often preceded by a long latency; (iv) the frequency of the spikes increased when the [ATP] was increased; (v) Ca2+ was released from an internal Ca2+ store, because the oscillation occurred for a limited period of time in Ca2+-free solution; and (vi) the oscillation needed extracellular Ca2+ to be sustained. A fast release of Ca2+ after a period of latency, reminiscent of that occurring during Ca2+ oscillations and similarly induced by Pmr1 overexpression, was also observed in the continuous presence of 100 µm ATP when the extracellular [Ca2+] was suddenly raised from 0 to 1.5 mm(Fig. 3C). In control (Fig. 3, A andB) and SERCA1-overexpressing COS-1 cells (Fig.3D) the rise of [Ca2+]i was much more gradual and not preceded by a period of latency. The fast time course of the increase of [Ca2+]i induced by Pmr1 overexpression strongly suggests a regenerative nature of the phenomenon and is therefore suggestive for an “all-or-none” release from an intracellular Ca2+ store, occurring when a threshold level of store filling has been exceeded. In agreement with this hypothesis, there always was a long latency period between the re-addition of Ca2+ and the fast rise of [Ca2+]i in Pmr1-overexpressing cells. Although it cannot be excluded that the delay was caused by a slow activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry, it is more likely that Ca2+ entry induced by the Ca2+-depleted endoplasmic reticulum (39Putney Jr, J.W. Ribeiro C.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1272-1286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) started immediately after addition of Ca2+. This incoming Ca2+ would then charge the IP3-sensitive Pmr1-containing Ca2+ store, where the [IP3] rise might be insufficient to open the Ca2+ channel directly due to the lower IP3sensitivity of this compartment. The loading of this pool then sensitizes it to the ambient level of IP3 until a critical Ca2+ content is reached and a Ca2+ spike is triggered. This sensitization of the IP3 receptor may be due to the increasing luminal [Ca2+] (20Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. Nature. 1992; 357: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 30Nunn D.L. Taylor C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 115-119PubMed Google Scholar) or the small rise in [Ca2+]i once this compartment became overloaded (40Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 41Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 42Bezprozvanny I.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18776-18782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transfer of Ca2+ from its entry site at the plasma membrane into the Pmr1-containing Ca2+ store was not accompanied by a global rise in [Ca2+]i. A similar situation has been reported in pancreatic acinar cells, where recharging of the intracellular Ca2+ stores in the secretory pool with Ca2+entering the cell at the basal pool also occurred without a rise in [Ca2+]i (44Mogami H. Nakano K. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 49-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Mn2+-quenching experiments of cytoplasmic Ca2+-sensitive dyes (data not shown) could not discriminate between delayed and immediate Ca2+ entry, possibly because Mn2+ is also rapidly transported by Pmr1 (12Van Baelen K.

Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells express mainly the type-3 (about 60%) and the type-2 IP3 receptor (about 30%), with only low levels of the type-1 IP3 receptor (46Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We have found direct ATP binding to recombinant type-1 and type-3 IP3 receptors, which is in agreement with a stimulatory effect on IP3-induced Ca2+ release in cell types mainly expressing these IP3 receptor isoforms (47Maes K. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smet P. Sienaert I. Waelkens E. Callewaert G. De Smedt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3492-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A particular characteristic of the type-2 IP3 receptor is its insensitivity to ATP (48Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Genetically engineered B cells expressing both the type-1 and -2 IP3 receptor or expressing both the type-2 and -3 IP3 receptor indeed lost the prominent ATP dependence that is characteristic of the type-1 IP3 receptor and to a lesser extent of the type-3 IP3 receptor (48Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The lack of ATP sensitivity of the IP3-induced Ca2+ release from the Pmr1-containing compartment in COS-1 cells would be compatible with the presence of the type-2 IP3 receptor in this compartment. Available antibodies against the type-2 IP3receptor are, however, of insufficient quality to directly immunolocalize with certainty this IP3 receptor isoform. Alternatively, the possibility remains that another IP3receptor isoform is present in this compartment but has lost its responsiveness to ATP, due to the presence of other regulatory elements. What is the nature of the Pmr1-expressing Ca2+ store? Pmr1 is a Golgi-targeted Ca2+ pump. Immunocytochemistry reveals that Pmr1 is present in the region that stains positive for the Golgi-specific 58K protein (Fig. 1A). However, weak staining was also present outside the Golgi apparatus. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. Either Pmr1 is only present in the Golgi compartment, in which case the Golgi marker would be unable to stain the whole Golgi compartment, or the Pmr1 antibody would in addition stain other proteins than Pmr1. Alternatively, some of the Pmr1 immunoreactivity is present outside the Golgi compartment. These proteins could be non-functional Ca2+ pumps being in the process of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, or they can represent functional Pmr1 Ca2+ pumps that became incorporated in other subcellular compartments. It is unlikely that Pmr1 Ca2+ pumps present in the endoplasmic reticulum would have been responsible for the baseline Ca2+ spiking for the following reasons: (i) Control or SERCA1-overexpressing cells never processed the incoming Ca2+ during capacitative Ca2+ entry into a regenerative [Ca2+]i rise after a period of latency, whereas Pmr1-overexpressing cells always did. (ii) Control or SERCA1-overexpressing cells with a Ca2+-loaded endoplasmic reticulum never produced baseline Ca2+ spikes, indicating that any overexpressed Pmr1 Ca2+ pumps that would have overflowed into the endoplasmic reticulum could not have caused the induction of baseline Ca2+ oscillations in about half of the transfected cells. (iii) The functional properties of the Pmr1-containing Ca2+ store differed from those of the endoplasmic reticulum by the smaller inherent passive Ca2+leak, the reduced sensitivity to IP3, and the insensitivity of their IP3 receptors to ATP. (iv) The Ca2+oscillations were inhibited by ilimaquinone, which activates a heterotrimeric G protein in the Golgi apparatus, with the release of βγ subunits (49Jamora C. Takizawa P.A. Zaarour R.F. Denesvre C. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1997; 91: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). βγ subunits bind to the pleckstrin homology domain of protein kinase D, which eventually causes vesiculation of Golgi stacks (50Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The observed effects of ilimaquinone on Ca2+ signaling (Fig. 7) occurred within seconds, whereas fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus needed a much longer time. In addition, brefeldin A did not have the same effect on ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling as ilimaquinone (Fig. 7D). These findings indicate that the effect of ilimaquinone did, therefore, not depend on vesiculation of the Golgi complex. We propose that the state of phosphorylation of one of the substrates of protein kinase D may be critically involved in setting up the ATP-induced oscillation. All these findings make it very likely that the Ca2+oscillations originate in the Golgi compartment. Some of the functional properties that we observed for the Pmr1-containing compartment are in agreement with what has been reported for the Golgi apparatus in intact cells. The reduced passive Ca2+ leak of the Pmr1-containing Ca2+ store in permeabilized COS-1 cells corresponds with observations in LLC-PK1 epithelial cells, Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, and L5 rat myoblasts, where the Golgi apparatus was substantially more resistant to Ca2+ depletion than the other regions of the cells (51Chandra S. Kable E.P. Morrison G.H. Webb W.W. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 747-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in EC50 for IP3-induced Ca2+ release (1.1 µmIP3 for the endoplasmic reticulum and 2.3 µmIP3 for the Pmr1-induced Ca2+ store) is in agreement with measurements of the luminal free [Ca2+] within organelles in permeabilized BHK-21 cells, which showed a lower responsiveness to IP3 in the perinuclear Golgi region than in the other regions of the cell (29Hoffer A.M. Schlue W.R. Curci S. Machen T.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have also investigated normal non-transfected HeLa cells, because the physiological relevance of findings obtained on cells overexpressing proteins could be questioned. When incubated in the presence of the SERCA-specific inhibitor thapsigargin, HeLa cells still managed to set up abortive Ca2+ spikes. The source of activator Ca2+ was therefore not the endoplasmic reticulum. An intracellular Ca2+ store filled by a non-SERCA type of Ca2+ pump could be involved. The Golgi complex seems to be a good candidate to fulfill this function in HeLa cells. First, active Ca2+ uptake in the latter compartment is mediated by a Pmr1-type of ion-transport ATPases, which is insensitive to thapsigargin and which is also expressed in HeLa cells (data now shown). Second, the Golgi apparatus in HeLa cells can function as a Ca2+ store that is able to release Ca2+ via IP3-mediated pathways (10Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of specific inhibitors of the Golgi Ca2+ pump, we have also here relied on ilimaquinone. Ilimaquinone stopped the histamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations in HeLa cells with functionally depleted endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores. These observations on untransfected cells suggest that the Golgi complex may also play a role in cells where Pmr1 was not overexpressed. There are indeed early studies directly localizing Ca2+ to a Golgi-like structure in intact normal cells (51Chandra S. Kable E.P. Morrison G.H. Webb W.W. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 747-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific inhibitors of Pmr1 will be needed to further explore the role of the Golgi apparatus."

In this study, resonance energy transfer was employed to characterize structural changes in RNA substrates in response to cation- and AUF1-binding events. An RNA substrate containing the tumor necrosis factor α ARE displayed a weak conformational transition in the absence of added cations but was cooperatively stabilized by Mg2+. Additional assays demonstrated a strong preference for small, multivalent cations, suggesting that the folded RNA structure was stabilized by counterion neutralization at discrete regions of high negative charge density. Association of AUF1 with cognate RNA substrates also induced formation of condensed RNA structures, although distinct from the folded structure stabilized by multivalent cations.

The synthetic rates of many eukaryotic gene products are regulated by the cytoplasmic stabilities of mRNAs encoding them (reviewed in Refs. 1Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G.

A + U-rich elements (AREs)1 are sequences located in the 3′-untranslated regions of many labile mammalian mRNAs, including some encoding oncoproteins, inflammatory mediators, cytokines, and G protein-coupled receptors, that target these transcripts for rapid cytoplasmic turnover (3Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). AREs are variable in length but often consist of a number of overlapping AUUUA pentamers embedded within or adjacent to a U-rich region. Messenger RNA turnover directed by AREs is typically characterized by rapid deadenylation of the mRNA, followed by degradation of the mRNA body (3Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar, 4Brewer G. J. Biol.

The ability of an ARE to promote rapid mRNA turnover incis is dependent on interactions between this element and any of a number of cytoplasmic ARE-binding factors. One such factor, HuR, is associated with stabilization of the ARE-containing transcript (6Peng S.S.Y. Chen C.-Y.A. Xu N. Shyu A.-B.

Characterization of the interactions between these proteins and their ARE substrates is an essential step toward a broader understanding of the mechanisms linking ARE recognition with the initiation or inhibition of mRNA decay processes. The ARE-binding factor AUF1 has been extensively studied as a mediator of rapid, ARE-directed mRNA turnover both in vivo (10Loflin P. Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B.

AUF1 exists as a family of four protein isoforms generated from a common pre-mRNA, and all associate with RNA substrates via two tandemly arranged RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) (17Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Individual isoforms are designated by their apparent molecular weights as p37AUF1, p40AUF1, p42AUF1, and p45AUF1. The principal cytoplasmic isoforms, p37AUF1 and p40AUF1, associate with several other cellular proteins (18Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), including eIF4G, poly(A)-binding protein, and the heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsc70 (19Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In vitro, recombinant p37AUF1 associates directly with AREs and forms protein oligomers on these RNA substrates by sequential binding of protein dimers (20Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The formation of multimeric AUF1 complexes on AREs, coupled with the ability of this protein to associate with other cellular factors involved in the regulation of translation and mRNA stability, indicates that AUF1 may function as an ARE-targeting system, assembling or recruiting selected additional trans-acting factors to the mRNA, which ultimately lead to the induction of RNA catabolism. Accordingly, mechanisms that modulate the ability of AUF1 to interact with AREs are likely to be important regulators of mRNA stability. Previously, we demonstrated that association of recombinant p37AUF1 to the ARE from tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA was inhibited by the presence of magnesium ions, concomitant with the adoption of a spatially condensed, unimolecular RNA structure exhibiting restricted backbone flexibility (22Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Inhibition of AUF1 binding by Mg2+ was sequence-specific with respect to the ARE substrate, since AUF1 biding to a comparably sized polyuridylate sequence (U32) was not significantly affected by the cation. In this study, we have further characterized the structural consequences of both cation- and AUF1-binding events to these RNA substrates. Using resonance energy transfer (RET) to monitor global changes in the solution structure of the TNFα ARE, we observed that this RNA substrate adopts a weak, higher order RNA structure that is cooperatively stabilized by Mg2+ in a sequence-specific manner. This structure was optimally stabilized by compact, multivalent cations, indicating that ion-mediated stabilization probably occurs by counterion neutralization at localized regions of high negative charge density, resulting from the juxtaposition of negatively charged groups in the folded RNA structure. AUF1 binding also induced conformational changes in both the TNFα ARE and U32 substrates. Based on calculation of intramolecular distances between the 5′- and 3′-ends of the RNA substrates, however, these protein-folded structures are shown to be distinct from those stabilized by cations and appear to be a direct consequence of AUF1 binding and oligomerization. Together, these experiments define a mechanism for structural condensation of AREs that regulates their AUF1 binding activity and suggest that AUF1-induced, localized remodeling of these RNA structures may contribute to the recruitment of additional trans-acting factors to the AUF1·ARE complex. RNA substrates used in this study are listed in Table I. Each RNA oligonucleotide (2′-hydroxyl) was synthesized, deprotected, and purified by ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The purity and integrity of each RNA substrate were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry. Dried RNA pellets were dissolved in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) and quantified by absorbance spectroscopy. Estimates of RNA extinction coefficients at 260 nm were calculated as described (23CRC Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.in: Fasman G.D. CRC Press, Inc.3rd Ed.

For fluorescein (Fl)-conjugated RNA probes, absorbance due to the fluorophore at 260 nm was subtracted from total measured A260 by quantitation of the Fl moiety at 493 nm with ε493, Fl = 74,600m−1·cm−1 and ε260, Fl = 26,000m−1·cm−1 as described (24Heyduk T.

The absorbance of double-labeled RNA oligonucleotides at 493 nm was further corrected for absorbance by Cy3 at this wavelength using ε493, Cy3 = 29,000 m−1·cm−1 (extinction coefficients for Cy3 provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Absorbance measurements also confirmed the efficiency of fluorophore coupling to these RNA substrates as >97% for Cy3 and >90% for Fl.Table IRNA substrates used in this studyNameSequence (5′ → 3′)1-a“Fl” and “Cy” indicate the positions of the fluorescein and cyanine 3 moieties, respectively, for each RNA substrate.Cy-TNF-FlCy-GUGAUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAG-FlTNF-FlGUGAUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAG-FlCy-TNFCy-GUGAUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAGFl-TNFα AREFl-GUGAUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAGCy-U32-FlCy-GAUCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUA-FlU32-FlGAUCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUA-FlFl-U32Fl-GAUCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUA1-a “Fl” and “Cy” indicate the positions of the fluorescein and cyanine 3 moieties, respectively, for each RNA substrate.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the total measured anisotropy (At) was interpreted as a function of the intrinsic anisotropy (Ai) and fractional concentration (fi) of each fluorescent species as described in Equation 1 (26Otto M.R.

At=∑iAifi(Eq. 1) In the absence of multivalent cations, the association of AUF1 with short U-rich RNA substrates is well described by the sequential binding of AUF1 dimers to form a tetrameric protein-RNA complex (22Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here the initial binding event between a U-rich RNA substrate (R) and an AUF1 dimer (P2) given by R + P2 ⇌ P2R is described by the equilibrium association constantK1, while the subsequent P2R + P2 ⇌ P4R equilibrium is described byK2 (20Wilson G.M.

Under conditions of limiting RNA concentration (i.e. [P2]free ≈ [P2]total), the total measured anisotropy of AUF1-RNA binding reactions plotted against the concentration of added protein dimer resolves to Equation 2. At=AR+AP2RK1[P2]+AP4RK1K2[P2]21+K1[P2]+K1K2[P2]2(Eq. 2) where AR,AP2R, andAP4R represent the intrinsic anisotropy values of the free RNA (R), AUF1 dimer-bound RNA (P2R), and AUF1 tetramer-bound RNA (P4R), respectively. All equation parameters were solved by nonlinear regression of Atversus[P2] data sets using PRISM version 2.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) as described (20Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Conformational changes in RNA substrates were evaluated by changes in the intramolecular distance between their 5′ and 3′ termini. This distance was monitored by RET between the 3′-Fl (donor) and 5′-Cy3 (acceptor) moieties of applicable RNAs. The efficiency of RET (ERET) varies inversely with the sixth power of the scalar distance (r) between an appropriate donor and acceptor by Equation 3, ERET=R06/(R06+r6)(Eq. 3) where R0 represents the Förster distance for the donor-acceptor pair, defined as the distance at which RET efficiency is 50% (29Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 30Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999: 367-394Crossref Google Scholar). This value may be calculated based on the spectral characteristics of the donor-acceptor pair and the sample environment by Equation 4, R0=9780(k2n−4QDJ(λ))1/6A∘(Eq. 4) where κ is the orientation factor for dipole-dipole coupling (typically nnnn 23), n is the refractive index of the medium, QD is the quantum yield of the donor in the absence of the acceptor, and J(λ) is the overlap integral between donor emission and acceptor excitation (29Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 30Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999: 367-394Crossref Google Scholar). The Förster distance for the Fl-Cy3 fluorophore pair conjugated to DNA has been calculated as 55.7 Å (31Norman D.G. Grainger R.J. Uhrı́n D. Lilley D.M.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6317-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this study, ERET was determined for double-labeled RNA substrates by measuring the decrease in fluorescence emission of the RET donor (λex = 490 nm, λem = 518 nm, 5-nm bandwidth) in the presence of the acceptor (29Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 32Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Accordingly, all experiments required the assembly of three parallel samples: (i) a blank containing no fluorophore, (ii) the donor in the absence of the acceptor (TNF-Fl or U32-Fl), and (iii) the donor in the presence of the acceptor (Cy-TNF-Fl or Cy-U32-Fl). Subtraction of blank sample fluorescence from donor samples lacking or containing the RET acceptor yielded FD andFDA, respectively. ERETwas then calculated using Equation 5 (30Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999: 367-394Crossref Google Scholar, 33Klostermeier D. Millar D.P. Methods. 2001; 23: 240-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ERET=1−(FDA/FD)(Eq. 5) All fluorescence readings were taken using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotomer (Varian Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA), with accessories indicated where applicable. For assays of ion-dependent RNA folding, samples (0.2-ml final volume) were assembled in 96-well plates containing fluorescent RNA substrates (20 nm) in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) and 2 mm DTT. Chloride salts were used as the source of additional cations as required. The concentration of acceptor fluorophore (20 nm) was well below its critical concentration of 2.5 mm estimated by Equation 6, thus minimizing the risk of intermolecular energy transfer in this system (33Klostermeier D. Millar D.P. Methods. 2001; 23: 240-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), [Acceptor]crit=447R03(Eq. 6) where R0 is given in Å and [Acceptor]crit is molar. Samples were incubated for 1 min at room temperature (22 °C) prior to measurement of fluorescence intensity using the Cary microplate reader accessory (Varian). Preliminary kinetic analyses measuring ion-induced changes in ARE structure by both anisotropy (22Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and RET (data not shown) demonstrated that equilibrium is achieved within seconds under these conditions. Thermal melting experiments were performed using the Peltier multicell holder and temperature controller (Varian). Samples (2 ml) were assembled exactly as described for ion-dependent RNA folding experiments, except that preliminary incubations were performed at 5–10 °C for 10 min. Temperature was then ramped to 80 °C at 1 °C/min using Eclipse Thermal Application software (Varian), with fluorescence readings taken every 0.5 °C. A limitation of evaluating thermal denaturation of RNA by RET is that the value ofR0 may be strongly influenced by temperature. Significant changes in the values of both QD andJ(λ) (Equation 4) were observed for the Fl-Cy3 donor-acceptor pair at elevated temperatures (>40 °C, data not shown), thus precluding the assignment of interfluorophore distances (r) or RNA folding enthalpy (ΔH) in these experiments. As such, the interpretation of thermal denaturation experiments in this work has been limited to the number of RNA structural transitions under different reaction conditions and an approximation of the melting temperatures (Tm) of each transition. For protein-induced RNA folding experiments, samples were assembled as described for assessment of RNA binding activity by fluorescence anisotropy (see above), except that the final volume was made to 2 ml and the concentration of fluorescent RNA substrate was increased to 2 nm. Samples lacking Mg2+ contained 0.5 mm EDTA. The increase in RNA concentration was necessary to improve signal-to-noise in the assay but required the employment of additional algorithms to determine the fractional concentration of each complex in RET binding assays containing titrations of recombinant AUF1 (for details, see below). Previously, we characterized ion-dependent folding of the TNFα ARE in terms of a two-component system, based on changes in the anisotropy of fluorophores conjugated to the 5′- or 3′-ends of the RNA (22Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this system, the RNA substrate was considered to be in equilibrium between a flexible, ion-free state and a structurally constrained, ion-associated state. Application of this model to changes inERET values for double-labeled RNA substrates across a titration of cation concentrations ([Ion]) allowed these data to be resolved by a variant of the Hill model (34Pan J. Thirumalai D. Woodson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6149-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) given in Equation 7. ERET=Eu+(Ef−Eu)×([Ion]/[Ion]1/2)h1+([Ion]/[Ion]1/2)h(Eq. 7) Here, Eu and Ef represent the intrinsic values of ERET for the unfolded and folded RNA conformations, respectively, while hrepresents the Hill coefficient, and [Ion] 12 represents the concentration of ion yielding 50% folded RNA. Values for all constants were derived by nonlinear regression ofERETversus [Ion] plots using PRISM version 2.0 (GraphPad). Using the sequential dimer binding model for AUF1 oligomerization on an RNA substrate, K1 and K2were solved by nonlinear regression of anisotropy versus[P2] plots using Equation 2 as described above. However, to estimate the fractional concentrations of AUF1·RNA complexes in RET experiments, a higher concentration of RNA (2 nm) was necessary to improve the signal/noise ratio. As such, [R]total approached or exceeded 1/K1, complicating estimation of fractional complex concentrations, since the approximation [P2]free ≈ [P2]total would be invalid. Accordingly, an equation set lacking this approximation was used to determine the concentration of each fluorescent species during RET experiments involving titrations of AUF1, when K1 andK2 are known. By conservation of mass, the concentrations of all RNA and protein components of these binding reactions are related by (Eq. 8), (Eq. 9). The equilibrium relationships describing [P2R] and [P4R] in terms of [P2]free, [R]free,K1, and K2 are given by (Eq. 10), (Eq. 11). [P2]total=[P2]free+[P2R]+2[P4R](Eq. 8) [R]total=[R]free+[P2R]+[P4R](Eq. 9) [P2R]=K1[R]free[P2]free(Eq. 10) [P4R]=K1K2[R]free[P2]2free(Eq. 11) All real solutions of ([P2]free, [R]free) (>0,>0) for this system of equations were determined for given values of [P2]total, [R]total, K1, andK2, using Mathematica version 4.1 (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL). Calculated values of [P2] and [R] were then used to derive [P2R] and [P4R] using (Eq. 10), (Eq. 11), which were then expressed as fractional concentrations of [R]total. Initial experiments were performed to validate the use of RET to monitor folding of RNA substrates. Following excitation at 490 nm, the Fl moiety may release energy by quantum emission (λmax = 518 nm) or by nonquantum events, including molecular contact with a quenching compound (Fig.1A). However, if an appropriate acceptor (Cy3) is present in suitable proximity to the excited Fl group, energy may be transferred from Fl to Cy3 by RET, a long range dipole-dipole interaction that effects acceptor excitation without the transfer of a photon (29Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 30Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999: 367-394Crossref Google Scholar). This nonradiative transfer of energy to Cy3 results in a decrease in fluorescence emission from Fl, allowing the efficiency of this process to be calculated using Equation 5. Previously, we demonstrated that Mg2+ inhibited association of AUF1 with the TNFα ARE (22Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Inhibition of protein binding occurred concomitantly with a cation-dependent conformational change in the RNA substrate that decreased its flexibility. To verify that Mg2+-induced changes in ARE conformation could be resolved by RET, the emission spectra (λex = 490 nm) of RNA substrates containing the TNFα ARE linked to either the donor alone (TNF-Fl), the acceptor alone (Cy-TNF), or both fluorophores (Cy-TNF-Fl) were evaluated in the presence or absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1B). Three observations confirmed the utility of RET for monitoring these conformational changes in the TNFα ARE. First, Fl emission (λmax = 518 nm) of Cy-TNF-Fl is dramatically decreased in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+, indicating that energy from this fluorophore is being lost to nonquantum events in the presence of the cation. Second, the Mg2+-dependent diminution of Fl emission is not observed for RNA substrates lacking the acceptor moiety (TNF-Fl). This demonstrates that the loss of Fl emission in the double-labeled substrate is not due to quenching interactions with the RNA sequence, Mg2+, or other components of the reaction mixture. Third, the loss of Fl emission from Cy-TNF-Fl in the presence of Mg2+ is accompanied by an increase in emission from Cy3, detectable at 564 nm. Based on the panel displayed in Fig.1B, total fluorescence emission of Cy-TNF-Fl at this wavelength is clearly not increased in the presence of Mg2+. However, the enhancement of Cy3 emission is obvious when total fluorescence intensity is corrected for emission from Fl (Table II). In the absence of Mg2+, the emission of Cy-TNF-Fl at 564 nm is attributable solely to the sum of Fl and Cy3 emission at this wavelength resulting from direct excitation of each fluorophore at 490 nm (Table II, −Mg2+ column). In the presence of Mg2+, however, the contribution of Fl to emission from Cy-TNF-Fl at 564 nm is very small, based on a proportional decrease in Fl emission at 518 nm. Since the emission of Cy3 resulting from direct excitation at 490 nm is not enhanced by the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1B, Cy-TNF), the Mg2+-induced increase in Cy3 emission from Cy-TNF-Fl concomitant with the decrease in Fl emission"

The largest collagenous domain of type XVII collagen, COL15, has been described previously as a cell adhesion domain (Tasanen, K., Eble, J. A., Aumailley, M., Schumann, H., Baetge, J, Tu, H., Bruckner, P., and Bruckner-Tuderman, L. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 3093–3099). In the present work, the integrin binding of triple helical, human recombinant COL15 was tested. Solid phase binding assays using recombinant integrin α1I, α2I, and α10I domains and cell spreading assays with α1β1- and α2β1-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that, unlike other collagens, COL15 was not recognized by the collagen receptors. Denaturation of the COL15 domain increased the spreading of human HaCaT keratinocytes, which could migrate on the denatured COL15 domain as effectively as on fibronectin. Spreading of HaCaT cells on the COL15 domain was mediated by α5β1 and αVβ1integrins, and it could be blocked by RGD peptides. The collagen α-chains in the COL15 domain do not contain RGD motifs but, instead, contain 12 closely related KGD motifs, four in each of the three α-chains. Twenty-two overlapping, synthetic peptides corresponding to the entire COL15 domain were tested; three peptides, all containing the KGD motif, inhibited the spreading of HaCaT cells on denatured COL15 domain. Furthermore, this effect was lost by mutation from D to E (KGE instead of KGD). We suggest that the COL15 domain of type XVII collagen represents a specific collagenous structure, unable to interact with the cellular receptors for other collagens. After being shed from the cell surface, it may support keratinocyte spreading and migration.

Among the 19 different collagen subtypes that have been identified, types XIII and XVII are the only transmembrane proteins (2Hägg P.O. Rehn M. Huhtala P. Väisänen T. Tamminen M. Pihlajaniemi T.

It occurs in two forms: as a full-length transmembrane protein and as a distinct, soluble ectodomain that is shed from the cell surface by a furin-mediated, proteolytic process (7Schäcke H.

This collagen possesses intracellular and transmembrane domains that are of 560 and 23 amino acids in length, respectively. In addition, it has an extracellular domain of 914 amino acids that contains multiple noncollagenous interruptions, dividing it into 15 collagenous subdomains (3Giudice G.J. Emery D.J. Diaz L.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 243-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The longest of these subdomains, COL15, consists of 242 amino acids (residues 567–808 of collagen XVII). Thus, it is much larger than any of the other collagenous domains, which vary from 14 to 45 residues in length (3Giudice G.J. Emery D.J. Diaz L.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 243-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Most collagen subtypes can be recognized by a group of integrin-type cell adhesion receptors. Although all collagen-receptor integrins share the common β1 integrin subunit, they have unique α subunits resulting in four heterodimers: α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, and α11β1 (9Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R.

Unlike many other integrins, such as the fibronectin receptor α5β1 and the αV class of integrins, the collagen receptors do not recognize the putative binding motif, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD). In contrast, they require the triple helical structure of native collagen. Different from other matrix receptor integrins, the collagen receptors have an independently folding protein structure called the I domain (inserted domain) (9Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R.

This 200-amino acid structure is located between the second and the third NH2-terminal repeated sequences in the ectodomain of an α subunit. The I domain adopts a structure called the “Rossman fold” configuration in which several β sheets are surrounded by α helices and support a divalent metal-binding site, referred to as the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (13Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Both the α1I and α2I domains are known to be essential for the primary recognition of the collagens (14Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol.

However, human HaCaT keratinocytes can use their RGD-dependent integrins to spread on COL15 and COL15 as a migration substrate. Although COL15 does not contain an RGD motif, it has numerous, highly related KGD sequences, and, as previous studies have shown, snake venom poisons can bind integrins through this sequence (21Scarborough R.M.

The media were collected every 48 h, centrifuged shortly to remove cellular debris, and transferred to ice, and protease inhibitors were added immediately to a final concentration of 1 mm Pefablock (Merck) and 1 mmN-ethylmaleimide (Sigma). The recombinant COL15 was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.6, and contaminating protein was removed by separation on a DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman). COL15 did not bind to DEAE-cellulose, but a significant amount of contaminating protein was removed with this purification step (20Tasanen K. Eble J.A. Aumailley M. Schumann H. Baetge J Tu H.

For spreading and binding experiments, COL15 was concentrated using 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by a dialysis against 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, at +4 °C, to remove ammonium sulfate. CHO1 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were used as hosts for transfection and expression of integrin α1 or α2 subunits (17Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Käpylä J.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. E. Marcantonio (Columbia University, New York, NY), and α2 cDNA (10Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. M. Hemler (Dana-Farber Cancer Research Center, Boston, MA). CHO cells were grown in α-minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin-G, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. 20 µg of expression plasmid consisting of α2 cDNA in pAW (23Ohashi P.S.

Nature. 1985; 316: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) was used to transfect cells by electroporation (0.3 kV, 960 microfarad, 0.4-cm cuvette in RPMI plus 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, without serum). Integrin α1cDNA in pLEN (20 µg; Ref. 9Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cotransfected with 1 µg of pAWneo2. Similarly, 20 µg α2/pAW was used. Transfected cells were plated and allowed to recover for 1 day in culture medium. G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the medium at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. G418-resistant clones were selected for 1–2 weeks, isolated, and analyzed for their expression of α1 or α2 integrin. The cell surface expression levels of the integrins were checked using anti-integrin antibodies (12F1 for α2 integrin, a gift from Dr. V. Woods, UCSD; SR-84 for α1 integrin, a gift from Dr. W. Rettig, Boehringer Ingelheim) and flow cytometry (17Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pihlajaniemi T. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). 96-well microtiter plates were precoated by exposure (12 h, 4 °C) to 0.1 ml of PBS containing purified collagens or either native or heat-denatured COL15. COL15 was denatured for 20 min at 56 °C. Residual protein sites on all wells were blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin in PBS. Three cell lines were used: a mixture of CHO clones expressing the α1β1 integrin (CHO-α1β1), monoclonal CHO cells expressing the α2β1 integrin (CHO-α2β1), and an immortalized human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) that was obtained from Dr. N. E. Fusenic (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany). Semiconfluent cell cultures were detached with 0.01% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Trypsin activity was inhibited by washing the cells with 0.2% soybean trypsin inhibitor. The cells were suspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or serum-free α-minimum essential medium containing 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide to avoid endogenous matrix synthesis. The cells were added to microtiter plates (104 cells/well) and allowed to attach and spread for 120 min. The role of specific integrin subunits in cell adhesion to COL15 was tested by adding to cell suspensions, function-blocking antibodies (2 µg/ml) against either the β1 (Chemicon), αV (American Type Culture Collection; L230) α2 (Serotec), α3 (Chemicon), or α5 (Chemicon) subunits. In inhibition studies, either linear or cyclic synthetic peptides were added to the cell suspensions. Linear peptides were used at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, or 0.7 mm. The cyclic RGD peptide used to inhibit integrin function was GACRGDCLGA, which contained a covalent bond between the cysteins. A similar RGE peptide (GACRGECLGA) was used as a nonfunctional control. These peptides were produced as described and were used at 500 µm. After incubation, the medium containing nonadhered cells was poured out; no additional washes were performed. The cells were fixed for 30 min with a solution of 30% formaldehyde and 5% sucrose. The cells in at least three parallel fields in each of three wells were analyzed using phase contrast microscopy. The total number of cells attached and the percentage of spread cells were counted. A spread cell was characterized as one having a clearly visible ring of cytoplasm around the nucleus. A 24-well cell culture cluster (Costar) was precoated for 2 h at 37 °C with 0.5 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, containing human fibronectin (5 µg/cm2;Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or either native or heat denaturated COL15 (5 µg/cm2). Semiconfluent HaCaT cell cultures were detached with 0.01% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Trypsin activity was inhibited by washing the cells with 0.2% soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The cells were suspended in serum-free Optimem 1 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 2 × 104 cells/well were transferred into a custom-made stainless steel cylinder with an opening of 2.8 mm in diameter in the center. The cells were allowed to attach to the substrate for 2 h at 37 °C. The cylinders were removed, nonadhered cells were washed away with Optimem, and the adhered cells were then allowed to migrate in Optimem for 2 or 4 days at 37 °C. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, stained with 5% crystal violet, and washed with distilled water. The rate of migration was estimated by measuring the surface area (mm2) covered by the cells by using NIH Image 1.62 software (National Institute of Health). cDNAs encoding for α1I and α2I domains were generated by PCR as described earlier (17Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pihlajaniemi T. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using human integrin α1 and α2 cDNAs as templates. Vectors pGEX-4T-3 and pGEX-2T (both Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to generate recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of human α1I and α2I domains, respectively. Competent Escherichia coli BL21 cells were transformed with the plasmids for protein production. LB medium (500 ml; Biokar) containing 100 g/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 50 ml of overnight culture of either BL21/pα1I or BL21/pα2I, and the cultures were grown at 37 °C until theA600 of the suspension reached 1.0–2.0. An inducer, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, was added, and the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 4–6 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were resuspended in PBS, pH 7.4, and then lysed by sonication followed by addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 10%. After incubation for 30 min, the suspensions were centrifuged, and the supernatants were pooled. Glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the lysate, which was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with gentle agitation. The lysate was then centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and glutathione-Sepharose with bound fusion protein was transferred into disposable chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). The columns were washed with PBS, and the fusion proteins were eluted using 30 mm glutathione. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done for both recombinant proteins. The recombinant α1I domain produced was 227 amino acids in length, corresponding to sequence 123–338, whereas the α2I domain was 223 amino acids long, which corresponded to sequence 124–339. The carboxyl termini of the α1I and α2I domains contained ten and six nonintegrin amino acids, respectively. Recombinant I domains were used as GST fusion proteins for binding experiments. The α10I domain cDNA was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR from RNA isolated from KHOS-240 cells (human Caucasian osteosarcoma). Total cellular RNA was isolated by using a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was done using the Gene Amp PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The amplified α10I domain cDNA was connected to a pMAL-c vector (New England BioLabs). The construct was transformed to the E. coli BL21 strain for production. The DNA sequence of the construct was checked with DNA sequencing. The α10I domain was produced as a fusion with maltose-binding protein (MBP) and tested to show specific binding to several fibril-forming collagens as well as to basement membrane type IV collagen in a Mg2+-dependent manner. 2M. Tulla, O. T. Pentikäinen, T. Viitasalo, J. Käpylä, U. Impola, P. Nykvist, L. Nissinen, M. S. Johnson, and J. Heino, submitted. The coating of a 96-well high binding microtiter plate (Nunc) was done by exposure to 0.1 ml of PBS containing 5 µg/cm2 (15 µg/ml) collagens or either native or heat-denaturated COL15 for 12 h at +4 °C. Blank wells were coated with 0.1 ml of Delfia® Diluent II (Wallac). Residual protein absorption sites on all wells were blocked with 0.1 ml of Delfia® Diluent II (Wallac). Recombinant proteins, α1I-GST, α2I-GST, or α10-MBP were added to the coated wells at a concentration of 10 or 15 µg/ml in Delfia® assay buffer and incubated for 1 h at +37 °C. Anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a concentration of 63 ng/ml or anti-MBP antibody (New England BioLabs) diluted in 1:1000 was added to wells and incubated for 1 h at +37 °C. Europium-labeled protein-G (Wallac) was then added, and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at +37 °C. All of the incubations mentioned above were done in the presence of 2 mmMgCl2. Delfia® enhancement solution (Wallac) was added to each well, and the Europium signal was measured by time-resolved fluorometry (Victor2 multilabel counter, Wallac). At least three parallel wells were analyzed. Wild-type CHO cells show endogenous expression of the β1 integrin subunit, but they do not express any collagen-binding α subunits. Here, cDNAs coding for either the integrin α1 or α2 subunit were transfected into CHO cells. The expression of these exogenous integrin subunits in transfected cells was verified by flow cytometry. In our previous studies the cell spreading assay has turned out to be a more sensitive and reproducible method to study integrin function than the cell attachment assay. CHO-α1β1 and CHO-α2β1 cells were allowed to spread for 120 min on microtiter wells that had been precoated with type I or type IV collagen or the largest collagenous domain of type XVII collagen, COL15. The total number of attached and spread cells were counted. Spread cells were described as those with cytoplasm around the nucleus and with either a flattened, circular shape with a string-of-pearls-like plasma membrane structure or a fibroblast-like morphology. Nonspread cells were characterized by either a round or a splinter-like shape and a yellow shimmer when viewed under a phase contrast microscope. After the 120-min incubation, more of the CHO-α1β1 cells on type IV collagen had spread (62 ± 3%) than those on type I (18 ± 3%; Fig.1A). In contrast, CHO-α2β1 cells spread faster on type I collagen; 88 ± 3% had spread versus 75 ± 6% on type IV collagen. These values are consistent with our previous observations (15Kern A. Briesewitz R. Bank I. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22811-22816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both α1β1- and α2β1-expressing cells attached and spread on COL15, although the spreading was much slower than on either types I or IV collagen. After incubation only 14 ± 6% of CHO-α1β1 cells and 17 ± 6% of CHO-α2β1 cells had spread on COL15. The spreading of vector-transfected CHO cells was at the same level (15 ± 4%), suggesting that COL15 was not recognized by α1β1 or α2β1, but probably by some other cell adhesion receptor expressed on CHO cells. Recombinant human integrin α1I, α2I, and α10I domains were produced as fusion proteins in E. coli and purified. The fusion proteins were characterized using both SDS- and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown). A solid phase assay was used to investigate the binding of αI domains to type I collagen and native and denatured COL15. Because the collagen-binding activity of integrin I domains has been shown to be Mg2+-dependent, the assays were carried out in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. Binding levels of each αI domain to bovine serum albumin were used as background controls. The fusion proteins of each αI domain were applied to immobilized COL15, and europium-labeled protein G was linked to the bound αI domain via an anti-GST or anti-MBP antibody. The binding was measured using time-resolved fluorescence as the number of counts/s. Integrin α1I (Fig. 1C), α2I (Fig. 1D), and α10I (Fig. 1E) domains bound to the fibril-forming collagen used as a positive control (type I collagen for α1I and α2I domains and type II collagen for α10I domain). The binding of each domain to either native or denatured COL15 was insignificant. Importantly, this suggests that COL15 is one of the very few collagens that cannot be recognized by the collagen receptors or their corresponding αI domains. Human HaCaT keratinocytes were tested in cell spreading assays on both denatured and native COL15. Spreading on the native COL15 fragment at concentrations of 5 and 20 µg/cm2 was 27 ± 6 and 36 ± 5%, respectively (Fig. 2). Although HaCaT cell spreading was slow on native COL15, it became significantly faster after denaturation. The spreading on denatured COL15 at concentrations 5 and 20 µg/cm2 was 31 ± 6 and 53 ± 2%. Because COL15 has a relatively low melting temperature (26 °C; Ref. 20Tasanen K. Eble J.A. Aumailley M. Schumann H. Baetge J Tu H. Bruckner P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3093-3099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it is probable that at room temperature a portion of native collagen is partially denatured and that only the denatured COL15 mediates cell adhesion. The capability of keratinocytes to migrate on COL15 was tested using coated cell culture wells. Migration was measured in serum-free conditions after 2 or 4 days. Most cells plated on native COL15 detached during the first 2 days, and no migration could be measured. Meanwhile, HaCaT cells stayed attached on denatured COL15, and cell migration during the first 4 days was comparable with that on fibronectin (Fig. 3). In 2 days, HaCaT cells migrated 9.3 ± 1.7 mm2 on denatured COL15 domain. Within 4 days, the extents of migration on denatured COL15 and fibronectin were 10.8 ± 1.8 and 10.3 ± 1.5 mm2, respectively. Thus, denatured COL15 forms an excellent matrix for keratinocyte migration. Similarly to the nonactivated basal keratinocytes in skin, the HaCaT cells express the following integrins: α2β1 collagen receptor and laminin receptors α3β1 and α6β4. However, they also have integrins that can usually be seen only in activated skin keratinocytes: fibronectin receptors α5β1, αVβ1, and αVβ6, and vitronectin receptor αVβ5 (24Koivisto L. Larjava K. Hakkinen L. Uitto V.J. Heino J. Larjava H. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1999; 7: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Zambruno G. Marchisio P.C. Marconi A. Vaschieri C. Melchiori A. Giannetti A. Luca M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 853-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Here, antibodies against β1 integrin (5 µg/ml) could inhibit 75% of HaCaT cell spreading on denatured COL15 (Fig.4A). This is in accordance with the previous report showing that anti-β1 antibody can block cell adhesion to both native and denatured COL15 (20Tasanen K. Eble J.A. Aumailley M. Schumann H. Baetge J Tu H. Bruckner P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3093-3099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, in our experiments the inhibition was not complete. A cyclic RGD peptide (26Koivunen E. Gay D.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20205-20210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), unlike a control peptide with an RGE sequence, could effectively inhibit cell spreading (Fig. 4B). In this experiment, when no synthetic peptide was present, 30 ± 9% of HaCaT cells spread on denatured COL15. In the presence of the RGE peptide, 41 ± 17% of cells spread. When the RGD peptide was present, spreading decreased to only 12 ± 4% of attached cells, which was equivalent to bovine serum albumin background (Fig.4B). Thus, the data indicate that the main cellular receptors for COL15 are the RGD-dependent β1integrins. In HaCaT cells this suggests the involvement of α5β1 and αVβ1. This was further supported by the fact that anti-αVintegrin antibody could partially (about 40%) inhibit HaCaT cell adhesion to COL15 (Fig. 5A) and that specific antibodies against integrin α2 and α3 subunits had no effect (data not shown). The involvement of α5β1"

In this study, we examined the role of VHL in renal cells subjected to chemical hypoxia, using four VHL-negative and two VHL-positive cell lines. VHL-negative renal carcinoma cells underwent apoptosis following chemical hypoxia (short-term glucose deprivation and antimycin treatment), as evidenced by morphologic changes and internucleosomal DNA cleavage. Reintroduction of VHL expression prevented this apoptosis.VHL-negative cells displayed a significant (greater than 5-fold) activation of caspase 9 and release of cytochrome cinto the cytosol following chemical hypoxia. In contrast,VHL-positive cells showed minimal caspase 9 activation, and absence of cytochrome c release under the same conditions. Caspase 8 was only minimally activated in both VHL-negative and -positive cells. In addition, VHL-positive cells displayed a striking up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression (5-fold) following chemical hypoxia. Antisense oligonucleotides toBcl-2 significantly down-regulated Bcl-2protein expression in VHL-positive cells and rendered them sensitive to apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 inVHL-negative cells conferred resistance to apoptosis. Our results suggest that VHL protects renal cells from apoptosis via Bcl-2-dependent pathways.

Indeed, reintroduction of VHL inVHL-negative RCC cells provides protection from the cytotoxic effects of serum withdrawal (9Pause A. Lee S. Lonergan K.M. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Maher E.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 423-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, the role of VHL in modulating the apoptotic effects of hypoxia remains unknown. Apoptosis or programmed cell death is characterized by distinct morphologic changes consisting of cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (13Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12867) Google Scholar). It has been observed in an increasing array of renal disorders (14Lieberthal W. Levine J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: F477-F488Google Scholar, 15Ueda N. Kaushal G.P. Shah S.V. Am. J. Med. 2000; 108: 403-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and particularly mediates renal tubule cell death in polycystic kidney disease (16Woo D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), hypoxic-ischemic injury (17Feldenberg L.R. Thevananther S. Del Rio M. De Leon M. Devarajan P. Am. J.

Thus renal tubule cell apoptosis has emerged as a final common pathway in response to a wide variety of cellular stresses experienced at an intensity below the threshold for necrosis. This has been particularly well documented in in vitro studies using chemical hypoxia, in which mild injury leads to partial ATP depletion and apoptosis, whereas severe injury results in complete ATP depletion and necrotic cell death (17Feldenberg L.R. Thevananther S. Del Rio M. De Leon M. Devarajan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F837-F846PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the notion that apoptosis is a process that requires energy and that intracellular ATP concentration plays a crucial role in the determination of cell death fate by apoptosis or necrosis (17Feldenberg L.R. Thevananther S. Del Rio M. De Leon M. Devarajan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F837-F846PubMed Google Scholar). In general, the caspase family of proteases constitutes the ultimate effector of apoptosis, and it is convenient to classify the major intracellular apoptotic pathways according to the type of specific pro-caspase that is activated (19Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar, 20Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). Activation of the initiator pro-caspase 8 results predominantly from signaling via integral membrane death receptors such as Fas and TNFR1 (21Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5152) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of the initiator pro-caspase 9 is dependent primarily on mitochondrial signaling pathways involving members of theBcl-2 family (19Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar, 22Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

The best-characterized events following activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, such as Bax, include induction of mitochondrial permeability transition, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol, and activation of pro-caspase 9 (28Korsmeyer S.J.

Once activated, both caspase 8 and 9 participate in a cascade that culminates in the activation of caspase 3, which cleaves several substrates resulting in chromosomal DNA fragmentation and cellular morphologic changes characteristic of apoptosis (20Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). In contrast, the anti-apoptoticBcl-2 family members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL play a pivotal and overriding protective role by preserving mitochondrial structure and function, preventing onset of mitochondrial permeability transition, and inhibiting the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (19Adams J.M.

In this study, using modified protocols of in vitro chemical hypoxia (17Feldenberg L.R. Thevananther S. Del Rio M. De Leon M. Devarajan P. Am. J.

Physiol. 1998; 274: F315-F327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we show that VHL-negative human 786-0 RCC cells undergo dose-dependent apoptosis. Reintroduction of VHL strikingly protected these cells from apoptosis. VHL-negative cells displayed a significant activation of caspase 9 and release of mitochondrial cytochromec into the cytosol following chemical hypoxia. In contrast,VHL-positive cells showed only a very modest activation of caspase 9 and no cytochrome c release under the same conditions. Caspase 8 was only minimally activated in bothVHL-negative and -positive cells. In addition,VHL-positive cells displayed a marked up-regulation ofBcl-2 expression when compared with VHL-negative cells. Antisense oligonucleotides to Bcl-2 significantly down-regulated Bcl-2 protein expression in VHL-positive cells and rendered them sensitive to apoptosis. Overexpression ofBcl-2 in VHL-negative cells conferred resistance to apoptosis. Our results suggest that VHL protects renal cells from apoptosis via Bcl-2-dependent pathways. We speculate that loss of VHL may sensitize cells to the pro-apoptotic effects of hypoxia, which may drive the selection of cells that can evade cell death, leading to tumorigenesis. The parental VHL-negative renal carcinoma cell line 786-0 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The VHL-positive cell lines used in this study have been previously characterized (3Schoenfeld A. Davidowitz E.J. Burk R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The otherVHL-negative cell lines include lines containing either the empty expression vector alone or the functionally compromised VHL deletion constructs VHL(MPR)del and VHL(MEA)del, as previously described (3Schoenfeld A. Davidowitz E.J. Burk R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8817-8822Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 8Davidowitz E.J. Schoenfeld A.R. Burk R.D. Mol. Cell.

Cells were seeded at high density and grown in six-well polystyrene plates (Corning, NY) in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (both from Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Stable transfectants were maintained in medium containing 600 µg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). Cells were typically fully confluent within 2 days. We modified previously described protocols of in vitro chemical hypoxia by substrate depletion and/or inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (17Feldenberg L.R. Thevananther S. Del Rio M. De Leon M.

On the second day post-confluence, cells were incubated in glucose-free DMEM (Life Technologies), complete DMEM with 1 µm antimycin A (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), or both (glucose-free DMEM with 1 µm antimycin A). The latter has been shown to result in rapid, partial, and reversible ATP depletion and has been used as an in vitro model of ischemic renal cell injury (17Feldenberg L.R. Thevananther S. Del Rio M. De Leon M. Devarajan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F837-F846PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lieberthal W. Menza S.A. Levine J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F315-F327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that such partial ATP depletion results in apoptosis of cultured distal tubule (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells, whereas greater degrees of ATP depletion leads to necrotic cell death (17Feldenberg L.R. Thevananther S. Del Rio M. De Leon M. Devarajan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F837-F846PubMed Google Scholar). We monitored ATP levels using a luciferase-based assay kit (Sigma). Briefly, cells were analyzed after 4 and 12 h of chemical hypoxia or incubation in control medium. An equal number of cells were incubated in 500 µl of ATP-releasing agent for 5 min, the sample was cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation, and equal volumes of the supernatant were added to an equal volume of ATP assay mix. ATP levels were measured with a luminometer and expressed as a percentage of control values. Overall cell viability was monitored using a MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide)-based assay kit (Sigma), designed for the measurement of cell viability as a function of mitochondrial activity in living cells. Briefly, equal numbers of cells were analyzed after 12 h of chemical hypoxia or incubation in control medium. MTT solution (10% of culture volume) was added, and the cells were returned to the incubator for an additional 3 h. MTT solvent was then added in an amount equal to the culture volume, and absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm. Background absorbance measured at 690 nm was subtracted, and the values were expressed as percentage of control values. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected after 12 h of incubation in glucose-free medium containing antimycin, by DNA laddering assay (17Feldenberg L.R. Thevananther S. Del Rio M. De Leon M. Devarajan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F837-F846PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, equal numbers of cells were resuspended in 500 µl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 25 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml proteinase K, pH 8) and incubated overnight at 50 °C. Ribonuclease A (10 mg/ml) was then added for an additional 2-h incubation at 37 °C. The chromosomal DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by staining with ethidium bromide to reveal the fragmentation pattern. DNA fragmentation was confirmed in situ utilizing the TdT-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay (ApoAlert DNA fragmentation assay kit,CLONTECH, La Jolla, CA), by which fluorescein-dUTP incorporation at the free ends of fragmented DNA is visualized using fluorescent microscopy (17Feldenberg L.R. Thevananther S. Del Rio M. De Leon M. Devarajan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F837-F846PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent cells grown on coverslips and subjected to control conditions or chemical hypoxia for 12 h were washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min at 4 °C, cells were incubated with a mixture of nucleotides and TdT enzyme for 60 min at 37 °C in a dark, humidified incubator. The reaction was terminated with 2× SSC, the cells were washed with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Crystal/mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Fluorescent nuclei were detected by visualization with a microscope equipped with fluorescein filters (IX70, Olympus). To confirm the occurrence of apoptosis, the characteristic morphologic changes, including cell shrinkage and nuclear condensation were detected by phase microscopy. Caspase 8 and caspase 9 activity assays were performed using the ApoAlert Caspase 8 and 9 fluorescence assay kits (CLONTECH), respectively. Briefly, equal numbers of cells from each of the six cell lines were examined before or after 12 h of chemical hypoxia induced by glucose deprivation and antimycin. Cells were incubated in cell lysis buffer for 10 min and centrifuged, and the supernatants were incubated in reaction buffer containing IETD-AFC (specific substrate for caspase 8) or LEHD-AMC (specific substrate for caspase 9) at 37 °C for 1 h, and assayed using a fluorometer. For the detection of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and tubulin, equal number of cells were washed with PBS, solubilized in 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as previously described (17Feldenberg L.R. Thevananther S. Del Rio M. De Leon M. Devarajan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F837-F846PubMed Google Scholar). For the detection of released cytochrome c, cytosolic extracts were prepared as previously described (32Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min on ice in 300 µl of lysis buffer (68 mm sucrose, 200 mm mannitol, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) protease inhibitor). Cells were lysed by six passages through a 25-guage needle and centrifuged at 4 °C at 800 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the resultant supernatant (cytosol) was subjected to Western blotting. All protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and equal amounts of protein were loaded (30 µg in each lane). Two different antibodies each were employed for the detection of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, for confirmation of differential expression in the various cell lines. The antibodies to Bcl-2 included a monoclonal at 1:500 dilution (clone #7, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and a second monoclonal at 1:500 dilution (clone #124, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The antibodies to Bcl-xL included a monoclonal at 1:500 dilution (clone #44, Transduction Laboratories) and a polyclonal at 1:500 dilution (Upstate Biotechnology). Monoclonal antibody to cytochrome c (clone #C-7, Upstate Biotechnology) was used at 1:1000 dilution. Monoclonal antibodies to Bax, Bad, Bid, and Bak (Transduction Laboratories) were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Monoclonal antibody to α-tubulin (Sigma) was employed at 1:10,000 dilution for confirmation of equal protein loading. Immunodetection of transferred proteins was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL). Antisense and sense 18-mer oligonucleotides directed to the translation initiation site of the human Bcl-2 transcript were synthesized as follows: antisense, 5′-TCTCCCAGCGTGCGCCAT-3′; and sense, 5′-ATGGCGCACGCTGGGAGA-3′ (40Katoh S. Mitsui Y. Kitani K. Suzuki T. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). Oligonucleotides (final concentration, 10 µm) were incubated in 10 mg/ml LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies) in Opti-MEM for 30 min at room temperature and then applied to the washed cells for 5 h at 37 °C (41Ackermann E.J. Taylor J.K. Narayana R. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11245-11252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After removal of the oligonucleotide-containing medium, cells were washed and incubated in standard medium for 24 h, subjected to chemical hypoxia for an additional 12 h, and analyzed for Bcl-2 protein expression and DNA fragmentation as described above. In parallel experiments, cells were co-transfected with an expression vector containing GFP (pEGFP, CLONTECH) to demonstrate efficiency of transfection. The VHL-negative 786-0 cells were transfected with the full-length human Bcl-2 construct in eukaryotic expression vector pORF (pORF-hBcl-2 from Invivogen, San Diego, CA), and three stable lines obtained using G418 selection as previously detailed (3Schoenfeld A.

Post-confluence cells maintained in glucose-free medium for a short duration displayed only a modest decrease in ATP content, as shown in Fig.1(85% of control after 12 h from four separate experiments). Comparable results were obtained for cells treated with 1 µm antimycin A alone. However, cells incubated in glucose-free medium with the addition of 1 µm antimycin A showed a sharp and significant drop in ATP levels (28% of control after 12 h from four separate experiments). Longer incubations in glucose-free medium with antimycin resulted in undetectable ATP levels, with the majority of cells showing signs of necrotic cell death by 24 h (not shown). Thus, we chose to further examine the cells after 12 h, with partial ATP depletion. The MTT-based assay for cell viability revealed that the majority of cells treated with either glucose deprivation alone or after antimycin alone remained viable after 12 h, as shown in Fig.2. However, only 55% of the cells (mean from four separate experiments) remained viable following partial ATP depletion with 12 h of combined glucose deprivation and antimycin treatment. We next tested the hypothesis that apoptosis represents the major form of cell death in 786-0 RCC cells following brief periods of chemical hypoxia. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detectable by the characteristic 180-bp laddering pattern in cells subjected to 12 h of combined glucose-free and antimycin incubation, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Apoptosis was confirmed by detection of fragmented chromosomal DNA by TUNEL assay and by the morphologic appearance of shrunken cells with condensed nuclei, both shown in Fig. 4.Figure 2786-0 renal carcinoma cells undergo dose-dependent cell death following chemical hypoxia.Cell viability was monitored using an MTT-based assay kit (Sigma), designed for the spectrophotometric m"

Our previous studies have shown that the cloned Kir6.2 is activated with mild acidification but inhibited with high acidity. The activation relies on His-175, whereas the molecular basis for the inhibition remains unclear. To elucidate whether the His-175 is indeed the protonation site and what other structures are responsible for the pH-induced inhibition, we performed these studies. Our data showed that the His-175 is the only proton sensor whose protonation is required for the channel activation by acidic pH. In contrast, the channel inhibition at extremely low pH depended on several other histidine residues including His-186, His-193, and His-216. Thus, proton has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the Kir6.2 channels, which attribute to two sets of histidine residues in the C terminus.

Without SUR, the Kir6.2 alone can express functional channels with essential ATP sensitivity when the last 26 or 36 amino acids are deleted (i.e. Kir6.2ΔC26 or Kir6.2ΔC36) (7Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M.

The KATP channels are modulated by multiple cytosolic factors, likely through allosteric mechanisms. Their hallmark feature is the sensitivity to intracellular ATP that inhibits channel activity. ADP and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) are another two regulators with opposite effects to ATP (8Allard B. Lazdunski M.

Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Similar to ATP, ADP, and PIP2, proton is a potent KATP regulator in a number of tissues (13Allard B. Lazdunski M. Rougier O.

Some studies have suggested that proton rather than ATP or ADP is the ultimate signal reflecting the metabolic status in the muscle cells (9Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The pH sensitivity is more complex in KATP than in all other Kir channels. In excised patches, the KATP first undergoes activation with mild acidosis and then is strongly inhibited with further acidification (15Fan Z. Tokuyama Y. Makielski J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1036-C1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Koyano T. Kakei M. Nakashima H. Yoshinaga M. Matsuoka T. Tanaka H. J. Physiol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The activation is a reversible process relying on inherent properties of the channel protein, whereas the inhibition manifests itself when the activation is removed and shows rather poor reversibility (20Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that His-175 is crucial for the pH-dependent channel activation (20Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This histidine residue is conserved in Kir6 but not seen in any other Kir channels. Therefore, detailed studies of such a critical residue may lead to a discovery of molecular intervention to KATP channels by manipulating this histidine residue. Although histidine is the ultimate proton sensor according to its side-chain pK value, it can be involved in channel gating via other mechanisms. Thus, the demonstration of the real proton sensor becomes crucial in the understanding of the pH-dependent KATP activation. To determine whether titration of the side-chain amine group of His-175 indeed occurs at acidic pH, we performed systematic mutagenesis experiments on the His-175 using whole-cell voltage clamp and single-channel recordings. We reasoned that if the channel activation requires protonation of the His-175, a replacement of it with a positively charged residue should lead to an enhancement of the base-line currents. On the other hand, its substitution with a neutral or negative residue should have no effect or even suppress the base-line currents if the channel expression in the plasma membranes remains unchanged. Furthermore, mutations to any other amino acids should abolish the acid-induced channel activation, because of their titratability in an environment that favors the histidine titration at pH 6–7. The pH-dependent channel inhibition is another important characteristic of the KATP, which is shown in excised patches at low pH. Since such an inhibition is also pH-dependent, it should have its own pH-sensing mechanisms in the Kir6.2 protein, which may depend on histidine residues as well. To understand the proton-sensing mechanisms for the Kir6.2 activation and inhibition, we performed these experiments in which all histidine residues in the Kir6.2 protein were studied either alone or in combination with other histidines. Our results indicate that there are two sets of histidine residues in the Kir6.2 channels critical for the pH-dependent activation and inhibition, respectively. Oocytes from Xenopus laevis were used in the present studies. Frogs were anesthetized by bathing them in 0.3% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. A few lobes of ovaries were removed after a small abdominal incision (∼5 mm). The surgical incision was then closed, and the frogs were allowed to recover from the anesthesia.Xenopus oocytes were treated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (type I, Sigma) in the OR2 solution (in mm): NaCl 82, KCl 2, MgCl2 1, and HEPES 5, pH 7.4, for 90 min at room temperature. After 3 washes (10 min each) of the oocytes with the OR2 solution, cDNAs (25–50 ng in 50 nl of water) were injected into the oocytes. The oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C in the ND-96 solution containing (in mm) NaCl 96, KCl 2, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1.8, HEPES 5, and sodium pyruvate 2.5 with 100 mg/liter geneticin added, pH 7.4. Mouse Kir6.2 (GenBankTM accession number D50581) cDNA was generously provided by Dr. S. Seino and subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Site-specific mutations were produced using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The correct mutations were confirmed with DNA sequencing. Whole-cell currents were studied on the oocytes 2–4 days after injection. Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed using an amplifier (Geneclamp 500, Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) at room temperature (∼24 °C). The extracellular solution contained (in mm): KCl 90, MgCl2 3, and HEPES 5, pH 7.4. The HEPES buffer was chosen because of its buffering range and membrane impermeability, as shown in our previous studies (20Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Qu Z. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 725-735Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in a semi-closed recording chamber (BSC-HT, Medical System, Greenvale, NY), in which oocytes were placed on a supporting nylon mesh, and the perfusion solution bathed both the top and bottom surface of the oocytes. The perfusate and the superfusion gas entered the chamber from two inlets at one end and flowed out at the other end. There was a 3 × 15-mm gap on the top cover of the chamber, which served as the gas outlet and an access to the oocytes for recording microelectrodes. At base line, the chamber was ventilated with atmospheric air. Exposure of the oocytes to CO2 was carried out by switching a perfusate that had been bubbled for at least 30 min with a gas mixture containing CO2 at various concentrations balanced with 21% O2 and N2 and superfused with the same gas (23Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Qu Z. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 725-735Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Yang Z. Xu H. Cui N. Qu Z. Chanchevalap S. Shen W. Jiang C. J. Gen.

The high dissolvability of CO2 resulted in a detectable change in intra- or extracellular pH values as fast as 10 s in these oocytes. Macroscopic and single-channel currents were recorded in excised patches at room temperature (∼24 °C) as described previously (24Yang Z. Xu H. Cui N. Qu Z. Chanchevalap S. Shen W. Jiang C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,25Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, the oocyte vitelline membranes were mechanically removed after exposing to hypertonic solution (400 mOsm) for 5 min. Recordings were performed on the stripped oocytes using the same solution applied to bath and recording pipettes. The solution contained (in mm) KCl 10, potassium gluconate 130, potassium fluoride 5, EGTA 1, and HEPES 10, pH 7.4. A parallel perfusion system was used to deliver low pH perfusates at a rate of ∼1 ml/min with no dead space (24Yang Z. Xu H. Cui N. Qu Z. Chanchevalap S. Shen W. Jiang C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Macroscopic and single-channel currents were analyzed using the pClamp 6 software as detailed previously (24Yang Z. Xu H. Cui N. Qu Z. Chanchevalap S. Shen W. Jiang C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Data were further filtered (1 kHz) with a Gaussian filter. This filtering causes events shorter than 200 µs to be ignored. No correction was attempted for the missed events. Single-channel conductance was measured as a slope conductance with at least two voltage points. The open-state probability (Po) was calculated by first measuring the time, tj, spent at current levels corresponding to j = 0,1,2,···N channels open (24Yang Z. Xu H. Cui N. Qu Z. Chanchevalap S. Shen W. Jiang C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ThePo was then obtained asPo = ( Σ jN = 1tjj)/TN, where Nis the number of channels active in the patch, and T is the duration of recordings. Po values were calculated from stretches of data having a total duration of 20–60 s. The current amplitude was described using Gaussian distributions, and the difference between two adjacent fitted peaks was taken as unitary current amplitude. The charge density of the side chain of an amino acid was calculated using the classical Henderson-Hasselbach equation pH = pK + log ([base]/[acid]). The ratio of [base]/[acid] was calculated using the side-chain pK value of a titratable amino acid in free base at different pH levels and was used as an index for the ratio of the protonated versus non-protonated state of the amino acid. The pH-current relationship was described using a sum of a double Hill equation: y = {m/(1 + (pH/pK1)h1)} + {m/(1 + (pK2/pH)h2)} −m, where pK1 is the midpoint channel activation; h1 is the Hill coefficient for channel activation; pK2 is the midpoint channel inhibition; h2 is the Hill coefficient for channel inhibition; and m = 1.2 (assuming 80% peak activation is reach before rundown starts). Data are presented as means ± S.E. Student's t or analysis of variance test was used. Differences of CO2 and pH effects beforeversus during exposures were considered to be statistically significant if p ≤ 0.05. Whole-cell currents were studied in the two-electrode voltage clamp mode using an extracellular solution containing 90 mm K+. Depolarizing and hyperpolarizing command pulses were given to the cell in a range from −160 (−120 mV in some cells) to 100 mV with a 20-mV increment at a holding potential of 0 mV. Under such a condition, the inward rectifying currents were observed 2–4 days after cDNA injection. Consistent with our previous observations, currents produced by Kir6.2 and SUR1 or a single Kir6.2ΔC36 were equally stimulated when the cell was exposed to 15% CO2 (Fig.1A). Therefore, to simplify the studies, the Kir6.2ΔC36 was used. This effect resulted from intracellular acidification and was independent of ATP, as it was seen in the excised patch in the absence of ATP (20Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In excised patches, the channel displayed a rapid inhibition at extremely acidic pH (20Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which showed a poor reversibility and appeared similar to channel rundown (Fig. 1B). As we reported previously (20Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), mutation of His-175 to lysine (a residue found in several other Kir channels, H175K) or alanine (H175A) completely eliminated the acid-induced channel activation. Instead, these mutants were inhibited during hypercapnia in whole-cell recordings (Fig.2A) and by acidic pH in excised patches (Fig. 1B). To determine how this histidine residue is involved in pH-dependent Kir6.2 activation, systematic mutation analysis was carried out. If certain side-chain properties of this residue such as the size, charged state, or hydrophobicity but not the titratability were critical for the proton sensitivity, a substitution of the histidine with another amino acid with similar side-chain properties would retain, to certain degree, the pH-dependent activation. To test this hypothesis, the His-175 was mutated to positively charged (H175K and H175R), neutral polar (H175N and H175C), neutral non-polar (H175A), or negatively charged (H175E and H175D) amino acids. When these mutants were tested, we found that the pH-dependent activation was totally lost in all these mutants (Fig. 2B). Among these substitutes are arginine and alanine. Arginine is highly hydrophilic and capable of forming hydrogen bonds with adjacent residues, whereas alanine is not. Arginine but not alanine has a large side chain and is positively charged at physiological pH. Despite these distinct properties, replacement of the His-175 with arginine affected the CO2 sensitivity almost identically to that with alanine. We noticed that the amplitude of base-line currents before CO2 exposure were closely associated with the charge characteristics of the amino acid at this location. Mutations to positively charged amino acids yielded channels with large base-line currents (H175K, 8.1 ± 1.1 µA, n = 8; H175R, 9.2 ± 1.1 µA, n = 5); mutations to neutral amino acid gave rise to moderate currents (H175A, 2.4 ± 0.4 µA,n = 11) similar to that of the wt Kir6.2ΔC36 (H175H, 2.1 ± 0.3 µA, n = 12); and no detectable current was seen when His-175 was mutated to negatively charged residues (H175D and H175E). The relationship of base-line currents with charge density was calculated according to the Henderson-Hasselbach equation (see “Materials and Methods”). When the base-line currents were plotted against the charge density, a strong correlation was revealed with r > 0.99 andp < 0.001 (Fig. 3), indicating that the current amplitude is a function of the positive charge at this location. There are two possible explanations for the difference in the base-line currents among these mutants. First, mutations to acidic or neutral amino acids are nonfunctional, owing to either misfolding, defective endoplasmic reticulum trafficking, or poor membrane insertion of the channel proteins. Second, the substitution with negative or neutral residues may lead most of expressed channels to the closed state, whereas mutations to the positive ones favor channel openings. If the mutant channels are expressed in the plasma membranes and stay in the closed state, their membrane expression can be demonstrated by activating these channels. Because the KATP channels are normally inhibited by ATP, lowering the ATP sensitivity can enhance the open-state probability, increasing the likelihood to see their expression. Therefore, another mutation on Cys-166 was introduced, as the C166S mutant has been reported previously to stabilize the channel to the open conformation (21Piao H. Cui N. Xu H. Mao J. Rojas A. Wang R. Abdulkadir L. Li L. Wu J. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36673-36680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Trapp S. Proks P. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). By adding the C166S mutation, several His-175 mutants (H175D, H175C, H175E, and H175Q) that failed to show channel activity were rescued (TableI). All of them were inhibited during CO2 exposure, even though the side-chain properties of the amino acids vary greatly (Table I). These results therefore suggest that the limited currents seen with negative charge or neutrality at locus 175 are likely to be due to the inadequate channel openings rather than the lack of functional expression.Table IMutation analyses of histidines involved in pH-dependent activation and inhibition of Kir6.2 channelNameBL currentCO2 effectnµA%Kir6.2ΔC362.1 ± 0.3148.0 ± 14.912His-175H175A2.4 ± 0.4−28.7 ± 6.911H175K8.1 ± 1.1−21.4 ± 2.18*H175K8.8 ± 2.6−15.8 ± 3.84*H175D15.8 ± 4.8−67.6 ± 6.05*H175E5.5 ± 0.5−38.1 ± 2.76*H175N18.7 ± 5.7−35.7 ± 4.74*H175C12.7 ± 1.8−23.7 ± 7.14H175R9.2 ± 1.1−7.8 ± 2.95Multiple histidine mutants*H175D15.8 ± 4.8−67.6 ± 6.05*H175D/H46A11.7 ± 1.1−67.6 ± 2.64*H175D/H70A26.4 ± 2.4−76.6 ± 2.64*H175D/H186A2.4 ± 0.2−5.4 ± 3.14*H175D/H193N32.7 ± 6.7−4.7 ± 2.85*H175D/H216Q15.7 ± 6.0−6.9 ± 4.14*H175D/H234A10.5 ± 3.4−66.7 ± 5.44*H175D/H259A11.1 ± 2.5−67.1 ± 3.35*H175D/H276A13.1 ± 4.0−54.5 ± 3.64*H175D/H277Q/278NNFH175K8.1 ± 1.1−21.4 ± 2.18H175K/H186A17.0 ± 2.46.3 ± 3.45H175K/H193N8.7 ± 0.4−0.8 ± 7.67H175K/H216Q8.4 ± 1.72.6 ± 7.94H175K/H186A/H913N15.5 ± 2.93.6 ± 0.95H175K/H70A15.1 ± 3.2−11.9 ± 1.97H175K/H259A5.0 ± 1.0−18.4 ± 0.75H186A2.0 ± 0.7169.1 ± 29.46H193N2.0 ± 0.3179.3 ± 29.34H216Q2.1 ± 0.4139.7 ± 14.64H186A/H193N2.7 ± 0.4190.6 ± 37.34H186A/H193N/H216Q3.5 ± 0.5213.7 ± 23.15Other mutantsE179Q15.4 ± 2.728.6 ± 10.04C166S14.7 ± 3.310.0 ± 6.97The mutants with * were constructed using the C166S mutant as a template.

The abbreviations used are: BL, base line; n, number of observations; NF, nonfunctional. To understand further the relationship of the open-state probability (Po) with the number of expressed channels, we studied single-channel currents in excised inside-out patches. The H175K had higher base-line activity (Po = 0.123 ± 0.016, n = 4, p < 0.001) than the wt channel (Po = 0.021 ± 0.040,n = 5) and H175A mutant (Po = 0.029 ± 0.006, n = 5) (Fig.4A). Based on the relationshipG =g·N·Po (whereG is conductance of the macroscopic currents; gis single-channel conductance, and N is number of functional channels), the number of functional channels expressed in the plasma membranes can be estimated. We thereby measured base-line macroscopic currents and the single-channel conductance under the identical conditions. The base-line macroscopic currents were 26.1 ± 2.3 pA (n = 12) in the Kir6.2ΔC36, 30.3 ± 4.4 pA (n = 7) in the H175A, and 93.6 ± 17.4 pA (n = 8) in the H175K. The single-channel conductance was 74.1 ± 1.0 pS (n = 15) in the Kir6.2ΔC36, 74.0 ± 2.0 pS (n = 4) in the H175A, and 67.0 ± 1.3 pS (n = 5) in the H175K. We found that the large base-line H175K currents were due to a higher Poinstead of a greater expression of functional channels in the plasma membranes, as theG/(Po·g) ratio, or theN value, for the H175K is not greater than those for H175A and Kir6.2ΔC36 (Fig. 4B). The whole-cell base-line currents of the H175K were also about 3–4 times larger than those of wt Kir6.2ΔC36 and H175A (Table I). The change in the base-line currents was not caused by a decrease in ATP sensitivity either, since H175K and H175A had a similar ATP sensitivity as wt Kir6.2ΔC36 (20Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These results thus indicate that protonation of the His-175 occurs at acidic pH leading to the channel activation. The H175K mutant showed high channel activity at pH 7.4–9.0. The channel activity decreased when the pH levels became higher or lower. The pK value for channel activation was pH 10.5 (Fig.5A), suggesting that the lysine residue is also protonated at near its pK value for free-base amino acids in the microenvironment of this residue. The PHDsec and Chou-Fasman analyses show that the secondary structure around the His-175 is α-helical. Thus, we studied two residues in the immediate vicinity of the His-175, which are aligned onto the same surface of His-175. Interestingly, when we neutralized Glu-179, the E179Q mutant showed CO2 sensitivity significantly smaller than that of the wt channel (Fig. 5B), indicating that the titratability of His-175 is strongly influenced by its microenvironment. We also studied Thr-171 by mutating it to a lysine (T171K), but we failed to obtain functional expression. Although the His-175 mutations eliminate the pH-dependent activation, the acid-induced channel inhibition remained, which indeed was more obvious in these mutants. It is possible that there is another mechanism responsible for the channel inhibition, which manifests itself only when the dominant activation is removed. To understand the molecular basis of this inhibition and to see whether this inhibition has a similar origin as the channel rundown that is usually seen in excised patch, further mutation analysis was performed. Mutations of one of several histidines were constructed on the H175D, H175K, or C166S/H175D mutants. The rationale for choosing the C166S/H175D as a template is that this mutant is strongly inhibited by CO2, raising the resolution of the CO2/pH-induced channel inhibition (Fig.6A). Note that the C166S mutant itself is not inhibited by 15% CO2 (Table I), similar to what we have shown recently (21Piao H. Cui N. Xu H. Mao J. Rojas A. Wang R. Abdulkadir L. Li L. Wu J. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36673-36680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Consistent with the CO2 sensitivity of whole-cell currents, the C166S/H175D mutant was inhibited by intracellular acidosis in inside-out patches with pK = 6.68 (h = 2.1,n = 4, Fig. 6, B and C). Concerning the CO2/pH sensitivities, the mutant channel behaved just like Kir1.1 and Kir2.3 channels where histidines are critical for the acid-induced channel inhibition (23Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Qu Z. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 725-735Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C1173-C1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we systematically studied all histidine residues in the channel protein. We found that His-193 was a player. The acid-induced inhibition was almost completely removed by mutation of His-193 to glutamine (Fig. 7, A andB). Mutations of His-186 and His-216 had a similar effect, whereas replacements of other histidines did not (Fig.8A and Table I). Mutation of these histidines did not compromise the channel activation. Indeed, the magnitude of the activation was significantly larger in the H186A/H193N/H216Q triple mutant than in the wt Kir6.2ΔC36 (Fig.8, B and C, Table I). Interestingly, mutations of these histidine residues markedly diminished the channel rundown, as shown in the H186A/H193N/H216Q and C166S/H175D/H193N (Fig.9, A and B). These results thus indicate that another set of histidine residues are involved in the pH-dependent inhibition of Kir6.2 channels.Figure 7Elimination of the acid-dependent inhibition by mutation of His-193. The H193N was constructed using the H175D/C166S as a template, and a triple mutation H175D/H193N/C166S was obtained. A, when the H175D/H193N/C166S was studied in whole-cell recording, this mutant showed large base-line (BL) currents and became insensitive to CO2(15%, 6 min).

The channel inhibition is greatly diminished when His-186, His-193, or His-216 is mutated, whereas mutations of other histidine residues have no significant effect. B, mutation of these histidines alone or combined does not reduce the channel activation during CO2 (15%) exposure.

Although the current amplitude drops with further decrease in pH, such an inhibition is much less severe in comparison to the wt Kir6.2ΔC36. There are substantial currents remaining at pH 6.2, at which the wt Kir6.2ΔC36 currents are almost completely inhibited.

However, previous studies on the pH sensitivity of the KATP in several tissues and cells were controversial and even contradictory. Channel response varies from activation (16Koyano T. Kakei M.

By using the cloned KATP channels, we have shown recently that acidic pH has dual effects depending on the pH range. The channels are activated by a moderate decrease in intracellular pH and inhibited at high acidity. Such two-phase effects, which have been observed in insulin-secreting cells and cardiac myocytes (15Fan Z. Tokuyama Y. Makielski J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1036-C1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Koyano T. Kakei M. Nakashima H. Yoshinaga M. Matsuoka T. Tanaka H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 463: 747-766Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), may underlie the controversy in the pH sensitivity of the cell-endogenous KATP. Our previous studies have shown that the channel activation relies on His-175 (20Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mutation of this histidine residue completely eliminates the acid-induced channel activation (20Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the His-175-dependent channel activation was examined in the present study. Our data have shown that protonation of His-175 is essential for the channel activation. First, histidine is absolutely necessary for the pH-dependent activation that is lost with a single mutation of this residue. Second, other side-chain properties of amino acid such as size, hydrophobicity, charge status, and hydrogen bond do not play a role, as mutations to other amino acids that have some of these properties cannot produce the pH-dependent activation. Third, the base-line channel activity is a function of the charge density. The largest currents are seen when residue 175 has a positive charge by protonation of the His-175 or by mutation to lysine or arginine. Fourth, the pKvalue of residue 175 is close to that of amino acid in its free base, which shifts to 10.5 when the His-175 is mutated to a lysine. These as well as the fact that the histidine side chain has a pKvalue most close to the physiological pH levels indicate that His-175 is the only proton sensor responsible for the pH-dependent Kir6.2 activation. We believe that finding this proton sensor is important since this histidine residue is exclusively seen in the Kir6 subfamily but not in any other Kir channels. The demonstration of such a site critical for controlling channel activity opens a major avenue to the understanding of the KATP regulation and the control of cellular activity in a number of physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. At pH levels below 6.5, the Kir6.2 channel activity drops rapidly. In the present study, we have looked at the molecular basis of the inhibition and found three histidine residues that are likely to play a role. Mutations of these residues markedly attenuate the pH-dependent channel inhibition with no sacrifice of the activation. The inhibition becomes more obvious when the activation is removed. Considering only partial recovery following acid exposure in Kir1.1 (32Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the H175D/C166S mutant responds to acidic pH almost identically to the typical pH-sensitive Kir channels (23Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Qu Z. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 725-735Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Yang Z. Xu H. Cui N. Qu Z. Chanchevalap S. Shen W. Jiang C. J. Gen.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C1173-C1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the Kir6.2 shares the same molecular basis for the pHdependent inhibition. At this stage, the physiological significance for the pHdependent inhibition of Kir6.2 is still unclear. Since such an inhibition shows very poor recovery and is clearly seen in excised patches but not in whole-cell recordings, it may be related to the channel rundown. Previous studies on the cell-endogenous KATP have shown that channel rundown can be greatly attenuated when the cytosolic side of patch membranes is exposed to protease (33Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 715-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lee K. Ozanne S.E. Rowe I.C. Hales C.N. Ashford M.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 176-185PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the KATPchannel rundown involves a large scale of movement of intracellular protein domains as demonstrated in the Kir1.1 (32Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas these histidine residues may play a part in the movement or even possibly initiate the movement. The KATP channels are gated by several intracellular regulators including ATP, ADP, PIP2, and proton. More complicated are the channel gating mechanisms, as proton itself has biphasic effects on channel activity showing how sophisticated the KATP gating can be. Although the precise mechanisms for channel gating are still not clear, a better understanding of the KATP regulation can be achieved with the availability of the information about all its key regulators. Therefore, the demonstration of the molecular basis for the pH-dependent channel activation and inhibition in the present study provides important information in this aspect. In conclusion, the Kir6.2 channel shows a biphasic response to acidic pH. The channel activation requires a histidine residue (His-175) near the M2 region in the C terminus. The His-175 is very likely to be the proton sensor that couples the pH change to channel activation. The channel inhibition, on the other hand, is related to another three histidine residues, i.e. His-186, His-193, and His-216. Mutations of these residues greatly diminish the pH-dependent inhibition. Thus, proton has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the KATP channels by acting on two distinct sets of histidine residues. We thank Dr. S. Seino for providing Kir6.2 cDNA."

Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). Human epidemiological and animal studies have demonstrated that NSAID administration is beneficial in the treatment of cancers, especially those of the colon and rectum (3Thun M.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 4Giovannucci E. Egan K.M. Hunter D.J. Stampfer M.J. Colditz G.A. Willett W.C. Speizer F.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which NSAIDs exert this anti-cancer activity is, however, unclear and controversial. Originally, it was believed that NSAIDs inhibit cancer progression by inhibiting COX, especially COX-2, because (i) progression of colon cancer development was associated with an increase of prostaglandin E2 production in cancer tissue (5Pugh S. Thomas G.A. Gut. 1994; 35: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), (ii) NSAIDs inhibited the activity of COX and thus the production of prostaglandins (5Pugh S. Thomas G.A. Gut. 1994; 35: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6Qiao L. Kozoni V. Tsioulias G.J. Koutsos M.I. Hanif R. Shiff S.J. Rigas B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and (iii) NSAIDs inhibited the proliferation of normal and cancerous colon epithelial cells by inducing arrest of the cells at the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle (7Barnes C.J. Lee M. Hardman W.E. Cameron I.L. Cell Prolif. 1996; 29: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 8Shiff S.J. Qiao L. Tsai L.L. Rigas B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many normal and cancerous cell types, whereas expression of COX-2 is stimulated by growth factors and tumor promoters and is often selectively expressed in tumor cells, including those of colon and rectal origins (9Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. DuBois R.N. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1183-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sano H. Hla T. Maier J.A. Crofford L.J.

Kondo M. Hla T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3785-3789PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, COX-2 expression correlated with tumorigenicity. This correlation was supported by the finding that in a mutated adenomatouspolyposis coli background (APCA716−/+), which predisposes the animals to intestinal cancer, COX-2−/− mice developed fewer intestinal polyps than COX-2+/+ mice (12Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). By extension, targeted inhibition of COX-2 by NSAIDs would logically be expected to suppress the development of cancers, at least those of colon origin. More recent data, however, suggested that the apoptotic activity of NSAIDs did not seem to be associated with their ability to inhibit COX-1 or COX-2, because (i) the concentration of NSAIDs required to induce apoptosis was several orders of magnitude higher than that required to inhibit the activity of COX (13Mitchell J.A. Akarasereenont P. Thiemermann C. Flower R.J. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11693-11697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar) and (ii) NSAIDs such asindomethacin (IND) and sulindacsulfide (SuS) still induced apoptosis in COX-1−/−, COX-2−/−, and COX-1:COX-2 double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (14Zhang X. Morham S.G. Langenbach R. Young D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Therefore, the apoptotic effect of NSAIDs appears to be mediated by other factors. Execution of apoptosis requires activation of caspases, which are ubiquitously and constitutively expressed as inactive zymogens (pro-caspases) in the cytosol (15Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar, 16Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol.

Caspases can be divided into “initiator” caspases (e.g. caspases-2, -8, -9, and -10), which activate downstream “effector” caspases (e.g.caspases-3, -6, and -7), which, in turn, degrade certain cellular proteins and ultimately result in cell death (15Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar, 16Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol.

The initiator caspases can be activated by either mitochondrial-mediated or cell surface “death” receptor-dependent processes (15Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar, 16Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol.

The mitochondria-mediated process begins with the activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-9, which then activates downstream effector caspases, in particular caspase-3, that result in cell death (18Hakem R.

In contrast, the death receptor-mediated process activates an apoptotic pathway that is dependent on the initiator caspase, caspase-8 (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). The best studied death receptor is Fas (24Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Engagement of the extracellular domain of Fas by the Fas ligand (Fas-L) results in Fas trimerization and intracellular recruitment of the adapter protein, FADD, to the receptor cluster (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 25Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). Recruitment is facilitated by homotypic interactions between “death domains” located in Fas and FADD. Receptor-bound FADD oligomerizes, and then utilizes a second domain, the “death effector domain,” to recruit pro-caspase-8 (24Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 25Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). The complex of Fas·FADD·procaspase-8 is referred to as DISC (death-inducing signalingcomplex). DISC catalyzes proteolytic conversion of procaspase-8 into active caspase-8 (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 24Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar), which then activates the downstream effector caspases, caspases-3, -6, and -7, triggering cell death. Recently, it was demonstrated that treatment of several human colon epithelial cancer cell lines, including HCT116, with NSAIDs such as IND and SuS induced (i) down-regulation of a key apoptotic suppressor, Bcl-xL; (ii) transduction of apoptotic signals to mitochondria by a Bax-dependent mechanism; and (iii) activation of the mitochondrial/caspase-9-dependent apoptotic pathway (27Zhang L., Yu, J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). The requirement for Bax and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis induction by NSAIDs was inferred from the observation that targeted knock-out of both alleles of thebax gene in HCT116 cells impaired their ability to respond to the apoptotic effect of IND and SuS (27Zhang L., Yu, J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the HCT116/Bax−/− cells were still responsive to the apoptotic effect of several other anti-cancer drugs, indicating that Bax was uniquely required to mediate the apoptotic effect of NSAIDs. In this report, we demonstrate that, similar to their effect on human colon cancer cells, treatment of human leukemia cell lines with IND and SuS induces apoptosis. We also demonstrate that the ability of NSAIDs to inhibit COX activity is insufficient to induce apoptosis. Surprisingly, however, our data show that the key step of apoptosis induction by IND and SuS involves a FADD-dependent, but not Bax-dependent, mechanism that activates the initiator caspase-8-dependent pathway. These results indicate that the apoptotic effect of NSAIDs on cells can be mediated by different mechanisms in cell type-specific fashion.

To maintain a high expression level of FADD-DN in the FADD-DN Jurkat cell line before they were used for experimentation, the cells were treated for 72 h with 100 ng/ml of the CH-11 agonistic anti-Fas antibody, and the surviving cells (∼75%) were expanded and subsequently used for experimentation. Untreated (control) and NSAID-treated cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in fixing solution (2% paraformadehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS), and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed once in PBS, and incubated in DAPI solution (500 ng/ml DAPI in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. An aliquot of the stained cells was observed under a fluorescent microscope connected to a Power Macintosh computer, and the cell morphology was recorded using Adobe Photoshop software. Apoptotic cells were identified as those with densely stained granular nuclear bodies (32Han Z. Li G. Bremner T.A. Lange T.S. Zhang G. Jemmerson R. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were left untreated or treated with IND or SuS at the indicated doses. The cells were then harvested and washed twice in PBS, and whole cell extracts were prepared under reducing conditions (32Han Z. Li G. Bremner T.A. Lange T.S. Zhang G. Jemmerson R. Wyche J.H.

Specific proteins were identified using ECL reagents (32Han Z. Li G. Bremner T.A. Lange T.S. Zhang G. Jemmerson R. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A.

The cells were then harvested, washed three times in drug-free medium, resuspended in drug-free medium at a density of 50 cells/ml, and seeded into 96-well plates (200 µl/well) in triplicate. The cells were incubated for 2–4 weeks. Growth of cells in each well was inspected and recorded. The growth of untreated cells was designated as 100%, and the growth of the drug-treated cells was compared with that of untreated cells. Cells were first incubated for 20 min with mouse monoclonal antibodies to Fas, Fas-L, or isotype-matched mouse IgG1 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum. The cells were then washed in PBS, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG1 antibody for 20 min. The cells were washed in PBS containing 1% bovine serum three times and then subjected to analysis in a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Preliminary studies showed that IND induced various human leukemic cell lines to undergo apoptosis (data not shown). In a 48-h survival assay, the effective concentration range for IND to induce apoptosis of all cell lines was between 200 and 500 µm (Fig.1A and data not shown). This concentration range was ∼100-fold more than that required for IND to inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 in cells (13Mitchell J.A. Akarasereenont P. Thiemermann C. Flower R.J. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11693-11697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). However, it was similar to the concentration required to induce Bax-dependent apoptosis of human colon cancer cell lines (27Zhang L., Yu, J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). To investigate in greater detail the mechanism mediating specifically the apoptotic effect of IND and other NSAIDs, we concentrated on the human leukemic Jurkat cell line. Treatment of Jurkat cells for 48 h with IND induced dose-dependent apoptosis with an IC50 value of ∼250 µm (Fig. 1A). Dying cells were identified by the appearance of granular nuclear apoptotic bodies containing condensed DNA (Fig. 1B). Jurkat cells did not express COX-2 protein at any detectable level, nor did IND induce its expression (Fig. 1C). Thus, the apoptotic effect of IND on Jurkat cells appeared to be independent of COX-2. COX-1 was expressed in Jurkat cells, and it was down-regulated by IND treatment in a fashion that paralleled apoptotic induction (Fig.1C). To pursue the correlation with COX-1, we investigated the effect of other NSAIDs, which are potent inhibitors of COX-1 (12Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 34Reddy B.S. Rao C.V. Seibert K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4566-4569PubMed Google Scholar, 35Smith M.L. Hawcroft G. Hull M.A. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 664-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), on Jurkat cells. Whereas SuS also induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells, the other NSAIDs had no apoptotic effect (Fig.2). These results indicated that the ability of NSAIDs to inhibit the activity of COX-1 alone was insufficient to induce apoptosis, and that IND and SuS were unique in their ability to induce apoptosis among the NSAIDs tested. Treatment of Jurkat cells with IND induced cleavage of the apoptotic targets PARP (36Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar) and β-catenin (37Steinhusen U. Badock V. Bauer A. Behrens J. Wittman-Liebold B. Dorken B. Bommert K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16345-16353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which was blocked by the irreversible pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK (Fig.3A). IND treatment of Jurkat cells progressively induced the activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-8, and the effector caspase, caspase-3, and both of these events paralleled the induction of PARP cleavage (Fig. 3B). Together, these results suggested that the exposure of Jurkat cells to IND resulted in the activation of caspase-8, which led to the activation of downstream effector caspases including caspase-3, which then cleaved cellular targets and caused apoptosis. To further assess whether caspase-8 activation was a critical event in the process of apoptotic induction, the ability of IND and SuS to induce apoptosis in a Jurkat cell line (29Tang D. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7245-7252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) expressing a dominant-negative version of FADD (FADD-DN) was investigated. The FADD-DN molecule expressed in these cells lacked the death effector domain, and it was therefore unable to interact with and induce the activation of caspase-8 and other caspases (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 25Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7795-7798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 26Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). The expression of FADD-DN dramatically blocked the ability of IND (Fig.4A) and SuS (Fig.4B) to induce apoptosis. Correspondingly, the FADD-DN cells exposed to IND or SuS failed to activate caspase-8 and caspase-3 and resulted in little, if any, cleavage of PARP (Fig. 4C). After a 24-h treatment of wild-type Jurkat cells with IND (500 µm) or SuS (200 µm), and subsequent withdrawal of the drugs, there were virtually no viable cells left to resume proliferation (Fig. 4D). In contrast, Jurkat cells expressing the FADD-DN not only survived the 24-h treatment but were also able to proliferate after the withdrawal of the drugs (Fig.4D). Taken together, these results indicated that IND and SuS induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells by a FADD-dependent mechanism that activated the initiator caspase-8-dependent pathway. To confirm the role of FADD and caspase-8 in the process of apoptosis induction by NSAIDs, a set of three Jurkat cell lines that were wild-type (i.e. parental), caspase-8-null (30Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), or FADD-null (31Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar) were treated with IND for 32 h. The caspase-8 and FADD-null cells were highly resistant to apoptosis induction in contrast to the wild-type cells (Fig.5A). Correspondingly, the IND-treated FADD-null cells underwent little activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 5, B and C) and neither the FADD-null nor the caspase-8-null cells showed significant cleavage of either PARP (Fig. 5B) or β-catenin (Fig. 5C). These results further indicated that the IND-induced death of Jurkat cells occurred primarily through a FADD- and caspase-8- dependent mechanism. Caspase-8 activation is normally associated with apoptotic induction caused by a death receptor ligand interacting with its cognate receptor (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). This interaction results in the recruitment of the adapter molecule FADD (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 25Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7795-7798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 26Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar), which, in turn, recruits and activates caspase-8 (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 24Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Thus, having shown the requirement for FADD and caspase-8 in the process of apoptosis induction by IND, we investigated whether the known death receptor ligands Fas-L, TRAIL, and TNFα were involved in NSAID-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells. The addition of the NOK-1 antibody, which potently neutralizes the activity of Fas-L and blocks its apoptotic effects (28Petak I. Tillman D.M. Harwood F.G. Mihalik R. Houghton J.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2643-2650PubMed Google Scholar), to cell culture medium did not alter the apoptotic activity of IND on Jurkat cells (Fig. 6A). Therefore, Fas-L was unlikely to be involved in IND-induced apoptosis. This was confirmed by the results from Western blot (data not shown) and flow cytometry analyses showing that, although Jurkat cells express high levels of Fas receptor (Fig. 6B, panel ii), they did not express detectable Fas-L either before (data not shown) or after (Fig. 6B, panel iii) IND treatment. Finally, IND-treated and untreated Jurkat cells were analyzed by immunoblotting for the expression status of TRAIL and TNFα. Neither ligand was expressed to a detectable level under either treatment condition (data not shown). From these experiments we concluded that IND-induced apoptosis was likely independent of the death receptor ligands Fas-L, TRAIL, and TNFα. We have demonstrated that IND and SuS, members of the NSAIDs family, induce apoptosis in human leukemic Jurkat cells. Since Jurkat cells did not express COX-2 (Fig. 1), the inhibition of COX-2 by IND and SuS appears to be irrelevant to the mechanism mediating the apoptotic effect of these two chemicals. In contrast, COX-1 was expressed in Jurkat cells, and it was down-regulated in a comparable and parallel degree to the extent of apoptosis induced by IND (Fig. 1). However, it is unlikely that COX-1 was involved in apoptosis regulation in Jurkat cells, because the concentration of IND and SuS required to induce apoptosis was orders of magnitude higher than that required to inhibit COX-1 activity (13Mitchell J.A. Akarasereenont P. Thiemermann C. Flower R.J. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11693-11697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). In addition, proven potent COX-1 inhibitors, including acetaminophen, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, piroxicam, salicylic acid, and sulindac (13Mitchell J.A. Akarasereenont P. Thiemermann C. Flower R.J. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11693-11697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar, 38Meade E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no apoptotic effect on Jurkat cells (Fig. 2). Thus, the apoptotic effect of IND and SuS appeared to be mediated by factors other than COX-1 and COX-2. A recent study demonstrated that IND- and SuS-induced apoptosis of human HCT116 colon epithelial cancer cells was mediated by a Bax-dependent mechanism (27Zhang L., Yu, J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Thus, in colon cancer epithelial cells, the apoptotic signals generated by these two drugs were transduced through Bax to mitochondria, which induced cytochrome c efflux (Fig.7A). Subsequently, this efflux presumably resulted in the activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-9, which then activated downstream effector caspases including caspase-3, finally culminating in apoptosis (39Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar). However, we have demonstrated in this study that IND- and SuS-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells was instead mediated by a FADD-dependent mechanism that activated the caspase-8-dependent pathway (Figs. 4, 5, and 7B). FADD was initially identified as a Fas-associated death domain protein (25Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7795-7798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 26Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar), which was required for activation of caspase-8 by death receptors such as Fas and TNFR1 (TNFα receptor type I). Although we have not directly tested whether Bax is involved in the IND-induced death of Jurkat cells, other groups have demonstrated that FADD-dependent cell death is independent of Bax and mitochondria (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 24Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Therefore, taken together, this study and the study by Zhang et al. (27Zhang L., Yu, J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) indicate that the apoptotic effect of IND and SuS can be mediated by either a FADD-dependent or a Bax-dependent mechanism in a cell type-specific fashion. Activation of caspase-8 can be mediated by several death receptors including Fas, TNFR1, DR4, and DR5 (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 24Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Stimulation of Fas and TNFR1 by their respective ligands, Fas-L and TNFα, induces activation of caspase-8 in a FADD-dependent fashion (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 40Yeh W.-C. de la Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.-B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K.

Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). A plausible mechanism that would have explained the FADD-dependent apoptosis triggered by IND and SuS in Jurkat cells was an induction of expression of either Fas-L or TNFα. This hypothesis, however, seems unlikely since the apoptotic effect of the drugs on Jurkat cells was not decreased in the presence of antibodies (28Petak I. Tillman D.M. Harwood F.G. Mihalik R. Houghton J.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2643-2650PubMed Google Scholar) that could neutralize the activity of Fas-L (Fig. 6) and TNFα (data not shown). Moreover, IND- and SuS-treated Jurkat cells did not express either Fas-L or TNFα as determined by Western blot and FACS analysis (Fig. 6, and data not shown). These data support the conclusion that Fas-L or TNFα are not mechanistically relevant for NSAID-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells. Other death receptors, such as DR4 and DR5, can mediate caspase-8-dependent apoptosis after engagement of the TRAIL ligand (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 42Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M.

Goddard A.D. Godowski P. Ashkenazi A. Science. 1997; 277: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). However, the role of FADD in this process remains controversial, with conflicting reports of FADD-independent (44Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M. Donahue C.J. Ruppert S. Bauer K.D. Ashkenazi A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 702-750Google Scholar), or FADD-dependent TRAIL-induced apoptosis (45Wajant H. Johannes F.J. Haas E. Siemienski K. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Weiss T. Grell M. Scheurich P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 46Kuang A.A. Diehl G.E. Zhang J. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25065-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is unlikely that TRAIL mediated the apoptotic effect of IND and SuS on Jurkat cells, because TRAIL expression was also not detected in this cell line (data not shown). We cannot rule out the possibility that there is an unknown death ligand activated in Jurkat cells by IND and SuS that was responsible for causing apoptosis. Alternatively, however, we propose that IND and SuS induce apoptosis of Jurkat cells by a FADD-dependent, but death ligand-independent, mechanism. This mechanism has already been proposed to mediate the apoptotic effect of several other compounds, including cycloheximide (28Petak I. Tillman D.M. Harwood F.G. Mihalik R. Houghton J.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2643-2650PubMed Google Scholar) and several anti-cancer drugs (22Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar,47Micheau O. Solary E. Hammann A. Dimanche-Boitrel M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7987-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Although our data imply that IND and SuS apoptotic induction is death ligand-independent, they nonetheless implicate the involvement of death receptors. Thus, the FADD-DN construct we utilized is defective in its ability to interact with procaspases, whereas it is still competent to interact with death receptors, and it thus behaves as a dominant negative (29Tang D. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7245-7252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, if IND and SuS could induce apoptosis without involvement of a death receptor but by activation, directly or indirectly, of FADD, then we would have expected to see no effect of the FADD-DN expression. Therefore, our finding that the FADD-DN-expressing cells were very resistant to apoptotic induction (Fig. 4) implies a requirement for a FADD:death receptor interaction. It is possible that, even in the absence of death ligands, treatment of Jurkat cells with NSAIDs induced activation of a still unidentified death receptor, which was then capable of mediating caspase-8 activation via a FADD-dependent mechanism. It is also interesting to note that the phenotype of the FADD-DN-expressing cells appeared more extreme than that of FADD- or caspase-8-null cells. FADD-DN cells underwent little apoptosis, even after prolonged IND or SuS treatment (Fig. 4C), and the majority of the cells were competent for continued proliferation upon removal of the apoptotic inducers (Fig. 4D). In contrast, the FADD- and caspase-8-null cells ultimately underwent apoptosis (Fig.5 and data not shown) and generally succumbed even if NSAIDs were removed after 24 h (data not shown), although at a greatly reduced rate in comparison to wild-type cells. These observations suggest that the FADD- and caspase-8-dependent pathway is the preferred mode of apoptosis induction by NSAIDs in Jurkat cells. In the presence of the FADD-DN, most of the caspase-8 and other initiator caspases are apparently sequestered into nonproductive complexes such that little activation of caspase-8 nor the subsequent downstream steps occurs (Fig. 7C). In the absence of caspase-8, FADD is probably still capable of weakly activating other initiator caspases, such as caspase-2 or caspase-10 (15Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar), and this results in an attenuated activation response (Fig. 7D). Similarly, in the absence of FADD, other adapter molecules with death domains and death effector domains (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar) may be inefficiently utilized to activate caspase-8 (Fig.7E). These molecules may have lower affinity for procaspase-8 than FADD and/or are not expressed at a sufficiently high level in Jurkat cells. In summary, our data suggest that the ability of NSAIDs to inhibit the activity of COX alone was insufficient to induce apoptosis. Moreover, the apoptotic activity of IND and SuS was unique among the NSAIDs tested, and their effect on Jurkat cells was mediated by an apparent death ligand-independent, but FADD-dependent mechanism."

It is present in reticular fibers of most parenchymal tissues, such as lung, kidney, liver, muscle, and spleen, with the exception of hyaline cartilage, brain and vitreous humor (3von der Mark K. Seibel M. Robins S. Bilezekian J. Dynamics of Bone and Cartilage Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1999: 3-18Google Scholar). Besides its biomechanical properties, type I collagen is important as an adhesive substrate for many cells and plays a major role in tissue and organ development, cell migration, proliferation and differentiation, wound healing, tissue remodeling, and homeostasis (4Aumalley M. Gayraud B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 19: 253-265Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Because type I collagen is a ubiquitous molecule with many biological functions, the regulation of its expression has been well studied in the past twenty years. Several cis-acting elements within the Col1a1 and Col1a2 promoters have been identified that interact with transcription factors such as CCAAT-binding factor (CBF), Sp1, NF-1, and c-Krox, which are critical for regulation of constitutive expression (5Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 6Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell.

Although knowledge about the regulation of type I collagen synthesis during development and in pathological states, such as lung fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis, remains a major interest, the understanding of its regulation under normal physiological conditions is crucial.YY1 (10Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), also termed NF-E1 (11Park K. Atchison M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Appella E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), is a transcription factor containing four Cys2-His2 zinc fingers that can either activate or repress transcription depending upon promoter context. YY1 binds to the (C/t/a)CATN(T/a)(T/g/c) consensus sequence located in the promoters of many viral and cellular genes (14Shi Y. Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Moreover, the YY1 binding site can also serve as a transcription initiator element (15Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 16Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), because it can direct specific transcription in the absence of binding sites for other factors (17Seto E. Shi Y. Shenk T. Nature. 1991; 354: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) including TATA-binding proteins. It has been shown that YY1 may be required for function of the initiator element, because antibodies to YY1 can block transcription (17Seto E. Shi Y. Shenk T. Nature. 1991; 354: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The critical importance of YY1 in growth and differentiation has been demonstrated in mice in which targeted disruption of YY1 results in peri-implantation lethality (18Donohoe M.D. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).Studies in our laboratory have focused on the regulation of collagen gene expression by cytokines and prostaglandins. Recently, we identified a region within the proximal Col1a1 promoter, which was down-regulated by E-series prostaglandins added to transiently transfected fibroblasts or induced by in-terleukin-1 (IL-1)1 (19Riquet R.B. Lai W.-F.T. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.-F. Karsenty G. Goldring M.B. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 705-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mori et al. (20Mori K. Hatamochi A. Ueki H. Olsen A. Jimenez S.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) identified a corresponding region in the humanCOL1A1 promoter that was sensitive to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced prostaglandin E2. A close study of the DNA sequence of the minimal promoter of the mouse Col1a1gene and preliminary studies of DNA-binding protein interactions with the sequence spanning –84 bp to –29 bp of the Col1a1minimal promoter permitted us to identify DNA sequences upstream of the TATA box that presented features of potential Yin Yang 1 (YY1) DNA binding sites.In the study presented here, we show that the YY1 transcription factor binds to two sites in the mouse Col1a1 minimal core promoter one located 11 bp upstream from the TATA box, and the other immediately adjacent to the TATA box on the complementary strand. Mutation analysis of these sites in transient transfections and overexpression of YY1 and antisense-YY1 in cotransfections demonstrate that YY1 functions as a transcriptional activator of the Col1a1 promoter in fibroblasts.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we report the presence of previously unidentified cis-acting elements within theCol1a1 minimal promoter that interact with the YY1 transcription factor. Our results indicate that YY1 binds to either of two sites, one upstream from (YY1A; CCATcAA at –40/–34 bp) and the other adjacent to (YY1B; AAgATGG at –35/–29 bp) the TATA box. Furthermore, we demonstrate using reporter gene studies that the integrity of both of the YY1 sites is required for strong transcription directed by the Col1a1 core promoter in fibroblasts. Using probes containing mutations similar to those made in the humanCOL1A1 promoter by Mori et al. (20Mori K. Hatamochi A. Ueki H. Olsen A. Jimenez S.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we did not observe any differences in binding due to either IL-1 (data not shown) or TNF-α treatment. However, constitutive expression was significantly modified by mutations in the YY1A and YY1B sites, the latter of which is not present in the human promoter. Nevertheless, treatment with either cytokine did inhibit Col1a1 promoter expression in transient transfections (data not shown). Our results are reminiscent of the findings of Higashi et al. (26Higashi K. Kouba D.J. Song Y.J. Uitto J. Mauviel A. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), who showed that IFN-γ inhibited expression of the human COL1A2promoter in transient transfections but did not modify binding of nuclear factors in EMSA experiments. Furthermore, Greenwel et al. (27Greenwel, P., Tanaka, S., Penkov, D., Zhang, W., Olive, M., Moll, J., Vinson, C., Di Liberto, M., and Ramirez, F. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol. 20.Google Scholar) have reported that TNF-α inhibits COL1A2promoter expression via interaction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ with elements upstream of the proximal promoter.Others have shown that only three factors, YY1, TFIIB, and RNA polymerase II, are minimal requirements for accurate initiation of constitutive transcription on a supercoiled adeno-associated virus P5 promoter template DNA, thereby providing an example of accurate and efficient transcriptional initiation by polymerase II in the absence of TBP/TFIID (28Usheva A. Shenk T. Cell. 1994; 76: 1115-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In our transient transfection studies, mutation of the TATA box to TgTA, known to eliminate binding of the TATA box binding protein, TBP/TFIID (25Wobbe C. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), severely diminished the activity of theCol1a1 –84/+13 core promoter (p130 construct) and completely eliminated expression directed by the strongCol1a1 –222/+113 promoter (p350 construct). This result supports an argument for an involvement of direct interaction of TBP with the Col1a1 TATA box. The involvement of YY1 binding appears to depend upon the promoter context. Disruption of the YY1A site in the p130 core promoter construct results in a modest decrease in activity of ∼40%, whereas the same mutation in the p350 construct results in an almost complete (99%) loss of function. Similarly, mutation of the YY1B site adjacent to the TATA box completely reduces p350 activity, but the p130 activity is reduced to the level of activity of p130mTgTA. In contrast, mutations in both YY1 sites are required to completely block the activity of either promoter construct. Therefore, in the case of the Col1a1 promoter, YY1 appears not to function according to the model of Usheva and Shenk (28Usheva A. Shenk T. Cell. 1994; 76: 1115-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), where it serves to functionally replace TBP on the TATA-less adeno-associated virus P5 promoter by recruiting TFIIB and RNA polymerase II. Rather, because the YY1B site occupies the position of the TFIIB recognition element, it may either stabilize TFIIB interaction with TBP/TFIID (29Austen M. Lüscher B. Lüscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) or interact with TAFII55 (30Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar).YY1 is constitutively expressed and is known to interact with other proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, such as c-Myc (31Riggs K.J. Saleque S. Wong K.K. Merrell K.T. Lee J.S. Shi Y. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), Sp1 (32Seto E. Lewis B. Shenk T. Nature. 1993; 365: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 33Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6145-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), CREB/ATF (34Zhou Q. Gedrich R.W. Engel D.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4323-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NF-κB (35Lu S.Y. Rodriguez M. Liao W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6253-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YY1 has been shown to be involved in suppression of the interferon-γ (IFN-γ) promoter in T cells through binding to an AP-2-like repressor protein and competition with AP-1 for DNA binding (36Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). On the other hand, YY1 may play a positive role in activation-induced IFN-γ transcription through interaction with NFAT (37Sweetser M.T. Hoey T. Sun Y.L. Weaver W.M. Price G.A. Wilson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34775-34783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, YY1 may also repress Sp1- or CREB-mediated transcription by interfering with communication between coactivators and targets within the transcription machinery (38Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For example, repression by YY1 of activation of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene mediated by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein is independent of YY1 binding directly to the low density lipoprotein receptor promoter, because YY1 interacts in solution with Sp1 and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (23Bennett M.K. Ngo T.T. Athanikar J.N. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13025-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). YY1 has been shown to bind to the upstream Col1a2 promoter region at –690/–613 bp and to modify Sp1 binding and repress Sp1-stimulated activity in hepatic stellate cells (39Miao K. Potter J.J. Anania F.A. Rennie-Tankersley L. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Compared with the proximalCol1a2 promoter, which binds many of the same factors, the position of YY1 binding sites immediately upstream of the TATA box seems to be unique to the Col1a1 promoter, where our studies show activation rather than repression of transcription by YY1. The observation that YY1 binding is critical for strong transcription by the Col1a1 promoter also suggests that its function is distinct from the inhibitory role played by this factor in vitamin D activation of the osteocalcin gene in osteoblasts (40Guo B. Aslam F. van Wijnen A.J. Roberts S.G. Frenkel B. Green M.R. DeLuca H. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or in IL-1β-mediated suppression of the skeletal α-actin gene in myocytes, which is associated with increased abundance and activity of YY1 via a site within a serum response element (41Patten M. Hartogensis W.E. Long C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21134-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 42Patten M. Wang W. Aminololama-Shakeri S. Burson M. Long C.S. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1341-1352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The observation that YY1 appears more important for p350 than for p130 activity suggests that YY1 may serve to couple the activities of transcription factors that bind upstream of the –84 bp position to the TBP-dependent core promoter. In this regard YY1 may serve as a facilitator protein, linking an enhancer to a core promoter (43Dorsett D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A somewhat similar situation has been reported recently for theIL1B core promoter, in which binding of the Spi-1/PU.1 transcription factor to the core promoter facilitates the activation by a C/EBPβ factor that binds to a distant enhancer via a protein-protein interaction (44Yang Z. Wara-aswapati N. Chen C. Tsukada J. Auron P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21272-21277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is possible that YY1 may serve a similar function in the Col1a1 gene through protein-protein interactions with one or more of the factors that bind to the sequences upstream of –84 bp and drive strong constitutive expression. These factors include CBF, Sp1, and NF-1, which bind to the region spanning –222 to –84 bp (5Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 6Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4065-4073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B.

A. 1994; 91: 9372-9376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 45Nehls M.C. Grapilon M.L. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and could conceivably cooperate with YY1.CBF appears to play a critical role in the upstreamCol1a1 sequence (7Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The factors of the CBF/NF-Y family and YY1 have often been observed to bind to overlapping sites in genes and to play a role in mutual modulation of activity (46Roy B. Li W.W. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28995-29002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the context of the Col1a1 –84/+13 bp core promoter, where the DNA sequences required for the binding of these factors have been deleted, disruption of YY1 interaction with either of its binding sites in the promoter affects the level of constitutive expression, but to a lesser extent than in the longer p350wt construct. Nevertheless, mutation of both YY1 sites abolishes the activities of both promoter constructs. Thus, YY1 is able to activate Col1a1 transcription in the absence of binding of factors, such as CBF and NF-1, to upstream sites, although at a significantly lower level. However, it is possible that YY1 could also interact with transcription factors present in nuclear extracts but not bound to DNA. Interestingly, binding activities of both CBF/NF-Y and YY1 may be inhibited independently by direct interaction with the Y-Box binding protein, YB-1 (47Li W.W. Hsiung Y.C. Wong V. Galvin K. Zhou Y.H. Shi Y. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). During terminal differentiation of myeloid cells, YY1 transactivates the gp91phox promoter by competing with the CCAAT displacement protein (48Jacobsen B.M. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29984-29993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These findings suggest possible mechanisms by which YY1 may function to release the promoter from inhibition by the upstream factor. YY1 has also been shown to interact with p300 and CBP, both of which have associated histone deacetylase activity and thereby cause chromatin to form a looser conformation permitting other factors to interact more efficiently with DNA (49Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 50Thomas M.J. Seto E. Gene. 1999; 236: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In the context of the endogenous Col1a1 promoter, this may allow upstream factors to more easily access and interact with the general transcription factors. Furthermore, it has been proposed that YY1, via multiple regulatory elements, may support association of the histone H4 gene with the nuclear matrix in a transient open chromatin state (51Last T.J. van Wijnen A.J. Birnbaum M.J. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).In our experiments, the p350m4 construct, containing the USE mutation (CCAGCT to CCAaCT) at position –45 bp upstream from the YY1A site, showed 30% decreased activity compared with the wild-type construct (p350wt), although the p130m4 construct expressed at a level the same as or higher than the p130wt. Our three-dimensional modeling of theCol1a1 gene promoter, using data derived from the crystal structures of TBP/TFIIB (52Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) and YY1 (53Houbaviy H.B. Usheva A. Shenk T. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13577-13582Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), did not show any striking evidence of an interaction between the USE at –45 bp and any amino acid residue of the YY1 protein. The oligonucleotide containing the USE mutation (m4) produced the same partial competition as wt2 for binding of YY1 to the wild-type (wt1) and the mTgTA probes (Fig. 5). These results, combined with the transfection data, indicate that the USE probably does not influence the interaction between YY1 and its binding sites in this promoter context. However, the YY1A site appeared to be critical for binding only to the short –56/–25 bp wt2 sequence (m1 and m2), possibly because the location of the YY1B site at the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide makes it unavailable for binding. This is further supported by the observation that the m3 mutant oligonucleotide containing the m1 mutations in the –56/–9 bp sequence competed as well as wt1 for YY1 binding to either the wild-type or mTgTA probe. Furthermore, the activity of p130m1/3 could be increased by over 4-fold by overexpression of YY1, whereas p130m7 with the YY1B site mutated was stimulated less than 2-fold. We conclude that YY1B is the preferential site for binding in the wt1 sequence, and that the USE does not contribute to binding of YY1 to either site. However, YY1-induced DNA bending via the YY1A site could bring factors, such as NF1, that are bound to upstream sites into close proximity to proteins bound to the TATA region, thus reducing the free energy requirement for these interactions, as has been shown on synthetic promoters (54Kim J. Shapiro D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Our functional analysis showing lack of activity of the mTgTA mutants indicates that Col1a1 expression requires binding of TBP/TFIID to the TATAAA motif. However, binding of YY1 to the –56/–9 bp probe containing the mTgTA mutation is increased compared with the wild-type, even though YY1 overexpression clearly increases the activities of the p130wt and p350wt constructs. To address this issue, we performed EMSA analysis under conditions optimal for TBP binding, and we found that recombinant TBP/TFIID bound strongly to the –56/–9 bp wt1 probe but not to the shorter wt2 probe that lacks the complete TATAAA motif. Recombinant YY1 could also bind when added at sufficiently high concentrations. Studies showing interactions with TFIIB via YY1 domains distinct from its transactivator function suggest that YY1 via the YY1B site may serve to stabilize the interactions between TBP/TFIID and TFIIB or other members of the transcription initiation complex (29Austen M. Lüscher B. Lüscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although further work will be required to define these interactions, our functional analysis of the YY1A and YY1B sites and cotransfection studies show clearly that YY1 is required for Col1a1 promoter activity and that both sites are important in the context of the intact promoter and upstream constitutive regulatory sites. We conclude that YY1 is necessary but not sufficient for transcriptional initiation of the constitutively expressed Col1a1 promoter and likely functions to integrate an upstream enhancer function with the core promoter. Type I collagen is the most abundant and well characterized collagen in vertebrates. It forms 90% of the organic mass of bone and tendon and is the major collagen of skin, ligaments, cornea, and many interstitial connective tissues. The helical type I collagen molecule is a heterotrimer composed of two α1 chains and one α2 chain, which are encoded by the Col1a1 andCol1a2 genes, respectively (1Vuorio E. de Crombrugghe B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 837-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). It is synthesized in large quantities by fibroblasts and osteoblasts and to a lesser extent by nearly all other cell types (2Mayne R. Koopman W.J. Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1997: 207-227Google Scholar). It is present in reticular fibers of most parenchymal tissues, such as lung, kidney, liver, muscle, and spleen, with the exception of hyaline cartilage, brain and vitreous humor (3von der Mark K. Seibel M. Robins S. Bilezekian J. Dynamics of Bone and Cartilage Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1999: 3-18Google Scholar). Besides its biomechanical properties, type I collagen is important as an adhesive substrate for many cells and plays a major role in tissue and organ development, cell migration, proliferation and differentiation, wound healing, tissue remodeling, and homeostasis (4Aumalley M. Gayraud B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 19: 253-265Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Because type I collagen is a ubiquitous molecule with many biological functions, the regulation of its expression has been well studied in the past twenty years. Several cis-acting elements within the Col1a1 and Col1a2 promoters have been identified that interact with transcription factors such as CCAAT-binding factor (CBF), Sp1, NF-1, and c-Krox, which are critical for regulation of constitutive expression (5Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 6Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell.

Although knowledge about the regulation of type I collagen synthesis during development and in pathological states, such as lung fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis, remains a major interest, the understanding of its regulation under normal physiological conditions is crucial. YY1 (10Shi Y."
https://openalex.org/W2040326257,"To understand the role of CCAAT-binding factor (CBF) in transcription in the context of chromatin-assembled DNA, we used regularly spaced nucleosomal DNA using topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) and α2(1) collagen promoter templates, which were subsequently reconstituted in an in vitro transcription reaction. Binding of CBF to the nucleosomal wild-type topo IIα promoter containing four CBF-binding sites disrupted the regular nucleosomal structure not only in the promoter region containing the CBF-binding sites but also in the downstream region over the transcription start site. In contrast, no nucleosome disruption was observed in a mutant topo IIα promoter containing mutations in all CBF-binding sites. Interestingly, CBF also activated transcription from nucleosomal wild-type topo IIα promoter. In this experiment, a promoter containing one wild-type CBF-binding site was activated very weakly, whereas the promoter containing mutations in all sites was not activated by CBF. A truncated CBF that lacked the glutamine-rich domains did not activate transcription from nucleosomal wild-type topo IIα promoter but disrupted the nucleosomal structure about as much as did the binding of full-length CBF. Two nucleosomal mouse α2(1) collagen promoter DNAs, one containing a single and the other containing four CBF- binding sites, were also reconstituted in anin vitro transcription reaction. None of the nucleosomal collagen promoters was activated by CBF. However, both of these collagen promoters were activated by CBF when the transcription reaction was performed using naked DNA templates. Binding of CBF to the nucleosomal collagen promoter containing four binding sites disrupted the nucleosomal structure, similarly as observed in the topo IIα promoter. Altogether this study indicates that CBF-mediated nucleosomal disruption occurred independently of transcription activation. It also suggests that specific promoter structure may play a role in the CBF-mediated transcription activation of nucleosomal topo IIα promoter template. To understand the role of CCAAT-binding factor (CBF) in transcription in the context of chromatin-assembled DNA, we used regularly spaced nucleosomal DNA using topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) and α2(1) collagen promoter templates, which were subsequently reconstituted in an in vitro transcription reaction. Binding of CBF to the nucleosomal wild-type topo IIα promoter containing four CBF-binding sites disrupted the regular nucleosomal structure not only in the promoter region containing the CBF-binding sites but also in the downstream region over the transcription start site. In contrast, no nucleosome disruption was observed in a mutant topo IIα promoter containing mutations in all CBF-binding sites. Interestingly, CBF also activated transcription from nucleosomal wild-type topo IIα promoter. In this experiment, a promoter containing one wild-type CBF-binding site was activated very weakly, whereas the promoter containing mutations in all sites was not activated by CBF. A truncated CBF that lacked the glutamine-rich domains did not activate transcription from nucleosomal wild-type topo IIα promoter but disrupted the nucleosomal structure about as much as did the binding of full-length CBF. Two nucleosomal mouse α2(1) collagen promoter DNAs, one containing a single and the other containing four CBF- binding sites, were also reconstituted in anin vitro transcription reaction. None of the nucleosomal collagen promoters was activated by CBF. However, both of these collagen promoters were activated by CBF when the transcription reaction was performed using naked DNA templates. Binding of CBF to the nucleosomal collagen promoter containing four binding sites disrupted the nucleosomal structure, similarly as observed in the topo IIα promoter. Altogether this study indicates that CBF-mediated nucleosomal disruption occurred independently of transcription activation. It also suggests that specific promoter structure may play a role in the CBF-mediated transcription activation of nucleosomal topo IIα promoter template. CCAAT-binding factor topoisomerase base pair polymerase chain reaction micrococcal nuclease The chromatin structure plays an important role in the regulation of transcription in eukaryotic cells. Generally the chromatin produces a repressive environment for transcription and the repression could occur at multiple steps of transcription activation (1Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 265-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Studies from many laboratories showed that specific DNA-binding proteins that bind to a particular promoter result in nucleosomal disruption or remodeling surrounding the promoter region, which then allows recruitment of coactivators and general transcription machinery to activate transcription (3Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5634-5644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kal A.J. Mahmoudi T. Zak N.B. Verrijzer C.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1058-1071PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tsukiyama T.

It is now recognized that the binding of multiple proteins may be required to disrupt the nucleosomal structure surrounding the promoter in a way that presets the promoter for subsequent transcription activation (6Pazin M.J.

The mammalian CCAAT-binding transcription factor CBF1/NF-Y is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of CBF-A, CBF-B, and CBF-C (9Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem.

A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). CBF-A and CBF-C contain histone-fold motifs that are similar to histones H2B and H2A, respectively (11Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11170-11174Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 12Baxevanis A.D. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). CBF contains two glutamine-rich transcription activation domains, one present in CBF-B and the other in CBF-C (13Coustry F. Maity S.N. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14485-14491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A survey of mammalian promoters showed that about 25% contain CBF-binding sites (14Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The CBF subunits are ubiquitously expressed in all mammalian tissues. To understand the in vivo function of CBF, we have recently inactivated CBF in mouse fibroblast cells by expressing a dominant-negative CBF-B mutant that inhibits DNA binding of CBF protein (15Hu Q. Maity S.N J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4435-4444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This study showed that the mutant but not the wild-type CBF-B retarded fibroblast cell growth. Analysis of the mRNA profile showed that the inactivation of CBF in fibroblasts decreased the expression of only a small number of cellular genes, many of which are regulated during cell growth. This study suggested that in cultured mammalian cells CBF may primarily be involved in transcription of growth-regulated genes. This is also further supported by the observation that the promoters of various growth-regulated genes such as thymidine kinase (16Arcot S.S. Flemington E.K. Deininger P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2343-2349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), E2F1 (17Hsiao K.-M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3822-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) contain multiple CBF-binding sites. Altogether this analysis implied that the in vivotranscription activity of only a subset of all promoters containing CBF-binding sites was affected by the inhibition of CBF binding in fibroblasts. In this regard it is important to mention that promoters of many tissue-specific genes that are not expressed in fibroblasts also contain CBF-binding sites. So it is conceivable that the in vivo function of CBF is dependent on the state of chromatin structure in the promoter. Indeed recent studies of the chromatin structure of the Xenopus hsp70 promoter showed that the two CBF-binding sites in this promoter were required to generate a nuclease-hypersensitive site in chromatin and played an important role in acetylation-responsive transcription in Xenopus oocyte nuclei (22Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This implied that CBF binding to this promoter altered the local chromatin architecture in the promoter so that recruitment of other transcription factors was facilitated. However, it remained to be determined whether such a function of CBF is specific to the hsp70 promoter or generally applicable to other promoters. It is possible that transcription of growth-regulated genes whose promoters contain multiple CBF-binding sites are highly dependent on CBF. The promoter of the mouse topoIIα gene has been recently isolated (18Adachi N. Kobayashi M. Koyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of this promoter is that it contains seven CBF-binding sites within the 210-bp upstream sequence of this gene and lacks a consensus TATA motif. The topo IIα is one of the two isoforms of DNA topoisomerase II enzyme which is a ubiquitous nuclear enzyme that can alter the topology of DNA and plays an important role during many cellular processes such as transcription, replication, recombination, and chromosome segregation. The expression of topo IIα is regulated during cell growth, with an activity that peaks at G2/M phase of the cell cycle; in contrast expression of the other isoform, topo IIβ, is unchanged during the cell cycle. Thus it is believed that the topo IIα isoform plays a major role during chromosome segregation in mitosis (18Adachi N. Kobayashi M. Koyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed the role of CBF in transcription of topo IIα promoters using in vitro reconstituted nucleosomal assembled DNA templates. We found that binding of CBF to the wild-type promoter disrupted regular nucleosomal structure not only at the CBF binding regions but also in the downstream promoter region. Interestingly, CBF also strongly activated transcription of nucleosomal topo IIα promoter even after nucleosomes were reconstituted with histone H1, which strongly repressed transcription. Altogether our results showed that transcription of nucleosomal topo IIα promoter was highly dependent on CBF-binding sites. Furthermore, we showed that although CBF activated transcription of collagen promoters in naked DNA template, it did not activate transcription of nucleosomal collagen promoter template. This study suggested that a promoter-specific mechanism plays a role in the CBF-dependent transcription activation of nucleosomal topo IIα template. The reporter plasmids FC1 and FC2 contained the sequence of the mouse α2(I) collagen promoter from pFC1 and pFC2 (23Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These promoter sequences were amplified by PCR and inserted between the KpnI and XhoI sites in the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The reporter plasmid PGL3-350 was constructed by inserting the sequence of the mouse α2(I) collagen promoter, amplified by PCR from pH 6 (24Goldberg H. Helaakoski T. Garrett L.A. Karsenty G. Pellegrino A. Lozano G. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19622-19630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), between the XhoI and HindIII sites in the pGL3-basic vector. To construct the 4CCAAT reporter plasmid, the sequence between −170 and +110 of the mouse topoisomerase IIα gene promoter (18Adachi N. Kobayashi M. Koyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and was cloned between the SacI and XhoI sites in the pGL3-basic vector. The reporter templates M1–4, W1, and W3, carrying mutations of the CBF-binding sites in the topo promoter, were obtained by introducing a point mutation (CCAAT to CCAAA) using PCR, as indicated in Fig. 1. Transient transfections were performed in NIH3T3 cells by using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). One day before transfection, NIH3T3 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well tissue culture plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. The cells, 50–80% confluent, were transfected for 5 h with 1.2 µg of reporter plasmid, 300 ng of internal control plasmid pSVβgal, and 6 µl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for each transfection following the procedure recommended by Life Technologies, Inc. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity was assayed as described (25Wood W.M. Kao M.Y. Gordon D.F. Ridway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14841-14847Google Scholar) using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (PharMingen). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using a Galactolight kit from Tropix. Each experiment was done in duplicate for two independent experiments. Full-length and truncated CBF proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase as described previously (13Coustry F. Maity S.N. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14485-14491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in suspension in Joklik medium supplemented with 5% calf serum at the density of 0.8 × 106 cells/ml. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar) and then were depleted of CBF as described previously (23Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by mixing with a DNA affinity resin in which the DNA sequence of the mouse α2(I) collagen gene promoter from −105 to −64 was covalently linked to Sepharose. The S190 extracts were prepared from 0- to 6-h Drosophila embryos (from Canton-S wild-type flies generously provided by W. Mattox, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) as described by Kadonaga and co-workers (27Bulger M. Kadonaga J. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar, 28Kamakaka R. Bulger M. Kadonaga J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These extracts were supplemented with exogenous core histones prepared from HeLa cells. HeLa cells were grown for 24 h at 37 °C in medium containing 8 mm sodium butyrate and then used for the preparation of chromatin-containing histones according to Wolffe and Hayes (29Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 314-329Google Scholar). The histones were fractionated following the procedure of Simon and Felsenfeld (30Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In a typical assembly reaction, 30 µl of S190 extract was incubated with 1.6 µg of purified core histones in RO buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at room temperature for 30 min. To this sample 10× ATP mix (300 mm creatine phosphate, 30 mm ATP, 1 µg of creatine phosphokinase, 26 mm MgCl2) was added and incubated for 5 min on ice. One microgram of plasmid DNA (preincubated or not with CBF for 20 min on ice) was then added, and chromatin assembly was allowed to proceed for 4.5 h at 27 °C. Purified histones H1, 0.4 or 0.8 µg (kindly provided by S. Majumder, M. D. Anderson, Houston, TX), were added in some reactions. The topo IIα promoter constructs and the α2(I) collagen promoter constructs, either as naked plasmid DNA or as chromatin-reconstituted DNA (taken as an aliquot of the chromatin assembly reaction mixture), were incubated with the transcription mix (1% polyvinyl alcohol, 1% polyethylene glycol, 1 mm NTPs, 5 mm MgCl2 final concentration), HeLa nuclear extract, and p120 plasmid DNA (23Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The templates were transcribed for 1 h at 27 °C. Transcription reactions were stopped with transcription stop buffer (0.4m NaOAc, pH 5.2, 1% SDS). RNAs were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation with glycogen as carrier. RNAs were analyzed by primer extension as described previously (23Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The chromatin was digested immediately after chromatin assembly with micrococcal nuclease (Mnase) for 5, 10, and 20 min or with DNase I for 10 min. The digestion was stopped by adding stop buffer (TE, EDTA, RNase I) for 15 min at 37 °C. This was followed by proteinase K treatment. The DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, chloroform extraction, and ammonium acetate/ethanol precipitation with glycogen as carrier. For Mnase ladder, DNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and in some cases transferred to a nylon membrane for Southern blot analysis. After prehybridization in hybridization buffer (6.66% SDS, 0.33 m NaPO4, pH 7.2), the membrane was hybridized with labeled oligonucleotides at 45 °C for 1 h. Washes were carried out in wash buffer (2× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS) briefly at room temperature, 15-min wash in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45 °C, and 15-min wash in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45 °C. Sequences of the various oligonucleotides used are as follows: plasmid-680 (5′-GATAGACGGTTTTTCGCCCTTTGACGTTGG-3′); plasmid-167 (5′-TCTCTATCGATAGGTACCGAGCTC-3′); prom-66 (5′-AAGACGATCTACGATTGGTTACTGCAAACAGAG-3′); prom+37 (5′-CTAGGGAAGCTCTCCTAACCG-3′); prom+109 (5′-AACCAGCGGCTCGAGCTGGGCGACCCGCGA-3′); plasmid+186 (5′-CATTCCGGTACTGTTGGTAAAGCC-3′); plasmid+207 (5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCC-3′); plasmid+283 (5′-GTATCTCTTCATAGCCTTATGCAG-3′). DNA, digested with either Mnase or DNase I, was subjected to linear amplification. The first reaction mixture was assembled by mixing in a hot-start PCR tube the reaction buffer with the labeled oligonucleotide and dNTPs. The PCR tube was heated at 90 °C for 30 s and cooled to room temperature to form the wax barrier. The second mix containing the DNA, the reaction buffer, and Vent (exo−) polymerase (New England Biolabs) was added to the PCR tube. The extension program was run in a PCR machine (4 min at 95 °C, 8 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 3 min of annealing at 45 °C for primer plasmid +283 and primer plasmid +186, 30 s at 74 °C, and hold at 18 °C). After NaOAc/EtOH precipitation, the DNA were analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel using a NaOAc gradient (top buffer, 0.5× TBE; bottom buffer, 1× TBE, 1m NaOAc). To analyze the role of CBF-binding sites in topo IIα promoter activity, we inserted the sequence −251 to +110 of the topoIIα gene in a vector 5′ to a luciferase reporter gene. Transfection of this construct into mouse fibroblast cells showed a high level of promoter activity (data not shown). Deletion of the promoter sequence from −170 to +110, which contains four CBF-binding sites, decreased promoter activity only about 20%. However, further deletion significantly reduced promoter activity. We used the −170 to +110 construct, which is designated here as 4CCAAT, as a wild-type background to introduce mutations into the CBF-binding sites. Each of the CBF-binding sites in this construct was mutated by single nucleotide substitution mutations from CCAAT to CCAAA or ATTGG to TTTGG (Fig. 1A). A promoter construct containing mutations in all four CBF-binding sites (M1–4) showed a 50-fold decrease in promoter activity. The promoter containing a single CBF-binding site (W1 or W3) retained significant promoter activity but was 3–4-fold lower than that of the 4CCAAT construct (Fig. 1B). This result indicated that the activity of the topo IIα promoter is highly dependent on CBF-binding sitesin vivo. In this regard it is important to note that not all promoters containing a CBF-binding site are dependent to the same extent on their CBF-binding site. For example, we showed previously that a mutation in the single CBF-binding site of the mouse α2(1) collagen promoter resulted in only a 4-fold decrease of promoter activity (24Goldberg H. Helaakoski T. Garrett L.A. Karsenty G. Pellegrino A. Lozano G. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19622-19630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the dependence of promoter activity on CBF-binding sites may increase with the number of CBF sites in the promoter, we constructed a promoter that contains four CBF-binding sites placed before the minimal promoter of the α2(1) collagen gene, named here as FC1. A mutant promoter, FC2, in which the four CBF-binding sites of FC1 were mutated by single nucleotide substitution, was also constructed (Fig. 1A). Previously, using an in vitro reconstituted transcription system, we showed that CBF strongly activated the transcription of the FC1 but not the FC2 promoter (23Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In DNA transfection experiments the promoter activity of FC1 was only 4-fold higher than FC2, similar to the collagen promoter containing a single CBF-binding site, and the overall promoter activity of FC1 was about 8–10-fold lower than the 4CCAAT promoter of topo IIα (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that the presence of multiple CBF-binding sites in the promoter does not always contribute higher dependence of promoter activity to the CBF sites. Recent studies showed that the two CBF-binding sites in the Xenopus hsp70 promoter play a role that presets the chromatin structure, a process that is required for transcription activation by heat shock (22Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This suggests that the CBF-dependent transcription activation in mammalian cells may be due, at least in part, to CBF-mediated nucleosome disruption, which may in turn facilitate recruitment of general transcription factors to form a preinitiation complex. To test this possibility, we studied the interaction of recombinant CBF with nucleosomal promoter DNA reconstituted in vitro. The DNA templates containing wild-type and mutant topo IIα promoters were incubated with Drosophila embryo extracts and purified human core histones and an ATP-regenerating system as described by Kamakakaet al. (28Kamakaka R. Bulger M. Kadonaga J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Formation of nucleosomes in the DNA template was verified by Mnase digestion analysis. This showed formation of DNA ladders of 146 bp and multiples of 146 bp, thus indicating that regularly spaced nucleosomal arrays had formed on the DNA template similar to that found in vivo in mammalian or other eukaryotic cells (Fig. 2B, upper panel, lanes 1–3 and 10–12). Addition of CBF to the incubation mixture before (lanes 7–9 and 16–18) or after formation of nucleosomes (lanes 4–6 and13–15) did not change the overall nucleosome pattern of the DNA template. To monitor specifically the nucleosome structure over the promoter sequence, we performed a Southern blot analysis, hybridizing the Mnase-digested DNA with a labeled oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the +37-bp region in the topo IIα promoter (see Fig.2A). This showed that all DNA fragments generated with wild-type nucleosomal DNA, formed without CBF, hybridized strongly with the oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 2B, lower panel, lanes 1–3). This indicated that the regular nucleosomal structure was present over the promoter region probed with the oligonucleotide. In contrast, incubation of CBF with the nucleosomal wild-type DNA significantly reduced hybridization (lanes 4–6), and more strikingly, preincubation of CBF before formation of the nucleosomes resulted in an almost complete loss of hybridization (lanes 7–9) of the oligonucleotide with the DNA ladders. Incubation of CBF with nucleosomal mutant DNA, however, did not cause any change in hybridization efficiency of the oligonucleotides with the DNA ladders (lanes 10–18). Recently it was reported (31Caretti G. Motta M.C. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8591-8603Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that CBF-A/CBF-C interacts with the histone H3-H4 complex in vitro. However, incubation of CBF-A/CBF-C or CBF-B alone with the wild-type DNA before or after nucleosome formation did not result in any alteration in hybridization efficiency of the oligonucleotides with the DNA ladders (data not shown). This result indicated that specific binding of CBF to the CCAAT motifs in the topo IIα promoter strongly disrupted the regular nucleosomal structure over the nucleosomal promoter region. To monitor the extent of disruption, we performed a Southern blot analysis of Mnase-digested nucleosomal wild-type and mutant DNA, which was formed after preincubation with CBF, with a series of oligonucleotides corresponding to different regions of the promoter and vector DNA (see Fig. 2A). Hybridization of each oligonucleotide with Mnase-digested wild-type or mutant nucleosomal DNA generated without CBF showed patterns of hybridization to DNA ladders that were identical to those observed in Fig. 2B, lower panel, lanes 1–3 and 10–12 (data not shown). All oligonucleotides also hybridized almost equally with the DNA ladders of mutant nucleosomal DNA preincubated with CBF (Fig. 2C, lower panel, lanes 1–18). In contrast, hybridization of the +109 and +207 oligonucleotides to the DNA ladder of wild-type nucleosomal DNA preincubated with CBF was very significantly reduced, whereas hybridization of −66 and +283 oligonucleotides was reduced modestly. The same DNA ladders, however, hybridized very efficiently with the −680 and −167 oligonucleotides. This indicated that binding of CBF to the nucleosomal topo IIα promoter disrupted the regular nucleosomal structure over the promoter region from −66 to +207. To monitor more precisely the extent of CBF-mediated nucleosomal disruption, we analyzed the Mnase-digested nucleosomal DNA with the primer extension method using a radiolabeled primer that hybridized at a downstream promoter region (Fig.3A). Since Mnase cleaves DNA outside of and not within the nucleosome, the primer extension bands should correspond to various nucleosomal positions over the promoter DNA. Our comparison of primer extension bands of wild-type nucleosomal DNA generated with or without CBF showed that binding of CBF protected promoter DNA and augmented Mnase cleavage (lanes 1 and2). The protected Mnase cleavage regions were located over the CBF-binding sites from positions −66 to −117, whereas regions of augmented cleavage are located both upstream and downstream of CBF-binding sites. Most notably, binding of CBF strongly increased Mnase cleavage at the region containing the start of transcription at +1, consistent with the observation in Fig. 2C. In contrast, incubation of CBF with nucleosomal promoter DNA containing mutations in all four CBF sites (M1–4) did not result in either protection or augmentation of Mnase cleavage in the promoter region (lanes 5 and 6). However, incubation of CBF with nucleosomal promoter DNA containing a single wild-type CBF site (W1) located at position −26 resulted in only a small increase of Mnase cleavage over the promoter region at the start of transcription (lanes 3and 4), indicating that the multiple CBF-binding sites are required for strong disruption of nucleosomal structure over the start of the transcription region. Overall, the results of Fig. 3Aindicate that CBF specifically disrupted the nucleosomal structure over the topo IIα promoter region from approximately −200"
https://openalex.org/W2016109730,"We have previously shown that carboxymethyl dextran benzylamide (CMDB7), a heparin-like molecule, inhibits the growth of tumors xenografted in nude mice, angiogenesis, and metastasis by altering the binding of angiogenic growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor β, and fibroblast growth factor 2, to their specific receptors. In this study, we explore the effect of CMDB7 on the most specific angiogenic growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165). We demonstrate here that CMDB7 inhibits the mitogenic effect of VEGF165 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUV-ECs) by preventing the VEGF165-induced VEGF receptor-2 (KDR) autophosphorylation and consequently a specific intracellular signaling. In competition experiments, the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to HUV-ECs is inhibited by CMDB7 with an IC50 of 2 µm. Accordingly, CMDB7 inhibits the cross-linking of125I-VEGF165 to the surface of HUV-ECs, causing the disappearance of both labeled complexes, 170–180 and 240–250 kDa. We show that CMDB7 increases the electrophoretic mobility of VEGF165, thus evidencing formation of a stable complex with this factor. Moreover, CMDB7 reduces the125I-VEGF165 binding to coated heparin-albumin and prevents a heparin-induced increase in iodinated VEGF165 binding to soluble 125I-KDR-Fc chimera. Concerning KDR, CMDB7 has no effect on 125I-KDR-Fc electrophoretic migration and does not affect labeled KDR-Fc binding to coated heparin-albumin. In the presence of VEGF165,125I-KDR-Fc binding to heparin is enhanced, and under these conditions, CMDB7 interferes with KDR binding. These data indicate that CMDB7 effectively inhibits the VEGF165activities by interfering with heparin binding to VEGF165and VEGF165·KDR complexes but not by direct interactions with KDR. We have previously shown that carboxymethyl dextran benzylamide (CMDB7), a heparin-like molecule, inhibits the growth of tumors xenografted in nude mice, angiogenesis, and metastasis by altering the binding of angiogenic growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor β, and fibroblast growth factor 2, to their specific receptors. In this study, we explore the effect of CMDB7 on the most specific angiogenic growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165). We demonstrate here that CMDB7 inhibits the mitogenic effect of VEGF165 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUV-ECs) by preventing the VEGF165-induced VEGF receptor-2 (KDR) autophosphorylation and consequently a specific intracellular signaling. In competition experiments, the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to HUV-ECs is inhibited by CMDB7 with an IC50 of 2 µm.

In the presence of VEGF165,125I-KDR-Fc binding to heparin is enhanced, and under these conditions, CMDB7 interferes with KDR binding. These data indicate that CMDB7 effectively inhibits the VEGF165activities by interfering with heparin binding to VEGF165and VEGF165·KDR complexes but not by direct interactions with KDR. vascular endothelial growth factor fibroblast growth factor human umbilical vein endothelial cell phosphate-buffered saline fetal calf serum Neovascularization is essential for tumor growth and is regulated by tumor cell-produced factors that have mitogenic and chemotactic effects on vascular endothelial cells (1Folkman J.J.

Several studies have recently indicated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A)1 expression in tumor cells may play a major role in tumor angiogenesis (3Dvorak H.F. Sioussat T.M. Brown L.F.

Curiel D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8795-8800Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). VEGF-A was observed in vivo to act as a potent angiogenic factor and blood vessel permeabilizing agent (7Keck P.M. Hauser S.D. Krivi G. Sanzo K. Warren T. Feder J. Connolly D.T. Science. 1989; 246: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, 8Neufeld G. Tessier S. Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Levi B.Z. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). VEGF-A is an homodimeric glycoprotein, the monomer of which exists in five forms, VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206, as a result of alternative splicing from a single gene (9Ferrara N. Davis-Smith T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). These various isoforms of VEGF-A differ in their affinity for heparin and extracellular matrix components. VEGF-A forms induce endothelial cell proliferation and migration and are essential for embryonic vessel development (10Riseau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4864) Google Scholar). The best characterized VEGF-A is the heparin-binding 165-amino acid-long form, VEGF165 (11Ferrara N. Houck K. Jakeman L. Leung D.W. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar, 12Peretz D. Gitay-Goren H. Safran M. Kimmel N. Gospodarowicz D. Neufeld G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The binding of VEGF165 to its receptors requires cell surface heparan sulfates and can be modulated by the addition of exogenous heparin (13Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two tyrosine kinase receptors have been identified as VEGF-A receptors, the VEGFR-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase, Flt-1) (14DeVries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara F. Willian T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar) and the VEGFR-2 (kinase domain region (KDR) in human, and the homologous fetal liver kinase-1 (Flk-1) in mouse) (15Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Arme D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). These transmembrane proteins with apparent molecular masses of about 200 and 220 kDa, respectively, have been shown to bind VEGF-A with high affinity. Both KDR/Flk-1 and Flt-1 contain seven immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular regions and large insert sequences in their intracellular kinase-domains (16Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an additional binding site, neuropilin-1 (NRP1), with a molecular mass of about 130 kDa, was identified and shown to be expressed on the surface of endothelial and tumor cells. NRP1 can act as a co-receptor, forming a complex with VEGFR-2 and thus enhancing VEGF165-induced activities mediated by VEGFR-2 (17Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). Several molecules with anti-angiogenic activity have been described in the last decade (18Fotsis T. Zhang Y. Pepper M.S. Adlercreutz H. Montesano R. Nawroth P. Schweigerer L. Nature. 1994; 368: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 19Polakowski I.J. Lewis M.K. Muthukkaruppan V.R. Erdman B. Kubai L. Auerbach R. Am J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 507-517PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in action of most of these molecules are unclear, but several of these angiogenesis inhibitors were found to be either heparin analogs or heparin-binding substances (20Taylor S. Folkman J. Nature. 1982; 297: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 21Jouan V. Canron X. Alemany M. Caen J.P. Quentin G. Plouet J. Bikfalvi A. Blood. 1999; 94: 984-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations and recent results showing that heparin-degrading enzymes can inhibit the tumor angiogenesis (22Sasisekharan R. Moses M.A. Nugent M.A. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) suggest that heparan sulfates may play an important regulatory role in the angiogenic processes. Carboxymethyl dextran benzylamide (CMDB7) is a noncytotoxic substituted dextran. Its chemical derivatization involves statistical distribution of chemical groups linked to the 1–6 glucosyl units forming the macromolecular chains (23Chaubet F. Champion J. Maı̈ga R. Maurey S. Jozefonvicz J. Carbohydr. Polym. 1995; 28: 145-152Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CMDB7 mimics some properties of heparin, such as the interactions with angiogenic growth factors, including FGF2 (24Bagheri-Yarmand R. Liu J.F. Ledoux D. Morère J.F. Crépin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Bagheri-Yarmand R. Kourbali Y. Mabilat C. Morère J.F. Martin A. Lu H. Soria C. Jozefonvicz J. Crépin M. Br. J.

Crépin M. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar), but it has no anticoagulant or anticomplement effects (27Mauzac M. Maillet F. Jozefonvicz J. Kazatchkine M.D. Biomaterials. 1985; 6: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Crepon B. Maillet F. Kazatchkine M.D. Jozefonvicz J. Biomaterials. 1987; 8: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have shown that CMDB7 specifically inhibits the mitogenic effect and receptor binding of FGF2, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor β, and thus prevents the endothelial cell proliferation and migration as observed in vitro (25Bagheri-Yarmand R. Kourbali Y. Mabilat C. Morère J.F. Martin A. Lu H. Soria C. Jozefonvicz J. Crépin M. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, CMDB7 inhibits in vitro the growth of breast tumor cells (24Bagheri-Yarmand R. Liu J.F. Ledoux D. Morère J.F. Crépin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Bagheri-Yarmand R. Kourbali Y. Mabilat C. Morère J.F. Martin A. Lu H. Soria C. Jozefonvicz J. Crépin M. Br. J.

Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar) xenograft growth in nude mice is blocked by CMDB7 treatment. In parallel, we observed the decrease of angiogenesis within these tumors. Furthermore, CMDB7 is able to inhibit by 88% the incidence of lung micrometastasis from breast carcinoma MDA-MB435 cell implants in the mammary fad pad of nude mice (29Bagheri-Yarmand R. Kourbali Y. Rath A.M. Vassy R. Martin A. Jozefonvicz J. Soria C. Lu H. Crépin M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 507-510PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we evaluated for the first time, in our knowledge, the possible effects of CMDB7 on activities of the most specific angiogenic growth factor, VEGF165. We show that CMDB7 inhibits (a) mitogenic activity of VEGF165on endothelial cells, (b) VEGF165 binding to its specific receptors, and (c) VEGF165 signaling by KDR in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We further demonstrate the CMDB7 ability to bind to VEGF165 and to compete for heparin binding to VEGF165 and VEGF165·KDR complexes. A water-soluble dextran derivative (CMDB7) was prepared as previously described (23Chaubet F. Champion J. Maı̈ga R. Maurey S. Jozefonvicz J. Carbohydr. Polym. 1995; 28: 145-152Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Its chemical composition, determined by acidimetric titration and elementary analysis of nitrogen, is 0% dextran, 70% carboxymethyl and 30% benzylamide. Average molecular weight was estimated as 80,000 g/mol. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUV-ECs) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). HUV-ECs were routinely grown in M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. Culture medium is supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (all obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.). HUV-ECs were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well into 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon, Strasbourg, France) in M199–10% FCS. After 24 h, the cells were growth-arrested by serum starvation for another 24 h and then incubated for 72 h with VEGF165 (R&D Systems Europe, Abingdon, United Kingdom) at various concentrations (60–500 pm) or at a fixed VEGF165concentration of 250 pm in the presence or absence of CMDB7 at various concentrations. Cells were washed with PBS, dissociated with 0.025% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) and counted using a Coulter counter (Coultronics, Margency, France). All experiments were performed in triplicate and data illustrate the mean cell numbers ± S.E. provided from one representative of three independent experiments. 5 × 105 HUV-ECs were plated into six-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) in M199–10% FCS. After 24 h, the cells were washed in PBS and then incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed with PBS and then incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate for 15 min at 37 °C. The media were then removed, and the cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with the serum-deprived medium containing 1.2 nm VEGF165 in the presence or absence of 40 µm CMDB7. The incubations were terminated by aspiration of the medium, two washings with cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, followed by the addition of 200 µl of cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Igepal CA-630, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1/10 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) at 4 °C for 10 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 14,000 × g and the protein concentrations of soluble fraction were determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Sigma). Cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (R&D Systems). Immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies: an anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) (1:1000 dilution), and an anti-KDR rabbit polyclonal (Sigma) (1:500 dilution) for 1 h and then washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20. Antigen-antibody complexes were revealed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For displacement binding assays, HUV-ECs were grown to 80% confluence in 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon). After an overnight incubation in serum-free medium and two washings with ice-cold binding buffer (PBS/0.2% gelatin), the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in 0.3 ml of binding buffer containing 7 pm125I-VEGF165 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence or absence of CMDB7 at various concentrations. Incubation was terminated by gently removing the medium and washing the cell monolayer three times with ice-cold binding buffer. The bound radioactivity was measured using a γ-counter (LKB 1261 Multigamma) after cell lysis in 0.3 ml of 0.5 n NaOH for 30 min. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of an excess (5 nm) of unlabeled VEGF165 (R&D Systems). For the Scatchard analysis, the binding was accomplished using increasing concentrations (0–5000 pm) of unlabeled VEGF165 (R&D Systems) and 7 pm125I-VEGF165 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 2 h. Parallel experiments were performed in the presence of 10 and 40 µm CMDB7. Each curve was analyzed according to the Scatchard procedure or by fitting to a logistic curve. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and were repeated at least three times. Subconfluent cell cultures in six-well plates (Falcon) were washed twice with binding buffer (PBS/0.2% gelatin) and then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 100 pm125I-VEGF165(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled VEGF165 (R&D Systems) or 40 µmCMDB7. Cells were then washed with ice-cold binding buffer and cross-linked for 15 min at room temperature with 0.5 mmdisuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce Perbio Science France, Bezons, France). The reaction was quenched by addition of an excess of 1 mTris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 2 min. Cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1/10 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) for 10 min. Cell extracts were then clarified by centrifugation, and supernatants mixed with 2× sample buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) were boiled for 3 min before loading on a SDS-6% polyacrylamide gel. After sample running, gels were dried and exposed (7–20 days) to a Kodak X-Omat film at −80 °C for autoradiography. The CMDB7 effects on the electrophoretic mobility of 125I-VEGF165(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 125I-KDR-Fc (labeled in laboratory) were analyzed by nondenaturant agarose gel electrophoresis as described by Lee and Lander (30Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). After a 1-h incubation of125I-VEGF165 (105cpm/3 ng) or125I-KDR-Fc (105cpm/3 ng) with CMDB7 at various concentrations at 4 °C, the mixtures (10 µl) were analyzed in 1% agarose gel at pH 7.0 using running buffer containing 125 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropane sulfonic acid, 6% sucrose, and 0.5% (w/v) bromphenol, and typical electrophoresis was performed at 60–70 V for 2 h. Gels were dried and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). If the negatively charged CMDB7 binds to essentially electrobasic VEGF165 or to KDR, an anodic shift in the migration of the tracer should be observed. The surface of flat-bottomed polystyrene wells (Disposable Immulon 1 Remowawell, Dynatech, Cambridge, MA) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 200 µl of 2 µg/ml anti-Fc IgG (Sigma) in PBS buffer. The nonspecific interactions were saturated with PBS containing 0.2% gelatin and 0.01% Tween-20 (PGT buffer) for an additional overnight at 4 °C. Blocking buffer was then removed, and the plates were washed three times with 300 µl of PGT buffer. Then, 2 µg/ml purified recombinant human KDR-Fc chimera (R&D Systems), 40 pm125I-VEGF165 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and unlabeled VEGF165 (R&D Systems) at increasing concentrations (0–2500 pm) were added successively to a final volume of 200 µl in PGT buffer. The incubations were performed in the presence or absence of CMDB7 or heparin (Sigma). After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, wells were washed three times with 300 µl of PGT buffer, and the radioactivity of each well measured in a γ-counter (LKB 1261 Multigamma). Heparin-albumin (Sigma) at concentration 17 µg/ml in 100 µl of PBS was coated on the surface of polystyrene wells (Disposable Immulon 1 Remowawell) as described above for anti-Fc IgG. The binding assays to coated heparin-albumin were performed in total volume of 90 µl overnight at 4 °C. We studied the binding of 40 pm125I-VEGF165 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence or absence of CMDB7 and the binding of 125I-KDR (1.5 × 105cpm/5 ng) in the presence or absence of CMDB7 in combination or not with unlabeled VEGF165 (R&D Systems). After washing, the radioactivity in each well was measured in a γ-counter (LKB 1261 Multigamma). Radioiodination was carried out utilizing the chloramine B method. Briefly, 5 µg of carrier-free human recombinant KDR-Fc chimera (R&D Systems) was suspended in 45 µl of 10× PBS-0.1% Triton X-100. To the reaction tube, 0.5 µCi of Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, followed by one IODO-BEAD (Pierce Perbio Science). Incubation was performed for 12 min and then stopped by addition of 20 µl of 2 mg/ml KI, followed by 430 µl of PBS-0.05% bovine serum albumin. The mixture was transferred to preequilibrated PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for separation from free iodine. The specific activity of iodinated KDR was 3 × 107cpm/µg. The radiolabeled KDR was used to perform a KDR binding to heparin-albumin and affinity electrophoresis in agarose. The inhibitory effect of CMDB7 was evaluated using HUV-ECs. First, we established the optimal VEGF165 concentration at which mitogenic effect on those endothelial cells can be observed. HUV-EC number was increased by VEGF165 at concentrations from 60 to 500 pm, with a maximal 3-fold augmentation observed in the presence of 250 pm VEGF165 (Fig.1A). CMDB7 (0.1–20 µm) inhibited the 250 pmVEGF165-induced proliferation of HUV-ECs in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 2 µm (Fig. 1 B). Starting from concentration 5 µm, CMDB7 completely prevented the VEGF165effect on HUV-ECs (Fig. 1 B). In the absence of VEGF165, no significant effect of CMDB7 on the cell growth was observed. Next, we asked whether CMDB7 is able to inhibit the VEGF165 signal transduction in HUV-ECs. Binding of VEGF-A results in the conformational changes in KDR and Flt-1, followed by their dimerization and autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues (31Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar), inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of other numerous proteins, as observed in bovine brain capillary endothelial cells (32D'Angelo G. Struman I. Martial J. Weiner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6374-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and porcine aortic endothelial cells (33Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). HUV-EC treatment with VEGF165 for 5 min induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with apparent molecular masses of 210 and 140 kDa (Fig.2A, lane 2), as revealed by Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. These two bands were not detected in extracts from control cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) or in cells treated with 40 µm CMDB7 alone (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). CMDB7 prevented the VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both 210- and 140-kDa bands (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). To confirm the identity of the phosphorylated proteins, a parallel immunoblot was probed with specific antibodies against KDR and Flt-1. The 210-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated band was recognized by the antibody against KDR (Fig. 2 B) but not by antibody against Flt-1 (data not shown). These two antibodies did not stain a 140-kDa band (data not shown), suggesting that it does not corresponds to VEGF receptors. This protein probably participates in down-stream signaling events (32D'Angelo G. Struman I. Martial J. Weiner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6374-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 33Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The KDR antibody revealed no changes in staining intensity with all treatments (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating that the loss in tyrosine phosphorylation was not due to decrease in KDR protein quantity. These results show that the inhibitory effect of CMDB7 on VEGF-induced HUV-EC growth is accompanied by a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR by VEGF. Because CMDB7 inhibited the VEGF165-induced KDR phosphorylation, we tested the effect of CMDB7 on the specific binding of VEGF165 to the HUV-ECs. First, the cells were incubated with radiolabeled VEGF165 at a fixed concentration and CMDB7 at increasing concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 µm. Fig. 3Ashows that CMDB7 decreases the 125I-VEGF165binding to its receptors in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 2 µm. For the Scatchard analysis (Fig. 3 B), the cells were incubated with radiolabeled VEGF165 at a fixed concentration and unlabeled VEGF165 at increasing concentrations in the presence or absence of CMDB7. Under control conditions (in the absence of CMDB7), two classes of high-affinity binding sites were observed, in agreement with Soker et al. (34Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and Li et al. (35Li S. Peck-Radosavljevic M. Koller E. Koller F. Kaserer K. Kreil A. Kapiotis S. Hamwi A. Weich H.A. Valent P. Angelberger P. Dudczak R. Virgolini I. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The higher affinity class is characterized by a K d of 326 pm and the lower one by a K d of 27 nm. The addition of CMDB7 does not affect the ligand binding affinity of the two site classes, but it results in a dose-dependent decrease in lower affinity site number. In the presence of 40 µm CMDB7,125I-VEGF165 is displaced from all lower affinity receptors. These data show that CMDB7 inhibits the binding of VEGF165 to HUV-ECs. To better characterize the VEGF165 binding sites on HUV-ECs affected by CMDB7, the affinity-labeling experiments were performed. Fig. 4, lane 1, shows two bands with apparent molecular masses of 240–250 and 170–180 kDa. The addition of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled VEGF165 prevented the formation of these bands (Fig. 4,lane 2), evidencing their specificity. CMDB7 (40 µm) decreased the intensity of two complexes (Fig. 4,lane 3), demonstrating an inhibition of VEGF165binding to its specific receptors with apparent molecular masses of 200–210 and 130–140 kDa, calculated by subtraction of the molecular mass of VEGF165. The first protein corresponds to KDR monomer. Like Tao et al. (36Tao Q. Backer M.V. Backer J.M. Terman B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21916-21923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we did not detect the complexes with KDR dimers. This observation can be explained by the inefficiency of cross-linker used in our study to covalently bind KDR dimers. In order to explore whether CMDB7 is able to interfere directly with VEGF165, we used an affinity-electrophoretic technique (ACE). Fig.5, lane 1, shows that125I-VEGF165, being weakly cationic under nondenaturing conditions, remains close to loading well. The presence of negatively charged CMDB7 increases the migration of labeled growth factor evidencing a formation of125I-VEGF165·CMDB7 complex. This shift toward the anode is already visible in the presence of 1 µmCMDB7 (Fig. 5, lane 2), and migration distances increase with enhanced CMDB7 concentrations (Fig. 5, lanes 3–5). These results demonstrate that CMDB7 binds directly to VEGF165. To test whether CMDB7 could alter the VEGF165 binding to heparin, we have measured the binding of125I-VEGF165 to coated heparin-albumin in the presence of CMDB7 at various concentrations (Fig.6). Specific125I-VEGF165 binding to heparin-albumin was inhibited by heparin with an IC50 of 5 µg/ml (data not shown) and in the presence of 10 µm CMDB7 by 44% (Fig.6). These results show that CMDB7 competes with heparin for heparin binding to VEGF165. To study the interactions of CMDB7 with VEGF receptors, we radioiodinated the KDR-Fc chimera. The possible direct interactions of CMDB7 and KDR were explored using an affinity-electrophoretic technique (Fig.7). 125I-KDR-Fc remains close to the loading well (Fig. 7, lane 1), and its migration does not change in the presence of CMDB7 at concentrations 2.5 to 20 µm (lanes 2–5), indicating the absence of CMDB7·KDR complexes. To study the effect of CMDB7 on heparin binding to KDR, we have used coated heparin-albumin (Fig.8). The binding of 125I-KDR to heparin was not affected by 0.1, 1, or 10 µmCMDB7.Figure 8CMDB7 has no effect on heparin binding to KDR. Polystyrene wells were coated with heparin-albumin. The binding of 40 pm125I-KDR-Fc was performed in the presence or absence of 0.1, 1.0, and 10 µm CMDB7 overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the radioactivity in each well was measured in a γ-counter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, we studied the CMDB7 effects on formation of VEGF165·KDR·heparin complexes. Fig.9A shows that125I-KDR-Fc binding to the coated heparin-albumin is enhanced by VEGF165 in a dose-dependent manner. This indicates that under our experimental conditions, we can reproduce, at least in part, the formation of triple complexes. Although CMDB7 has no effect on KDR-heparin interactions (Fig. 8), it does efficiently inhibit the 125I-KDR binding to heparin in the presence of 3 nm VEGF165 (Fig.9 B). This inhibitory effect is dose-dependent and significantly measured at CMDB7 concentration of 0.1 µm. Further support for CMDB7 action on VEGF165·KDR·heparin complexes was supplied by results of another experimental design. This time, the KDR-Fcs were coated and the binding of 125I-VEGF165 was measured in the presence or absence of heparin and/or CMDB7 (Fig.10). In the presence of heparin, when only KDR and VEGF165 are present, 40 µm CMDB7 has no effect on of 125I-VEGF165 binding. In the presence of 0.1 µg/ml heparin, the VEGF165 binding is augmented in agreement with the findings of Kaplan et al.(37Kaplan J.B. Sridharan L. Zaccardi J. Dougher-Vermazen M. Terman B., I. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, 40 µm CMDB7 is able to inhibit the heparin-induced increase in125I-VEGF165 binding. These data suggest that CMDB7 competes for heparin binding to VEGF165·KDR complexes. Displacement of heparin by CMDB7 causes the inhibition of both 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-KDR binding.Figure 10Effect of CMDB7 on the VEGF165binding to KDR receptors. Polystyrene plates were coated with KDR-Fc overnight at 4 °C and blocked with 0.2% gelatin, 0.01% Tween-20 in PBS.

Maretzek A.F. Goldberg I. Horowitz A. Degani H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5511-5514PubMed Google Scholar). As the high expression of VEGF and its receptors have been closely correlated to tumor vascularity, progression, and metastasis (42Weidner N. Semple J.P. Welch W.R. Folkman J. N. Eng. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (5356) Google Scholar, 43Takahashi Y. Kitadai Y. Bucana C.D. Cleary K.R. Ellis L.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3964-3968PubMed Google Scholar), targeting of VEGF/VEGF-receptors is an excellent anti-angiogenic strategy. Different anti-VEGF strategies have been used with success, but direct targeting of the heparin binding sites on VEGF and/or KDR by a heparin analog have never been proposed. In this study, we demonstrated that the dextran derivative CMDB7 is capable of neutralizing the VEGF165 activities by direct interactions with VEGF165 and by heparin displacement from VEGF165 and VEGF165·KDR complexes. We have shown here that CMDB7 efficiently inhibited the VEGF165-induced proliferation of endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, CMDB7 inhibited the formation of 125I-VEGF165·receptor complexes, namely, 240–250- and 170–180-kDa complexes containing KDR and NRP1 receptors, respectively. This is in agreement with the findings of Soker et al. (34Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), who reported that VEGF binds to endothelial cells via these two receptors. In addition, by studying a receptor autophosphorylation, we demonstrated that CMDB7 suppressed the VEGF165 signal transduction in endothelial cells. These findings are in agreement with our previous results showing that CMDB7 inhibited in vitro the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells and inhibited in vivo the tumor angiogenesis (24Bagheri-Yarmand R. Liu J.F. Ledoux D. Morère J.F. Crépin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Bagheri-Yarmand R. Kourbali Y. Mabilat C. Morère J.F.

Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar). Concerning the mechanism of action, we observed that CMDB7 displaced the VEGF165 from its specific binding sites on HUV-ECs. It is noteworthy that CMDB7 was originally designed as a heparin analog and might therefore behave as an antagonist or partial agonist. Heparin can interfere with VEGF165 action either by binding to a specific domain on VEGF165 (44Dougher A.M. Wasserstrom H. Torley L. Shridaran L. Westdock P. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Anderberg R. Lyman S. Linhardt R.J. Kaplan J. Terman B.I. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 257-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or by interacting with its cellular binding sites, KDR or NRP1 (44Dougher A.M. Wasserstrom H. Torley L. Shridaran L. Westdock P. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Anderberg R. Lyman S. Linhardt R.J. Kaplan J. Terman B.I. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 257-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Consequently, CMDB7 might affect both the ligand and its cellular binding sites. We show here that CMDB7 interacts directly with VEGF165 (Fig. 5). This is in agreement with our previous findings that CMDB7 inhibited the activity of other heparin binding growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor β, FGF2, and FGF4, by binding them and thus altering the conformation of ligand·receptor complexes (24Bagheri-Yarmand R. Liu J.F. Ledoux D. Morère J.F. Crépin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Bagheri-Yarmand R. Kourbali Y. Mabilat C. Morère J.F.

Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, we did not observe any effect of CMDB7 on heparin-binding growth factors, including EGF and IGF1 (24Bagheri-Yarmand R. Liu J.F. Ledoux D. Morère J.F. Crépin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Bagheri-Yarmand R. Kourbali Y. Mabilat C. Morère J.F.

Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar). Because of structural similarity to heparin, CMDB7 could bind to VEGF165 requiring the heparin binding sites. Our results support this hypothesis as we demonstrate the dose-displacement of VEGF165 from heparin-albumin by CMDB7 (Fig. 6). This suggests that CMDB7 and heparin can compete for the same site on VEGF165. But the fact that CMDB7 inhibits the VEGF165 binding to heparin-albumin with IC50higher than heparin doses, 10 µm versus0.3–1.7 µm, suggests that the affinity of this site is weaker for CMDB7 than for heparin. In contrast to VEGF165, KDR does not directly interact with CMDB7. Indeed, we showed that CMDB7 did not change the electrophoretic migration of KDR-Fc (Fig. 7), suggesting that the CMDB7·KDR complexes are not formed. One can think that CMDB7 negative charge is not enough strong to move a molecule as big and heavy as KDR-Fc, which is characterized by a molecular mass of 380 kDa. Our hypothesis that CMDB7 does not act directly on KDR is supported by the fact that CMDB7 does not displace the radiolabeled KDR from heparin-albumin (Fig. 8). The binding of heparin to KDR is well established now (45Tessler S. Rockwell P. Hicklin D. Cohen T. Levi B.-Z. Witte L. Lemischka I.R. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12456-12461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Chiang M.-K. Flanagan J.G. Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, in the light of our observations, it seems that heparin-binding site on KDR differs from that on VEGF165 because CMDB7 is able to interact with the growth factor but not with the receptor. CMDB7 binding to VEGF165 could change the growth factor conformation in a different manner then heparin does, as we previously showed for FGF2 (47Bittoun P. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Chaubet F. Crepin M. Jozefonvicz J. Fermandjian S. Biochem. Pharmacol. J. 1999; 57: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This could perturb the VEGF165interactions with KDRs. Indeed, we observed that CMDB7 inhibits the formation of VEGF165·KDR complexes on heparin-albumin (Fig. 9 B). Interestingly, when the ligand· receptor complexes are formed without heparin, as in the case of VEGF165 binding to coated KDR-Fcs, CMDB7 has no effect (Fig. 10). This argues for the hypothesis that the mechanism of CMDB7 action involves the displacement of heparin from VEGF165and VEGF165·KDR complexes. In conclusion, CMDB7 prevents the binding of VEGF165 to its cell surface receptors, inducing an inhibition of the receptor phosphorylation and consequently the endothelial cell proliferation arrest. It acts by displacing heparin from VEGF165 and VEGF165·receptor complexes. Being completely nontoxic and very efficient in tumor animal models, this dextran derivative could be used to increase the efficiency of conventional anticancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1969463341,"p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) is an effector for the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac. Because Pak1 binds to and is activated by both these GTPases, it has been difficult to precisely delineate the signaling pathways that link extracellular stimuli to Pak1 activation. To separate activation of Pak1 by Cdc42versus activation by Rac, we devised a genetic screen in yeast that enabled us to create and identify Pak1 mutants that selectively couple to Cdc42 but not Rac1. We recovered several such Pak1 mutants and found that the residues most often affected lie within the p21 binding domain, a region previously known to mediate Pak1 binding to GTPases, but that several mutations also map outside the borders of the p21 binding domain. Pak1 mutants that associate with Cdc42 but not Rac1 were also activated by Cdc42 but not Rac1. In rat 3Y1 cells expressing oncogenic Ha-Ras, the Pak1 mutants defective in Rac1 binding are not activated, suggesting that Ras signals through a GTPase other than Cdc42 to activate Pakl. Similar results were obtained when epidermal growth factor was used to activate Pak1. However, Pak1 mutants that are unable to bind Rac are nonetheless well activated by calf serum, implying that this stimulus may induce Pak activation independent of Rac. p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) is an effector for the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac.

Although these two small GTPases are structurally similar and share certain biochemical properties, there is ample evidence that Rac and Cdc42 are differentially regulated and affect distinct signaling pathways. For example, Rac is activated by platelet-derived growth factor, induces formation of lamellipodia, and stimulates cell survival pathways, whereas Cdc42 is activated by tumor necrosis factor-α, induces the formation of filopodia, and when expressed at high level, is pro-apoptotic. Like their distant cousin Ras, activated Cdc42 and Rac transmit signals by recruiting an array of effector proteins. Among these effectors, the p21-activated kinases (Paks)1have attracted much attention. Paks are serine/threonine kinases that bind to and are activated by both Cdc42 and Rac (5Lim L. Manser E.

The ability of Pak1 to bind both Cdc42 and Rac makes it unusual among GTPase effectors as most known effectors are specific for one but not both of these GTPases. Because Pak1 binds to and is activated by both Cdc42 and Rac1, it is often difficult to determine the precise nature of the signaling mechanisms that stimulate this kinase. For example, transient expression of Ras activates Pak1 (17Tang Y., Yu, J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A.

Similarly, growth factors and cell adhesion activate Pak1 (19Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31119-31122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the signals from these stimuli are thought to be funneled through Rac1 or Cdc42, it is difficult to determine which of these GTPases is specifically involved. In principle, expression of dominant negative forms of Rac or Cdc42, which act by titrating out endogenous GEFs, might be used to dissect these signaling pathways. In practice, however, dominant negative approaches suffer many specificity problems that limit their utility (24Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Alternate approaches could therefore be useful in analyzing the mechanisms of Pak1 activation. Here we present an alternate method to analyze Pak1 signaling. To delineate the Pak1 pathways involving Rac1 versus those involving Cdc42, we devised a genetic screen in yeast to create and identify mutants of Pak1 that can specifically bind Cdc42 but can no longer effectively bind Rac1. Several such mutants were isolated, and their binding and activation properties were confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Unlike the one previously known example of a Pak1 Cdc42-specific binding mutant (25Knaus U.G. Wang Y. Reilly A.M. Warnock D. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21512-21518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), several of the Pak1 mutants isolated in our screen retained normal activation by Cdc42. We have used these mutants to analyze the mechanism by which Ras and EGF activate Pak1 and determined that Ras and EGF activation of Pak1 is mediated by a GTPase other than Cdc42 but that Pak1 activation by calf serum is mediated by a GTPase other than Rac. A cDNA encoding the N-terminal 186 amino acids of Pak1 was created by PCR and cloned as anEcoRI/XhoI fragment into the yeast two-hybrid activation domain vector pJG4–5 (26Gyuris J. Golemis E.A. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar) to create pJG4–5 Pak1. The cDNA fragment was randomly mutated by error-prone PCR using a protocol based on the method of Fromant et al. (27Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 224: 347-353Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). 1 µg of pJG4–5 Pak1 was amplified by PCR in a 100-µl mixture containing Taq polymerase buffer, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm MnCl2, 200 µm ATP and TTP, and 20 µm CTP and GTP. The forward (sense) primer 5′-CGCCGATCCAGCCTGACTGGCTGA-3′ matched the sequence of pJG4–5 from position −128 to −105, 5′ to theEcoRI cloning site, whereas the reverse (antisense) primer 5′-GTGTCAACAACGTATCTACCAACG-3′ matched the sequence of pJG4–5 from position +109 to +132, 3′ to the XhoI cloning site.Taq polymerase was used to amplify the DNA using 20 cycles of PCR with each cycle consisting of 95 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 120 s. The resulting mutagenized mixture of PCR fragments was isolated on an agarose gel, excised, and purified using glass beads. The fragment was then co-transformed along with 0.5 µg ofEcoRI/XhoI-cut pJG4–5 vector into the yeast SKY48 strain (MATα ura3 his3 trp1 cIop-LYS2 lexAop-LEU2), which had been previously transformed with the two-hybrid bait vectors pGKS-8-Rac1 L61(28), pEG202-Cdc42 L61(26), and the pSH18–34lacZ reporter vector. The transformants were isolated on Trp− (to select for pJG4–5), Ura− (to select for pSH18–34), His− (to select for pEG202), and Zeocin+ (to select for pGKS-8) plates. Colonies were then replica-plated to Lys− (to select for Rac1 interactors) and Leu− (to select for Cdc42 interactors) media and assayed for β-glucuronidase (Rac1 interaction reporter) and β-galactosidase (Cdc42 interaction reporter) activity (28Serebriiskii I.

The Pak1 inserts from individual yeast colonies were retrieved by colony PCR using the same primers as for mutagenesis but normal PCR conditions. These inserts were purified and retransformed, along withEcoRI/XhoI-digested pJG4–5, into yeast to reconfirm the phenotype. 3Y1 rat fibroblasts, Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, or COS7 African green monkey epithelial cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum or calf serum were seeded at 2 × 105 for 3Y1 or 4 × 105 for COS and 3T3 cells per 60-mm plate and transfected with the LipofectAMINE Plus method (Life Technologies, Inc.) with a total of 1.5 to 2 µg of DNA. Cells were harvested at 24 or 48 h post-transfection in Robert's lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysates were adjusted for equal protein content and then boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blotting and overlay assays or quick frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until needed for immunoprecipitation. 3Y1 cells were transiently transfected with 1.0 µg of various Myc-tagged Pak proteins along with 0.5 µg of HA-tagged activated Rac1 or Cdc42. Cells were harvested at 24 h post-transfection in Robert's lysis buffer, equalized for protein content, and immunoprecipitated overnight with α-Myc polyclonal antibodies (A-14, Santa Cruz, CA). The immune complexes were sedimented with 50% protein A-agarose beads (Pierce), washed with lysis buffer without protease inhibitors, and analyzed by Western blotting to detect Rac1 or Cdc42 proteins precipitated with the wild-type or mutant Pak1 proteins. For Pak1 overlays, 3Y1 cells were transiently transfected to express various Myc-tagged Pak proteins. The cells were harvested, and the lysates were equalized for protein and separated by SDS-PAGE. The Pak proteins were immobilized on PVDF membrane and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 4 °C. Wild-type Rac and Cdc42 were either made as GST-tagged proteins in bacteria or purchased as His-tagged proteins (Cytoskeleton) and were activated with 25 µCi of 35S-labeled GTPγS in exchange buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100) for 10 min at 30 °C. The binding reaction was allowed to occur for 20 min at room temperature in binding buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.5 mm GTP, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol). The membranes were then washed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline containing 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA 2000) and autoradiography. COS7, 3Y1, or Swiss 3T3 cells were transiently transfected to express various Myc-tagged Pak proteins along with activated forms of Rac1, Cdc42, or Ras or were treated with growth factors. The cells were lysed in Robert's lysis buffer, and the lysate was equalized for protein content and immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-Myc polyclonal antibodies. The immune complexes were sedimented with 50% protein A-agarose beads and then washed with lysis buffer without protease inhibitors twice and once with kinase buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2). The immunoprecipitated Pak1 was then incubated with 1 µCi of [32P]ATP in kinase buffer containing 20 µmATP and 5 µg of MBP (Sigma) or Histone H4 (Fluka) for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by incubation in a boiling bath for 5 min. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA 2000) and autoradiography. Although most CRIB-containing proteins bind to Cdc42 but not Rac, Paks 1, 2, and 3 associate with and are activated by both these GTPases (6Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This unusual property makes it difficult to analyze the pathways by which upstream signals activate any of these Paks as these may be channeled through Cdc42, Rac, or both. We therefore attempted to create Pak1 mutants that could selectively couple to Rac1 or Cdc42 but not both. We used a dual-bait two-hybrid system in yeast in which it is possible to monitor the binding of a protein to two baits simultaneously (28Serebriiskii I. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17080-17087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this system, two baits are introduced into SKY48 yeast cells along with an interactor and two sets of auxotrophic and chromogenic transcriptional reporters. For the Pak1 screen, an activated allele of Cdc42, fused to the DNA binding domain of LexA, served as the first bait, whereas an activated allele of Rac1, fused to the DNA binding domain of the λ phage cI protein, served as the second bait. When wild-type Pak1 is co-expressed in these cells, all four reporters should be activated (Fig.1A). The first set of reporters is controlled by the Lex-Cdc42-Pak1 interaction (LexAop-LEU2 and LexAop-lacZ), whereas the second set is controlled by the cI-Rac1-Pak1 interaction (cIop-LYS2and cIop-GusA). Thus, such yeast should grow on media lacking both leucine and lysine and should induce a color change when assayed on media containing the appropriate substrates for β-galactosidase and β-glucuronidase. A Pak1 protein that, for example, contains a mutation that disables binding to Rac1 but not Cdc42 would activate the Leu2 and LacZ but not the Lys2 and GusA reporters, resulting in cells that grow on medium lacking leucine and produce a color change in a β-galactosidase enzymatic assay but which fail to grow on medium lacking lysine and fail to produce a color change in a β-glucuronidase enzymatic assay (Fig.1B). To create and isolate Pak1 mutants that differentially bind Cdc42 and Rac1, we used an error-prone PCR protocol (27Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 224: 347-353Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar) to create a library of Pak1 mutants encoding the N-terminal segment (amino acids 1–186) of this protein. The 5′ and 3′ ends of the PCR fragments contained sequences derived from the pJG4–5 plasmid, allowing efficient in vivo recombination in yeast. Yeast expressing both GTPase baits were co-transformed with EcoRI/XhoI-digested pJG4–5 and the library of Pak1 mutants. In vivorecombination between the homologous ends of the pJG4–5 vector and the Pak1 PCR fragment results in the formation of intact pJG4–5-Pak1 plasmids in the yeast cells that confer growth on Trp−media. The transformants were picked and tested for the ability to grow selectively on Lys− or Leu− media. As a secondary screen, the yeast in the colonies were also tested for the ability to cause a color change in a β-galactosidase or β-glucuronidase substrate assay. Following selection of positive colonies, plasmid DNA containing the mutated Pak1 was retrieved and retransformed into fresh yeast expressing both baits. The colonies were again screened for growth on Leu− and Lys−media. From a total of 2000 colonies screened, we recovered 20 colonies that showed selectivity in activating Cdc42-responsive reporters and 12 colonies that showed selectivity in activating Rac1-responsive reporters (Fig. 2). The phenotype of most of these colonies was stable and reproducible as multiple independent isolates of each clone behaved similarly upon retesting. We chose to focus on those colonies that showed strong positive growth on Leu− but not on Lys− media (i.e.mutants of Pak1 that potentially bound Cdc42 but not Rac1). Most of these clones displayed relatively enhanced specificity for Cdc42versus Rac1 binding in both the two-hybrid assay as well as in a GTPase overlay assay (data not shown), suggesting that the dual-bait screen is indeed able to select for GTPase binding mutants. We sequenced the Pak1 inserts to determine the basis for this binding selectivity. A schematic representation of the mutations is shown in Fig. 3A. Most of the clones contained more than one mutation. However, mutations at particular sites (e.g. Pro-42, Pro-78, His-83, Ala-91, stop codons at residues 101–103, and frameshifting mutations at residue 126 that result in a truncated protein) appeared in more than one clone. Many of these common mutations (i.e. Pro-78, His-83, and Ala-91) as well as one unique mutation (His-86) alter key residues within the CRIB motif, whereas other mutations map outside this region. To determine which of these mutations account for the altered binding properties of Pak1, we used site-directed mutagenesis to create single amino acid changes or early stop codons in the Pak1 1–186 fragment contained in the yeast two-hybrid plasmid. We focused on those mutations that were common to more than one clone as well as those lesions that affected residues within the CRIB domain. We also made point mutations at Gln-102 as this site was frequently mutated in the Cdc42 binding selective clones. In addition to these mutations derived from the dual-bait two-hybrid screen, we mutated Pak1 Phe-96 (to alanine) as this residue is conserved in Paks 1, 2, and 3 but not in the CRIB domains of MRCK, Ack, or WASP, which bind Cdc42 but not Rac1. The Pak1 mutations are summarized in Fig. 3B. These point mutants were retested in the two-hybrid system against both GTPase baits (data not shown). Pak1-bearing point mutations at either Pro-78, His-83, Phe-96, and Gln-102 bound to Cdc42 as well or better than did wild-type Pak1 but bound poorly or not at all to Rac1. Interestingly, certain early stops in the Pak1 protein, for example at residues 96 or 102, were associated with selective binding for Cdc42. These truncations were not studied further, however, as we wished to use the binding mutants to dissect upstream signals that activate Pakl, and this could not be done in molecules that lack the protein kinase catalytic domain. We next studied the binding properties of these mutants in the context of full-length Pak1 in mammalian cells. Based on the two-hybrid and overlay data, we introduced single amino acid point mutations in Myc-tagged wild-type Pak1 in a mammalian expression vector. The mutant Paks were expressed in both COS7 (not shown) and 3Y1 cells, and the cell lysates were bound to PVDF and probed with radiolabeled GTP-loaded Rac1 or Cdc42 (Fig.4A). As expected, wild-type Pak1 bound to both Rac1 and Cdc42 and the control Pak1 binding mutant H83L/H86L bound poorly to Cdc42 and not at all to Rac1. The P78T and F96A mutants, bound effectively to Cdc42 (45 and 49% compared with wild-type Pak1, respectively) but not at all to Rac1. The H83Y mutant did not bind either GTPase, whereas the Q102Y mutant bound to Cdc42 nearly as well as wild-type Pak1 (86%) and was partially compromised for Rac1 binding (55%). By contrast, the K66L/K67L/K68L Pak1 mutant, as reported by Knaus et al. (25Knaus U.G. Wang Y. Reilly A.M. Warnock D. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21512-21518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), also displayed partially compromised binding to Rac1 (54%) and was only slightly defective in binding Cdc42 (78%), similar to the Q102Y mutant described here. Thus, when assayed in the context of the full-length Pak1 protein, the mutants uncovered by the dual-bait two-hybrid screen retained relative binding specificity for Cdc42. To assess the binding of the full-length Pak1 mutants to Rac1 and Cdc42 in an in vivo environment, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation assays. Myc-tagged full-length wild-type Pak1 or the P78T, F96A, or Q102Y mutants were co-transfected into COS7 or 3Y1 cells with either vector control or HA-tagged activated Rac1 or Cdc42. Myc-Pak1 was then immunoprecipitated, and the immune complexes were assayed for the presence of Rac1 or Cdc42 by immunoblot (Fig.4B). Wild-type Pak1 was able to precipitate both Rac1 and Cdc42. Pak1 Q102Y precipitated Cdc42 nearly as well as did wild-type Pak1 but precipitated Rac1 weakly, consistent with the overlay assays. Pak1 F96A precipitated Cdc42 weakly but did not detectably precipitate Rac1, whereas the P78T mutant precipitated neither GTPase. That the last Pak1 mutant failed to co-precipitate Cdc42 despite binding this GTPase in the overlay assay suggests that the native conformation of the full-length protein affects its ability to complex with Cdc42. In summary, the binding data indicate that it is possible to create mutants of Pak1 that are relatively selective in their ability to bind Cdc42 versus Rac1. Two Pak1 mutants in particular, F96A and Q102Y, show good selectivity in the two-hybrid, GTPase overlay, and co-immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting their potential utility in analyzing the activation pathways for Pak1. Because mutations in Pak1 that affect GTPase binding may also affect kinase activity (9Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), we compared the basal and GTPase-stimulated activity of wild-type Pak1 with that of the P78T, F96A, and Q102Y mutants. COS cells were co-transfected with these vectors plus or minus expression vectors bearing activated (Leu-61) Cdc42 or Rac1. Pak1 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies and tested for protein kinase activity (Fig. 5). Both active Rac1 and active Cdc42 strongly activated wild-type Pak1. Consistent with previous studies, Cdc42 activated Pak1 to a greater extent than did Rac1, as seen in the kinase assay. The Pak1 P78T mutant, which failed to co-immunoprecipitate either Rac1 or Cdc42, was not activated by either GTPase. Interestingly, the F96A and Q102Y mutants were fully activated by Cdc42 despite their partially compromised ability to bind to this GTPase. Similarly, these mutants, which do not detectably co-precipitate with Rac1, were nevertheless partially activated by this GTPase (33 and 50% of wild-type value, respectively). These data suggest either that Pak1, even when overexpressed as a transgene, is limiting in cells or that weak binding to the GTPase is sufficient for activation. In either case, the fact that these two mutants retain full activation by Cdc42 but compromised activation by Rac1 means that in cells, the Pak1 F96A and Q102Y mutants, unlike the previously described Pak1 K66L/K67L/K68L mutant (25Knaus U.G. Wang Y. Reilly A.M. Warnock D. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21512-21518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), can be used to assess the contributions of Cdc42versus Rac1 to Pak1 activation. Previous published results suggest that Ras activates Pak1 mainly through a Rac or Cdc42 pathway (17Tang Y., Yu, J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We used our Pak1 binding mutants to distinguish whether Ras operates primarily through Rac or Cdc42. If Ras activates Pak1 via Rac, then Ras should fail to fully activate mutants of Pak1 that cannot bind Rac, whereas the opposite would hold true whether Ras activates Pak1 via Cdc42. To distinguish these possibilities, we co-transfected 3Y1 cells with a control vector or an activated form of Ras plus either wild-type or mutant forms of Pak1. These mutant forms included a kinase inactive mutant (K299R) and the Cdc42 but not Rac1-activable mutants F96A and Q102Y. Myc-tagged Pak1 was immunoprecipitated and tested for the ability to autophosphorylate (Fig. 6). Ras was able to induce the activation of wild-type Pak1 4-fold, consistent with published reports (17Tang Y., Yu, J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The Pak1 K299R mutant was not activated by Ras, demonstrating that the kinase assays indeed are measuring Pak activity. The F96A mutant, which is fully activated by Cdc42 but poorly activated by Rac1, was not activated by Ras, whereas the Q102Y mutant, which is fully activated by Cdc42 but only about 50% by Rac1, was activated nearly 50% by Ras. Together, these data are most consistent with a Ras-Rac-Pak1, rather than a Ras-Cdc42-Pak1, signaling pathway. We tested the ability of EGF and calf serum to stimulate wild-type and mutant Pak1. EGF treatment of cells expressing wild-type Pak1 resulted in about 5-fold stimulation of this kinase (Fig.7). The F96A mutant, which is severely compromised in Rac binding, did not respond to EGF, whereas the Q102Y mutant, which retains about 50% Rac binding, was activated 2.2-fold. These data are most consistent with a model in which EGF signals are transmitted primarily through Rac. In contrast, calf serum caused an 8.5-fold activation of wild-type Pak1, but this activation was unaffected by the Q102Y mutation and was only partly lost in the F96A mutant. As these mutants bind Rac poorly, these data suggest that calf serum acts through other GTPases to activate Pak1. Pak1 is an unusual GTPase effector in that it binds to and is activated by both Cdc42 and Rac. Most PBD-containing proteins, such as MRCK (30Leung T. Chen X.Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Promoter remodeling occurs following CIITA induction, suggesting the involvement of chromatin remodeling factors. Transcription of numerous genes requires the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activities of CREB-binding protein (CBP), p300, and/or p300/CBP-associated factor (pCAF). These co-activators cooperate with CIITA and are hypothesized to promote class II major histocompatibility complex transcription through their HAT activity. To directly test this, we used HAT-defective CBP and pCAF. We demonstrate that cooperation between CIITA and CBP is independent of CBP HAT activity. Further, although pCAF enhances CIITA-mediated transcription, pCAF HAT domain dependence appears contingent upon the concentration of available CIITA. When HAT-defective CBP and pCAF are both present, cooperativity with CIITA is maintained. Consistent with a recent report, we show that nuclear localization of CIITA is enhanced by lysine 144, an in vitro target of pCAF-mediated HAT. Yet we find that neither mutation of lysine 144 nor deletion of residues 132–209 affects transcriptional cooperation with CBP or pCAF. Thus, acetylation of this residue may not be the primary mechanism for pCAF/CBP cooperation with CIITA.

Wright K.L. Ting J.P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4589-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Wright K.L. Chin K.C. Linhoff M. Skinner C. Brown J.A. Boss J.M. Stark G.R. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6267-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with little if any detectable binding by X and Y box binding factors. The observation that promoters can be “opened” by CIITA is indicative of chromatin remodeling that could be mediated directly by CIITA or through recruitment of chromatin remodeling co-activators that may rely upon histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Some examples include CREB-binding protein (CBP), p300, and p300/CBP-associated factor (pCAF). Interestingly, recent work shows that histones H3 and H4 are acetylated at the HLA-DRA promoter in the presence of CIITA (26Beresford G.W. Boss J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). CBP interacts and synergizes with CIITA in the activation of class II MHC transcription in transient transfection experiments through an interaction with the amino terminus of CIITA (21Fontes J.D. Kanazawa S. Jean D. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Kretsovali A. Agalioti T. Spilianakis C. Tzortzakaki E. Merika M. Papamatheakis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6777-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This interaction has recently been mapped and shown to occur between residues 68 and 103 of CIITA (28Zhu X.S. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7078-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, CIITA sequesters CBP (thus down-regulating other CBP-dependent genes) (28Zhu X.S. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7078-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and a dominant negative form of CBP can inhibit class II MHC expression (21Fontes J.D. Kanazawa S. Jean D. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). CIITA also interacts and cooperates with p300 (29Sisk T.J. Roys S. Chang C.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 15: 4919-4928Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and pCAF (30Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although these observations suggest that CBP and other co-activators are important for class II MHC transcription, another critical issue is whether the HAT domains of CBP/pCAF are required for the observed effects. Likewise, it is not clear whether acetylation of CIITA affects its transactivator function. The answers to these issues would greatly affect our view of how CIITA transactivates its target promoters. In this report, we demonstrate that the HAT activity of CBP is not required for the synergistic cooperation between CIITA and CBP. Further we demonstrate that the CBP-associated factor pCAF, which also possesses a HAT domain, similarly cooperates with CIITA and can also function in a HAT-independent fashion. Complementing these findings, we also show that a lysine residue that can be acetylated is not required for cooperativity with pCAF. These findings have important implications regarding the mode of action of CIITA. The African green monkey kidney cell line COS-7 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and streptomycin-penicillin. All cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The plasmid expression vectors encoding CIITA, Δ132–209, CBP, pCAF, and the DRA300Luc reporter have been described previously (5Chin K.C. Li G.G. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CBPHAT(−) was produced by introducing two amino acid substitutions at residues 1690 and 1691 of wild-type CBP by Quick ChangeTM (Stratagene) mutagenesis. This mutation has been previously shown to completely abolish histone acetyltransferase activity, resulting in a CBP molecule that fails to activate a CRE-containing promoter (34Korzus E. Torchia J.

Cells (2 × 104 to 2 × 105) were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates 18–24 h prior to transfection of plasmid DNAs using FuGene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) transfection reagent per the manufacturers instructions. Following transfection (24–48 h), the cells were lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (36Piskurich J.F. Linhoff M.W. Wang Y. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 431-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent staining of transiently transfected COS-7 cells was performed as described previously (16Sisk T.J. Gourley T. Roys S. Chang C.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 165: 2511-2517Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 × 104 cells were grown overnight and transfected with 1.5 µg of DNA using the FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following fixation with 40% acetone in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with anti-FLAG M5 (Sigma) and goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate. Photomicrographs were acquired using Scion Series 7 video capture hardware and an Olympus BX40 fluorescence microscope. Transcriptional cooperation of the co-activators CBP and pCAF with CIITA has been previously reported (21Fontes J.D. Kanazawa S. Jean D. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Kretsovali A. Agalioti T. Spilianakis C. Tzortzakaki E. Merika M. Papamatheakis J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), implicating the importance of HAT activity in transactivation by CIITA. A variety of transfection methods using differing ratios of co-activator to CIITA have been reported (21Fontes J.D. Kanazawa S. Jean D. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar,27Kretsovali A. Agalioti T. Spilianakis C. Tzortzakaki E. Merika M. Papamatheakis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6777-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To reduce the risk of missing the effects of cooperation by overexpressing CIITA, we transfected various quantities of CIITA with a fixed quantity of the DRA reporter (Fig.1A). In COS-7 cells, activation of DRA transcription was maximal with 100 ng of transfected CIITA DNA. Significant transcriptional activation occurs with 20 ng as well. Transfecting 1 µg of CIITA DNA gives a level of activation similar to 20 ng, suggesting some form of inhibition at this high concentration. The relationship observed between the amount of DNA transfected and the degree of activation is consistent for a variety of cell lines (data not shown). A previous analysis of the dose response of class II MHC transcription to CIITA demonstrated a linear relationship in various tissues (37Otten L.A. Steimle V. Bontron S. Mach B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This disagreement is likely due to the high transfection efficiency (60–90%) using the FuGene reagent in this report as compared with the other transfection method. For the purposes of this study only the 20- and 100-ng quantities of CIITA are used. To investigate the importance of CBP HAT activity in transcriptional activation of class II MHC genes by CIITA, we tested the ability of a HAT-defective form of CBP to cooperate with CIITA in transient transfection experiments. This same construct has been previously tested as being HAT-deficient in other systems (34Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 35Adamson A.L. Kenney S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6551-6558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HAT-defective form of CBP and two HAT-defective forms of pCAF (32Jiang H. Lu H. Schiltz R.L. Pise-Masison C.A. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8136-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) enhanced CIITA activity as well as wild-type CBP and pCAF, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). Co-transfection of 0.1 µg of CIITA with equivalent concentrations of pCAF or CBP constructs reveals HAT-independent cooperation of CIITA with either CBP or pCAF (Fig. 1,B and C). When CBP is overexpressed (50-fold relative to CIITA; Fig. 1D), only a small difference is observed between cooperation with wild-type and HAT-defective CBP. However, under similar conditions, wild-type pCAF enhances the activity of CIITA, whereas the two pCAF HAT-defective mutants (pCAFΔHATA and pCAFΔHATB) display a reduced, but still detectable, capacity to enhance CIITA-mediated transcription (Fig. 1E). Taken together these data suggest that cooperation of CIITA with CBP is mostly HAT-independent. Cooperation of pCAF with CIITA is partially HAT-dependent when reporter activation by CIITA is suboptimal (20 ng of transfected CIITA plasmid) (Fig. 1E). When CIITA activity is optimal (0.1 µg), cooperation occurs but is HAT-independent. No cooperation is observed when an excess of CIITA plasmid (1 µg) is used (data not shown). CBP often recruits pCAF, and it is very likely that CBP and pCAF act together (38Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 39Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). Thus, we further examined the role of the HAT domains of CBP and pCAF using equivalent amounts (0.1 µg) of the DNAs in co-transfection experiments. Under these conditions, CBP and pCAF together gave a greater than 5-fold enhancement of HLA-DRA activation compared with CIITA alone (Fig.2A). No significant change in enhancement is observed when the HAT-defective forms of CBP, pCAF, or both are used. Similar results are obtained using 50-fold overexpression of the co-activators relative to CIITA (Fig.2B). This cooperation between CIITA/CBP/pCAF, maintained by HAT-defective co-activators, strongly suggests that the HAT activities of CBP and pCAF are not required for transcriptional cooperativity with CIITA. Our previous analysis has shown that residues 132–209 of CIITA are not required for activation of DR transcription (5Chin K.C. Li G.G. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, it has been recently shown that mutation of lysines 141 and 144 or lysines 156 and 159 to arginine within this region has an effect on nuclear localization, consistent with the existence of a putative bipartite NLS acetylated by both CBP and pCAF (30Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the sequence of CIITA from 132 to 209, the positions of the bipartite NLS, and lysines in this region. The CIITA deletion mutant Δ132–209 activates DRA transcription and is comparable with wild-type CIITA using 1.0 µg of DNA (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with our previous report using this mutant at a high concentration (5Chin K.C. Li G.G. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At 0.1 and 0.02 µg, the transactivation ability of Δ132–209 is substantially lower than wild type. Reduced transactivation by Δ132–209 is consistent with a defect in nuclear localization (Fig.3C) and thus the presence of the bipartite NLS. This paradoxical defect of nuclear localization and successful activation of DR transcription at a higher concentration of CIITA has been recently observed using LRR mutants of CIITA.2 These LRR mutations reduce the import rate of CIITA without diminishing its ability to activate transcription once nuclear CIITA levels are adequate, which is achieved with a higher concentration of CIITA. Contrary to the earlier observation that deleting residues 132–209 of CIITA does not abrogate transactivator function, a recent paper suggests that acetylation of CIITA at residues 141 and 144 could be instrumental to CBP/pCAF-enhanced transcription by CIITA (30Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). More specifically, nuclear localization was shown to be dependent upon lysines 141 and 144 and was positively affected by the HAT activity of pCAF. However, the contribution of HAT activity to transcriptional activation and the role of each individual lysine residue was not investigated. If CBP and/or pCAF acetylation of CIITA at lysines 141 and/or 144 reflects the mechanism of cooperativity, CBP and pCAF should fail to cooperate with CIITAΔ132–209. To examine this possibility, we transfected cells with different forms of CIITA and either CBP, CBPHAT(−), pCAF, or pCAFΔHATA/B under conditions where the HAT domain of pCAF is necessary for full cooperativity. In these experiments the level of transactivation by Δ132–209 is reduced to 30% of wild type. However, cooperation with CIITA, as measured by the capacity of CBP or pCAF to enhance transactivation, is preserved (Fig. 3, D andE). Furthermore, this cooperation mirrors that seen with wild-type CIITA with respect to a partial dependence on the pCAF HAT domain (Fig. 3D) and independence from CBP HAT activity (Fig. 3E). Also, like wild type, when equivalent amounts (0.1 µg) of CIITA and pCAF (or CBP) are used, the dependence on pCAF HAT activity disappears (data not shown). These observations demonstrate that deleting residues 132–209 did not affect cooperation with CBP or pCAF. The slight dependence on the pCAF HAT domain is still present despite the absence of the lysine(s) in the bipartite NLS, suggesting that this modest enhancement does not require acetylation in this region of CIITA. The following experiment using site-specific mutagenesis was performed to address this issue further. A previous study demonstrated that lysine 144 of CIITA is acetylated by pCAF and suggested that either lysines 144 and/or 141 are acetylated by CBP (30Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The same report also shows that mutation of both of these residues to arginine had a negative effect on pCAF-enhanced CIITA nuclear localization. However, the transactivation function of K144R and K141R individually has not been tested prior to this report. To this end, single point mutagenesis was performed. Single point mutation of lysine 141 to arginine (K141R) has no effect on activity (Fig.4B) or localization (Fig.4C, middle panel). K144R displays no defect in transactivation assays, even when as little as 20 ng of DNA is transfected (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, K144R also displayed nearly complete cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 4B), consistent with the prior report. This demonstrates that the localization effects previously tested result from mutation of Lys144, not Lys141 or the combination of both mutations, and suggests that on a per molecule basis, K144R is likely more active than wild-type CIITA, because K144R exhibits defective nuclear accumulation (Fig. 4C). This represents a rare gain-of-function mutation of CIITA. To assess the effect of the K144R mutation on cooperation with CBP and pCAF, several experiments were performed using this mutant. If acetylation of K144 is responsible for cooperation between pCAF (or CBP) and CIITA, a failure of cooperation would be expected. Using both the 50-fold overexpression and “equivalent” expression systems, pCAF cooperated with K144R (Fig.5). The ability of CBP and CBPHAT(−) to cooperate with K144R was essentially identical using the 50-fold overexpression conditions (data not shown). These data demonstrate that acetylation of CIITA at lysine 144 by pCAF is not necessary for cooperation with pCAF. The same is true of CBP (data not shown). The ability of CIITA to activate class II MHC transcription can be enhanced by the presence of the co-activators CBP (21Fontes J.D. Kanazawa S. Jean D. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Kretsovali A. Agalioti T. Spilianakis C. Tzortzakaki E. Merika M. Papamatheakis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6777-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), pCAF (30Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), or p300 (29Sisk T.J. Roys S. Chang C.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 15: 4919-4928Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made for CBP using class I MHC reporters consistent with the role of CIITA in class I MHC transcription (8Gobin S.J.P. van den Elsen P. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 40Martin B.K. Chin K.-C. Skinner C.A. Olsen J.C. Dey A. Ozato K. Ting J.P.-Y. Immunity. 1997; 6: 591-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Acetylation of lysine 144 of CIITA by pCAF and lysines 141 and/or 144 by CBP, which comprise a bipartite nuclear localization sequence, has been demonstrated recently to play a role in enhancing the nuclear import of CIITA (30Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These previous studies implicate the importance of HAT activities in promoting the transcription of class II MHC genes. Here we directly test an aspect of this hypothesis. This report explores the implied requirement for HAT activity of CBP and pCAF for enhancing CIITA transactivation of class II MHC genes and finds that the HAT domains of CBP and pCAF are frequently not required. Further, a lysine residue within 132–209 that is acetylated by the pCAF HAT is dispensable for cooperativity with the co-activators. This particular residue is important for nuclear accumulation, as described previously (30Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This report confirms previous findings that CBP and pCAF cooperate with CIITA; however, we find that this cooperation is completely independent of HAT activity contributed by CBP. Further, this cooperation can also be independent of pCAF HAT activity depending on the conditions. Although some dependence for pCAF HAT activity was observed when pCAF was transfected in excess of CIITA, this was not observed when equivalent amounts of either wild-type CBP or HAT-defective CBP and CIITA were co-expressed. HAT independence is also observed when HAT-defective pCAF and CBP are used in combination. HAT-independent cooperation between co-activators and other transcription factors has been well documented (32Jiang H. Lu H. Schiltz R.L. Pise-Masison C.A. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8136-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Avots A. Buttmann M. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Smola U. Bannister A.J. Rapp U.R. Kouzarides T. Serfling E.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2676-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and is thought to occur through either recruitment of additional co-factors or directly through the non-HAT domains of the co-activators themselves. We consistently observe a lack of HAT dependence for CBP cooperation with CIITA at various concentrations of CIITA, using different amounts of transfected DNA and using different expression vectors (Fig. 1 and data not shown). As the concentration of CIITA increases, we observe a decreased enhancement with CBP (data not shown). We interpret this to indicate a decreasing reliance upon CBP, and perhaps co-activators in general, as the amount of available CIITA increases. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that at some defined concentration of CIITA, CBP is less important for activation of class II transcription. Cooperative activation of class II MHC by CIITA and pCAF or CBP does not require sequences between 132 and 209 of CIITA, despite the presence of pCAF/CBP acetylation sites in this region. In a similar fashion, point mutation of the lysines identified as acetylation targets fail to impair the activity of CIITA or its ability to cooperate with co-activators. Together, these observations suggest that although CIITA interacts and cooperates with CBP and pCAF, the HAT activities of these factors, even in combination (Fig. 2), are not an absolute requirement for cooperative transactivation. In addition, the putative acetylation sites for these HATs in CIITA are also not required for cooperation with pCAF. These data are consistent with several interpretations: 1) An essential HAT activity is supplied by another co-activator (e.g. p300, GCN5, SRC-1, or TAFII250). The interaction of CIITA with p300 has been reported (29Sisk T.J. Roys S. Chang C.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 15: 4919-4928Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and indirect association with TAFII250 has been suggested (23Mahanta S.K. Scholl T. Yang F.C. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6324-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In light of this report, the role of the HAT activities of these factors in class II MHC transcription should be investigated. 2) CIITA may possess its own HAT activity. This possibility is supported by a recent report that CIITA has acetyltransferase activity (44Raval A. Howcroft T.K. Weissman J.D. Kirshner S. Zhu X. Yokoyama K. Ting J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 3) Other features of the co-activators, independent of the HATs are important. 4) HAT recruitment is important for acetylation of other factors involved in class II MHC transcription (e.g. NF-Y; Ref. 45Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and this requirement is sensitive to available CIITA. (5Chin K.C. Li G.G. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) Lastly, the assay systems currently employed to address the role of HATs in class II MHC transcription may be inadequate. The characterization of K144R is intriguing because although its nuclear import is clearly impaired, its transactivation function is not (Fig. 4C). The nuclear localization of Δ132–209 is also reduced, although this mutant has impaired function using smaller amounts of transfected DNA (Fig. 3). We have recently observed that decreases in the rate of CIITA import exhibited by the LRR mutants correlate with an activation profile similar to that seen for Δ132–209 over a range of 0.1–1.0 µg, in that the transactivation function is comparable with the wild-type CIITA at a high concentration but is reduced at a lower concentration.2 A likely explanation is that for Δ132–209 and the LRR mutants, although functional, fewer of these molecules accumulate in the nucleus. K144R exhibits a different pattern: defective nuclear localization, yet transactivation comparable with wild type. These observations suggest that K144R is potentially more active on a per molecule basis than wild type and may represent the first described gain-of-function CIITA mutant. Combined with a previous report indicating that lysine 144 is an acetylation site, we speculate that this acetylation may have the unexpected result of reducing transactivation function on a per molecule basis. Clearly, more detailed analysis is necessary to explore this intriguing possibility. In summary, our observations regarding co-activator function and CIITA are consistent with reports demonstrating HAT-independent cooperation in other systems (32Jiang H. Lu H. Schiltz R.L.

Chen D. Lee Y.H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transcriptional activation by CIITA shows a requirement for the HAT domain of pCAF only when CIITA is less abundant. It seems clear that acetylation by pCAF promotes nuclear import of CIITA (30Spilianakis C. Papamatheakis J. Kretsovali A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and this requires Lys144. Once inside the nucleus, CIITA causes specific gene activation assisted by CBP and pCAF. The function of CBP is HAT-independent, whereas the role of pCAF can be HAT-dependent. As CIITA availability increases, even the HAT activity of pCAF is no longer required. Co-activator involvement in the CIITA/class II MHC system is thus complex and underscores the need for a more complete understanding of the role of HATs in CIITA-mediated transcriptional control. We thank Dr. Y. Nakatani and Dr. Vasily Ogryzko for providing the pCAF plasmids used in this study."
https://openalex.org/W1999283983,"Administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein B (apoB) containing lipoproteins, including lipoprotein(a), in man. However, the mechanism behind this hypolipidemic effect is unknown. This study aimed at distinguishing between the main possibilities (increased elimination or decreased production of lipoproteins) using HepG2 cell cultures. Addition of ACTH to the cell culture medium selectively down-regulated apoB mRNA expression and apoB secretion in a dose-dependent manner. At 100 pmol/liter ACTH, the apoB mRNA level was about 40% lower than in the untreated cells, and the secretion of apoB into the medium was decreased to a similar extent. The expression and secretion of other apolipoproteins (apoA–I, apoE, and apoM), however, were not affected by ACTH. Under normal culture conditions the level of secretion of apoB from HepG2 cells is quite low. In the presence of 0.4 mmol/liter oleic acid secretion of apoB increased 3-fold, but this phenomenon was not seen in ACTH-treated cells. Binding and internalization of radiolabeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) by HepG2 cell, as well as LDL-receptor mRNA and scavenger receptor B-I mRNA levels, were not influenced by ACTH. In conclusion, ACTH directly and selectively down-regulated the production and secretion of apoB in HepG2 cell cultures, suggesting that a principal mechanism behind the cholesterol-lowering effect of ACTH in vivo may be a decreased production rate of apoB-containing lipoproteins from the liver.

Pedersen R.C. Kramer R.E. Brownie A.C. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1983; 61: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). ACTH has also been shown to influence plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism (2Arnadottir M. Berg A.L. Kronenberg F. Lingenhel A. Hugosson T. Hegbrant J. Nilsson-Ehle P.

Thus, we have demonstrated previously that ACTH treatment markedly and consistently lowers plasma concentrations of low density lipoproteins (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) in healthy individuals (2Arnadottir M.

Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In some of the studies, an increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration was also observed (4Berg A.L. Nilsson-Ehle P. Arnadottir M. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Berg A.L. Nilsson-Ehle P. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 90-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The effects of ACTH on LDL and Lp(a) levels seem attributable to ACTH as such, because they are clearly distinct from the effects of equipotent doses of corticosteroids (6Berg A.L. Nilsson-Ehle P. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 90-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanisms behind the lipid-lowering effects of ACTH are not known. Previous data indicated that ACTH could increase LDL receptor (LDL-R) activity in HepG2 cells (6Berg A.L. Nilsson-Ehle P. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 90-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that an increased elimination rate of LDL might be involved. It has also been reported that ACTH increased the receptor-mediated uptake of native LDL but not of oxidized LDL or of LP(a) in HepG2 cells. However, because the elimination of LDL and Lp(a) from the circulation occurs via distinctly different routes (i.e. Lp(a) does not utilize the LDL-R pathway), the parallel decrease in plasma LDL and Lp(a) concentrations after administration of ACTH in vivo indicates that other mechanisms must also be involved. Because apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the main protein component of both LDL and Lp(a), an obvious possibility is that ACTH would affect the production of lipoproteins in the liver rather than their removal from plasma. In the present study, therefore, we investigated the effects of ACTH on the expression and secretion of apoB and other apolipoproteins and re-examined the influence of ACTH on the receptor-mediated uptake of LDL in HepG2 cell cultures. Because LDL removal may occur not only by the LDL-R but also by the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) (9Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

ACTH (from porcine pituitary) and oleic acid were purchased from Sigma. The established hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA. [32P]dCTP and 125I were purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Six-well cell culture clusters and 25-cm2 vented cell culture flasks were purchased from Costar. HepG2 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in the presence of benzylpenicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml) under standard culture conditions (5% CO2, 37 °C). Cells were seeded in 25-cm2 cell culture flasks or in 6-well cell culture clusters and allowed to grow to 50–70% confluence. Immediately prior to the experiment, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and once with serum free RPMI 1640 and then the experimental medium (RPMI 1640 + 0.5% human serum albumin (HSA)) containing ACTH at the indicated concentrations was added. The dosage of ACTH was chosen to cover the range from physiological concentrations (2–11 pmol/liter) in human plasma (11Tietz N.W. Clinical Guide to Laboratory Tests. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1995Google Scholar) up to 10 times higher. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time intervals. In another series of experiments the cells were incubated with (100 pmol/liter) or without ACTH in the presence of 0.4 mmol/liter oleic acid (molar ratio, oleic acid:human albumin was 2:1) for 24 h. The medium was collected for estimation apoB secretion. A commercial G3PDH cDNA fragment or a β-actin cDNA fragment (CLONTECH) was used as a control probe. A full-length human apoM cDNA was used as probe for apoM mRNA hybridization (12Xu N. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31286-31290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). A 385-bp DNA fragment corresponding to apoB LDL-R binding domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (primers, 5′-gctgtactctaccgctaaagga and 5′-gacatttgccatggagagagtt) from human genomic DNA and used as human apoB Northern blotting probe. A 651-bp apoA–I exon 3 DNA fragment was amplified from human genomic DNA (primers, 5′-ctgggacagcgtgacctc and 5′-tctgagcaccgggaaggg) as a probe for apoA–I hybridization (13Kempen H.J. Imbach A.P. Giller T. Neumann W.J. Hennes U. Nakada N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1796-1806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To be used as a probe for apoE hybridization, a 317-bp DNA fragment of the apoE gene was amplified from human genomic DNA (primers, 5′-ctgatggacgagaccatgaa and 5′-tcgcgggccccggcctggta). A 932-bp DNA fragment of the LDL-R gene (exons 12–18) was amplified from human genomic DNA (primers, 5′-ctcaagcatcgatgtcaatg and 5′-agctctggcaggcaatgctt) to be used as an LDL-R probe. A 195-bp fragment was amplified from exon 1 of the gene coding for SR-BI (primers, 5′-cgtcgccgtccccgtctcctgccag and 5′-cttaaggacctgctgcttgatgagc) as a probe for SR-BI (14Cao G. Garcia C.K. Wyne K.L. Schultz R.A. Parker K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33068-33076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). All polymerase chain reactions were performed using Ampli Taq DNA polymerase with buffers and dNTPs supplied by manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacture's directions, on a GeneAmp polymerase chain reaction system 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All probes were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP using the random primer method (RediPrime; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA of HepG2 cells was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method, and Northern blots were hybridized with the probes described above and eventually exposed to x-ray film (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). G3PDH or β-actin probes were used as controls. Hybridizations were carried out at 65 °C in a hybridization solution (CLONTECH) with 32P-labeled DNA probes. The blots were washed several times in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS solution at room temperature for 2 h and twice in 0.1× SSC/0.05% SDS at 50 °C for 40 min. The washed blots were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C from 1 day to 1 week. The autoradiographs were analyzed with a scanner (UMAX Astra 1220U; UMAX Data Systems Inc.). The membrane was stripped with boiled water in the presence of 0.5% SDS for 10 min and then rehybridized with the next probe. To compare the effects of ACTH on different apolipoprotein and lipoprotein receptor mRNA levels, all Northern blotting analyses, except for LDL-R, were performed using the same membrane. LDL-R mRNA levels were determined in a separate series of experiments, using many different membranes. The relative mRNA levels were calculated with a Macintosh computer using Quantity One software (version 4.2.1; Bio-Rad). apoB, apoA–I, apoE, and apoM masses were determined by Western blotting analysis. Cell culture medium without FCS was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human apoB, apoA–I, apoE, or apoM. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG was used as the secondary antibody. Bands corresponding to the different apolipoproteins were visualized by an ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or developed by the peroxidase staining method and quantified by a scanner using Quantity One software. Human plasma LDL was separated and labeled with125I by the monochloride method according to Rayyeset al. (16Rayyes O.A. Wallmark A. Floren C.H. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 613-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LDL-R activity was measured by determination of the binding and internalization of radioactive labeled LDL by HepG2 cells. In brief, the subconfluent HepG2 cells were incubated with the experimental medium containing 0, 10, or 100 pmol/liter ACTH. The binding and uptake of LDL by HepG2 cells were studied at 4 and 37 °C, respectively. To estimate binding, the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and precooled for 20 min on ice with 2 ml of ice-cold medium without HSA. The cells were then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 125I-LDL (9.86 µg/ml) and subsequently washed three times with ice-cold PBS. 2 ml of dextran sulfate (10 mg/ml) were added, followed by a 1-h incubation on a shaker at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and radioactivity was measured in an automatic γ counter (LKB 1260, multigamma counter; Wallac Service). Finally the wells were scraped after addition of 2 ml of 0.5 m NaOH, and the protein content of the cells were determined according to the method described by Lowry et al. (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LDL uptake (binding plus internalization) by HepG2 cells was examined at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS, incubated for 2 h with125I-LDL (9.86 µg/ml), and washed three times with PBS. After addition of 2 ml of 0.5 m NaOH, the cells were scraped off the wells, and the radioactivity was measured in a γ counter. Protein content was measured by the method described by Lowryet al. (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Comparisons among groups were statistically evaluated by the Mann-Whitney U test. Significance was established at ap value less than 0.05. Fig. 1 demonstrates the contents of apoB in the medium from cell cultures exposed to ACTH for 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively. ACTH significantly lowered apoB concentrations at all three time intervals. The effect was most pronounced at higher concentrations of ACTH (50 and 100 pmol/liter), indicating that ACTH influences apoB production in a dose-dependent manner. In another series of experiments, we treated cells once with ACTH (100 pmol/liter) and followed the concentrations of apoB in the medium by repeated sampling over time. A decrease of apoB levels occurred after 3 h and reached maximum after 24 h (Fig. 2). In the presence of 0.4 mmol/liter oleic acid the level of secretion of apoB in control cell cultures increased about 3-fold, but this phenomenon was not seen in ACTH-treated cells (Fig. 3). Thus, oleic acid could not reverse the inhibitory effect of ACTH on apoB secretion. There were no significant changes in the production of apoA–I, apoE, and apoM in the medium after ACTH administration (data not shown). There were no morphological changes in cells after ACTH treatment (data not shown).Figure 2Time course of ACTH on apoB secretion.HepG2 cells were incubated in 25-cm2 flasks with 5 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS until subconfluent.

At 100 pmol/liter, the reduction in apoB mRNA was about 45% compared with control cells. The effect of ACTH was selective for apoB mRNA, because there was no corresponding decrease in the mRNA of other apolipoproteins or in the control mRNA, i.e.G3PDH mRNA (Fig. 4). Stimulation of HepG2 cells by ACTH did not influence the receptor mediated uptake of LDL, as determined by binding or uptake of radioactively labeled LDL. Numerous experiments were performed, but no consistent or significant effects on LDL binding or uptake could be documented at various time points, concentrations, or other relevant manipulations of the experimental conditions.

Because the uptake of the radiolabeled LDL in cell cultures might be influenced by alterations in the medium occurring during the incubations (e.g. secretion of apoB or other apolipoproteins into the medium), we also investigated the possible effects of ACTH on the levels of LDL-R and SR-BI mRNA. As demonstrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, ACTH did not influence the expression of the LDL-R or SR-BI in HepG2 cells. In a series of investigations in healthy volunteers and in patients with moderate secondary hyperlipoproteinemia due to renal diseases, we have demonstrated that administration of ACTH strongly and consistently lowers plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels in humans (2Arnadottir M.

The concentrations of apoB-containing lipoproteins VLDL, LDL, and LP(a) are markedly reduced, whereas plasma HDL levels are unaffected or increase moderately (2Arnadottir M. Berg A.L. Kronenberg F.

Med. 1991; 229: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Largely, these effects, notably those on apoB-containing lipoproteins, seem to be mediated via ACTH per se, because administration of corticosteroids under similar conditions tends to increase plasma lipid concentrations (6Berg A.L. Nilsson-Ehle P. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 90-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The present study supports the view that ACTH exerts direct effects on lipid metabolism, demonstrating that addition of ACTH to HepG2 cell cultures affects key events in lipoprotein metabolism in liver cells. Although it is generally considered that ACTH largely acts indirectly, via corticosteroids, direct metabolic effects of ACTH have been suggested previously, because ACTH promotes the mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue in the rat (18Akgun S. Rudman D. Endocrinology. 1969; 84: 926-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mechanisms behind the effects of ACTH on lipoprotein metabolismin vivo are still obscure. Theoretically, the hypolipidemic effects could be the result of an inhibition of the production of lipoproteins in the liver or of enhanced catabolism of LDL particles via lipoprotein receptor-mediated pathways. The present study, using HepG2 cell cultures, supports the view that ACTH primarily affects lipoprotein production, demonstrating that ACTH decreased significantly apoB mRNA levels in hepatic cells and apoB secretion into the medium, whereas there was no effect of ACTH on receptor-mediated LDL uptake or on LDL-R mRNA and SR-BI mRNA concentrations. ApoB is the structural component of VLDL and LDL. Expression of apoB determines VLDL production (19Teng B. Blumenthal S. Forte T. Navaratnam N. Scott J. Gotto Jr., A.M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29395-29404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and secondarily influences LDL formation. The present finding, therefore, might be a major mechanism explaining the reduction of plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol during administration of ACTH in vivo. We have reported earlier that ACTH could up-regulate LDL-R activity in HepG2 cells (6Berg A.L. Nilsson-Ehle P. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 90-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similarly, Bartens et al. (8Bartens W. Kramer-Guth A. Wanner C. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 726-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reported that ACTH could stimulate LDL-R activity in HepG2 cells, promoting the uptake of labeled native LDL but not that of oxidized LDL or Lp(a). In the present study, we were not able to reproduce these data. As shown in Table I, numerous experiments under various conditions were performed, but no consistent effects on LDL uptake could be demonstrated. Although it is well known that receptor activity measurements have a comparatively low reproducibility, we have no clear explanation for this variability. Possibly, the complexity of such measurements, e.g. the uptake of radiolabeled marker is influenced by dynamic effects (such as secretion of lipoproteins from the cells) in the cultures during incubations, could be involved. Our data showing that ACTH does not affect LDL-R mRNA levels support further the view that ACTH does not act by enhancing the removal of lipoproteins via the LDL-R pathway in the liver. SR-BI is known to mediate the selective uptake of HDL-cholesteryl ester in liver and in steroidogenic tissues (9Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Liver-specific overexpression of the SR-BI gene in mice decreased plasma HDL-cholesteryl ester, apoA–I, and apoA–II levels (9Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 10Jian B. de la Llera-Moya M. Ji Y. Wang N. Phillips M.C. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5599-5606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Plasma triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and VLDL and LDL apoB were also decreased, indicating that SR-BI can also play a role in the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins. In the present study we found that ACTH had no effect on SR-BI mRNA in liver cells. In another series of experiments 2Manuscript in preparation. we pretreated rats with ACTH and then injected radioactive labeled LDL. There were no differences in LDL clearance or LDL tissue distribution in ACTH-treated rats compared with control rats. The uptake of radiolabeled LDL in adrenals was less than 0.1% of that in the liver. Taken together, these observations indicate that the SR-BI in hepatic cells or in adrenals are not involved in the ACTH-lowering cholesterol effect observed in vivo. The availability of lipids is critical in determining apoB particle assembly and secretion. Dixon et al. (22Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that oleic acid could stimulate secretion of apoB-containing lipoprotein from HepG2 cells by inhibiting early intracellular degradation of apoB (22Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we also cultured HepG2 cells in the presence of 0.4 mmol/liter oleic acid with (100 pmol/liter) or without ACTH. Supplementation with oleic acid strongly stimulated apoB secretion from HepG2 cells in the absence of ACTH but not in ACTH-treated cells (Fig.3). Thus, the effect of ACTH could not be blocked by addition of oleic acid, which is consistent with a direct and unique inhibitory effect on apoB synthesis. However, the fact that ACTH did indeed abolish the increase in apoB secretion induced by oleic acid might indicate that ACTH could also affect lipoprotein secretion at a later stage in the secretary process, i.e. by modulating intracellular degradation of apoB. The apoB-containing pre-VLDL particle is formed during the translation and translocation of apoB to the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (23Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Boren J. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further modified during a short period post-translationally (26Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) to form a mature VLDL particle that is secreted into plasma. Synthesis of apoB is the rate-limiting step in this process (18Akgun S. Rudman D. Endocrinology. 1969; 84: 926-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). VLDL is then transformed into LDL particles by delipidation of its lipid core by lipoprotein lipase (27Alaupovic P. Wang C.S. McConathy W.J. Weiser D. Downs D. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 226-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28Breckenridge W.C. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Eisenberg S.

Thus, down-regulation of apoB synthesis may explain the reduction of VLDL, as well as of LDL, in response to ACTH. Alterations in apoB production may be the result of reduced apoB gene transcription or enhanced apoB mRNA degradation (31Boren J. Wettesten M. Rustaeus S. Andersson M. Olofsson S.O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Kraft H.G. Demosky Jr., S.J. Schumacher K. Brewer Jr., H.B. Hoeg J.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The present experiments do not distinguish between these possibilities. Pulse-chase experiments using apoB gene transfected cells may help to further elucidate the effects of ACTH on VLDL production and assembly. Our previous studies have shown that ACTH also decreases plasma Lp(a) concentration (2Arnadottir M. Berg A.L. Kronenberg F. Lingenhel A. Hugosson T. Hegbrant J. Nilsson-Ehle P. Metabolism. 1999; 48: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 3Arnadottir M. Berg A.L. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.C. Nilsson-Ehle P. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 1651-1655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Lp(a) is composed of an LDL particle, which also contains apo(a). The latter seems to bind to the apoB moiety of VLDL/LDL in the circulation (33Vu H. Cianflone K. Zhang Z. Kalant D. Sniderman A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 34Babiak J. Rudel L.L. Baillieres Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1987; 1: 515-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the reduction of plasma Lp(a) may be secondary to the decrease of VLDL and LDL concentrations after ACTH administration. However, it cannot be ruled out that ACTH may also affect the production of apo(a) or the elimination of Lp(a) from plasma. In a parallel study of healthy individuals and hemodialysis patients (35Arnadottir M. Dallongeville J. Nilsson-Ehle P. Berg A.L. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 2001; 61: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), administration of ACTH also induced an increase in the serum concentrations of apoE, an observation that may hypothetically offer an alternative mechanism for the effect of ACTH on lipoprotein metabolism. ApoE is present in all lipoprotein classes and plays a central role in lipoprotein catabolism because of its high affinity to lipoprotein receptors (36Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). In the rabbit, intravenous injection of apoE was associated with a transient lowering of plasma cholesterol concentrations (37Yamada N. Shimano H. Mokuno H. Ishibashi S. Gotohda T. Kawakami M. Watanabe Y. Akanuma Y. Murase T. Takaku F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), an effect that did not involve an up-regulation of LDL-R activity (38Osuga J. Yonemoto M. Yamada N. Shimano H. Yagyu H. Ohashi K. Harada K. Kamei T. Yazaki Y. Ishibashi S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, in HepG2 cells we did not observe an enhanced apoE mRNA expression or apoE secretion into the medium in response to ACTH. Nevertheless, these results do not rule out the possibility that apoE is involved in the lipid-lowering effect of ACTHin vivo, because apoE is expressed in several organs besides the liver (39Elshourbagy N.A. Liao W.S. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present study shows that ACTH down-regulates hepatic apoB mRNA expression and apoB secretion, which may constitute a major mechanism behind its strong and consistent lipid-lowering effectin vivo. A reduced synthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins may also explain the reduction of Lp(a) concentration, but further studies are needed to investigate possible effects of ACTH on the metabolism of apo(a).

However, following the cloning of the first subunit of the epithelial Na+channel (ENaC)1 in 1993 (3Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar,4Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and the subsequent development of specific immunological and molecular biological reagents, a new gene superfamily of ion channels was quickly defined (5Corey D.P.

Members of this degenerin/ENaC superfamily include the mammalian, avian, and amphibian orthologs of ENaC; subfamily members in snails and insects; and the genes and coding proteins involved in touch sensation and neurodegeneration in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (7Alvarez de la Rosa D. Canessa C.M. Fyfe G.K. Zhang P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Over 60 members of this gene superfamily have been identified to date (8Waldmann R.

Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs; otherwise known as brain Na+ channels (BNaCs)) compose one branch of the degenerin/ENaC superfamily (20Garcı́a-Añoveros J. Derfler B. Neville-Golden J. Hyman B.T.

The polypeptide is predicted to have two hydrophobic domains, a large extracellular loop, and intracellularly located amino and carboxyl termini. These channels are found throughout the nervous system and were first discovered in sensory neurons (21Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

However, their localization is not restricted to the nervous system, but extends to tissues such as the small intestine, lung, and pituitary gland (23Ishibashi K. Marumo F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The fact that lowering extracellular pH activates the majority of these channels led to the hypothesis that they are involved in nociception (8Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin.

BNaC-1 (MDEG, BNC1, or ASIC-2a) and BNaC-2 (ASIC-1a), or brain sodium channels, have been cloned from mammalian brain and studied in heterologous expression systems (20Garcı́a-Añoveros J. Derfler B.

The major goal of this work was to characterize the single channel properties of BNaC-2 in planar lipid bilayers so that the regulatory properties of these channels could be studied in a controlled environment. Calcium caused a voltage-dependent block of both wild-type (WT) BNaC-2 and gain-of-function (GF) BNaC-2 in dose-dependent manner. At lower pH, these channels became less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of Ca2+. This “shift” in Ca2+ sensitivity at lower pH might be responsible for pH activation of BNaCs. Planar lipid bilayers were formed from a solution containing a 2:1 mixture of diphytanoylphosphatidylethanolamine and diphytanoylphosphatidylserine dissolved in n-octanol at a concentration of 25 mg/ml. Membranes were painted onto a 200-µm diameter hole in a polystyrene cup. Membrane capacitance in all of the experiments reported herein averaged 250–350 picofarads. The standard bathing solution contained in both compartments of the bilayer system was composed of 100 mm sodium chloride plus 10 mm MOPS/Tris buffer (pH 7.4). Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All solutions were made using Milli-Q water and were filtered-sterilized using 0.22-µm Sterivex-GS filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Free Ca2+ concentrations were adjusted using appropriate EGTA/Ca2+ combinations calculated by the Bound-and-Determined program (29Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and were verified by Fura-2 fluorometry. Current measurements were made with a high-gain operational amplifier connected to a 10-gigaohm feedback resistor as described previously (30Ismailov I.I. Shlyonsky V.G. Alvarez O. Benos D.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 287-300Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Electrical connections were made through Ag/AgCl electrodes using 3 m KCl and 3% agar bridges. Voltage was applied to the cis chamber, and thetrans chamber was held at virtual ground. Oocyte membrane vesicles were applied to a preformed bilayer with a glass rod from thetrans compartment with the membrane potential held at −40 mV. In most cases, the channels were oriented with the amiloride-sensitive extracellular side facing the transsolution and the cytoplasmic side facing the cis solution. Only membranes containing a single ion channel were used for experimentation. Data analysis was performed as previously described (30Ismailov I.I. Shlyonsky V.G. Alvarez O. Benos D.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 287-300Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles from oocytes injected with water did not produce currents with properties of BNaC-2. Standard methods for oocyte isolation, cRNA preparation, and injection were applied (31Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, eggs were removed from anesthetized frogs (Xenopus laevis) and stored in nominally Ca2+-free OR-2 solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 5.0 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.5)). Stage V–VI oocytes were isolated and defolliculated manually. The defolliculated oocytes were transferred to L15 medium modified for use with amphibian cells and supplemented with gentamycin sulfate (25 mg/ml). Oocytes were permitted to recover overnight at 19 °C before injection. cRNA was transcribed from appropriately linearized vectors using either T7 or SP6 polymerase promoters. Pipettes for microinjecting cRNA were pulled and beveled. Individual oocytes were injected with cRNA for BNaC-2 (25 ng in 50 nl of water). Control injections consisted of 50 nl of RNase-free water. Injected oocytes were kept in 24-well cell culture plates containing modified L15 media in groups of three to six oocytes/well at 19 °C for 2–3 days to allow for channel synthesis and insertion. Membrane vesicles were prepared following the method of Perez et al. (34Perez G. Lagrutta A. Adelman J.P. Toro L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 30 or 40 oocytes were washed in a high-potassium/sucrose medium containing the following protease inhibitors: 25 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.0 µg/ml DNase I. Oocyte membranes were isolated by discontinuous sucrose gradient density centrifugation and resuspended in 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, and 5.0 mm MOPS (pH 6.8). Membrane vesicles were separated into 50-µl fractions and stored at −80 °C until used. Single channel traces of WT BNaC-2 incorporated into planar lipid bilayers at neutral or acidic extracellular pH are shown in Fig.1a. When bathed in 100 mm NaCl, these channels displayed a conductance of 20 picosiemens; and at neutral pH, they were only open an average 8% of the time. However, lowering the trans solution pH to 6.2 caused the channel to remain open >90% of the time (Po = 0.90 ± 0.08, n = 10). Fig. 1b shows the effects of amiloride on WT BNaC-2 activity at pH 6.2. Amiloride produced a flickery block of the channel, consistent with its effects on other members of the degenerin/ENaC family (35Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 36Benos D.J. Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Johnson J.P. J. Membr.

At pH 7.4, the apparent equilibrium inhibitory dissociation constant (Ki) for amiloride was 0.82 ± 0.09 µm (n = 7). At pH 6.2, the curve was slightly right-shifted, with Ki = 2.0 ± 0.23 µm (n = 6). There was no indication that lowering the extracellular pH changed the conductance or produced a time-dependent ion activation or inactivation of channel activity (see “Discussion”). Under asymmetric solutions of NaCl, WT BNaC-2 displayed a permeability (P)PNa/PCl ratio of 9:1 (n = 5) (data not shown). This cation/anion ratio was not altered by pH changes. Fig. 1d presents a summary of the results of experiments in which WT BNaC-2 was examined for its ability to discriminate between Na+ and K+ at neutral and acid extracellular pH values. The opened and closed circles represent the current-voltage curves obtained under symmetrical conditions of NaCl and different pH values. The cis solutions of the same bilayer containing the channel were then replaced with 100 mm KCl either at pH 7.4 (open squares) or with the external solution reduced to pH 6.2 (closed squares), and bi-ionic reversal potentials were measured. The reversal potential at pH 7.4 under bi-ionic conditions was ∼50 mV; using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz formulation, this translated into aPNa/PK of 7:1. However, when the external pH was lowered to 6.2, the reversal potential shifted to 18 mV, indicating that the relative Na+versus K+ permeability ratio was reduced to 2.0. Genetic studies in C. elegans have identified specific mutations in proteins homologous to the mammalian BNaCs that produce neurodegeneration (38Chalfie M. Wolinsky E.

Fig. 2presents the results of these experiments. Substituting a phenylalanine for glycine at position 433 of BNaC-2 resulted in constitutive activation of the channel, increasing Po from 0.08 ± 0.03 in the WT channel to 0.89 ± 0.09 (n = 5). The channel's sensitivity to amiloride (Fig.2, b and c) was slightly right-shifted compared with the WT channel (∼2.5 µmversus 0.8 µm at pH 7.4). However, this constitutively activated channel was insensitive to reduction of extracellular pH (Fig.2a, lower trace). Also, acidification did not change the Ki for amiloride (Ki = 2.55 ± 0.20 µm at pH 7.4 (n = 8)versus Ki = 2.45 ± 0.24 µm at pH 6.2) of this gain-of-function mutation, in contrast to the WT channel. Another difference between G433F BNaC-2 and the WT channel was the poor ability of the mutant to discriminate between Na+ and K+,PNa/PK = 2.5:1.PNa/PK was determined from reversal potential measurements under bi-ionic conditions, which were not affected by acidification (Fig. 2d). To determine the relationship between the pH andPo of BNaC-2, we performed additional pH clamp experiments. The single channel activities of both WT BNaC-2 and G433F BNaC-2 were measured under conditions in which the pH of thetrans bathing compartment was varied. These results are summarized in Fig. 3. Acidification of the bathing solution increased the activity of WT BNaC-2. In contrast, the Po of constitutively activated G433F BNaC-2 was unaffected by alterations in pH, at least over the pH range 6.2–7.4. All of the aforementioned sets of experiments were performed with ∼10 µm Ca2+ in the bilayer bathing solution. Because the role of Ca2+ in modulating native and cloned epithelial Na+ channels is well established (48Silver R.B. Frindt G. Windhager E.E. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F557-F564PubMed Google Scholar, 49Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 50Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K.

Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we next tested the hypothesis that Ca2+ may influence the activity of BNaC-2. Fig. 4 displays current traces of WT BNaC-2 at pH 7.4 in a planar lipid bilayer. In Fig. 4a, theupper trace was obtained under control conditions in which the channel was bathed with standard 100 mm NaCl solution containing ∼10 µm Ca2+ as determined by Fura-2 measurements. Buffering the solutions bathing both sides of the bilayer with EGTA to be nominally free of Ca2+ (lower trace) increased the open probability of BNaC-2 (from 0.08 ± 0.02 to 0.91 ± 0.08 (n = 8)). Subsequent elevation of the concentration of Ca2+ in either compartment of the bilayer chamber resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in Po, but not in the unitary conductance of the channel. In Fig. 4a, the effects of increasing the cis Ca2+concentration (either 5, 10, or 25 µm) on the single channel activity are shown. A comparable outcome was observed when addition of Ca2+ was made to the transcompartment of the bilayer chamber, albeit with a different dose dependence (Fig. 4, b and c). Also, the efficacy of both cis and trans Ca2+ as blockers of BNaC-2 was dependent upon membrane voltage (Fig.4d). trans and cis Ca2+ dose-response curves at holding potentials of −100 and +100 mV are shown in Fig. 4(b and c, respectively). Fitting the experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation transformed for open probabilities allowed the calculation of [Ca2+] required for half-maximal inhibition of the channels (Ki(Ca)). The trans Ki(Ca) was 51.3 ± 6.9 µm(n = 7) at +100 mV and 2.4 ± 0.36 µm (n = 7) at −100 mV; the cis Ki(Ca) was 1.4 ± 0.21 µm(n = 9) at +100 mV and 35.6 ± 5.4 µm (n = 7) at −100 mV. Fig.4d presents a semilogarithmic plot of cis andtrans Ki(Ca) as a function of applied membrane voltage. The lines through the data points were computed from the Woodhull formulation (52Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar) using a best fit approach and varying δ in the Woodhull equation,KD(V) =KD(0)·exp(δ·z·F·V/R·T), where KD(V) and KD(0) are Ca2+ inhibitory dissociation constants at given and zero holding potentials, respectively; δ is the fraction of the electric distance between the surface of the channel and the binding site; z is the valence of the blocker; and T,F, V, and R have their usual meanings. An assumption utilizing this equation is that the binding sites for Ca2+ are located within the electric field. From these plots, there was an inverse voltage dependence between cisand trans inhibition of BNaC-2 by Ca2+, suggesting a minimum of two binding sites within the electric field. The locations of these sites computed by this equation are at 18 ± 1.9 and 20 ± 2.1% of the electric field from thecis and trans surfaces of the channel, respectively. Thus, we conclude that our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Ca2+ directly blocks BNaC-2 in a manner similar to that of the rat epithelial sodium channel and in a manner similar to that of amiloride-sensitive channels recorded in native epithelial cells (48Silver R.B. Frindt G. Windhager E.E. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F557-F564PubMed Google Scholar, 49Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. J. Gen.

J. 1997; 72: 1182-1192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As described above, a decrease in pH resulted in some changes in the basic biophysical profile (e.g. ion selectivity and amiloride inhibition) of BNaC-2 activity. These changes prompted us to test the possibility that the effects of trans andcis Ca2+ could be different on BNaC-2 activity at decreased pH. Fig. 5 presents a similar analysis done for the WT channel at pH 6.2. Buffering the bilayer bathing solution to be nominally free (<10 nm) of Ca2+ with EGTA had little effect on the open probability of the channel (Fig. 5a). However, increasing the concentrations of Ca2+ in either the cis ortrans compartment reduced the single channel open probability in a dose-dependent fashion. Fig. 5(b and c) presents the trans andcis Ca2+ dependence at −100 and +100 mV. Compared with pH 7.4, the effectiveness of either cis ortrans Ca2+ as an inhibitor of channel activity was diminished by nearly an order of magnitude at either +100 or −100 mV at lower pH. The voltage dependence at pH 6.2 of the Ca2+ block of BNaC-2 is shown in Fig. 5d. The apparent electrical distances for Ca2+ from both thecis and trans solutions were the same as determined at pH 7.4, viz. 18 and 20%, respectively. The simplest explanation for these observations is that hydrogen ions compete for Ca2+ by binding to the same sites. The effects of cis and transCa2+ on the activity of G433F BNaC-2 at pH 7.4 and 6.2 were also examined. These experiments are summarized in TableI. Because this mutant channel was constitutively activated, buffering the bathing solution to <10 nm free Ca2+ with EGTA had no significant effect on Po at either pH 7.4 or 6.2 (data not shown). Addition of Ca2+ to either the cis ortrans compartment produced a voltage- and concentration-dependent decrease inPo. Table I summarizes these data and provides a comparison with the WT channel. The major effect of this GF mutation was to reduce the effectiveness of Ca2+ in blocking the channel at all applied voltages and at both pH values. The locations within the electric field of both the cis andtrans Ca2+-binding sites were unaffected by the G433F mutation.Table ICa2+ inhibitory constants for WT BNaC2 and GF BNaC2 at different voltages and pH values in planar lipid bilayersWild-type BNaC2G433F BNaC2pH 7.4pH 6.2pH 7.4pH 6.2[Ca2+]cis[Ca2+]trans[Ca2+]cis[Ca2+]trans[Ca2+]cis[Ca2+]trans[Ca2+]cis[Ca2+]transKi, −100 mV (µm)35.6 ± 5.42.4 ± 0.36469 ± 5940 ± 5.7122 ± 1512 ± 2.01454 ± 180164 ± 20Ki, +100 mV (µm)1.4 ± 0.2151.3 ± 6.918 ± 4.3772 ± 857.8 ± 1.1198 ± 3094 ± 111944 ± 240 Open table in a new tab We have examined BNaC-2, a member of the degenerin/ENaC superfamily of ion channels, using a model planar lipid bilayer approach. Both WT BNaC-2 and GF BNaC-2 formed functional amiloride-sensitive Na+channels. Decreasing the pH had a differential effect on their biophysical properties. A decrease in pH activated a predominantly closed WT channel, but had little or no influence on constitutively activated GF BNaC-2. Also, a decrease in pH resulted in slight rightward shift of amiloride sensitivity (∼0.8 µm at pH 7.4 versus ∼2 µm at pH 6.2) and decreased the ability of WT BNaC-2 to select between Na+ and K+ (fromPNa/PK = 7:1 at pH 7.4 toPNa/PK = 2:1 at pH 6.2). These maneuvers with pH had no effect on the amiloride sensitivity (∼2.5 µm) and cation selectivity of GF BNaC-2. The fact that the introduction of the GF point mutation in the pre-M2 region of BNaC-2 resulted in changes in channel activity and selectivity may be indicative of involvement of this residue in pore and/or selectivity filter formation. In fact, mutation at a similar position in MDEG (BNaC-1) led to a change in ion selectivity and conductance (22Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

It is thought that the intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity of CBP acetylates histone proteins and specific transcription factors to promote the remodeling of compact chromatin structures and hence modulate transcription activity. On the other hand, the adenoviral protein E1A inhibits transcription, in part, by sequestering CBP (37Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Thus, stable interactions with transcription factors are important for CBP function.The purpose of this study was to examine transactivation mediated by NFATc4. Since NFATc4 has been implicated in multiple biological processes, understanding the molecular mechanism of NFATc4-mediated transcription activation is an important goal. We report that binding of CBP potentiates NFATc4-mediated transcription activity. Two transactivation domains on the NFATc4 protein are identified. Each transactivation domain interacts with CBP on a distinct region. Both transactivation domains of NFATc4 are required for CBP potentiation of transcription activity. Removal of one of the transactivation domains of NFATc4 abolishes CBP potentiation. Conversely, mutation of the KIX or CH3 domain prevents CBP-mediated potentiation of NFATc4 transcription activity. These results indicate that NFATc4 functionally interacts with CBP at two distinct sites. The transcription factor NFAT group was first characterized as an important regulator of interleukin-2 (IL-2)1 gene expression (1Durand D.B. Shaw J.P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Other cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) have also been shown to be regulated by NFAT (2Lee H.J. Masuda E.S. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Biol.

Four members of the NFAT group (NFATc1/NFATc/NFAT2, NFATc2/NFATp/NFAT1, NFATc3/NFAT4/NFATx, and NFATc4/NFAT3) have been identified (reviewed in Refs. 5Crabtree G.R.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). The wide tissue distribution of these NFAT isoforms suggests that NFAT may participate in multiple physiological processes. Within the NFAT group of proteins, NFATc4/NFAT3 is the member that is primarily expressed in nonimmune tissues (7Hoey T. Sun Y.L. Williamson K. Xu X.

Recently, NFATc4 activities have been implicated in heart hypertrophy, adipocyte differentiation, and learning and memory (8Ho I.C. Kim J.H. Rooney J.W. Spiegelman B.M. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl.

NFAT is present in the cytoplasm of resting cells (5Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 6Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

Phosphorylation of NFAT by these protein kinases opposes nuclear translocation of NFAT. Thus, opposing actions of protein kinases and the phosphatase calcineurin regulate the subcellular localization of NFAT. Activated nuclear NFAT interacts with other transcription factors to induce gene expression (6Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Indeed, structural studies have demonstrated interactions between NFAT and the Fos·Jun (AP-1) complex (24Chen L. Glover J.N. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 25Zhou P. Sun L.J. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Verdine G.L.

Formation of a ternary NFAT·Fos·Jun protein complex on DNA suggests that this complex may function as a composite transcription enhancer. The interaction of NFAT with GATA, myocyte enhancer factor-2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ suggests that NFAT may often function at composite DNA elements (9Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R.

Further studies on NFAT transactivation will thus provide better understanding on NFAT-mediated gene expression. The coactivator CBP was first identified as a binding partner for the transcription factor CREB and the adenoviral E1A protein (30Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H.

Kex2 can be distinguished from degradative subtilisins on the basis of stringent substrate specificity and distinct pre-steady-state behavior. To better understand these mechanistic differences, we have examined the effects of substrate residues at P1 and P4 on individual steps in the Kex2 catalytic cycle with a systematic series of isosteric peptidyl amide and ester substrates. The results demonstrate that substrates based on known, physiological cleavage sites exhibit high acylation rates (≥550 s−1) with Kex2. Substitution of Lys for the physiologically correct Arg at P1 resulted in a ≥200-fold drop in acylation rate with almost no apparent effect on binding or deacylation. In contrast, substitution of the physiologically incorrect Ala for Nle at P4 resulted in a much smaller defect in acylation and a modest but significant effect on binding with Lys at P1. This substitution also had no effect on deacylation. These results demonstrate that Kex2 utilizes enzyme-substrate interactions in different ways at different steps in the catalytic cycle, with the S1-P1 contact providing a key specificity determinant at the acylation step.

These “kexin/furin” enzymes are serine proteases belonging to the subtilase superfamily, a group that includes the well characterized subtilisins (9Philipp M. Bender M.L. Mol. Cell.

Whereas the subtilisins are digestive enzymes acting either extracellularly or in proteolytically active compartments such as the lysosome or the yeast vacuole, the processing proteases are active in intracellular compartments involved in sorting and secretion. As might be expected, the processing proteases are much more specific than the degradative subtilisins (13Grøn H. Meldal M. Breddam K.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, it has also been possible to distinguish these two families of serine proteases on the basis of their pre-steady-state behavior (9Philipp M. Bender M.L. Mol. Cell.

This last finding suggests that the processing proteases may have adapted the classical serine protease mechanism (10Perona J.J. Craik C.S.

Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985Google Scholar) to their in vivo function during evolution in a manner not previously appreciated. Serine proteases hydrolyze ester and amide substrates via a mechanism involving the generation and subsequent hydrolysis (or transamidation) of a covalent acylenzyme intermediate (10Perona J.J.

It had been thought classically that in cleavage of amide substrates, serine proteases were limited by the rate of acylation (commonly referred to ask2), because this step involves the hydrolysis of a resonance-stabilized amide bond rather than the more labile ester cleaved in the deacylation step (whose rate is referred to as k3). Early experiments with chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates analogous to single amino acids seemed to confirm this notion (9Philipp M. Bender M.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 51: 5-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985Google Scholar). Furthermore, substrates incorporating scissile esters rather than amides exhibited an initial burst of product formation caused by rate-limiting deacylation (21Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985Google Scholar, 24Hartley B.S. Kilby B.A. Biochem. J. 1954; 56: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For the subtilisin family, work with larger oligopeptide substrates also confirmed this expectation (9Philipp M. Bender M.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 51: 5-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), in contrast to the evolutionarily unrelated serine proteases of the trypsin/chymotrypsin family (25Hedstrom L. Szilagyi L. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 255: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, the pre-steady-state behavior of Kex2 protease is at odds with this model, because the enzyme exhibits burst kinetics in cleavage of amide substrates based on known, physiological Kex2 cleavage sites (aliphatic/basic P4, basic P2, Arg at P1; Refs. 14Brenner C.

It was thus possible that this behavior was an artifact of the activated leaving group. However, otherwise identical substrates with either coumarin leaving groups or authentic peptide bonds are cleaved with essentially identical values ofkcat/KM (15Rockwell N.C. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent work has demonstrated that burst kinetics are also seen in Kex2 cleavage of an actual peptide bond, and this behavior requires the presence of the physiologically correct P1 Arg (28Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3657-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the acylation rate for Kex2 cleavage of peptide bonds must be substantially higher than some subsequent step, such as deacylation or product release. It has also recently been demonstrated that hydrolysis of the acylenzyme is rate-limiting for Kex2 protease in cleaving a substrate that exhibits burst hydrolysis (28Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3657-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This body of work suggested that catalysis by processing proteases such as Kex2 and furin involves an adaptation of the serine protease mechanism to allow rapid acylation in cleavage of sites resembling those in physiological substrates, e.g. with Arg at P1, but not in cleavage of nonphysiological sites. The much slower rate of deacylation relative to acylation in cleavage of physiologically correct sequences suggested that the energy of enzyme-substrate interactions might be used differentially during different points in the catalytic cycle. To test this model and better understand the means by which processing enzymes such as Kex2 and furin may distinguish authentic physiological substrates from other potential cleavage sites, we have measured or estimated substrate binding, acylation rate, and deacylation rate for sequences containing correct or incorrect P4 and P1 residues. The results are consistent with a model whereby correct enzyme-substrate contacts are used to drive acylation, with less effect on binding and essentially no effect on deacylation. Kex2 protease was purified as described (15Rockwell N.C. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The peptidyl-MCA2 substrates Ac-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA, Ac-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Lys↓MCA, Ac-Ala-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA, and Ac-Ala-Tyr-Lys-Lys↓MCA have been described previously (16Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Z-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA and Z-Ala-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA were prepared as described (15Rockwell N.C. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with the use of suprastoichiometric LiCl to solubilize the peptides (17Krysan D.J. Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23229-23234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The synthesis of Z-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Lys↓MCE and Z-Ala-Tyr-Lys-Lys↓MCE has been described elsewhere (27Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Fuller R.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The preparation of Z-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Lys↓MCE used in these experiments was contaminated with a minor amount of Z-Nle-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Lys↓MCE, apparently arising from contaminants in commercially available Z-Nle (Bachem), but this minor species did not affect our results (data not shown). Kex2 protease was reacted with substrates in 0.2 m Bistris, pH 7.26, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 at 21 °C (standard conditions for this work). The reactions were quenched with 1 m acetic acid (600 µl added to a reaction volume of 100 µl), and product formation was measured by fluorescence as described (15Rockwell N.C. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Some reactions were run in the above conditions but at 37 °C, as reported previously (15Rockwell N.C. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The difference in pH associated with the temperature change was negligible for these experiments (data not shown). For measurement of deacylation rates, some substrates were examined in 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 at 21 °C. The reaction conditions are indicated in the tables and figure legends as appropriate. Active site titration with the substrate Ac-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA indicated that these different reaction conditions did not result in a change in the active enzyme concentration in the reaction (data not shown). Substrate stocks were prepared as described (27Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Fuller R.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Kex2 cleavage of these substrates was examined in 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 at 21 °C to minimize hydrolysis of the ester (27Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Fuller R.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reactions were quenched with acetic acid, and fluorescence was measured exactly as described (27Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Fuller R.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Z-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Lys↓MCE and Z-Ala-Tyr-Lys-Lys↓MCE were prepared in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and reacted with Kex2 in 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 in a Kintek RQF-3 rapid quenched flow mixer exactly as described (27Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Fuller R.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This protocol minimized nonspecific ester hydrolysis. Ac-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA was examined using either this procedure or the method previously reported (16Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and no difference between these methods was observed. Z-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA, Ac-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA, and Z-Ala-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA (1–200 µm) were reacted with Kex2 (260–520 nm) in an Applied Photophysics stopped flow fluorimeter. The data were typically collected at photomultiplier tube voltages between 550 and 620 V with an offset of 4.99 V using an excitation wavelength of 380 or 385 nm with a 1-nm bandwidth. Emission was monitored with a 460-nm band pass interference filter (10 nm full width at half-maximum band pass; CVI Laser, Albuquerque, NM). Four data points/ms were collected for 100–1000 ms, and the data were transferred to Kaleidagraph for analysis. For comparison, substrate base lines were prepared using mock reactions lacking enzyme. Base lines were stable, with no significant enzyme-independent change during the time course of the reaction. At least four trials were recorded at each substrate concentration. The data from the individual time courses described above showed an initial drop in fluorescence attributed to completion of mixing in the cuvette, followed by an initial burst and a linear steady state (representative trials shown in Fig. 1). Time points after completion of the initial mixing phase (t > 1.5 ms) were fit to Equation 1 using nonlinear regression. Equation 1 describes an initial exponential transient followed by a linear steady state with an arbitrary intercept (to accommodate the arbitrary fluorescence units). F(t)=F0+A(1−e−kobst)+uobst(Eq. 1) In this equation, F(t) is the fluorescence at time t, F0 is the arbitrary intercept (in V), A is the apparent amplitude of the transient (also in V), kobs is the observed rate of the burst (in s−1), and Vobs is the steady-state rate (in V/s). Residuals were calculated as (observed fluorescence − calculated fluorescence)/(calculated fluorescence) and showed no systematic deviation from the origin as a function of time (data not shown), indicating that the data were adequately described by this model. For Ac-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA it was occasionally necessary to constrain the fit by using the known base line as F0. The steady-state rate Vobs should follow the Michaelis-Menten equation when followed as a function of substrate concentration (21Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985Google Scholar), so Vobs was plottedversus [S]. The resulting plots showed well behaved saturation behavior without apparent substrate inhibition or other complications (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Kinetic parameters derived from these plots agreed reasonably well with values determined using other procedures (all values within 50%; data not shown). To examine the acylation phase itself, we plotted the burst ratekobs as a function of substrate concentration [S]. This quantity should follow a modified Michaelis-Menten relationship (Equation 2), with the acylation ratek2 as the maximal quantity (Vmax equivalent) and the enzyme-substrate affinity constant KS as the half-maximal binding constant (pre-steady-state KM; Ref. 21Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985Google Scholar). kobs([S])=k2[S]KS+[S](Eq. 2) The observed data did follow an apparent saturation relationship (Fig. 3 and data not shown), but it did not seem well behaved. Observed burst rates at higher substrate concentrations deviated from predicted behavior, and data at lower substrate concentrations were equally well described by a linear model until a rate of ∼550 s−1 was reached. This rate corresponds to a half-time of 1.3 ms, comparable with the apparent dead time for the instrument of 1.5 ms. These deviations from ideal behavior as predicted by both the saturation relationship and simulations suggested that the apparent saturation could be caused by a machine limit and not by true saturation of the initial burst phase, so we consider the apparentk2 values to be lower bounds. We wished to characterize Kex2 specificity throughout the catalytic cycle to expand upon our understanding of how this enzyme recognizes physiologically correct cleavage sites. We therefore focused on the Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓ sequence we had previously used to mimic the Met-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓ cleavage site found in the Kex2 substrate pro-α-factor (3Fuller R.S. Sterne R.E. Thorner J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 345-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 28Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3657-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Deacylation is known to be rate-limiting for this sequence with amide substrates (28Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3657-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), so the deacylation rate (k3) for this sequence is simply given by kcat. However, we also wished to examine earlier events in the catalytic cycle. We utilized Z-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA and Ac-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA for this purpose. Z-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA was chosen because we suspected that substitutions at P1 resulted in rate-limiting acylation, necessitating the use of ester substrates to examine the deacylation step, and we had found that tetrapeptidyl methylcoumarin ester substrates (peptidyl MCEs; Ref. 27Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Fuller R.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and synthetic intermediates leading to them were easier to obtain as solid products with N-terminal Z groups than with N-terminal Ac groups, 3N. C. Rockwell and R. S. Fuller, unpublished observations. whereas Ac-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA had previously been used to demonstrate rate-limiting deacylation (28Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3657-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The use of peptidyl-MCE substrates also necessitated a lower pH to reduce nonspecific hydrolysis (27Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Fuller R.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but preliminary experiments using rapid quenched flow techniques at either pH 7.26 or pH 6.0 indicated that the pre-steady-state behavior of Kex2 cleavage of Ac-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA was not significantly altered at the lower pH (data not shown). To examine early events in the Kex2 catalytic cycle (binding and acylation, referred to as KS andk2 in the tables), we attempted to examine the saturation behavior of the burst phase of Kex2 cleavage of these substrates. When deacylation is rate-limiting, the initial approach to the steady state occurs as an exponential transient whose rate is a function of the substrate concentration, binding constant, and acylation rate (21Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985Google Scholar). Therefore, examination of the apparent burst rate (kobs in Equation 1) as a function of substrate concentration should give a Michaelis-Menten relationship withKS as the pre-steady-state KM andk2 as the pre-steady-statekcat. The steady-state portion of the reaction (represented as Vobs in Equation 1) should in turn follow a Michaelis-Menten relationship with the known steady-state parameters. Initial experiments using rapid quench techniques suggested that the acylation rate was extremely rapid (data not shown), so we attempted to examine these processes by stopped flow fluorimetry. Kex2 cleavage of Z-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓MCA was examined at 21 °C over a range of substrate concentrations from 1 to 100 µm, and the resulting data were fit to Equation 1 (representative trials at 5 and 25 µm substrate are shown in Fig.1). Analysis of the fitted data showed that the steady-state rate Vobs did indeed follow the expected behavior (Fig. 2), and the apparent burst rates initially seemed to exhibit saturation. However, detailed examination of the pre-steady-state rates (kobs) showed that there might be significant deviations from the predicted behavior at higher substrate concentrations, where the observed burst rate was ∼550 s−1 (Fig. 3). The observed rate constants were approximately linear with substrate concentration until this point was reached and then diverged from predicted saturation behavior to remain at this apparent limiting rate (Fig.3B). We were therefore concerned that the apparent saturation was due to a machine limit, in keeping with the observation that a rate constant of 550 s−1 corresponds to a half-time that is quite close to the dead time of the instrument (1.3 msversus 1.5 ms; “Materials and Methods”). Therefore, we have chosen to report this value as a lower bound for the acylation rate constant (k2 ≥ 550−1; TableI).Table IPre-steady-state rate constants for the Nle-Tyr-Lys-Arg↓ cleavage siteSubstrate21 °C, pH 7.2621 °C, pH 6.037 °C, pH 7.26KSk2k3k3k3µms−1s−1s−1s−1Z-βYKR↓MCA1-aβ = Nle.≥251-bMeasured or estimated by stopped flow at 21 °C in 0.2 m Bistris, pH 7.26, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100. k2and KS were derived from plottingkobsversus [S] as shown in Fig. 3.k3 was determined from plots ofVobsversus [S] as shown in Fig. 2.≥5501-bMeasured or estimated by stopped flow at 21 °C in 0.2 m Bistris, pH 7.26, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100. k2and KS were derived from plottingkobsversus [S] as shown in Fig. 3.k3 was determined from plots ofVobsversus [S] as shown in Fig. 2.191-bMeasured or estimated by stopped flow at 21 °C in 0.2 m Bistris, pH 7.26, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100. k2and KS were derived from plottingkobsversus [S] as shown in Fig. 3.k3 was determined from plots ofVobsversus [S] as shown in Fig. 2.271-eMeasured by saturation kinetics at 21 °C in 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100.871-gMeasured by saturation kinetics at 37 °C in 0.2 m Bistris, pH 7.26, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100.Ac-βYKR↓MCA≥121-cMeasured or estimated by stopped flow at 21 °C in 0.2 m Bistris, pH 7.26, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100. k2and KS were derived from plottingkobsversus [S] (Fig. 3).≥5501-cMeasured or estimated by stopped flow at 21 °C in 0.2 m Bistris, pH 7.26, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100. k2and KS were derived from plottingkobsversus [S] (Fig. 3).151-dMeasured by rapid quenched flow at multiple substrate concentrations in 0.2 m Bistris, pH 7.26, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 at 21 °C.

The consequences of such Ras/Raf interactions on cellular function have been extensively studied and found to result in the activation of the Raf/MEK/MAPK cascade. Ras-stimulated MAPK activity is not only required for cellular proliferation, but elevated MAPK activity is commonly associated with Ras transformation of both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Although elevated MAPK is absolutely required to maintain the transformed phenotype, the current model for Ras function implicates the requirement of additional signaling networks to produce the full spectrum of Ras-dependent biological end points. Several lines of evidence, in support of this model, indicate that oncogenic Ras facilitates the activation of multiple Ras effector pathways that cooperate to establish cellular transformation. The most direct evidence comes from Ras effector domain mutants that have been characterized to bind only a single Ras target (13White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M.

Co-expression, however, of any two of these Ras effector domain mutants induced the formation of foci, suggesting that Ras must activate more than one effector pathway to generate a transformed phenotype (9Rodriguez-Viciana P.

It is not clear, however, whether the role of PI 3-kinase in Ras-dependent transformation arises from a direct association with Ras-GTP or through other unidentified indirect mechanisms. This uncertainty is amplified by the failure to detect a stable complex between Ras and PI 3-kinase in vivo, even when both are transiently overexpressed (14Rubio I. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Downward J. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously published data showing that specific Ras isoforms have different affinities for Raf-1 in vivo. Using 10T1/2 fibroblasts transformed by minimal levels of G12V Ha-Ras, we observe that Raf-1 preferentially associates with c-N-Ras and not the ectopically expressed oncogenic Ha-Ras (12Hamilton M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have extended these observations by demonstrating that G12V Ha-Ras induces the secretion of EGF receptor (EGFR) ligands that promote the activation of c-N-Ras·Raf-1 complexes and, hence, up-regulate MAPK activity (18Hamilton M. Wolfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28155-28162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Together these observations suggest that G12V Ha-Ras does not interact with Raf-1 and requires the co-operative function of other signaling modules to generate transformation and elevate basal MAPK. Observations that Raf-CAAX does not substitute for oncogenic G12V Ha-Ras in the transformation of RIE-1 cells provide further evidence that Ha-Ras transformation is mediated by additional Raf-independent mechanisms (19Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to investigate whether oncogenic Ha-Ras requires a direct interaction with PI 3-kinase to mediate the transformation of epithelial cells. To address this issue we constructed a constitutively active Ha-Ras protein (Y64G/Y71G/F156L) that binds all known downstream Ras effectors except PI 3-kinase. Our results indicate that oncogenic Ha-Ras does not require a direct association with PI 3-kinase to transform rat intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells. Although a direct Ha-Ras/PI 3-kinase interaction is dispensable for the transforming activities of oncogenic Ha-Ras, we do find that loss of this direct interaction between Ha-Ras and PI 3-kinase greatly impairs migration of epithelial cells toward fibronectin. The F156L point mutation was introduced into Ha-Ras cDNA sequence using Altered Sites IIin vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega). Wild-type Ha-Ras cDNA and Y64G/Y71G Ha-Ras cDNA were subcloned into the pAlter-Ex2 vector. Mutagenesis reactions were carried out using the following mutagenesis oligonucleotide: ggaggatgccttatacacgttgg (Life Technologies, Inc.). The integrity of the Ha-Ras mutants was verified by sequence analysis. The cDNAs for the mutant Ha-Ras proteins were subcloned into QE-9 vector for bacterial expression and into the pcDNA3 vector for mammalian expression. IEC-6 (normal rat epithelium; small intestine) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1 unit/ml bovine insulin. Stable cells lines were generated by transfecting IEC-6 cells with the indicated constructs using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were plated at 106 in 100-mm dishes and transfected the next day with 4 µg of DNA, as specified by manufacturer. After 48 h the transfected cultures were split and placed in selection medium containing G418 (400 µg/ml). Control cell lines were transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3). After 14 days of drug selection individual resistant colonies were isolated and propagated for further analysis. Protein expression was assessed by Western blotting using anti-Ha-Ras monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). Stable clones that expressed the various Ha-Ras proteins at levels consistent with levels expressed in T24 bladder carcinoma cells were selected for further analysis. Partially purified membrane fractions were prepared by first lysing cells in 1× p21 buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 200 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1% saponin, protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (saponin lysis buffer). The cell ghosts were isolated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then solubilized in 1× p21 buffer containing 1% (w/v) CHAPS, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors (CHAPS lysis buffer), the samples were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved as the enriched membrane fraction. Fifty micrograms of the CHAPS fraction was resolved on SDS-PAGE (13% gel) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked with TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl), containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5% dry milk, and 1% calf serum for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS/Nonidet P-40, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed for 1 h (four changes) with TBS/Nonidet P-40 and incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The membranes were then washed for 2 h, and the immunoreactive bands were detected with ECL Plus Reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized on a Molecular Dynamics StormImager. Recombinant His6-tagged wild-type Ha-Ras, F156L Ha-Ras, and Y64G/Y71G/F156L Ha-Ras were purified from Escherichia coliusing a standard Ni2+ column and elution with EDTA. The purified proteins were concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged to p21 buffer using a Centricon 10 filtration unit. Ras proteins were incubated with [α-32P]GTP (final concentration, 10 µm) and 30 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C. At the indicated time points aliquots were collected on 0.2-µm nitrocellulose filters, and the amount of bound [α-32P]GTP was determined by scintillation counting. The total amount of Ras-[α-32P]GTP for each sample was determined by the addition of excess (35 mm) EDTA in identical reactions. Recombinant Ha-Ras proteins were purified and assayed for activity using a standard filter binding assay. 300-µg aliquots of recombinant Ha-Ras proteins (wild type, F156L, Y64G/Y71G/F156L, and G12V/Y40C) were covalently immobilized on silica resin as described previously (3Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 20DiBattiste D. Golubic M. Stacey D. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 637-643PubMed Google Scholar). Following the immobilization protocol, the covalently linked Ras proteins were again assayed for GTP binding activity. Equal amounts of each Ras protein was then loaded with either GDP or GMP-PNP (a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog) (3Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 21Moodie S.A. Paris M. Villafranca E. Kirshmeier P. Willumsen B.M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 447-454PubMed Google Scholar). IEC-6 cell lysate (250 µg) was incubated with the immobilized Ras proteins (25 µg) for 60 min at 4 °C. Similar experiments were performed using a rat brain lysate as a source of Ras effectors (20DiBattiste D. Golubic M. Stacey D. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 637-643PubMed Google Scholar). Following the 1-h incubation, the immobilized Ras proteins were washed three times with 1× p21 buffer containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mmdithiothreitol and 3 times with 1× p21 buffer alone. Laemmli sample buffer was then added to the washed silica beads, and the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were then immunoblotted for the known Ras effectors using the following antibodies: Raf-1 (Transduction Labs), B-Raf antiserum (Walter Kolch), PI 3-kinase, anti-p85 (Upstate Biotechnology), RalGDS antiserum (Steve Martin, Franz Hofer), Rin 1 (Transduction Labs), and AF6 (K. Kaibuchi). Antibodies for the p110 isoforms were obtained from Santa Cruz and used at the recommended 1:200 dilution. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected by Western analysis using a monoclonal phosphospecific antibody against the TEY phosphorylation sites of ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz). Total ERK2 was detected using anti-MAPK/ERK2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Phosphorylated Akt was detected by Western analysis using a polyclonal phosphospecific antibody against Ser473 of Akt, and total Akt using a polyclonal Akt antibody (New England Biolabs). Subconfluent cells stably expressing the various Ha-Ras mutants were plated at 1 × 105/100-mm dish in medium containing 10% serum and 0.3% agar over a previously poured layer of 0.6% agar. The cells were photographed after 21 days. The cells were plated at 7 × 105 in a 100-mm dish and 12 h later switched to serum-free DMEM (containing 0.1 unit/ml insulin) for 72 h. The monolayers were washed with TBS and lysed in p21 CHAPS lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis, and 200 µg of whole cell lysate was immunoprecipitated rotating at 4 °C, with 2 µg of anti-MAPK/ERK2 polyclonal IgG (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by a 2-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose (PAS). The PAS beads were then washed three times with 1× p21 buffer containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40. The kinase assay was performed as described previously using MBP as the substrate (3Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated MBP was visualized and quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics StormImager. The cells were plated at equal densities and incubated in serum-free DMEM supplemented with insulin for 48 h. The cells were washed with ice-cold TBS and allowed to swell in cold p21 buffer for 20 min. The cells were broken using a Dounce homogenizer, and cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. Enriched plasma membranes were collected by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm at 4 °C for 2 h. The P100 fraction was solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in 1× p21 CHAPS lysis buffer. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar). Fifty micrograms of solubilized plasma membrane was then immunoprecipitated with 4 µg of anti-PI 3-kinase p85 rabbit antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology) for a 1-h rotation at 4 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation with PAS. The PAS beads were washed three times with p21 buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EGTA). The PAS beads were then resuspended in 50 µl of kinase buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml sonicated phosphatidylinositol (Sigma), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (final concentration, 10 µm) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 150 µl of chloroform:methanol:concentrated HCl (50:100:1). The phosphatidylinositol lipids were extracted by the addition of 150 µl of chloroform, and the organic phase was removed and washed once with 150 µl of methanol, 1 m HCl (1:1) and subsequently dried in a Savant speed vac. The phosphatidylinositol lipids were resuspended in 15 µl of chloroform, and the entire reaction was spotted on a silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate (Whatman). Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-phosphate was resolved using chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide, water (86:76:10:14) and visualized on a Molecular Dynamics StormImager. An aliquot of the same plasma membrane preparations, used for the PI 3-kinase activity assays was blotted for PI 3-kinase using the p85 antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology). IEC-6 cells stably expressing either empty vector, F156L Ha-Ras, Y64G/F156L Ha-Ras or p110* (an activated p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase) were radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate (150 µCi/ml in phosphate-free DMEM) for 36 h in the presence of 10% dialyzed FBS. Total cellular lipids were extracted and treated as described by others (23Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly total cellular lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol, washed in methanol/EDTA, and deacylated using methylamine. Radiolabeled glycerophosphoinositides (gPIs) were separated using a Partisphere 5-SAX column (Whatman) (23Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The position of glycerophosphoinositide 3,4,5 triphosphate was determined from a standard generatedin vitro using immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase (anti-p110α antibody), [γ-32P]ATP and phosphatidylinositol 3,4 bisphosphate as the substrate. Identical reactions of radiolabeled standards were separated on TLC, scraped, eluted from the TLC plate, deacylated, and separated by HPLC as described above. Data from the HPLC separations were analyzed as follows. Each 1-ml fraction was counted for radioactivity. The amount of radioactivity eluting in the position consistent with the standards is expressed as a percentage of the total applied to the column for each individual analysis. This analysis results in artificially inflated values for the percentages of PI (3,4)P2 and PI (3,4,5)P3, resulting from the additional phosphate groups/molecule not normally associated with other phospholipids. This analysis, however, controls for differences in extraction and efficiency of deacylation between samples. Cell migration through collagen-coated filters was assayed using a multiwell chamber assay as described previously (24Anand-Apte B. Zetter B.R. Viswanathan A. Qiu R.G. Chen J. Ruggieri R. Symons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30688-30692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25Boyden S. J. Exp. Med. 1962; 115: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar). 10,000 cells from each cell line were plated in each well of the Boyden chamber. Cell migration was determined after a 4-h incubation in the chemotaxis chamber. Nonadherent cells were scraped off with phosphate-buffered saline, and cells that migrated to the underside of the filter were stained, fixed, and counted. Statistical analysis was performed on the values for stimulated migration. The data are expressed as the means of quadruplicate samples ± S.E. We have previously shown that recombinant Y64G/Y71G Ha-Ras forms stable complexes with Raf-1 but fails to physically associate with PI 3-kinase and neurofibromin. The structural changes arising from these point mutations also diminish its ability to form nucleotide-free stable complexes with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (21Moodie S.A. Paris M. Villafranca E. Kirshmeier P. Willumsen B.M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 447-454PubMed Google Scholar). It is very likely, therefore, that when expressed in cells these Ha-Ras proteins would not reach an adequate level of bound GTP to be active in signaling. To make Y64G/Y71G Ha-Ras exchange factor-independent we inserted an additional F156L point mutation. The insertion of this point mutation into wild-type Ha-Ras results in a protein with an accelerated exchange rate, making the Ras protein exchange factor-independent (26Quilliam L.A. Zhong S. Rabun K.M. Carpenter J.W. South T.L. Der C.J. Campbell-Burk S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1272-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We first examined the in vitro biochemical properties of Y64G/Y71G/F156L Ha-Ras. To verify that the addition of the F156L mutation yielded a Ras protein with constitutive activity, we tested its in vitro guanine nucleotide exchange rate. In the presence of millimolar MgCl2, wild-type Ha-Ras has a very slow guanine nucleotide exchange rate, with the half-life of Ras-GDP being greater than 20 min (27Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1A, wild-type Ha-Ras exchanges nucleotides very slowly, whereas both F156L and Y64G/Y71G/F156L Ha-Ras proteins exchange guanine nucleotides at a greatly accelerated rate. We next verified that the F156L mutation did not alter the effector selectivity of the Y64G/Y71G mutant. Covalently immobilized recombinant Ha-Ras proteins (wild type, F156L, or Y64G/Y71G/F156L) were loaded with GDP or GMP-PNP and incubated with whole cell lysates from IEC-6 cells. We also compared the in vitro binding properties of our mutant proteins to the previously characterized G12V/Y40C Ha-Ras effector mutant, which binds only PI 3-kinase. Wild-type Ha-Ras, F156L, and Y64G/Y71G/F156L Ha-Ras-GMP-PNP proteins formed stable complexes with Raf-1, whereas the G12V/Y40C mutant did not stably associate with Raf-1 (Fig. 1 B, panel i). All of the Ha-Ras proteins tested, except the variant carrying the Y64G mutation, formed stable complexes with the p85 subunit of dimeric PI 3-kinase (Fig.1 B, panel ii). The binding site for Ras-GTP and PI 3-kinase has been mapped to the p110 subunit. Work by other groups has also shown that Ha-Ras-GTP can associate with multiple isoforms of the p110 family in in vitro binding assays (6Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 8Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J.

Biol. 1994; 4: 798-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We tested, therefore, whether the mutation at position 64 rendered the Ha-Ras protein unable to associate with all of the different p110 subunits expressed in IEC-6 cells. All of the Ras proteins tested except the Y64G/Y71G/F156L Ha-Ras formed stable complexes with p110α and p110δ (Fig. 1 B, panels iii andvi). Although IEC-6 cells express easily detectable levels of both p110β and p110γ, we failed to detect a stable interaction between these two p110 isoforms and wild-type, F156L, or G12V/Y40C Ha-Ras (Fig. 1 B, panels iv and v). These data were confirmed using saturation experiments. Lysate exposed to a second round of naı̈ve Ha-Ras-GMPPNP did not possess any bound PI 3-kinase (either p85 or p110α or δ; data not shown). The remaining lysate possessed easily detectable levels of both p110β and γ, although there was a significantly reduced amount of both p110α and δ (data not shown). This supports our previous observation suggesting that Ha-Ras forms stable complexes with only p110α and p110δ from whole cell lysates. Wild-type Ha-Ras, F156L, and Y64G/Y71G/F156L Ha-Ras-GMP-PNP proteins formed stable complexes with Raf-1, whereas the G12V/Y40C mutant did not stably associate with Raf-1 (Fig. 1 B, panel i). Both the F156L and Y64G/Y71G/F156L Ha-Ras proteins formed stable complexes with B-Raf (data not shown), RalGDS (Fig.1 C, panel ii), Rin 1 (Fig. 1 C,panel i), and AF6 (data not shown) to a similar extent as those observed with wild-type Ha-Ras. The detection of an interaction between these Ha-Ras proteins and RalGDS is particularly instructive. The interaction between c-Ha-Ras-GTP and RalGDS has been reported to be in the low micromolar range (1–3 µm), a significantly weaker interaction than that of Ras-GTP with either Raf-1 (100 nm) or the p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase (150 nm) (8Rodriguez-Viciana P.

https://openalex.org/W2012346240,"We have previously shown that antigens complexed to the receptor-recognized form of α2-macroglobulin (α2M*) demonstrate enhanced immune responsiveness mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein LRP/CD91. Recently, we developed a proteinase-independent method to covalently bind antigens to α2M*. Given the potential applications of this chemistry, we analyzed the kinetics, thermodynamics, and pH dependence of this reaction. The incorporation of lysozyme into α2M* was a mixed bimolecular second-order reaction with a specific rate constant of 91.0 ± 6.9m−1 s−1, 50.0 °C, pH 7.4. The activation energy, activation entropy, and Gibbs’ free energy at 50.0 °C were 156 kJ mol−1, 266 J mol−1K−1, and 70 kJ mol−1, respectively. The rate of incorporation increased as a function of pH from pH 5.0 to 7.0 and was unchanged thereafter. Furthermore, the reaction between α2M* and lysozyme was irreversible. The data are consistent with a two-step mechanism. In the first step, α2M* reforms its thiol ester bond, entering a reactive state that mimics the proteolytically induced “nascent state.” In the rate-limiting second step, the reformed bond quickly undergoes nucleophilic attack by lysozyme. The kinetic equations derived in this study are the basis for optimizing the formation of stable α2M*·antigen complexes."
https://openalex.org/W4236459937,"Recent evidence suggests that increased translational efficiency of existing ribosomes alone is insufficient to account for the hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes and that synthesis of new functional ribosomes must occur. The rate-limiting step in ribosome accumulation is the transcription of the ribosomal 45S genes (rDNA) by RNA polymerase I. Our previous studies have demonstrated that increases in the expression of the rDNA transcription factor UBF correlated with hypertrophy of neonatal cardiomyocytes. These studies expand this observation to examine directly the hypothesis that increased UBF levels are an essential requirement for the initiation of cardiac hypertrophy. We demonstrate that the introduction of UBF antisense RNA into myocytes, using adenovirus approaches, efficiently inhibits UBF accumulation during induction of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, this approach results in a significant reduction in rDNA transcription, rRNA levels, and protein accumulation, which are all the hallmarks of cardiac growth. Furthermore, UBF antisense RNA expression did not alter re-expression of the fetal gene program, which confirmed that the effect was specific for transcription by RNA polymerase I. These findings demonstrate that an increase in rRNA synthesis is required for hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and also implicate UBF as a major regulatory factor in this process. Approaches that target UBF activity may be of therapeutic use in the regression of pathophysiological cardiac hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2049520040,"Grb4 is an adaptor protein consisting of three src homology (SH) 3 domains and a single SH2 domain. We previously cloned Grb4 as a direct interacting partner of Bcr-Abl and v-Abl via the Grb4 SH2 domain. We now show that overexpression of Grb4 results in significant inhibition of v-Abl-induced transcriptional activation from promitogenic enhancer elements such as activator protein 1 (AP-1) and serum-responsive element (SRE). We demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of Grb4 is independent of the direct interaction of v-Abl and Grb4: a Grb4 mutant that lacks a functional SH2 domain shows an even more pronounced inhibition of AP-1/SRE. Further mutational analysis revealed that the first two SH3 domains primarily mediate the inhibitory function. The inhibitory activity of Grb4 is specific for c-jun/c-fos-regulated promoter elements and is located downstream of MEKK1 and JNK because co-expression of Grb4 resulted in down-regulation of MEKK1-induced AP-1 activity without affecting JNK activity. Thus, the nuclear pool of Grb4 is likely to mediate this inhibition. Indeed, cell fractionation and fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that the stronger inhibitory potential of the Grb4 SH2 mutant occurred in conjunction with increased nuclear localization of this mutant. Our results suggest a novel role for Grb4 in the inhibition of promitogenic enhancer elements such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element and SRE.

SH3 domains are known to mediate interactions with proline-rich motifs; SH2 domains bind to specific phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Grb4 exhibits high homology to Nck (Nckα). For Nck, a functional role in JNK activation (6Stein E. Huynh-Do U. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. J. Biol.

Nck-interacting kinase has been reported to bind Nck and MEKK1 and activate the JNK/stress-activated protein kinase pathway (7Su Y.C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5542-5549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nck has been shown to transform fibroblasts (15Chou M.M. Fajardo J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas at this time, there are somewhat contradictory reports regarding the function of Grb4 on mitogenesis. Grb4 has been shown to cooperate with v-Abl to transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts and synergistically activate the Elk-1 pathway (3Braverman L.E. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5542-5549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Another group demonstrated that Grb4 is a potent inhibitor of epidermal growth factor-stimulated and platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis (2Chen M. She H. Davis E.M. Spicer C.M. Kim L. Ren R. Le Beau M.M. Li W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25171-25178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We previously identified Grb4 as a direct interaction partner of Bcr-Abl (5Coutinho S. Jahn T. Lewitzky M. Feller S. Hutzler P. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2000; 96: 618-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction resulted in a significant redistribution of both proteins, most likely involving actin reorganization. Other reports also describe an involvement of Grb4 in cytoskeletal reorganization. Tu et al. (4Tu Y. Li F. Wu C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3367-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) showed that Grb4 interacts with PINCH, a molecule that links growth factor receptors with integrin signaling. Recently, Chen et al. (16Chen M. She H. Kim A. Woodley D.T. Li W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7867-7880Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) showed that Grb4 but not Nck blocks Rac-1-mediated membrane ruffling and formation of lamellipodia. Thus, despite the high homology between Grb4 and Nck, the functional characteristics of both proteins seem to be quite different. In this report, we show that Grb4 inhibits the transcription from promitogenic promoters such as AP-1 and SRE. AP-1 acts as a dimeric DNA sequence-specific transcriptional activator composed of homo- or heterodimers of Jun, Fos, and/or ATF. Jun homodimers and Jun-Fos heterodimers preferentially recognize the TPA-responsive element, whereas Jun-ATF and ATF-ATF dimers bind to the cyclic AMP-responsive element. Activation of AP-1 has been reported to be induced after a variety of stimuli (including TPA, growth factors, cytokines, T-cell activation, neurotransmitters, and UV radiation) and to play a role in cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation (for a review, see Refs. 17Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar and 18Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). AP-1 activity is generally regulated by the expression level of AP-1 proteins and their activity state (19Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). AP-1 proteins have been reported to control their own expression level. Transcription of c-Jun is usually mediated through the TPA-responsive element (TRE), which is recognized by AP-1. Transcription of c-Fos is regulated by the SRE. In addition, secondary modificationse.g. modifications (e.g. phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues) enhance the stability of these proteins (20Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 21Tsurumi C. Ishida N. Tamura T. Kakizuka A. Nishida E. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. Inagaki M. Okazaki K. Sagata N. et al.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5682-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of c-Jun also results in increased transcriptional activity (22Smeal T. Hibi M. Karin M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6006-6010Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A co-activator designated JAB1 has been identified, and it stabilizes AP-1-DNA complexes by interaction with c-Jun or JunD (23Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Known inhibitors of AP-1 activity include ligands of nuclear receptors (e.g. glucocorticoid receptor), which are thought to reduce the interaction between c-Jun and the transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300 (24Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar), and the interferon-inducible p202, which interacts directly with c-Jun and c-Fos (25Min W. Ghosh S. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Another model proposed for the inhibition of AP-1 by ligand-activated nuclear receptors involves blocking of c-Jun phosphorylation (26Caelles C. Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Munoz A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3351-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The oncogene v-Abl has been shown to activate the serum-responsive and TPA-responsive elements (27Hori Y. Kaibuchi K. Fukumoto Y. Oku N. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1201-1206PubMed Google Scholar), which is correlated with its promitogenic potential. It could be demonstrated that v-Abl-induced activation of TPA-responsive elements is inhibited by dominant negative Rac-1 but not Ras, suggesting that Rac-1 is involved in the signal transduction pathway leading to activation of AP-1 (28Renshaw M.W. Lea-Chou E. Wang J.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 76-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, dominant negative Rac also inhibited v-Abl-induced activation of SRE and other mitogenic responses such as JNK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 activation (28Renshaw M.W. Lea-Chou E. Wang J.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 76-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Searching for a functional role for Grb4 in Abl-mediated signaling, we found that Grb4 is a potent inhibitor of v-Abl-induced activation of TRE and SRE. AP-1 inhibition by various Grb4 mutants with different subcellular localization strongly suggested that the nuclear pool of Grb4 mediates this inhibition. The anti-xpress™ antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). Anti-Abl antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen (8E9) and Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Ab3) (Schwalbach, Germany), anti-c-Jun (H-79) and anti p-c-Jun (KM-1) and anti-p-JNK (G-7) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz (Heidelberg, Germany). The Grb4 mutants were generated using polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. For mutation of the SH2 domain, arginine within the FLVR motif was changed to leucine. SH3 domains were mutated by exchange of the characteristic tryptophan with lysine (29Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). EYFP and ECFP mutants of EGFP and the EY(C)FP-Grb4 fusion constructs were obtained as described previously (5Coutinho S. Jahn T. Lewitzky M. Feller S. Hutzler P. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2000; 96: 618-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 293, NIH3T3 and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS7 cells were transfected using Gene Porter (GTS Inc., Biozol GmbH, Eching, Germany) according to manufacturer's recommendations. NIH3T3 cells were transfected using Gene Porter or Superfect™ (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 293 cells were transfected usingN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxyl)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammoniummethyl sulfate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were done as described previously (30Duyster J. Baskaran R. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, pelleted, and lysed in lysis buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 130 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton. Proteinase inhibitor mixture Complete™ tablets were added according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After clarification by centrifugation and preclearing with protein A-Sepharose, antibody-protein complexes were brought down with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lysates and bound fractions of immunoprecipitations were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotting was performed on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore GmbH, Eschborn, Germany). AP-1 activation was determined as described previously (5Coutinho S. Jahn T. Lewitzky M. Feller S. Hutzler P. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2000; 96: 618-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, in 293 cells or NIH3T3 cells, 1 μg of the AP-1/luciferase reporter construct, which contains a basic TATA promoter joined to tandem repeats of AP-1 or SRE binding elements (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), 100 ng of a plasmid carrying the β-GAL gene, and tagged Grb4 constructs as indicated were co-transfected with 1 μg of pCDNA3.1/v-Abl. Cells were cultured for 3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and a luminometer (Berthold, Pforzheim, Germany). For transforming growth factor β-mediated SMAD activation, 1 μg of a SMAD-dependent luciferase reporter construct was used instead of the AP-1 construct. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared as follows: transiently transfected 293 cells were pelleted, washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 300 mm sucrose, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Complete™; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After a short centrifugation, the cytosolic supernatant was removed, the nuclear pellet was again resuspended in buffer A, and extraction was repeated. Nuclear proteins were extracted by resuspending the nuclear pellet in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture). After 10 s of sonification and a pulse centrifugation, the supernatant containing the nuclear fraction was frozen. For shift and supershift assays, 3 μg of protein was used and incubated with the33P-labeled AP-1 probe at room temperature for 30 min. Antibodies (4 μg) were added as indicated. Complexes were separated by nondenaturing PAGE (8%). Gels were dried, and DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Fixation and detection of EGFP fusion constructs in fixed cells was done as described previously (5Coutinho S. Jahn T. Lewitzky M. Feller S. Hutzler P. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2000; 96: 618-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, COS7 cells were cultured and transfected on gelatin-coated chamber slides (Nunc GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany). 72 h after transfection, cells were starved for at least 6 h, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm vanadate, and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, overlaid with mounting medium (Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, The Netherlands), covered with a coverslide, and visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co. GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) connected to a digital imaging system (T.I.L.L. Photonics, Munich, Germany). For detection of ECFP and EYFP fluorochromes, the appropriate filter sets were used (Chroma; AHF AG, Tuebingen, Germany). The Mig-IRES-v-abl construct was cloned by ligating v-abl cDNA (a kind gift from J. Wang, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA) cut withBamHI/HindIII together with the ECMV-IRES sequence cut with EcoRI/BamHI into the MigRI vector (a kind gift from W. Pear, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA) cut with EcoRI andHindIII. The FLAG epitope-tagged Grb4-SH2 mutant cDNA was digested from the pcDNA3.1-Zeo vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) with PmeI and cloned into the HpaI site of the Mig-IRES-v-abl construct, generating Mig-Grb4SH2-v-abl. Viral particles were produced by transiently transfecting the ecotropic Phoenix cell line (kindly supplied by G. Nolan, Stanford University School of Medicine, Standford, CA) with the different constructs, as described previously (31Bai R.Y. Ouyang T. Miething C. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2000; 96: 4319-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 105 NIH3T3 cells were infected in 6-well plates in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene overnight. After 2 days, cells were analyzed for v-abl expression by intracellular staining for Abl, as described previously (32Hao S.X. Ren R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Equal numbers of infected cells were plated in duplicate in soft agar medium according to procedures described previously (31Bai R.Y. Ouyang T. Miething C. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2000; 96: 4319-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plates were monitored for colony growth, and photographs were taken after 20 days of culture. We previously identified Grb4 as a specific interaction partner of Bcr-Abl binding to the Abl portion of Bcr-Abl (5Coutinho S. Jahn T. Lewitzky M. Feller S. Hutzler P. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2000; 96: 618-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase binding assays revealed that this interaction is mediated by the SH3 as well as the SH2 domains of Grb4 and that Grb4 was able to bind to v-Abl in vitro (5Coutinho S. Jahn T. Lewitzky M. Feller S. Hutzler P. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2000; 96: 618-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the SH2 and SH3 domains for complex formation of Grb4 and v-Abl in vivo in more detail, we created a Grb4 SH2 mutant (Grb4SH2) and a Grb4 mutant with loss of function mutations in all three SH3 domains (Grb4SH3-1,2,3) of Grb4 (29Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In a third mutant, SH2 and SH3 mutations were combined (Grb4SH2/SH3-1,2,3) (TableI). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that co-expression of Grb4 and v-Abl resulted in complex formation between v-Abl and Grb4 independent of the kinase activity of v-Abl (Fig. 1 A, top panel, lanes 1 and 5). The complex between Grb4 and kinase-defective v-Abl (v-AblKD) was dependent on the SH3 domains but independent of the SH2 domain of Grb4 (Fig. 1 A, top panel, lanes 2–4). In contrast, complex formation between Grb4 and kinase-active v-Abl was significantly reduced by a mutation in the SH2 domain of Grb4 (Fig.1 A, top panel, lane 7). Mutation of the SH3 domains had little effect on complex formation with kinase-active v-Abl (Fig.1 A, top panel, lane 6). A similar result was obtained when we analyzed complex formation with the other oncogenic variant of Abl, Bcr-Abl (Fig. 1 B). Both kinase-defective Bcr-Abl (Bcr-AblKD) and kinase-active Bcr-Abl can co-immunoprecipitate Grb4 (Fig. 1 B, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). According to the data obtained with v-abl, the complex between Grb4 and Bcr-Abl was also abrogated by a mutation in the SH2 domain of Grb4 (Fig. 1 B, top panel, lane 3). Similar to v-Abl, kinase-defective Bcr-Abl binds to Grb4 independent of the SH2 domain but dependent on the SH3 domains (data not shown). Thus, in vivo complex formation between Grb4 and kinase-active v-Abl or Bcr-Abl is mediated mainly by the SH2 domain of Grb4. Interestingly, the SH3 domain only contributes to the complex of kinase-defective v-Abl and Grb4, suggesting that the SH3-mediated binding of Grb4 to v-Abl might be negatively regulated by phosphorylation.Table IGrb4 and Grb4 mutants Open table in a new tab Figure 1Complex formation between v-Abl and Grb4. A, kinase-defective v-Abl (KD) or v-Abl was co-expressed with either tagged (xpress™) Grb4, the triple SH3 Grb4 mutant (Grb4SH3–1,2,3), the SH2 mutant (Grb4SH2), or the combined mutant (Grb4SH2/SH3–1,2,3) in COS1 cells. The Grb4 mutants were immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-xpress™ antibody (first and third panels) or nonspecific rabbit anti-mouse antibody (RαM) as control (second panel). Immunoprecipitations were analyzed by αAbl antibody (first and second panel) or anti-xpress™ antibody (third panel) to demonstrate immunoprecipitation of Grb4. Lysates analyzed by αAbl antibody demonstrate equal expression of v-Abl in all samples (fourth panel). B,kinase-defective Bcr-Abl (KD) was co-expressed with tagged Grb4 WT (lane 1), and Bcr-Abl was co-expressed with either Grb4 or Grb4SH2 (lanes 2 and 3). The Grb4 proteins were immunoprecipitated using αexpress antibody (first and third panels) from lysates containing equal amounts of Bcr-Abl (fourth panel). Control immunoprecipitations were performed using equal amounts of rabbit anti-mouse antibody (RαM) (second panel). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using the antibodies indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously shown that co-expression of Grb4 with v-Abl resulted in inhibition of v-Abl-induced activation of an AP-1 reporter construct in a concentration-dependent manner (5Coutinho S. Jahn T. Lewitzky M. Feller S. Hutzler P. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2000; 96: 618-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were interested in discovering whether disruption of the direct interaction between v-Abl and Grb4 would have an effect on the Grb4-mediated AP-1 inhibition. Surprisingly, co-expression of v-Abl and the Grb4SH2 mutant that no longer binds to v-Abl caused an even stronger inhibition of v-Abl-mediated activation of an AP-1 reporter construct (Fig.2 A). Co-expression of v-Abl and Grb4SH2 resulted in about 30% more inhibition of AP-1 activity compared with that induced by the same amount of wild-type (WT) DNA (Fig. 2 A, compare bars 2 and 5). Western blot analysis of the lysates showed that the expression level of the Grb4SH2 mutant was even lower than that of WT Grb4 (Fig.2 B). In turn, compared with WT Grb4, the same extent of Grb4SH2-induced inhibition was obtained when only a third of the WT Grb4 DNA was transfected (76% versus 79% inhibition; Fig.2 A, compare bars 4 and 5). Therefore, the difference in the inhibitory activity is not due to the expression level of both proteins but is specific for the introduced mutation. All luciferase activities were normalized by β-GAL activity. β-GAL values after co-expression of a vector carrrying the β-GAL gene were similar and were not influenced by Grb4 co-expression (see Fig.3 C). In addition, in vitro translation of v-Abl in the presence or in the absence of Grb4 did not change the autophosphorylation capacity of v-Abl (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that the inhibitory activity of Grb4 upon AP-1 activity is independent of the direct interaction of v-Abl and Grb4 and is located downstream of v-Abl.Figure 3Grb4-mediated inhibition of MEKK1-induced AP-1 activity. A, 293 cells were co-transfected with the AP-1 reporter construct (1 μg), a plasmid containing the β-GAL gene (100 ng), constitutively active MEKK1 (50 ng), and tagged Grb4 constructs as indicated. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using β-GAL values. B, 293 cells were co-transfected with the SRE reporter construct (1 μg), a plasmid containing the β-GAL gene (100 ng), constitutively active MEKK1 (25 ng), and tagged Grb4 constructs (1 μg) or vector control (Ø; 1 μg). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using β-GAL values. C, 293 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid containing the β-GAL gene (100 ng), constitutively active MEKK1 (25 ng), and tagged Grb4 constructs (1 μg) or vector control (Ø; 1 μg). D, 293 cells were co-transfected with the SMAD-dependent luciferase reporter construct (1 μg), a plasmid containing the β-GAL gene (100 ng), constitutively active MEKK1 (25 ng), and tagged Grb4 constructs (1 μg) or vector control (Ø; 1 μg). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using β-GAL values. Data represent the relative luciferase activity of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further define the target in the signaling cascade of Grb4-mediated AP-1 inhibition, we tested whether MEKK1-induced AP-1 activity is affected by Grb4. Similar to v-Abl, co-expression of constitutively active MEKK1 and Grb4 resulted in inhibition of MEKK1-induced AP-1 activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). The SH2 mutant of Grb4 again exhibited significantly increased inhibition. The same result was obtained when we measured the effect of Grb4 on MEKK1-induced SRE activation using a different reporter construct (Fig.3 B). These results confirmed the data obtained with v-Abl. In addition, the inhibitory effect of Grb4 is also demonstrable with another promitogenic enhancer element such as SRE. Importantly, Grb4 did not show any detectable suppression of β-GAL activity (Fig.3 C) or of transforming growth factor β-inducible activation of a SMAD-responsive reporter construct (Fig.3 D). Thus, Grb4 specifically inhibits the activation of promitogenic reporter systems such as SRE and TRE downstream or at the same level of MEKK1. Grb4 consists of one C-terminal SH2 domain and three SH3 domains (Table I). Our data show that disruption of the SH2 domain even enhances the inhibitory effect on transription from TRE/SRE-regulated reporter constructs. To investigate the role of the Grb4 SH3 domains for the inhibition of these promitogenic enhancer elements, we created three additional single SH3 mutants of Grb4SH2 (Grb4SH2/SH3-1, Grb4SH2/SH3-2, and Grb4SH2/SH3-3) and a combination thereof by changing the central tryptophan to lysine within each SH3 domain (Table I) (29Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These mutants were co-expressed with MEKK1 and analyzed for their ability to down-regulate AP-1-dependent luciferase activity (Fig.4). Compared with the Grb4SH2 mutant, the triple SH3 mutant (Grb4SH2/SH3-1,2,3) failed to inhibit MEKK1-mediated AP-1 activation (Fig. 4, compare bars 2 and 6). When the single SH3 mutants in combination with the SH2 mutation were co-expressed with MEKK1, mutation of the first and the second SH3 domains resulted in significantly weaker inhibition compared with that of the mutation affecting the third SH3 domain (Fig. 4, comparebars 3, 4, and 5). Similar results were obtained for v-Abl-induced AP-1 activity (data not shown). These findings suggest that the first two SH3 domains of Grb4 mediate the inhibition of transcription from promitogenic enhancer elements such as TRE in this assay. JNK is a direct effector of MEKK1 (33Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). JNK regulates the transcriptional activation domain of c-jun for both the SRE and TRE enhancer elements. Therefore, we wished to determine the activity of JNK because it is located further downstream within the AP-1 signaling cascade. To test whether the inhibition of MEKK1-induced AP-1 activation is due to a decrease in JNK activity, we measured JNK activation and AP-1-dependent luciferase activity within the same cells (Fig. 5).
