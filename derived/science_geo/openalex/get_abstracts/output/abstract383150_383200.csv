https://openalex.org/W1981463058,"DNA methylation is one of the best-characterized epigenetic modifications. Although the enzymes that catalyse DNA methylation have been characterized, enzymes responsible for demethylation have been elusive. A recent study indicates that the human TET1 protein could catalyse the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) of DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), raising the possibility that DNA demethylation may be a Tet1-mediated process. Here we extend this study by demonstrating that all three mouse Tet proteins (Tet1, Tet2 and Tet3) can also catalyse a similar reaction. Tet1 has an important role in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell maintenance through maintaining the expression of Nanog in ES cells. Downregulation of Nanog via Tet1 knockdown correlates with methylation of the Nanog promoter, supporting a role for Tet1 in regulating DNA methylation status. Furthermore, knockdown of Tet1 in pre-implantation embryos results in a bias towards trophectoderm differentiation. Thus, our studies not only uncover the enzymatic activity of the Tet proteins, but also demonstrate a role for Tet1 in ES cell maintenance and inner cell mass cell specification."
https://openalex.org/W2144718635,"Both endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membranes are thought to contribute to the formation of autophagosomes during autophagy induction. We now learn that plasma membrane is also involved, and is partly targeted to the growing autophagosome through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Autophagy is a catabolic process in which lysosomes degrade intracytoplasmic contents transported in double-membraned autophagosomes. Autophagosomes are formed by the elongation and fusion of phagophores, which derive from pre-autophagosomal structures. The membrane origins of autophagosomes are unclear and may involve multiple sources, including the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Here we show in mammalian cells that the heavy chain of clathrin interacts with Atg16L1 and is involved in the formation of Atg16L1-positive early autophagosome precursors. Atg16L1 associated with clathrin-coated structures, and inhibition of clathrin-mediated internalization decreased the formation of both Atg16L1-positive precursors and mature autophagosomes. We tested and demonstrated that the plasma membrane contributes directly to the formation of early Atg16L1-positive autophagosome precursors. This may be particularly important during periods of increased autophagosome formation, because the plasma membrane may serve as a large membrane reservoir that allows cells periods of autophagosome synthesis at levels many-fold higher than under basal conditions, without compromising other processes."
https://openalex.org/W2061184183,"Protein ubiquitination is a post-translational modification (PTM) that regulates various aspects of protein function by different mechanisms. Characterization of ubiquitination has lagged behind that of smaller PTMs, such as phosphorylation, largely because of the difficulty of isolating and identifying peptides derived from the ubiquitinated portion of proteins. To address this issue, we generated a monoclonal antibody that enriches for peptides containing lysine residues modified by diglycine, an adduct left at sites of ubiquitination after trypsin digestion. We use mass spectrometry to identify 374 diglycine-modified lysines on 236 ubiquitinated proteins from HEK293 cells, including 80 proteins containing multiple sites of ubiquitination. Seventy-two percent of these proteins and 92% of the ubiquitination sites do not appear to have been reported previously. Ubiquitin remnant profiling of the multi-ubiquitinated proteins proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and tubulin alpha-1A reveals differential regulation of ubiquitination at specific sites by microtubule inhibitors, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method to characterize the dynamics of lysine ubiquitination."

https://openalex.org/W2158452837,"Background This study was designed to evaluate the hypothesis that the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among children in the United States is positively associated with socioeconomic status (SES). Methods A cross-sectional study was implemented with data from the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, a multiple source surveillance system that incorporates data from educational and health care sources to determine the number of 8-year-old children with ASD among defined populations. For the years 2002 and 2004, there were 3,680 children with ASD among a population of 557 689 8-year-old children. Area-level census SES indicators were used to compute ASD prevalence by SES tertiles of the population. Results Prevalence increased with increasing SES in a dose-response manner, with prevalence ratios relative to medium SES of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64, 0.76) for low SES, and of 1.25 (95% CI 1.16, 1.35) for high SES, (P<0.001). Significant SES gradients were observed for children with and without a pre-existing ASD diagnosis, and in analyses stratified by gender, race/ethnicity, and surveillance data source. The SES gradient was significantly stronger in children with a pre-existing diagnosis than in those meeting criteria for ASD but with no previous record of an ASD diagnosis (p<0.001), and was not present in children with co-occurring ASD and intellectual disability. Conclusions The stronger SES gradient in ASD prevalence in children with versus without a pre-existing ASD diagnosis points to potential ascertainment or diagnostic bias and to the possibility of SES disparity in access to services for children with autism. Further research is needed to confirm and understand the sources of this disparity so that policy implications can be drawn. Consideration should also be given to the possibility that there may be causal mechanisms or confounding factors associated with both high SES and vulnerability to ASD."
https://openalex.org/W1999491456,"Metal ion cofactors afford proteins virtually unlimited catalytic potential, enable electron transfer reactions and have a great impact on protein stability. Consequently, metalloproteins have key roles in most biological processes, including respiration (iron and copper), photosynthesis (manganese) and drug metabolism (iron). Yet, predicting from genome sequence the numbers and types of metal an organism assimilates from its environment or uses in its metalloproteome is currently impossible because metal coordination sites are diverse and poorly recognized. We present here a robust, metal-based approach to determine all metals an organism assimilates and identify its metalloproteins on a genome-wide scale. This shifts the focus from classical protein-based purification to metal-based identification and purification by liquid chromatography, high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry (HT-MS/MS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to characterize cytoplasmic metalloproteins from an exemplary microorganism (Pyrococcus furiosus). Of 343 metal peaks in chromatography fractions, 158 did not match any predicted metalloprotein. Unassigned peaks included metals known to be used (cobalt, iron, nickel, tungsten and zinc; 83 peaks) plus metals the organism was not thought to assimilate (lead, manganese, molybdenum, uranium and vanadium; 75 peaks). Purification of eight of 158 unexpected metal peaks yielded four novel nickel- and molybdenum-containing proteins, whereas four purified proteins contained sub-stoichiometric amounts of misincorporated lead and uranium. Analyses of two additional microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Sulfolobus solfataricus) revealed species-specific assimilation of yet more unexpected metals. Metalloproteomes are therefore much more extensive and diverse than previously recognized, and promise to provide key insights for cell biology, microbial growth and toxicity mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2018995141,"Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) can progress from a slow growing chronic phase to an aggressive blast crisis phase, but the molecular basis of this transition remains poorly understood. Here we have used mouse models of CML to show that disease progression is regulated by the Musashi-Numb signalling axis. Specifically, we find that the chronic phase is marked by high levels of Numb expression whereas the blast crisis phase has low levels of Numb expression, and that ectopic expression of Numb promotes differentiation and impairs advanced-phase disease in vivo. As a possible explanation for the decreased levels of Numb in the blast crisis phase, we show that NUP98-HOXA9, an oncogene associated with blast crisis CML, can trigger expression of the RNA-binding protein Musashi2 (Msi2), which in turn represses Numb. Notably, loss of Msi2 restores Numb expression and significantly impairs the development and propagation of blast crisis CML in vitro and in vivo. Finally we show that Msi2 expression is not only highly upregulated during human CML progression but is also an early indicator of poorer prognosis. These data show that the Musashi-Numb pathway can control the differentiation of CML cells, and raise the possibility that targeting this pathway may provide a new strategy for the therapy of aggressive leukaemias."

https://openalex.org/W2126181351,"N-linked glycosylation is the most frequent modification of secreted and membrane-bound proteins in eukaryotic cells, disruption of which is the basis of the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). We describe a new type of CDG caused by mutations in the steroid 5Î±-reductase type 3 (SRD5A3) gene. Patients have mental retardation and ophthalmologic and cerebellar defects. We found that SRD5A3 is necessary for the reduction of the alpha-isoprene unit of polyprenols to form dolichols, required for synthesis of dolichol-linked monosaccharides, and the oligosaccharide precursor used for N-glycosylation. The presence of residual dolichol in cells depleted for this enzyme suggests the existence of an unexpected alternative pathway for dolichol de novo biosynthesis. Our results thus suggest that SRD5A3 is likely to be the long-sought polyprenol reductase and reveal the genetic basis of one of the earliest steps in protein N-linked glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1976649316,"The metabolic enzyme CTP synthase (CtpS) of Caulobacter crescentus can polymerize into cytoskeletal filaments. It functions together with the intermediate filament protein crescentin to control cell shape. Filament-forming cytoskeletal proteins are essential for the structure and organization of all cells. Bacterial homologues of the major eukaryotic cytoskeletal families have now been discovered, but studies suggest that yet more remain to be identified. We demonstrate that the metabolic enzyme CTP synthase (CtpS) forms filaments in Caulobacter crescentus. CtpS is bifunctional, as the filaments it forms regulate the curvature of C. crescentus cells independently of its catalytic function. The morphogenic role of CtpS requires its functional interaction with the intermediate filament, crescentin (CreS). Interestingly, the Escherichia coli CtpS homologue also forms filaments both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that CtpS polymerization may be widely conserved. E. coli CtpS can replace the enzymatic and morphogenic functions of C. crescentus CtpS, indicating that C. crescentus has adapted a conserved filament-forming protein for a secondary role. These results implicate CtpS as a novel bifunctional member of the bacterial cytoskeleton and suggest that localization and polymerization may be important properties of metabolic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2093172018,"Diabetes costs represent a large burden to both patients and the health care system. However, few studies that examine the economic consequences of diabetes have distinguished between the two major forms, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, despite differences in underlying pathologies. Combining the two diseases implies that there is no difference between the costs of type 1 and type 2 diabetes to a patient. In this study, we examine the costs of type 1 diabetes, which is often overlooked due to the larger population of type 2 patients, and compare them to the estimated costs of diabetes reported in the literature.Using a nationally representative dataset, we estimate yearly and lifetime medical and indirect costs of type 1 diabetes by implementing a matching method to compare a patient with type 1 diabetes to a similar individual without the disease. We find that each year type 1 diabetes costs this country $14.4 billion (11.5-17.3) in medical costs and lost income. In terms of lost income, type 1 patients incur a disproportionate share of type 1 and type 2 costs. Further, if the disease were eliminated by therapeutic intervention, an estimated $10.6 billion (7.2-14.0) incurred by a new cohort and $422.9 billion (327.2-519.4) incurred by the existing number of type 1 diabetic patients over their lifetime would be avoided.We find that the costs attributed to type 1 diabetes are disproportionately higher than the number of type 1 patients compared with type 2 patients, suggesting that combining the two diseases when estimating costs is not appropriate. This study and another recent contribution provides a necessary first step in estimating the substantial costs of type 1 diabetes on the U.S."
https://openalex.org/W2048898838,"The domestic pig is of enormous agricultural significance and valuable models for many human diseases. Information concerning the pig microRNAome (miRNAome) has been long overdue and elucidation of this information will permit an atlas of microRNA (miRNA) regulation functions and networks to be constructed. Here we performed a comprehensive search for porcine miRNAs on ten small RNA sequencing libraries prepared from a mixture of tissues obtained during the entire pig lifetime, from the fetal period through adulthood. The sequencing results were analyzed using mammalian miRNAs, the precursor hairpins (pre-miRNAs) and the first release of the high-coverage porcine genome assembly (Sscrofa9, April 2009) and the available expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences. Our results extend the repertoire of pig miRNAome to 867 pre-miRNAs (623 with genomic coordinates) encoding for 1,004 miRNAs, of which 777 are unique. We preformed real-time quantitative PCR (q-PCR) experiments for selected 30 miRNAs in 47 tissue-specific samples and found agreement between the sequencing and q-PCR data. This broad survey provides detailed information about multiple variants of mature sequences, precursors, chromosomal organization, development-specific expression, and conservation patterns. Our data mining produced a broad view of the pig miRNAome, consisting of miRNAs and isomiRs and a wealth of information of pig miRNA characteristics. These results are prelude to the advancement in pig biology as well the use of pigs as model organism for human biological and biomedical studies."

TRPV1 expression and activity appear to be altered under pathophysiological conditions such as chronic cough and airway hypersensitivity, whereas TRPV4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, to date, there is no information about the genetic impact of either TRPV1 or TRPV4 on asthma pathophysiology. We now report on the association of two functional SNPs, TRPV1-I585V and TRPV4-P19S, with childhood asthma. Both SNPs were genotyped in a population of 470 controls without respiratory symptoms and 301 asthmatics. Although none of the SNPs modified the risk of suffering from asthma, carriers of the TRPV1-I585V genetic variant showed a lower risk of current wheezing (odds ratio = 0.51; p = 0.01), a characteristic of active asthma, or cough (odds ratio = 0.57; p = 0.02). Functional analysis of TRPV1-I585V, using the Ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2 to measure intracellular [Ca2+] concentrations, revealed a decreased channel activity in response to two typical TRPV1 stimuli, heat and capsaicin.

https://openalex.org/W2068596727,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aminopeptidase I (Ape1p) and Î±-mannosidase (Ams1p) are known cargoes of selective autophagy. Atg19p has been identified as an Ape1p receptor and targets Ape1p to the preautophagosomal structure (PAS). Under nutrient-rich conditions, transport of Ams1p to the vacuole largely depends on Atg19p. Here, we show that Atg34p (Yol083wp), a homolog of Atg19p, is a receptor for Ams1p transport during autophagy. Atg34p interacted with Ams1p, Atg11p, and Atg8p using distinct domains. Homo-oligomerized Ams1p bound to the Ams1-binding domain of Atg34p; this binding was important for the formation of a higher order complex named the Ams1 complex. In the absence of the interaction of Atg34p with Atg8p, the Ams1 complex was targeted to the preautophagosomal structure but failed to transit to the vacuole, indicating that the interaction of Atg34p with Atg8p is crucial for the Ams1 complex to be enclosed by autophagosomes. Atg34p and Atg19p have similar domain structures and are important for Ams1p transport during autophagy.

Here, we show that Atg34p (Yol083wp), a homolog of Atg19p, is a receptor for Ams1p transport during autophagy. Atg34p interacted with Ams1p, Atg11p, and Atg8p using distinct domains. Homo-oligomerized Ams1p bound to the Ams1-binding domain of Atg34p; this binding was important for the formation of a higher order complex named the Ams1 complex. In the absence of the interaction of Atg34p with Atg8p, the Ams1 complex was targeted to the preautophagosomal structure but failed to transit to the vacuole, indicating that the interaction of Atg34p with Atg8p is crucial for the Ams1 complex to be enclosed by autophagosomes. Atg34p and Atg19p have similar domain structures and are important for Ams1p transport during autophagy. Macroautophagy (hereafter simply called autophagy) has been described as a non-selective degradation system of cytoplasmic constituents. Recently, selective degradation of proteins and organelles by autophagy has been shown to be important for the homeostasis of eukaryotic cells by eliminating unnecessary or harmful proteins and organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes.

Among them, 18 genes are essential for autophagosome formation under starvation conditions (1Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1280-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Atg proteins encoded by these genes are organized into the preautophagosomal structure (PAS), which plays a central role in autophagosome formation near the vacuole (2Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). During autophagy, cytoplasmic constituents are sequestered by the double membrane of an autophagosome. The outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the vacuole membrane. The inner structure, an autophagic body, is released into the vacuolar lumen and degraded by the action of vacuolar hydrolases. autophagy-related preautophagosomal structure cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting Atg8 family-interacting motif precursor Ape1p synthetic dextrose synthetic complete medium. Previous analysis showed that the resident vacuolar hydrolases, Î±-mannosidase (Ams1p) and aminopeptidase I (Ape1p), are transported to the vacuole via selective autophagy (3Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 4Hutchins M.U. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20491-20498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Ams1p oligomerizes after synthesis and associates with a precursor Ape1p (prApe1p) by the action of Atg19p (4Hutchins M.U. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20491-20498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Ams1p, prApe1p, and Atg19p assemble into a large complex called the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) complex, which was identified as an electron-dense structure localized close to the vacuole by electron microscopy (3Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Atg19p mediates the association of the Cvt complex with the PAS by interacting with Atg8p and Atg11p (5Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 6Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Cvt complex is selectively enclosed in a Cvt vesicle (about 150 nm in diameter) under nutrient-rich conditions and in an autophagosome (about 500 nm in diameter) under starvation conditions. After transport to the vacuole, prApe1p is processed into mature Ape1p (mApe1p). Under nutrient-rich conditions, Atg19p is essential for Ams1p transport (4Hutchins M.U. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20491-20498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that Ams1p is transported to the vacuole under starvation conditions in an Atg19p-independent manner. We found that Atg34p, a homolog of Atg19p, functions as a receptor for Ams1p. Ams1p bound to the Ams1-binding domain of Atg34p and formed a higher order complex called the Ams1 complex. The interaction of Atg34p with Atg8p was essential for sequestration of the Ams1 complex into an autophagosome. Standard methods were used for yeast manipulation (7Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1998Google Scholar). Cells were grown in either YEPD (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, and 2% glucose) or SD + casamino acid medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.5% casamino acid, and 2% glucose) with appropriate supplements. Autophagy was induced by addition of 400 ng/ml rapamycin (Sigma) or by shifting to a nitrogen starvation medium (SD(âN); 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate and 2% glucose). The yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. GFP-tagged Atg strains were generated using a PCR-based gene modification method (8Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). For Atg34ÎC4p-GFP and Atg34AEEAp-GFP strains, mutations were introduced in primers used to amplify GFP fragments. To disrupt ATG genes, disruption cassettes were amplified from disruptants in laboratory stocks and used for transformation. Tetrad dissection was used to create several disruptants. mRFP-prApe1 strains were generated by transforming cells with pPS129 digested with AvrII (the plasmid was a gift from Dr. Daniel J. Klionsky, University of Michigan). ATG34 was cloned into the pRS316 plasmid (9Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing Atg34HA,EA, Atg34HA, and Atg34EA were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The GFP sequence of the pRS316 GFP-ATG8 plasmid was substituted for the 2Ã mCherry sequence to create the pRS316 2Ã mCherry-ATG8 plasmid. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy system (Olympus) equipped with a UPlanSApo 100Ã oil objective (numerical aperture, 1.40) and a CoolSNAP HQ charge-coupled device camera (Nippon Roper). Blue (Sapphire 488-20, Coherent) and yellow lasers (85-YCA-010, Melles Griot) were used for excitation of GFP and mRFP/mCherry, respectively. A U-MNIBA2, mirror unit from which the excitation filter was removed was used for GFP visualization, and an FF593-Di02-25 Ã 36 dichroic mirror and an FF593-Em02-25 bandpass filter (Semrock) were used to visualize mRFP/mCherry. For simultaneous observation of GFP and mRFP/mCherry, both lasers were combined to obtain a fluorescent image. Fluorescence was filtered with a DM488â561 dichroic mirror and an EM505â540&572IF bandpass filter (Olympus) and was split into two channels using a U-SIP splitter (Olympus) equipped with a 565DCLP dichroic mirror (Chroma). For each channel, the fluorescent light was further filtered with an FF495-Em02-25 bandpass filter (Semrock) for the GFP channel and an FF593-Em02-25 bandpass filter (Semrock) for the mRFP/mCherry channel. Both channels were imaged on different parts of the charge-coupled device camera. Images were acquired using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Cell lysates were prepared by NaOH/2-mercaptoethanol extraction with a slight modification (10Horvath A. Riezman H. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). An anti-Atg34p antiserum was raised against bacterially expressed Atg34p (a gift from Dr. Inagaki, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan) and affinity-purified using the antigen. To detect GFP and Ape1p, anti-GFP antiserum (Invitrogen) and anti-Ape1p antiserum (6Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were used, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid assays were carried out as described previously (11James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a series of truncated ATG34 constructs were cloned into a pGAD-based plasmid. Full-length ATG34, AMS1, ATG11, ATG8, and APE1 were cloned into a pGBD-based plasmid. pGAD- and pGBD-based plasmids were cotransformed into the PJ69-4A host strain. Cells harboring the indicated plasmids were cultured in synthetic complete medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (SC(âLW)). Five microliters of 0.1-A600 unit aliquots of cells were spotted onto SC(âLW) or SC(âLW) lacking adenine (SC(âALW)) plates. These plates were incubated for 3â4 days at 30 Â°C. Î±-Mannosidase (Ams1p) is a vacuolar hydrolase that is selectively transported to the vacuole via the Cvt pathway under nutrient-rich conditions and via autophagy under starvation conditions (4Hutchins M.U. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20491-20498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Under nutrient-rich conditions, Ams1p transport largely depends on Atg19p, a receptor for Ams1p transport (5Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The dynamics of Ams1p during autophagy was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using Ams1p-GFP expressed from the chromosome. We induced autophagy by adding rapamycin to growth medium unless otherwise noted. In this study, we refer to the rapamycin-treated conditions as âstarvation conditions.â In wild-type cells under starvation conditions, Ams1p-GFP localized to a dot proximal to the vacuole (Fig. 1A, arrows) as well as the vacuolar lumen (Fig. 1A, arrowheads). In atg1Î cells, GFP staining was detected as a bright dot(s) exclusively outside the vacuole (Fig. 1A). These results show that vacuolar staining with GFP enables the monitoring of Ams1p-GFP transport by autophagosomes. Vacuolar staining was hardly detected in atg11Î cells (Fig. 1A), indicating that Atg11p is involved in selective transport of Ams1p by autophagy. Ams1p transport depends on Atg19p under nutrient-replete conditions (5Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 12Scott S.V. Guan J. Hutchins M.U. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Under starvation conditions, however, Ams1p was effectively transported even in the atg19Î strain (Fig. 1A). We assumed that another receptor protein would play a role in Ams1p transport under starvation conditions. Genome-wide two-hybrid analyses showed that Yol083wp interacts with Ams1p (13Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3922) Google Scholar, 14Ito T. Tashiro K. Muta S. Ozawa R. Chiba T. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto K. Kuhara S. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Moreover, bioinformatics analysis using a BLAST search suggests that Yol083wp is a homolog of Atg19p. Thus, YOL083W is additionally disrupted in atg19Î cells. The transport of Ams1p-GFP was abolished in the atg19Îyol083wÎ double disruptant, showing that Yol083wp acts for Ams1p transport in the absence of Atg19p (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the transport of Ams1p was normal in the yol083wÎ strain (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that either Yol083wp or Atg19p is sufficient for Ams1p transport during autophagy. The Ams1p transport is defective in ape1Î cells during vegetative growth (5Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) but seemed normal under starvation conditions (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the prApe1p-Atg19p complex is dispensable for Ams1p transport. Ams1p-GFP did not stain the vacuolar lumen in the atg1Î, atg11Î, or atg19Îyol083wÎ strains but exhibited different staining patterns: Ams1p-GFP formed a dot structure in the atg1Î and atg11Î strains, whereas it dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in the atg19Îyol083wÎ strain (Fig. 1A), indicating that either Yol083wp or Atg19p serves to assemble Ams1p to the dot structure and subsequently to the PAS, the center of autophagosome formation (2Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In atg19Î cells, the dot structure marked by Ams1p must be localized to the PAS since Ams1p was normally transported to the vacuole, but this Ams1p dot is distinct from the Cvt complex because in these cells the Ape1 complex is apart from the PAS (5Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 6Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hence, the dot structure marked by Ams1p is referred to as the âAms1 complex.â In addition, we monitored Ams1p transport to the vacuole by immunoblot. When Ams1p-GFP is delivered to the vacuole, the GFP moiety is cleaved off by vacuolar hydrolases. As the GFP moiety is relatively stable in the vacuole, the level of Ams1p-GFP transport could be estimated by the amount of free GFP (6Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The immunoblot showed that Ams1-GFP was normally expressed in all strains (Fig. 1B). The GFP moiety was detected in wild-type cells but not in atg1Î cells (Fig. 1B). Double disruption of ATG19 and YOL083W prevented the generation of free GFP, but disruption of either ATG19 or YOL083W did not (Fig. 1B). Taken together, we conclude that Yol083wp is involved in Ams1p transport via autophagosomes in a manner similar to Atg19p. Thus, we name YOL083W ATG34. Atg34p is dispensable for Ape1p transport, for Ams1p transport under nutrient-rich conditions, and for bulk autophagy (supplemental Fig. S1). Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that full-length Atg34p interacts with Ams1p, Atg8p, Atg11p, and itself (Fig. 2A). We generated four truncated forms of Atg34p: Atg34p lacking the C-terminal four residues (Atg34ÎC4p, residues 1â408), Atg34p lacking the 33 C-terminal residues (Atg34ÎC33p, residues 1â379), Atg34p lacking residues 158â412 (Atg34ÎC255p, residues 1â157), and the first 130 N-terminal residues of Atg34p (Atg34(1â130), residues 1â130). Atg34ÎC4p did not bind to Atg8p but did bind to Ams1p, Atg11p, and itself (Fig. 2A). Atg34ÎC33p did not interact with Atg8p or Atg11p (Fig. 2A). Further truncation just before the putative coiled coil domain (Atg34ÎC255p) abrogated the interaction with Ams1p (Fig. 2A). When the putative coiled coil domain was deleted, Atg34p no longer bound any interacting protein identified here (Atg34(1â130); Fig. 2A). These results show that Atg34p associates with Ams1p, Atg8p, Atg11p, and itself using distinct domains (Fig. 2B). Atg34p is not involved in Ape1p transport, whereas Atg19p is (supplemental Fig. S1). Consistently, Atg34p was not capable of interacting with prApe1p, but Atg19p was (Fig. 2C). Our two-hybrid analysis of Atg34p indicates that residues 158â379 are essential for the interaction with Ams1p (Fig. 2B). We confirmed that this domain was sufficient for the interaction with Ams1p (Fig. 3A). Recently, a structure of the Ams1-binding domains of Atg34p and Atg19p has been solved by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (see the accompanying paper by Watanabe et al. (22Watanabe Y. Noda N.N. Kumeta H. Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285Google Scholar)). An in vitro pulldown assay showed that two conserved His and Glu residues in the domain are important for the interaction with Ams1p (see the accompanying paper by Watanabe et al. (22Watanabe Y. Noda N.N. Kumeta H. Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285Google Scholar)). Based upon these data, we generated three Atg34p mutants, which harbor a change of His296 to Ala (Atg34HAp), Glu297 to Ala (Atg34EAp), or both (Atg34HA,EAp). The in vivo activity of these proteins was monitored by fluorescence microscopy and GFP cleavage assay using an Ams1p-GFP strain lacking both ATG19 and ATG34. In cells carrying an empty vector, Ams1p-GFP exhibited a cytoplasmic pattern, whereas wild-type Atg34p enabled Ams1p to be assembled into the Ams1 complex (Fig. 3B, arrows) and to be transported to the vacuole (Fig. 3B, arrowheads). Atg34EAp acted as a wild-type Atg34p, but Atg34HAp and Atg34HA,EAp neither formed the Ams1 complex nor transported Ams1p to the vacuole (Fig. 3B). Immunoblot analysis showed that cells expressing Atg34HAp or Atg34HA,EAp are defective in Ams1p transport (Fig. 3C). These results led to the conclusion that the His296 residue is critical for the formation of the Ams1 complex by binding to Ams1p in vivo. We next examined whether the interaction of Atg34p with Atg8p is essential for its activity. Recently, our groups have found an AIM at the C terminus of Atg19p (Trp412-Glu-Glu-Leu415) and shown that the Atg19p mutants harboring changes of either Trp412, Leu415, or both residues to Ala fail to interact with Atg8p (15Noda N.N. Kumeta H. Nakatogawa H. Satoo K. Adachi W. Ishii J. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 16Noda N.N. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Atg34p also has an AIM at the C terminus (Trp409-Glu-Glu-Ile412). We replaced the Trp409 and Ile412 residues with Ala to make Atg34AEEAp. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that Atg34AEEAp interacted normally with Ams1p and Atg11p but did not interact with Atg8p (Fig. 4A). This result was the same as that of Atg34ÎC4p (Fig. 2A). Next, Atg34ÎC4p and Atg34AEEAp were expressed in the atg19Îatg34Î strain expressing Ams1p-GFP, and their activities were analyzed by monitoring Ams1p-GFP cleavage. Free GFP was generated only in the cells expressing wild-type Atg34p but not in the cells expressing Atg34ÎC4p or Atg34AEEAp (Fig. 4B), showing that the interaction between Atg34p and Atg8p is essential for Ams1p transport. Ams1p-GFP dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in atg19Îatg34Î cells (Figs. 1A and 4C). This pattern reverted to normal when wild-type Atg34p was expressed in these cells (Fig. 4C). In cells expressing Atg34ÎC4p or Atg34AEEAp, Ams1p-GFP was not transported to the vacuole but accumulated outside the vacuole as a brighter dot relative to that observed in cells expressing wild-type Atg34p (Fig. 4C). This suggests that Atg34p mutants lacking the interaction with Atg8p retain the ability to form the Ams1 complex. In wild-type cells, Atg34p-GFP was transported to the vacuole (Fig. 5), whereas the vacuole was not labeled by GFP in atg1Î cells (supplemental Fig. S2A), indicating that the Atg34p transport depends on autophagy. Moreover, in atg1Î cells, Atg34p-GFP accumulated as a dot outside the vacuole and was colocalized with prApe1p, which is a marker of the Cvt complex (supplemental Fig. S2B). Shintani et al. (5Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) showed that the Cvt complex is targeted to the PAS in the absence of Atg1p. Together with these results, we conclude that Atg34p is first targeted to the PAS and then delivered to the vacuole by autophagy as is Atg19p. We next created Atg34ÎC4p-GFP and Atg34AEEAp-GFP strains and examined the localization of these proteins by fluorescence microscopy. During autophagy, they were detected as a dot in the cytoplasm but were not transported to the vacuole (Fig. 5). The fluorescence intensity of the dots was much brighter than observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 5), indicating that these Atg34p mutants are not able to be enclosed in autophagosomes and consequently accumulate outside the vacuole. Together, it is likely that Ams1p and Atg34ÎC4p/Atg34AEEAp form the Ams1 complex but accumulate outside the vacuole because of a defect in sequestration into autophagosomes. Under starvation conditions, both Atg11p and Atg17p act as scaffold proteins and are required for organization of the PAS (17Suzuki K. Kubota Y. Sekito T. Ohsumi Y. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In atg11Îatg17Î cells, both Atg34p-GFP and Atg34ÎC4p-GFP were still detected as dots (Fig. 5), indicating that PAS organization is not required for dot formation. Thus, we conclude that Atg34p is associated with the Cvt complex. Immunoelectron microscopy with anti-Atg34 antibodies demonstrated that Atg34p was localized on the periphery of the Cvt complex enclosed in autophagic bodies (supplemental Fig. S3). Next, we examined PAS localization of Atg34ÎC4p by using 2Ã mCherry-Atg8p. Vacuoles were stained with mCherry fluorescence, indicating that autophagy is normal in this strain (Fig. 6). Nevertheless, Atg34ÎC4p-GFP was not transported to the vacuole (Fig. 6). We evaluated the extent of colocalization by counting cells with dots labeled by both GFP (Atg34p) and mCherry (PAS). Atg34p-GFP and mCherry-Atg8p were colocalized in 74% of the cells (n = 43), and Atg34ÎC4p-GFP and mCherry-Atg8p were colocalized in 62% of the cells (n = 34). These results indicate that Atg34ÎC4p-GFP was targeted to the PAS in a normal manner but that it was not engulfed by autophagosomes. It seems likely that Ams1p accumulates at the PAS in Atg34ÎC4p- and Atg34AEEAp-expressing cells (Fig. 4C), showing that the interaction with Atg8p is important for the Ams1 complex to be delivered to autophagosomes. prApe1p is important for recruitment of Atg19p to a dot structure (5Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether known cargoes are responsible for recruitment of Atg34p to a dot structure. In ams1Îape1Î cells, Atg34p formed a dot and was normally transported to the vacuole, whereas Atg19p was defective in dot formation (supplemental Fig. S4). The delivery of Atg34p to the vacuole was not affected in the ape1Îams1Î cells, raising the possibility that other cargoes exist. We showed that Atg34p acts as a receptor for Ams1p under starvation conditions. Selective autophagy may have important roles in adaptation to various nutrient environments. The physiological significance of selective autophagy will be elucidated by examining the activities of receptors for selective autophagy under diverse culture conditions. In this study, we showed that Atg34p acts as a receptor for the selective transport of Ams1p to the vacuole during autophagy. Ams1p assembles into a homo-oligomer in the cytoplasm after synthesis (4Hutchins M.U. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20491-20498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Formation of an Ams1p-receptor complex by interaction with Ams1p-binding domains in Atg34p and Atg19p is the first step for Ams1p transport (Fig. 3B). Next, the Ams1p-receptor complex is assembled into a higher order complex, called the Ams1 complex, which can be recognized as an Ams1p-GFP dot by fluorescence microscopy (Figs. 1A and 3B). This complex is targeted to the PAS and enclosed in an autophagosome via the interaction of the four residues at the C terminus of Atg34p with Atg8p (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). The Ams1p transport under nutrient-rich conditions was defective in atg19Î cells (supplemental Fig. S1), but this defect was not observed during autophagy (Fig. 1A). Under starvation conditions, Atg34p was detected in a ladder pattern by immunoblot (Fig. 3C). The upper bands disappeared following Î»-phosphatase treatment (data not shown). This result suggests that Atg34p is phosphorylated under starvation conditions. The activity of Atg34p might be regulated by its phosphorylation. We examined the involvement of Atg34p in transport of other selective cargoes of autophagosomes. Pexophagy was normal in atg34Îatg19Î cells (supplemental Fig. S5A). We also examined peroxisome degradation in nitrogen-starved cells by assessing the cleavage of Pex14p-GFP to free GFP. Peroxisome degradation was normal in atg34Îatg19Î cells (supplemental Fig. S5B). It is thus unlikely that Atg34p and Atg19p act as receptors for the degradation of peroxisomes. In contrast, atg11Î cells showed a partial defect (supplemental Fig. S5B), suggesting that Atg11p can recognize peroxisomes without Atg34p and Atg19p. Recently, we have found that leucine aminopeptidase III (Lap3p) is a selective cargo of the autophagosome. Overexpressed Lap3p concentrated around the Cvt complex is degraded in the vacuole by autophagy in an Atg11p-independent manner (18Kageyama T. Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 378: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ald6p, a cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, is known to be a cargo preferentially degraded by autophagy. This degradation does not depend on Atg11p either (19Onodera J. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16071-16076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, there may be Atg11p-independent mechanisms of selective autophagy. In mammalian cells, p62 and NBR1 are proteins that interact with LC3, a mammalian homolog of yeast Atg8p, and are thought to interact with polyubiquitinated protein aggregates and participate in their elimination (20Ichimura Y. Kumanomidou T. Sou Y.S. Mizushima T. Ezaki J. Ueno T. Kominami E. Yamane T. Tanaka K. Komatsu M. J. Biol.

Interestingly, p62 and NBR1 also contain AIMs, which are important for binding to LC3. We believe that there are more receptors other than Atg34p and Atg19p and more cargoes for selective autophagy. Identification of new receptors and new cargoes will lead to a fundamental understanding of the physiological roles of selective autophagy in eukaryotic cells.

https://openalex.org/W2060079211,"Research on migration and HIV has largely focused on male migration, often failing to measure HIV risks associated with migration for women. We aimed to establish whether associations between migration and HIV infection differ for women and men, and identify possible mechanisms by which women's migration contributes to their high infection risk.Data on socio-demographic characteristics, patterns of migration, sexual behavior and HIV infection status were obtained for a population of 11,677 women aged 15-49 and men aged 15-54, resident members of households within a demographic surveillance area participating in HIV surveillance in 2003-04.Logistic regression was conducted to examine whether sex and migration were independently associated with HIV infection in three additive effects models, using measures of recent migration, household presence and migration frequency. Multiplicative effects models were fitted to explore whether the risk of HIV associated with migration differed for males and females. Further modeling and simulations explored whether composition or behavioral differences accounted for observed associations.Relative to non-migrant males, non-migrant females had higher odds of being HIV-positive (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.72; 95% confidence interval [1.49-1.99]), but odds were higher for female migrants (aOR = 2.55 [2.07-3.13]). Female migrants also had higher odds of infection relative to female non-migrants (aOR = 1.48 [1.23-1.77]). The association between number of sexual partners over the lifetime and HIV infection was modified by both sex and migrant status: For male non-migrants, each additional partner was associated with 3% higher odds of HIV infection (aOR = 1.03 [1.02-1.05]); for male migrants the association between number of partners and HIV infection was non-significant. Each additional partner increased odds of HIV infection by 22% for female non-migrants (aOR = 1.22 [1.12-1.32]) and 46% for female migrants (aOR = 1.46 [1.25-1.69]).Higher risk sexual behavior in the context of migration increased women's likelihood of HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2096963432,"Rabbits are one of the few mammalian species that appear to be resistant to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies due to the structural characteristics of the rabbit prion protein (RaPrP(C)) itself. Here, we determined the solution structures of the recombinant protein RaPrP(C)-(91-228) and its S173N variant and detected the backbone dynamics of their structured C-terminal domains-(121-228). In contrast to many other mammalian PrP(C)s, loop 165-172, which connects Î²-sheet-2 and Î±-helix-2, is well-defined in RaPrP(C). For the first time, order parameters S(2) are obtained for residues in this loop region, indicating that loop 165-172 of RaPrP(C) is highly ordered. Compared with the wild-type RaPrP(C), less hydrogen bonds form in the S173N variant. The NMR dynamics analysis reveals a distinct increase in the structural flexibility of loop 165-172 and helix-3 after the S173N substitution, implying that the S173N substitution disturbs the long range interaction of loop 165-172 with helix-3, which further leads to a marked decrease in the global conformational stability. Significantly, RaPrP(C) possesses a unique charge distribution, carrying a continuous area of positive charges on the surface, which is distinguished from other PrP(C)s. The S173N substitution causes visible changes of the charge distribution around the recognition sites for the hypothetical protein X. Our results suggest that the ordered loop 165-172 and its interaction with helix-3, together with the unique distribution of surface electrostatic potential, significantly contribute to the unique structural characteristics of RaPrP(C)."
https://openalex.org/W2056918727,"The GH3 family of acyl-acid-amido synthetases catalyze the ATP-dependent formation of amino acid conjugates to modulate levels of active plant hormones, including auxins and jasmonates. Initial biochemical studies of various GH3s show that these enzymes group into three families based on sequence relationships and acyl-acid substrate preference (I, jasmonate-conjugating; II, auxin- and salicylic acid-conjugating; III, benzoate-conjugating); however, little is known about the kinetic and chemical mechanisms of these enzymes. Here we use GH3-8 from Oryza sativa (rice; OsGH3-8), which functions as an indole-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase, for detailed mechanistic studies. Steady-state kinetic analysis shows that the OsGH3-8 requires either Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) for maximal activity and is specific for aspartate but accepts asparagine as a substrate with a 45-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency and accepts other auxin analogs, including phenyl-acetic acid, indole butyric acid, and naphthalene-acetic acid, as acyl-acid substrates with 1.4-9-fold reductions in k(cat)/K(m) relative to IAA. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies indicate that the enzyme uses a Bi Uni Uni Bi Ping Pong reaction sequence. In the first half-reaction, ATP binds first followed by IAA. Next, formation of an adenylated IAA intermediate results in release of pyrophosphate. The second half-reaction begins with binding of aspartate, which reacts with the adenylated intermediate to release IAA-Asp and AMP. Formation of a catalytically competent adenylated-IAA reaction intermediate was confirmed by mass spectrometry. These mechanistic studies provide insight on the reaction catalyzed by the GH3 family of enzymes to modulate plant hormone action."
https://openalex.org/W2143588126,"In the face of impending influenza pandemic, a rapid vaccine production and mass vaccination is the most effective approach to prevent the large scale mortality and morbidity that was associated with the 1918 ""Spanish Flu"". The traditional process of influenza vaccine production in eggs is time consuming and may not meet the demands of rapid global vaccination required to curtail influenza pandemic.Recombinant technology can be used to express the hemagglutinin (HA) of the emerging new influenza strain in a variety of systems including mammalian, insect, and bacterial cells. In this study, two forms of HA proteins derived from the currently circulating novel H1N1 A/California/07/2009 virus, HA1 (1-330) and HA (1-480), were expressed and purified from E. coli under controlled redox refolding conditions that favoured proper protein folding. However, only the recombinant HA1 (1-330) protein formed oligomers, including functional trimers that bound receptor and caused agglutination of human red blood cells. These proteins were used to vaccinate ferrets prior to challenge with the A/California/07/2009 virus. Both proteins induced neutralizing antibodies, and reduced viral loads in nasal washes. However, the HA1 (1-330) protein that had higher content of multimeric forms provided better protection from fever and weight loss at a lower vaccine dose compared with HA (1-480). Protein yield for the HA1 (1-330) ranged around 40 mg/Liter, while the HA (1-480) yield was 0.4-0.8 mg/Liter.This is the first study that describes production in bacterial system of properly folded functional globular HA1 domain trimers, lacking the HA2 transmembrane protein, that elicit potent neutralizing antibody responses following vaccination and protect ferrets from in vivo challenge. The combination of bacterial expression system with established quality control methods could provide a mechanism for rapid large scale production of influenza vaccines in the face of influenza pandemic threat."
https://openalex.org/W2154313522,"Rab1a is a member of the Rab family of small GTPases with a well characterized function in the regulation of vesicle trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and within Golgi compartments. The integrin family heterodimeric transmembrane proteins serve as major receptors for extracellular matrix proteins, which play essential roles in cell adhesion and migration. Although effects on intracellular trafficking of integrins or other key cargos by Rab1a could influence cell migration, the regulatory mechanisms linking Rab1a to cell migration are not well understood. Here, we report identification of Rab1a as a novel regulator of cell migration using an unbiased RNAi screen targeting GTPases. Inhibition of Rab1a reduced integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectins, reduced integrin Î²1 localization to lipid rafts, and decreased recycling of integrin Î²1 to the plasma membrane. Analysis of Rab1a effector molecules showed that p115 mediated Rab1a regulation of integrin recycling and lipid raft localization in cell migration. Taken together, these results suggest a novel function for Rab1a in the regulation of cell migration through controlling integrin Î²1 recycling and localization to lipid rafts via a specific downstream effector pathway.

Taken together, these results suggest a novel function for Rab1a in the regulation of cell migration through controlling integrin Î²1 recycling and localization to lipid rafts via a specific downstream effector pathway. Cell migration plays critical roles in a variety of biological and disease processes such as embryonic development, wound repair, inflammation, and cancer metastasis (1Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3740) Google Scholar). The integrin family heterodimeric transmembrane proteins serve as major receptors for extracellular matrix proteins, which play essential roles in cell adhesion and migration. Integrins function to link the extracellular matrix and intracellular actin cytoskeleton and are capable of mediating bidirectional signal transduction across the plasma membrane in migration and other cellular processes (3Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6687) Google Scholar). Besides these relatively well understood functions of integrins, it is increasingly evident that cell-surface integrins undergo dynamic internalization and recycling processes, which may also play crucial roles in the regulation of cell migration (4Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Traffic. 2006; 7: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 5Jones M.C. Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The internalization of integrins is through a clathrin-independent pathway (6Ng T. Shima D. Squire A. Bastiaens P.I.

Traffic. 2004; 5: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The endocytosed integrins are subsequently degraded or recycled back to the plasma membrane through caveolin-1-positive structure or early endosomes, either directly or via a perinuclear recycling complex in a cell type- and stimulus-dependent manner (4Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Traffic. 2006; 7: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggested that cell-surface integrins can localize to lipid rafts on the plasma membrane (9Krauss K. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36921-36927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Leitinger B. Hogg N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 963-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Del Pozo M.A. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 725-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich plasma membrane domains that contain a variety of proteins, including glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. They have been proposed to act as signaling platforms by recruiting distinct sets of signaling pathways whose core components display high affinity for the liquid-ordered environment of rafts (12Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). In migrating cells, lipid rafts are preferentially localized in the leading edges, where new sites of integrin-mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix are forming (13MaÃ±es S. Mira E. GÃ³mez-MoutÃ³n C. Lacalle R.A. MartÃ­nez C. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrins have been shown to facilitate recruitment of Rac to lipid rafts, where it couples to the effectors to promote cell migration (11Del Pozo M.A. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 725-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14del Pozo M.A. Alderson N.B. Kiosses W.B. Chiang H.H. Anderson R.G. Schwartz M.A. Science. 2004; 303: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanisms controlling the intracellular trafficking of integrins and their localization to lipid rafts are still not well understood (15Huttenlocher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 336-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The small GTPases are major intracellular signaling molecules involved in the regulation of diverse cellular functions (1Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar, 16Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Members of the Rho subfamily small GTPases such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 have been well characterized to regulate cell migration directly through controlling dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton (17Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). The Rab and Arf subfamilies of small GTPases regulate protein endocytosis, exocytosis, and recycling and thus could also influence cell migration through their effects on intracellular trafficking of proteins, including integrins (18Nielsen E. Cheung A.Y. Ueda T. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 1516-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several members of the Rab and Arf subfamilies have been shown to regulate trafficking of integrins directly in cell migration. Rab11a and Rab25, both members of the Rab11 family of GTPases, have been shown to regulate recycling of internalized integrin Î±5Î²1, which is dependent on at least one Rab11 effector molecule (19Caswell P.T. Spence H.J. Parsons M. White D.P. Clark K. Cheng K.W. Mills G.B. Humphries M.J. Messent A.J. Anderson K.I. McCaffrey M.W. Ozanne B.W. Norman J.C. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 496-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Another Rab family member, Rab4, has been shown recently to regulate recycling of integrin Î±vÎ²3, but not integrin Î±5Î²1, from early endosomes in a âshort loopâ pathway stimulated by PDGF, without the involvement of Rab11 (20Roberts M. Barry S. Woods A. van der Sluijs P. Norman J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1392-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Recent studies also showed that Arf6 can regulate recycling of integrin Î²1 together with Rab11 in a sequential manner (8Powelka A.M. Sun J. Li J. Gao M. Shaw L.M. Sonnenberg A. Hsu V.W. Traffic. 2004; 5: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies characterizing the role of individual GTPases in various functions, including cell migration (21Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar), much remains to be learned about possible novel roles of other members of the small GTPase family in the regulation of cell migration, given the large size of the family.

Rabbit anti-integrin Î²1 antibody was as described previously (42Marcantonio E.E. Hynes R.O. J.

Drosophila S2 cells were incubated in insect medium (Invitrogen) at 30 Â°C with 95% humidity. HEK293 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293 and NIH 3T3 cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator with 95% humidity at 37 Â°C. Drosophila S2 cells were treated with individual dsRNA of a collection of dsRNAs targeting 152 different Drosophila GTPases as described previously (22Kim E. Goraksha-Hicks P. Li L. Neufeld T.P. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Three days after the RNAi treatment, S2 cells were measured for their migration using Boyden chamber assays essentially as described previously (23Shen T.L. Park A.Y. Alcaraz A. Peng X. Jang I. Koni P. Flavell R.A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), except that polycarbonate membranes with 5-Î¼m pores (Neuro Probe, Inc.) were used because of the small size of S2 cells. The target GTPases whose knockdown by RNAi reduced migration of S2 cells at least by 2-fold were then subjected to two additional rounds of validation by RNAi, followed by Boyden chamber assays. The psPAX2 and pMD2G vectors and the pGIPZ lentiviral vectors (Open Biosystems) encoding shRNA targeting Rab1a, Rab9b, Arf4, Arl1, GM130, Golga5, or p115 were purchased through the University of Michigan shRNA Core Facility. HEK293 cells were transfected with 10 Î¼g of pGIPZ lentiviral vector encoding each shRNA, 10 Î¼g of psPAX2, and 5 Î¼g of pMD2G by the calcium phosphate method according to the instructions recommended by the manufacturer. Twelve h after transfection, the media were replaced with DMEM containing 5% FBS. The conditioned media were then collected twice at 1-day intervals and combined. After centrifugation and filtration, the supernatant was used to infect HEK293, MDA-MB-231, and NIH 3T3 cells. In some experiments, the infected HEK293 and MDA-MB-231 cells were selected with 1 Î¼g/ml puromycin in DMEM containing 10% FBS to obtain pools that stably expressed shRNA. pEYFPC-Rab1a was kindly provided by Dr. Yanzhuang Wang (University of Michigan). DNA fragments were excised from the pEYFPC vector and cloned into pKH3 (43Wu X. Gan B. Yoo Y. Guan J.L. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) to generate HA-tagged Rab1a and mutant S25N. The plasmid DNA was used for transient transfection of HEK293 and NIH 3T3 cells via Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Boyden chamber assays were performed to measure migration for both transiently transfected HEK293 cells and HEK293 cells with stable expression of various shRNA constructs using 8-Î¼m pore polycarbonate membranes as described previously (23Shen T.L.

Chem. 2006; 281: 15352-15360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, coverslips were coated with 10 Î¼g/ml collagen I, 10 Î¼g/ml fibronectin, or 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine overnight at 4 Â°C. Cells were washed twice with PBS, trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen), and kept in suspension in DMEM for 1 h. They were then seeded on the coated coverslips and incubated for 1 h in 5% CO2 with 95% humidity at 37 Â°C. The fraction of spread cells (i.e. phase-dark cells) was determined by viewing 10 random fields under a phase-contrast microscope. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 3% BSA overnight at 4 Â°C or for 2 h at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS for 10 min, the cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were then mounted with SlowFadeÂ® antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and kept at 4 Â°C. In some experiments, cells were incubated with 1 Î¼g/ml CTxB-FITC in PBS with 0.1% BSA at 4 Â°C for 20 min to stain lipid rafts. Detection of components of lipid rafts by sucrose gradient fraction was performed as described previously (47Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and once with Mes-buffered saline (25 mm Mes and 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5). They were then resuspended in 2 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in Mes-buffered saline and incubated at 4 Â°C for 20 min. The solubilized cells were homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and 1.5 ml of the homogenate was added to 2.5 ml of 70% (w/v) sucrose in Mes-buffered saline. The samples were overlaid successively with 5 ml of 30% sucrose and 3 ml of 5% sucrose. They were then centrifuged at 240,000 Ã g in a Beckman SW 41 Ti rotor for 18 h, and 12 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. The pellet was resuspended and designated fraction 13. The fractions were then analyzed by Western blotting with various antibodies as described previously (48Wu X. Yoo Y. Okuhama N.N. Tucker P.W. Liu G. Guan J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the cells were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% saponin instead of 1% Triton X-100. Cell-surface protein biotinylation and endocytosis assay were performed essentially as described previously (43Wu X. Gan B. Yoo Y. Guan J.L. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), except that endocytosis was allowed to proceed for 30 min. To measure recycling of internalized proteins, the cells were further incubated at 37 Â°C for 15 min, followed by two successive GSH washes. The cells were then lysed, and the lysates were precipitated by streptavidin-agarose beads and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-integrin Î²1 antibody. Tail vein injection in nude mice was performed as described previously (49Hauck C.R. Hsia D.A. Puente X.S. Cheresh D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6289-6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 Ã 105 cells in 200 Î¼l of DMEM were injected into the tail veins of nude mice. Four weeks after injection, the mice were killed, and lungs were removed. They were fixed in Bouin's solution, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned. After staining with hematoxylin and eosin, the samples were examined for metastatic nodules under a light microscope and quantified. Data are presented as means Â± S.E. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To identify new signaling molecules in the regulation of cell migration, we performed an RNAi screen of a collection of 152 annotated Drosophila GTPases using Drosophila S2 cells, taking advantage of the high RNAi efficiency of the system (22Kim E. Goraksha-Hicks P. Li L. Neufeld T.P. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Three rounds of screening and validation were performed as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Among those GTPases whose mammalian homologs are not known to function in cell migration, four fly GTPases were found to play a role in promoting cell migration, as their RNAi-mediated knockdown significantly reduced migration of Drosophila S2 cells (Fig. 1A). To evaluate a potential role of these genes in mammalian cells, we prepared mammalian expression vectors encoding shRNA targeting two different sequences for each of the mammalian orthologs of these four genes (human rab1a, rab9b, arf4, and arl1). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with these vectors, and the effects on cell migration were measured using Transwell assays as described previously (23Shen T.L. Park A.Y. Alcaraz A. Peng X. Jang I. Koni P. Flavell R.A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that Rab1a knockdown inhibited mammalian cell migration, whereas Rab9b knockdown did not. For Arf4 and Arl1, shRNAs targeting two different sequences in the same gene had different results. Similar to HEK293 cells, knockdown of Rab1a by transient transfection of shRNA vectors also significantly inhibited migration of mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results identify Rab1a as a new regulatory molecule of cell migration in various mammalian cells as well as in Drosophila S2 cells. To investigate potential mechanisms of Rab1a regulation of cell migration, we examined whether knockdown of Rab1a can affect cell adhesion and spreading on extracellular matrix proteins. As shown in Fig. 1D, knockdown of Rab1a significantly inhibited cell adhesion on fibronectin compared with cells treated with the control shRNA. Interestingly, expression of Rab1a shRNA did not reduce adhesion of the cells on either collagen I or poly-l-lysine. We also measured the effect of overexpression of wild-type Rab1a or its mutants on cell adhesion. Overexpression of wild-type Rab1a did not affect cell adhesion on any of the substrates. However, the S25N mutant, which functions as a dominant-negative mutant to inhibit endogenous Rab1a (24Nuoffer C. Davidson H.W. Matteson J. Meinkoth J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), significantly decreased cell adhesion on fibronectin, but not on collagen I or poly-l-lysine. Similar results were obtained when cell spreading was measured, except that the S25N mutant also reduced cell spreading on poly-l-lysine (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results suggest that Rab1a may regulate cell migration by affecting integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. To explore a possible mechanism of regulation of integrins by Rab1a in cell adhesion and migration, we examined the subcellular localization of Rab1a in mammalian cells. Besides its well characterized localization in the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate components, and intracellular vesicles, we detected the presence of some Rab1a in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A, panel a, arrow). Furthermore, co-staining of the cells with CTxB, a marker for lipid rafts (25Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), revealed a fraction of Rab1a localized in the lipid raft subdomain of the plasma membrane in a ruffle-like structure of migrating cells (Fig. 2A, panels aâc, arrows). Interestingly, the S25N mutant was absent in lipid rafts as indicated by CTxB staining (Fig. 2A, panels dâf). As previous studies have shown localization of several integrins, including Î²1, in lipid rafts of migrating cells (26Holleran B.J. Barbar E. Payet M.D. Dupuis G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Fabbri M. Di Meglio S. Gagliani M.C. Consonni E. Molteni R. Bender J.R. Tacchetti C. Pardi R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5793-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the putative localization of Rab1a in lipid rafts as detected by immunofluorescent staining suggests that Rab1a may affect integrin Î²1 partition in lipid rafts to regulate cell migration. To study the potential regulation of integrin partitioning in lipid rafts by Rab1a, stable HEK293 cell pools expressing shRNA for Rab1a (Rab1a knockdown (KD) cells) or a control scrambled sequence (control cells) were established using lentiviral vectors as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The cells were solubilized and subjected to sucrose gradient fractionation, followed by Western blotting to detect the localization of various proteins in each fraction. As shown in Fig. 2B, lipid rafts were recovered in fractions 3 and 4 as indicated by the presence of Fyn, Rac, and caveolin-1 (proteins known to reside in lipid rafts) in these fractions. Integrin Î²1 was also present in lipid raft fractions in control cells as reported previously (26Holleran B.J. Barbar E. Payet M.D. Dupuis G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consistent with the immunofluorescent staining results (Fig. 2A), endogenous Rab1a was detected in the lipid raft fractions. In Rab1a KD cells, Rab1a was not detected in either lipid rafts or other fractions, as it was specifically depleted in these cells (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the lipid raft localization (i.e. fractions 3 and 4) of integrin Î²1 was also eliminated in Rab1a KD cells, suggesting that partitioning of integrin Î²1 to lipid rafts is dependent on Rab1a. Knockdown of Rab1a in Rab1a KD cells did not disrupt the lipid rafts per se, as localization of other resident proteins such as Fyn, Rac, and caveolin-1 was not affected in these cells. The localization of clathrin heavy chain (a marker for proteins not localized in lipid rafts) in the Triton X-100-soluble fractions (fractions 9â12) was not affected by Rab1a depletion in Rab1a KD cells. As expected, the lipid raft localization of Rab1a, as well as integrin Î²1, Fyn, Rac, and caveolin-1, was abolished by treatment of cells with 0.5% saponin, which dissolved cholesterol and shifted all lipid raft components to fractions 9â12 (data not shown). To complement the studies by Rab1a knockdown, we also examined the effect of the S25N mutant on lipid raft localization of integrin Î²1. Similar to the results from immunofluorescent staining, whereas ectopically expressed wild-type Rab1a was localized in the lipid raft fractions (Fig. 2D), the S25N mutant was absent in these fractions (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, expression of the S25N mutant also significantly inhibited integrin Î²1 partitioning into lipid rafts while not affecting localization of Fyn, Rac, and caveolin-1 (Fig. 2E). These results provide further support that lipid raft localization of integrin Î²1 is dependent on functional Rab1a. Together, the above data suggest that Rab1 may regulate cell migration through its control of integrin Î²1 localization to lipid rafts (28Vassilieva E.V. Gerner-Smidt K. Ivanov A.I. Nusrat A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2008; 295: G965-G976Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Integrins on the cell surface are dynamically regulated through continuous endocytosis from and recycling to the plasma membrane during cell migration (4Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Traffic. 2006; 7: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 29Pellinen T. Ivaska J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 30Caswell P. Norman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Rab family proteins play key roles in regulating intracellular trafficking of receptors, although a role for Rab1a in controlling integrin dynamics has not been described previously. To investigate the possible mechanisms by which Rab1a may regulate integrin Î²1 localization to lipid rafts, we examined the effect of Rab1a knockdown on the endocytosis and recycling of integrin Î²1 by pulse-chase analysis of surface-labeled proteins as outlined in Fig. 3A. As shown in Fig. 3B, a significant fraction of integrin Î²1 was endocytosed during the 30-min incubation in control cells (upper left panel, lane 3). Furthermore, the majority of endocytosed integrin Î²1 was recycled back to the cell surface after an additional 15-min incubation, as little remaining labeled integrin Î²1 was detected internally (upper left panel, lane 5). In Rab1a KD cells, a comparable amount of integrin Î²1 endocytosis was observed (upper right panel, lane 3), suggesting that endocytosis of integrin Î²1 is not significantly affected by depletion of Rab1a. In contrast, recycling of integrin Î²1 was greatly inhibited in Rab1a KD cells compared with control cells, as a significant amount of endocytosed integrin Î²1 was still protected from GSH wash after the additional 15-min incubation (upper right panel, lane 5). Quantification of data from multiple experiments indicated that â¼70% of endocytosed integrin Î²1 recycled back to the cell surface in control cells, but only â¼30% did so in Rab1a KD cells (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 3 and 5). There was no appreciable degradation of internalized integrin Î²1 in either control or Rab1a KD cells (i.e. a similar amount in Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the differential amount of integrin Î²1 remaining inside control and Rab1a KD cells is not caused by any difference in degradation in these two cells. Analysis of total integrin Î²1 at various times after inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide showed that it is very stable in both control and Rab1a KD cells (data not shown). These results provide further support that the regulation of recycling of integrin Î²1 by Rab1a is not due to any alteration of its degradation. We also carried out a similar analysis of the effect of ectopic expression of wild-type Rab1a and the S25N mutant on integrin Î²1 recycling. Fig. 3D shows that whereas expression of wild-type Rab1a did not affect any aspect of integrin Î²1 dynamics, expression of the S25N mutant inhibited recycling of integrin Î²1 back to the cell surface without significant perturbation of its endocytosis. Together, these data suggest that Rab1a is required for efficient recycling of integrin Î²1, which may be necessary for lipid raft localization and promotion of cell spreading and migration. A number of downstream effectors of Rab1a have been described, including GM130, Golga5, and p115 (31Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 32Satoh A. Wang Y. Malsam J. Beard M.B. Warren G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 33Allan B.B. Moyer B.D. Balch W.E. Science. 2000; 289: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To study whether Rab1a regulates cell migration through one or more of these effectors, stable HEK293 cell pools expressing shRNAs for GM130 (GM130 KD cells), Golga5 (Golga5 KD cells), and p115 (p115 KD cells) were established using lentiviral vectors as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The effects on integrin Î²1 localization to lipid rafts and recycling to the cell surface were then examined in these cells. Similar to control cells (Fig. 4A), integrin Î²1 was detected in both lipid rafts and non-raft fractions in GM130 KD and Golga5 KD cells (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, localization of integrin Î²1 to lipid rafts was significantly reduced in p115 KD cells (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, Rab1a localization to lipid rafts was also abolished in p115 KD cells, but not in GM130 KD or Golga5 KD cells. Analysis of integrin Î²1 dynamics in these cells showed that recycling of integrin Î²1 to the cell surface was inhibited in p115 KD cells, whereas a similar extent of integrin Î²1 recycling was found in GM130 KD and Golga5 KD cells compared with that in control cells (Fig. 4E). Consistent with its effect on integrin Î²1 recycling and localization to lipid rafts, knockdown of p115 also reduced cell migration in p115 KD cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4F). Together, these results identify p115 as a key mediator of Rab1a in the regulation of integrin Î²1 recycling and localization to lipid rafts in cell migration. To evaluate a potential role of Rab1a regulation of cell migration in vivo, we also created stable human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) expressing Rab1a or control shRNA (designated 231 KD and 231 control cells, respectively). Similar to the observations obtained with 293 and 3T3 cells (see Fig. 1), knockdown of Rab1a also reduced migration of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). We then injected 231 KD or 231 control cells into the tail veins of recipient nude mice and monitored for metastasis to the lungs, as migration of tumor cells is critical for cancer metastasis. Numerous metastatic nodules were found in the lungs of recipient mice injected with 231 control cells, but only few were detected in mice injected with 231 KD cells (Fig. 5C). Quantification of the metastatic nodules in lung sections indicated an â¼7-fold reduction in the metastatic activity of 231 KD cells compared with 231 control cells (Fig. 5D). These results provide further support for Rab1a regulation of cell migration through controlling integrin dynamics in physiological and disease processes. In this work, we have identified a novel function for Rab1a in cell migration using an unbiased RNAi-mediated gene knockdown screening of GTPases. Although proper control of intracellular protein trafficking is likely crucial in the regulation of cell migration, this is the first report directly demonstrating a specific role for Rab1a in cell migration. We further demonstrated that Rab1a regulated cell migration through controlling integrin Î²1 recycling and localization to lipid rafts via its downstream effector p115. Recent studies suggest that partitioning of integrin in lipid rafts is important for its functions in mediating signaling and regulation of cellular events such as migration (10Leitinger B. Hogg N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 963-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar, 27Fabbri M. Di Meglio S. Gagliani M.C. Consonni E. Molteni R. Bender J.R. Tacchetti C. Pardi R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5793-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Vassilieva E.V. Gerner-Smidt K. Ivanov A.I. Nusrat A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2008; 295: G965-G976Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we demonstrated the localization of a fraction of Rab1a in lipid rafts of the plasma membrane, in addition to its well characterized localization in the Golgi (24Nuoffer C. Davidson H.W. Matteson J. Meinkoth J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This observation raised the possibility that Rab1a regulates integrin localization and intracellular dynamics directly to control cell migration. In support of this hypothesis, we found that either knockdown of Rab1a or expression of dominant-negative Rab1a mutant S25N abolished the localization of integrin Î²1 in lipid rafts. Moreover, inhibition of Rab1a did not affect the localization of other resident proteins such as caveolin-1, Rac, and Fyn, suggesting that Rab1a regulates cell migration through its specific effect on integrin Î²1 localization to lipid rafts rather than by disrupting the structure of lipid rafts per se, which are critical for cell migration also (34MaÃ±es S. Viola A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Arf6, another small GTPase involved in endosome recycling (35D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), has been shown to regulate trafficking of the lipid raft marker GM1 and the recruitment of Rac1 to lipid rafts (36Balasubramanian N. Scott D.W. Castle J.D. Casanova J.E. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1381-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, whether Arf6 may also affect integrin localization to lipid rafts to modulate cell migration. Nevertheless, these results suggest that different small GTPases could regulate different components of lipid rafts and possibly affect different cellular processes. Previous studies have shown that surface integrins undergo dynamic endocytosis and recycling processes during cell migration and that integrin recycling is essential for sustained cell migration (4Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Traffic. 2006; 7: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 29Pellinen T. Ivaska J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Our analysis of each of these steps in cells with either knockdown of Rab1a or expression of dominant-negative mutant Rab1a showed that inhibition of Rab1a significantly reduced recycling of integrin Î²1 but did not affect endocytosis of integrin Î²1 or its total level on the cell surface. Consistent with the lack of an effect on its endocytosis, inhibition of Rab1a did not affect the endosome localization of integrin Î²1 (data not shown). Furthermore, we did not observe significant degradation of internalized integrin Î²1 either with or without inhibition of Rab1a, consistent with previous observations that the internalized integrins traffic through a recycling endosomal pathway rather than a late endosomal/lysosomal system (37Ghosh R.N. Mallet W.G. Soe T.T. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the lack of change in the total level of surface integrin Î²1 is that only a small fraction of the integrin is undergoing endocytosis and recycling. This pool of integrins could be those localized in lipid rafts only that play more critical roles in cell migration. Alternatively, it is possible that internalization of integrin Î²1 is from the pool of total surface integrin Î²1 but that the recycling process is specifically targeted to lipid rafts, which subsequently diffuse to the bulk part of the plasma membranes. Our results showing reduction in both recycling of integrin and its localization in lipid rafts, but not other steps in the dynamics, are consistent with the idea of integrin Î²1 recycling to the lipid rafts on the surface in a Rab1a-dependent manner. Further support for this possibility is provided by observations that disruption of lipid rafts by methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin reduces integrin endocytosis (28Vassilieva E.V. Gerner-Smidt K. Ivanov A.I. Nusrat A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2008; 295: G965-G976Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and inhibited cell migration without a significant effect on the total surface level of integrins (data not shown). A number of other small GTPases, including Rab4, Rab11, and Arf6, have been shown to regulate recycling of integrins to the cell surface (8Powelka A.M. Sun J. Li J. Gao M. Shaw L.M. Sonnenberg A. Hsu V.W. Traffic. 2004; 5: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 18Nielsen E. Cheung A.Y. Ueda T. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 1516-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Roberts M. Barry S. Woods A. van der Sluijs P. Norman J. Curr.

It will be interesting to determine whether or not they also affect integrin localization to lipid rafts on the plasma membrane. If so, this will provide further support for the possibility that integrins are recycled to the surface in lipid rafts. On the other hand, these studies may reveal that some or all of them will not affect integrin localization in lipid rafts. Such a scenario would suggest that recycling and lipid raft localization are separate events (i.e. integrin recycling is targeted to the bulk plasma membrane, and integrin localization to lipid rafts within the plasma membrane is controlled by other mechanisms). This would suggest that Rab1 regulates both recycling to the membrane and lipid raft localization of integrin Î²1 but through distinct mechanisms. Like other small GTPases, Rab1a exerts its regulatory functions through multiple effector molecules (32Satoh A. Wang Y. Malsam J. Beard M.B. Warren G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 33Allan B.B. Moyer B.D. Balch W.E. Science. 2000; 289: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 39Moyer B.D. Allan B.B. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that Rab1a regulates integrin recycling and localization to lipid rafts through its effector p115, but not GM130 or Golga5. p115 has been shown to regulate other intracellular trafficking as an effector of Rab1a, including the major function of Rab1a in endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi trafficking as well as transcytosis. Examination of multiple effectors of Rab1a suggested that p115 is the only known Rab1a effector in the regulation of transport of polymeric IgA receptor from basolateral membranes to the apical plasma membrane (40Sztul E. Colombo M. Stahl P. Samanta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1876-1885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p115 has also been shown to regulate the transport of GLUT4 after insulin stimulation from perinuclear recycling complex to the plasma membrane (41Hosaka T. Brooks C.C. Presman E. Kim S.K. Zhang Z. Breen M. Gross D.N. Sztul E. Pilch P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2882-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the best characterized trafficking pathway mediated by Rab1a, p115 was shown to directly tether a set of SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) proteins on COPII vesicles, thus facilitating vesicle fusion (33Allan B.B. Moyer B.D. Balch W.E. Science. 2000; 289: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Although SNARE proteins such as SNAP25 are present in lipid rafts, it remains to be determined whether p115 regulates integrin recycling to lipid rafts through its interaction with SNARE proteins and facilitation of the fusion events there.

https://openalex.org/W2101028973,"The introduction of transgenes into plants may cause unintended phenotypic effects which could have an impact on the plant itself and the environment. Little is published in the scientific literature about the interrelation of environmental factors and possible unintended effects in genetically modified (GM) plants.We studied transgenic bread wheat Triticum aestivum lines expressing the wheat Pm3b gene against the fungus powdery mildew Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici. Four independent offspring pairs, each consisting of a GM line and its corresponding non-GM control line, were grown under different soil nutrient conditions and with and without fungicide treatment in the glasshouse. Furthermore, we performed a field experiment with a similar design to validate our glasshouse results. The transgene increased the resistance to powdery mildew in all environments. However, GM plants reacted sensitive to fungicide spraying in the glasshouse. Without fungicide treatment, in the glasshouse GM lines had increased vegetative biomass and seed number and a twofold yield compared with control lines. In the field these results were reversed. Fertilization generally increased GM/control differences in the glasshouse but not in the field. Two of four GM lines showed up to 56% yield reduction and a 40-fold increase of infection with ergot disease Claviceps purpurea compared with their control lines in the field experiment; one GM line was very similar to its control.Our results demonstrate that, depending on the insertion event, a particular transgene can have large effects on the entire phenotype of a plant and that these effects can sometimes be reversed when plants are moved from the glasshouse to the field. However, it remains unclear which mechanisms underlie these effects and how they may affect concepts in molecular plant breeding and plant evolutionary ecology."

https://openalex.org/W2009953641,"PII proteins are one of the most widespread families of signal transduction proteins in nature, being ubiquitous throughout bacteria, archaea, and plants. They play a major role in coordinating nitrogen metabolism by interacting with, and regulating the activities of, a variety of enzymes, transcription factors, and membrane transport proteins. The regulatory properties of PII proteins derive from their ability to bind three effectors: ATP, ADP, and 2-oxoglutarate. However, a clear model to integrate physiological changes with the consequential structural changes that mediate PII interaction with a target protein has so far not been developed. In this study, we analyzed the fluctuations in intracellular effector pools in Escherichia coli during association and dissociation of the PII protein GlnK with the ammonia channel AmtB. We determined that key features promoting AmtB-GlnK complex formation are the rapid drop in the 2-oxoglutarate pool upon ammonium influx and a simultaneous, but transient, change in the ATP/ADP ratio. We were also able to replicate AmtB-GlnK interactions in vitro using the same effector combinations that we observed in vivo. This comprehensive data set allows us to propose a model that explains the way in which interactions between GlnK and its effectors influence the conformation of GlnK and thereby regulate its interaction with AmtB.

Its three-dimensional structure reveals a stable homotrimer in which each monomer has a cleavable signal peptide, so the mature protein has 11 transmembrane helices with an extracytoplasmic N terminus and a cytoplasmic C terminus (5Zheng L.

Each subunit of AmtB has a narrow, predominantly hydrophobic, pore containing a number of highly conserved residues that play critical roles in periplasmic NH4+ binding, NH4+ deprotonation, and NH3 translocation (5Zheng L.

In E. coli and most prokaryotes, the gene encoding AmtB (amtB) is in an operon together with a second gene (glnK) encoding a member of the PII family (10Thomas G. Coutts G. Merrick M. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PII proteins are one of the most widespread signal transduction proteins in nature (11Sant'Anna F.H. Trentini D.B. de Souto Weber S. Cecagno R. da Silva S.C. Schrank I.S. J. Mol. Evol. 2009; 68: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). They play a major role in coordinating the regulation of nitrogen metabolism by interacting with, and regulating the activities of, a variety of enzymes, transcription factors, and membrane transport proteins. E. coli has two PII proteins, GlnB and GlnK, and their homologs are commonly found in other bacteria (12Forchhammer K. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 65-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The conserved genetic linkage between glnK and amtB suggested a functional association between GlnK and AmtB (10Thomas G. Coutts G. Merrick M. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and indeed an increase in cellular nitrogen status leads to AmtB-GlnK association and consequent inactivation of AmtB (13Javelle A. Severi E. Thornton J. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8530-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 14Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Definitive evidence for in vivo complex formation between GlnK and AmtB was obtained by purification of the intact complex from the membrane fraction of E. coli cells that had been subjected to a prior ammonium shock (15Durand A. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29558-29567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A series of subsequent studies in other bacteria supported the proposition that this interaction is conserved among prokaryotes (16Teixeira P.F. Jonsson A. Frank M. Wang H. Nordlund S. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 2336-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Wolfe D.M. Zhang Y. Roberts G.P. J.

Like all PII proteins, GlnK is a homotrimer. Each subunit contains 112 amino acids and is a compact, cylindrically shaped molecule from which three long exposed loops (the T-loops) protrude. The T-loops are significantly conserved in sequence but are structurally very flexible. They are vital for PII interactions with many of their targets and are also sites of reversible covalent modification (20Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition to the T-loops, PII proteins are also characterized by three lateral intersubunit clefts within which are two smaller loops (the B- and C-loops). Functionally, E. coli GlnK can be regarded as a signal integrator that has two modes of signal perception. First, like many (but not all) PII proteins, GlnK is subject to covalent modification through the action of the bifunctional enzyme (GlnD) that covalently modifies GlnK by uridylylation or deuridylylation of Tyr51 in the T-loop (20Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). GlnD activity is regulated by the cellular glutamine pool; hence, the modification state of GlnK reflects the cellular glutamine status. The second mode of signal perception by GlnK, which is apparently conserved in all PII proteins, consists of the binding of effector molecules ATP, ADP, and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) 2The abbreviations used are: 2-OG2-oxoglutarateITCisothermal titration calorimetry. (12Forchhammer K. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 65-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin.

X-ray crystal structures have shown that ATP or ADP binds in the lateral clefts between the subunits, where the B- and T-loops from one subunit and the C-loop from another contribute to a nucleotide-binding pocket (22Xu Y. Cheah E. Carr P.D. van Heeswijk W.C. Westerhoff H.V. Vasudevan S.G. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 23Conroy M.J. Durand A. Lupo D. Li X.D. Bullough P.A. Winkler F.K. Merrick M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The binding site for 2-OG, which is expected to be conserved in all PII proteins, has been elusive. However, a recent crystal structure of Azospirillum brasilense GlnZ revealed that both ATP and 2-OG bind in the lateral clefts, where they participate in the coordination of a Mg2+ ion (24Truan D. Huergo L.F. Chubatsu L.S. Merrick M. Li X.D. Winkler F.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 400: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that MgATP binding to GlnB and GlnK of E. coli is synergistic with the binding of 2-OG (20Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 21Jiang P. Ninfa A.J.

Complex formation between E. coli GlnK and AmtB provides an excellent model system in which to explore, at the molecular level, the way that effector ligands control the interaction of a PII protein with its target. Deuridylylation of GlnK, as a consequence of ammonium shock, coincides with its membrane sequestration by AmtB (14Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The E. coli AmtB-GlnK complex has a stoichiometry of 1:1, and all molecules of GlnK within the complex are fully deuridylylated (15Durand A. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29558-29567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the AmtB-GlnK complex revealed that ADP and not ATP is present in all three lateral clefts of GlnK and that 2-OG and Mg2+ ions are absent (23Conroy M.J. Durand A. Lupo D. Li X.D. Bullough P.A. Winkler F.K. Merrick M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 25Gruswitz F. O'Connell 3rd, J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The conformation of the GlnK T-loop is also critical for AmtB-GlnK interaction, and it appears that ADP may be required to favor the extended T-loop conformation that facilitates successful complex formation (23Conroy M.J. Durand A. Lupo D. Li X.D. Bullough P.A. Winkler F.K. Merrick M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Truan D. Huergo L.F. Chubatsu L.S. Merrick M. Li X.D. Winkler F.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 400: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In vitro studies of ligand effects on the E. coli AmtB-GlnK complex showed that high levels of 2-OG play a critical role in complex dissociation (15Durand A. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29558-29567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Studies of homologous AmtB-PII complexes have also implicated 2-OG and the ATP/ADP ratio in the regulation of complex formation (16Teixeira P.F. Jonsson A. Frank M. Wang H. Nordlund S. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 2336-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Wolfe D.M. Zhang Y. Roberts G.P. J.

However, although these various studies have given some indications as to the roles of effectors in regulating the interaction of GlnK with AmtB, it has not yet been possible to link such effects to metabolic changes within the cell or to conformational changes in GlnK. In the work reported here, we determined the intracellular pools of ATP, ADP, and 2-OG in E. coli and established the relationship between those metabolites and cellular nitrogen status under conditions that promote either association or dissociation of the AmtB-GlnK complex. We also studied the influence of physiologically relevant concentrations of Mg2+, ATP, ADP, and 2-OG on in vitro interactions between purified GlnK and AmtB. A combination of these in vivo and in vitro data allows us to propose a molecular mechanism whereby changes in intracellular effector pools control the ability of GlnK to regulate ammonium influx through AmtB. The following strains of E. coli were used: ET8000 (rbs lacZ::IS1 gyrA hutCK) (26MacNeil D. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 260-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GT1000 (ET8000 ÎglnKamtB) (14Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and JW3841 (ECK3863 glnA::Km) (27Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 1-11Crossref Scopus (5472) Google Scholar). ET8009 (ET8000 glnA::Km) was constructed by P1 transduction of the glnA::Km allele from strain JW3841 into ET8000. Construction and verification of âscarâ strain ET8010 (ET8000 ÎglnA) were carried out using plasmid pCP20 (28Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). Plasmid pAD2 was expressed in GT1000 and used for His6-AmtB-GlnK complex purification (15Durand A. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29558-29567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Plasmid pJT25 in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) was used for overexpression of GlnK. It was constructed by digesting plasmid pMODULES3 (15Durand A. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29558-29567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with NdeI and PstI and ligating the resulting 338-bp glnK gene into expression vector pT7-7 (30Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from overnight cultures of ET8000 grown in M9Gln medium (4Javelle A. Thomas G. Marini A.M. KrÃ¤mer R. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) at 30 Â°C and assayed with Coomassie PlusTM protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientific) using an albumin standard (Thermo Scientific). Pure AmtB and GlnK at concentrations of 5, 10, 20, and 40 ng/lane and whole cell extracts at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 Î¼g/lane were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel and analyzed by Western blotting as described (14Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected using an appropriate primary antibody: anti-E. coli GlnK (31Forchhammer K. Hedler A. Strobel H. Weiss V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or anti-E. coli AmtB (13Javelle A. Severi E. Thornton J. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8530-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) raised in rabbits. The ECL Plex Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare), ECL Plex Cy5-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (GE Healthcare), an FLA-7000 fluorescent image analyzer (Fujifilm Life Science), and the Gene Tools v.3.06 image analysis system (Syngene) were used for protein quantification. Integration parameters were as follows: base-line correction method, lowest slope; base-line correction offset, yes; color filtration options, no filter; Savitsky-Golay smoothing order 2, width 3; type, absorption; and image dimensions, whole membrane filter. Final data were obtained from three independent experiments. 1-ml aliquots of membrane and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from 120 ml of culture grown in M9Gln medium at 30 Â°C and subjected to ammonium shock by the addition of NH4Cl to a final concentration of 50, 100, 200, or 300 Î¼m for 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 15 min. Membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as described previously (14Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and membrane fractions were subjected to two high-salt washes (600 mm NaCl) prior to analysis. Overnight cultures grown in M9Gln medium at 30 Â°C were subjected to ammonium shock. Portions of cultures (8 ml) taken prior to ammonium shock and 30 s, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 15 min after ammonium shock were immediately filtered through 0.45-Î¼m pore size membrane filters (25-mm diameter) with vacuum suction. Extracts for measurement of 2-OG were prepared as described previously (32Reyes-Ramirez F. Little R. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3076-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 2-OG concentrations were determined by fluorometric reactions (32Reyes-Ramirez F. Little R. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3076-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using an LS55 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data are the result of three independent experiments. Effectors concentrations (nmol/mg of total cell protein) were converted to intracellular concentrations (mm) based on an intracellular volume of 6.6 Î¼l/mg of total cell protein. Quantitative detection of ATP and ADP was based on luciferase-driven bioluminescence and was carried out using the ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit HS II (Roche Applied Science) and a SpectraMax Gemini XS microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices). Overnight cultures were grown in M9Gln medium at 30 Â°C. Aliquots (1 ml) were taken prior to ammonium shock and 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 15 min after ammonium shock and frozen in liquid N2. Cells were lysed according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the supernatant of each lysate was divided into two 50-Î¼l aliquots. One aliquot, for ATP measurement, received 50 Î¼l of buffer containing 200 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.6), 2 mm MgCl2, 240 mm KCl, and 4.6 mm phosphoenolpyruvate. The second aliquot, for ADP measurement, received 50 Î¼l of the same buffer containing 3 units/ml pyruvate kinase. All samples were incubated at 37 Â°C for 10 min, placed on ice, and analyzed immediately. This was performed as described previously (15Durand A. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29558-29567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Before harvesting, the cells were subjected to a 10 mm ammonium chloride shock. AmtB-GlnK complex was eluted from a HisTrap HP 1-ml column (GE Healthcare). The stability of the AmtB-GlnK complex when treated with effectors was studied as described previously (15Durand A. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29558-29567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with some modifications. To simulate the in vivo environment for each condition tested, physiologically relevant concentrations of all three effectors were added to the washing buffer. The washed fractions were collected after applying effectors, and the eluted fractions were loaded on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Instant Blue (Expedeon Ltd.). Both proteins were obtained by purifying the complex as described previously (15Durand A. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29558-29567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), immobilizing it on a HIS-Select spin column, and subsequently dissociating it using 600 mm NaCl. AmtB (400 Î¼g) was immobilized on a HIS-Select spin column previously equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) n-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine N-oxide) containing 5 mm imidazole. The flow-through fraction was collected, and unbound proteins were removed by two washes with the same buffer. Three additional washes were carried out in buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole, 300 Î¼g of GlnK protein, and physiologically relevant concentrations of effectors (see âResultsâ). As a control, buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole, 300 Î¼g of GlnK protein, and 0.6 m NaCl was used. The molar ratio of AmtB to GlnK was â¼1:3. A single column was used for each condition tested. Elution of His6-AmtB or His6-AmtB-GlnK complex was performed by the addition of buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were analyzed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Experiments were performed in an iTC200 isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal) at 28 Â°C in a cell volume of 0.2 ml. GlnK solutions (60â120 Î¼m trimer concentration) or equimolar solutions of GlnK plus AmtB (40â43.5 Î¼m trimers) were titrated with ATP or ADP in the presence of 0.1 or 1.0 mm 2-OG. Ligand concentrations were adjusted, according to the concentration of GlnK trimer, to obtain an optimal binding isotherm. 20 Ã 2-Î¼l injections of ligand were performed with a stirring rate of 1000 rpm. Buffer conditions were 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.03% (w/v) n-dodecyl-Î²-d-maltoside. Dissociation constants were obtained by fitting the data to a sequential binding site model, assuming existence of three sites, using the Origin 7 software supplied by MicroCal. Final data were obtained from at least two independent experiments. Strain BL21(DE3)pLysS pJT25 was grown in 20 ml of LB broth supplemented with 100 Î¼g/ml carbenicillin for 8 h at 37 Â°C. This culture was inoculated into 1 liter of autoinduction medium (ForMedium Ltd.); grown overnight at 37 Â°C; harvested at 6000 Ã g; and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, and 20% glycerol. Whole cell extracts of the culture were heated to 80 Â°C for 4 min, cooled on ice for 10 min, and harvested by centrifugation at 28,000 Ã g. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap heparin HC column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mm KCl, and run at 1 ml/min. GlnK was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 m KCl at 2 ml/min using a two-step gradient (15 ml, 5%; and 25 ml, 10%). Pure fractions of GlnK were identified on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stored at â80 Â°C. Previous analysis of the AmtB-GlnK complex purified directly from E. coli cells revealed an AmtB:GlnK stoichiometry of 1:1 (15Durand A. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29558-29567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the in vivo cellular levels of GlnK and AmtB have not been determined. Our Western blotting quantification of ET8000 samples gave values of 1353 Â± 255 AmtB molecules of trimer/cell (2.7 Â± 0.5 ng of AmtB/Î¼g of total cell protein) and 11,387 Â± 2398 GlnK molecules of trimer/cell (6.7 Â± 1.4 ng of GlnK/Î¼g of total cell protein). Thus, the in vivo stoichiometric ratio of AmtB to GlnK is â¼1:8 in E. coli. To define a set of conditions in which a complete in vivo cycle of AmtB-GlnK complex formation and dissociation occurs, we examined a range of ammonium concentrations added to nitrogen-limited cells. We determined that an extracellular NH4Cl concentration of 200 Î¼m triggered relatively rapid (30 s) membrane sequestration of GlnK (Fig. 1A). The highest level of membrane-bound GlnK was found at 2 min post-ammonium shock, and within 15 min, gradual ammonia assimilation elicited complete AmtB-GlnK complex dissociation. The levels of AmtB in the membrane remained constant both pre- and post-ammonium shock (Fig. 1A). An ammonium concentration of 200 Î¼m and a time frame of 15 min were used in all subsequent experiments. We monitored the uridylylation status of GlnK following an ammonium shock of 200 Î¼m. As expected, prior to the shock, GlnK was fully uridylylated. Deuridylylation of GlnK occurred within 2 min, followed by slow reuridylylation of GlnK within 15 min (Fig. 1B). GlnK deuridylylation/uridylylation events coincided with the membrane association status of GlnK (Fig. 1, compare A and B) such that formation of the AmtB-GlnK complex was directly proportional to the amount of GlnK deuridylylation. A number of studies have suggested that in vivo formation of an AmtB-PII complex is influenced by the intracellular pools of MgATP, ADP, and 2-OG metabolites (15Durand A. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29558-29567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Teixeira P.F. Jonsson A. Frank M. Wang H. Nordlund S.

To establish the relationship between these metabolites and the cellular nitrogen status, we determined the intracellular pools of ATP, ADP, and 2-OG in E. coli over a period of 15 min following a 200 Î¼m ammonium shock. In nitrogen-limited ET8000 cells, the intracellular pool of 2-OG was â¼1.4 mm. However, it was rapidly depleted upon addition of ammonium and, after 2 min, was reduced to 0.3 mm. Due to ammonium utilization, this rapid depletion was followed by a gradual increase in 2-OG concentration, and within 15 min, the 2-OG pool had reverted to the original level prior to ammonium shock (Fig. 2A). The ATP and ADP pools of ET8000 cells were stable prior to ammonium shock (Fig. 3A), and the averages for two separately prepared extracts from each of at least four different cultures were 2.1 Â± 0.5 mm for ATP and 0.3 Â± 0.1 mm for ADP. Two significant changes in adenine nucleotide pools took place in post-ammonium-shocked cells. The first change happened within 2 min after introduction of ammonium. Fig. 3A shows that 30 s after ammonium addition, the ATP pool had decreased to 1.8 Â± 0.5 mm, whereas the amount of ADP had increased reciprocally to 0.6 Â± 0.1 mm. This change was transitory because 2 min later, the ATP and ADP levels were restored to values close to the levels of pre-ammonium-shocked ET8000 cells. The second change in ATP/ADP pools happened more gradually. A progressive increase was observed in both pools as the added ammonium was gradually metabolized. By 15 min, there was a 2-fold increase in both the ATP and ADP pools (Fig. 3A). Comparison of these in vivo changes in effector pools with the concomitant changes in GlnK localization revealed that the membrane sequestration of GlnK by AmtB coincided with an â¼5-fold decrease in the 2-OG pool, a slight decrease in the ATP pool, and an â¼2-fold increase in the ADP pool, changing the ATP/ADP ratio from â¼7 to â¼3 within 30 s. The subsequent dissociation of the AmtB-GlnK complex occurred as the 2-OG level slowly returned to the pre-ammonium shock level, during which time there was an â¼2-fold increase in ATP and ADP pools, changing the ATP/ADP ratio back to â¼7â8. A rapid reduction in the cellular ATP pool of E. coli following ammonium shock was reported in a previous study (33Schutt H. Holzer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was suggested that this drop was due to the transiently elevated activity of glutamine synthetase following the increased uptake of ammonium and that the ammonium-induced inactivation of glutamin"

Quite a few of these genes show a specific or preferential mRNA expression in the renal glomerulus. To identify additional candidate genes involved in glomerular function in humans we generated a human renal glomerulus-enriched gene expression dataset (REGGED) by comparing gene expression profiles from human glomeruli and tubulointerstitium obtained from six transplant living donors using Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays. This analysis resulted in 677 genes with prominent overrepresentation in the glomerulus. Genes with 'a priori' known prominent glomerular expression served for validation and were all found in the novel dataset (e.g. CDKN1, DAG1, DDN, EHD3, MYH9, NES, NPHS1, NPHS2, PDPN, PLA2R1, PLCE1, PODXL, PTPRO, SYNPO, TCF21, TJP1, WT1). The mRNA expression of several novel glomerulus-enriched genes in REGGED was validated by qRT-PCR. Gene ontology and pathway analysis identified biological processes previously not reported to be of relevance in glomeruli of healthy human adult kidneys including among others axon guidance. This finding was further validated by assessing the expression of the axon guidance molecules neuritin (NRN1) and roundabout receptor ROBO1 and -2. In diabetic nephropathy, a prevalent glomerulopathy, differential regulation of glomerular ROBO2 mRNA was found.In summary, novel transcripts with predominant expression in the human glomerulus could be identified using a comparative strategy on microdissected nephrons. A systematic analysis of this glomerulus-specific gene expression dataset allows the detection of target molecules and biological processes involved in glomerular biology and renal disease."

Among extrinsic signals that control dendritic development, substantial evidence indicates that BDNF regulates dendritic morphology.

IntroductionDendrites are the primary sites where neurons receive and integrate information from a vast number of synaptic inputs. The specific branching pattern of dendrites determines the number and type of synapses received by a neuron (1Whitford K.L. Dijkhuizen P. Polleux F. Ghosh A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 127-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Dendritic development is essential for the formation of neuronal circuits. Indeed, defects in dendritic growth are associated with some forms of mental retardation, including Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome (2Benavides-Piccione R. Ballesteros-YÃ¡Ã±ez I. de LagrÃ¡n M.M.

Neurosci. 2002; 25: 315-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Dendritic arbor development is characterized by extension and retraction of dendritic branches, followed by stabilization and growth of these branches (4Cline H.T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 5Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2627-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This multistep process is regulated both by intrinsic genetic programs that are capable of generating a basic dendritic arborization and by external signals such as neuronal activity, guidance molecules, and growth factors that are essential for sculpting dendrites to their final form (1Whitford K.L. Dijkhuizen P. Polleux F. Ghosh A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 127-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 6Dijkhuizen P.A. Ghosh A. J.

There is compelling in vitro and in vivo evidence that BDNF, a member of the neurotrophin family, regulates dendritic morphology. In particular, BDNF plays an important role in controlling the dendritic length and branching of pyramidal neurons in the developing visual cortex (8McAllister A.K. Lo D.C. Katz L.C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 9McAllister A.K. Katz L.C. Lo D.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In addition, BDNF overexpression in pyramidal neurons induces sprouting of basal dendrites (10Horch H.W. KrÃ¼ttgen A. Portbury S.D. Katz L.C. Neuron. 1999; 23: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and release of BDNF from single cells elicits local dendritic growth in nearby neurons (11Horch H.W. Katz L.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, the underlying mechanisms by which BDNF exerts its effects on dendritic growth remain largely unknown.Neurotrophins trigger a variety of biological responses by activating Trk receptor tyrosine kinases (12Reichardt L.F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Binding of neurotrophins to Trk receptors leads to the activation of three major intracellular signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, and phospholipase CÎ³1 (PLCÎ³1) 2The abbreviations used are: PLCÎ³1phospholipase CÎ³1CREBcAMP response element-binding proteinCRTCCREB-regulated transcription coactivator. (12Reichardt L.F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Neurotrophin signaling through the MAPK, PI3K, and PLCÎ³1 pathways regulates neuronal differentiation, neuronal survival, and synaptic plasticity, respectively (12Reichardt L.F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Trk-mediated signaling can propagate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription through the activation of several transcription factors (12Reichardt L.F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is activated by BDNF (13Finkbeiner S. Tavazoie S.F. Maloratsky A. Jacobs K.M. Harris K.M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1031-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) and plays a key role in mediating dendritic development in response to neuronal activity (14Redmond L. Ghosh A. Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although CREB activation requires phosphorylation of serine 133, there is evidence that phosphorylation of CREB is not always sufficient to initiate gene transcription (15Bonni A. Ginty D.D. Dudek H. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 16Ravnskjaer K. Kester H. Liu Y. Zhang X. Lee D. Yates 3rd, J.R. Montminy M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that additional factors such as CREB-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs), also known as transducers of regulated CREB activity (17Conkright M.D. Canettieri G. Screaton R. Guzman E. Miraglia L. Hogenesch J.B. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 413-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), may control CREB-mediated gene transcription. CRTCs are latent cytoplasmic coactivators that shuttle to the nucleus in response to increased levels of calcium and cAMP (18Bittinger M.A. McWhinnie E. Meltzer J. Iourgenko V. Latario B. Liu X.

After translocation into the nucleus, CRTCs associate with the basic leucine zipper domain of CREB independently of its phosphorylation status and increase CREB transcriptional activity (17Conkright M.D. Canettieri G.

Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12147-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Among CRTC family members, CRTC1 is primarily expressed in the brain and is involved in activity-dependent transcription of BDNF and in late-phase long-term potentiation (21KovÃ¡cs K.A. Steullet P.

Although there is compelling evidence supporting a critical role of BDNF in regulating dendritic morphology, the signaling pathways and downstream effectors necessary for BDNF to promote dendritic development of cortical neurons remain to be identified.In this study, we show that activation of MAPK, CREB, and CRTC1 mediates BDNF-induced changes in cortical dendritic morphology. We provide evidence that nuclear translocation of CRTC1 results from NMDA receptor-mediated activation of calcineurin and is essential for the regulation of cortical dendritic development by BDNF.DISCUSSIONThere is considerable evidence that BDNF regulates dendritic growth during development, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we have shown that activation of MAPK, CREB, and CRTC1 plays a critical role in mediating the effects of BDNF on dendritic growth. In addition, our data revealed that nuclear translocation of CRTC1 results from NMDA receptor-mediated activation of calcineurin. Finally, we found that activation of CRTC1 by glutamate via stimulation of NMDA receptors and calcineurin is essential for the effects of BDNF on dendritic development.Characterization of the signaling cascade by which BDNF regulates dendritic development revealed that activation of the MAPK signaling pathway mediates BDNF-induced dendritic growth and branching (Fig. 1A). In line with these findings, activation of MAPK was found to be sufficient to increase the total dendritic length and branch point number of cortical neurons (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, previous studies have provided evidence that BDNF induces primary dendrite formation in cortical neurons via activation of the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways (6Dijkhuizen P.A. Ghosh A. J. Neurobiol. 2005; 62: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that the effects of BDNF on primary dendrite formation were independent of new protein synthesis (6Dijkhuizen P.A. Ghosh A. J. Neurobiol. 2005; 62: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas increases in dendritic length and complexity by BDNF, described in the present study, were mediated by transcription-dependent mechanisms, as shown by the complete inhibition of BDNF-induced dendritic growth by actinomycin D (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of CREB phosphorylation by expression of CREB S133A suppressed BDNF-induced increases in dendritic length and branching (Fig. 4C), indicating that phosphorylation of CREB is required for the stimulation of dendritic growth by BDNF. In line with these observations, BDNF induced a sustained phosphorylation of CREB that was abolished by inhibition of the MAPK pathway (Fig. 3, A and B). Although CREB phosphorylation is critical for the regulation of cAMP response element-mediated gene expression (28Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), there is evidence that phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 is not sufficient to activate gene transcription (15Bonni A. Ginty D.D. Dudek H. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 16Ravnskjaer K. Kester H. Liu Y. Zhang X. Lee D. Yates 3rd, J.R. Montminy M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this context, members of the CRTC family potently enhance CREB-dependent transcription via a phosphorylation-independent interaction with the basic leucine zipper DNA-binding/dimerization domain of CREB (17Conkright M.D. Canettieri G. Screaton R. Guzman E. Miraglia L. Hogenesch J.B. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 413-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 20Iourgenko V. Zhang W. Mickanin C.

Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12147-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Among CRTC family members, CRTC1 is abundantly expressed in the brain and is involved in activity-dependent dendritic growth and hippocampal long-term potentiation (21KovÃ¡cs K.A. Steullet P. Steinmann M. Do K.Q. Magistretti P.J. Halfon O. Cardinaux J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 4700-4705Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22Zhou Y. Wu H. Li S. Chen Q. Cheng X.W.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2334-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Expression of a CREB construct bearing a point mutation in the CRTC1-binding domain, as well as depletion of CRTC1 expression by shRNA-mediated knockdown, abolished BDNF-induced increases in dendritic length and branching (Figs. 4D and 5C), indicating that the interaction of CREB with CRTC1 is required for the effects of BDNF on dendritic growth.Under resting conditions, CRTC1 is sequestered in the cytoplasm through a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (19Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G. Jeffries S. Guzman E. Niessen S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Takemori H. Okamoto M. Montminy M. Cell. 2004; 119: 61-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Increases in intracellular calcium levels have been shown to trigger the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of CRTC1 via activation of the calcium/calmodulin- dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (18Bittinger M.A. McWhinnie E. Meltzer J. Iourgenko V. Latario B. Liu X. Chen C.H. Song C. Garza D. Labow M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2156-2161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 19Screaton R.A.

Cell. 2004; 119: 61-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In our study, cortical neurons exhibited a strong nuclear accumulation of CRTC1 (Fig. 6, A and B) that was not further increased by exposure of cortical neurons to BDNF (Fig. 6F). In this context, it is interesting to note that previous studies have shown that stimulation of cortical neurons by BDNF induces calcineurin activity and nuclear translocation of NFATc, a transcription factor that regulates embryonic axon outgrowth (33Graef I.A. Wang F. Charron F. Chen L. Neilson J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 2003; 113: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The marked nuclear accumulation of CRTC1 exhibited by cortical neurons in our study was prevented in the absence of glutamate or in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (Fig. 6, AâD), indicating that nuclear translocation of CRTC1 results from the activation of NMDA receptors. In agreement with these data, recent studies have provided evidence that activation of NMDA receptors by intravitreous injection of NMDA triggers nuclear accumulation of CRTC1 in retinal ganglion cells (34Deng J. Zhang X.L. Wang J.W. Teng L.L. Ge J. Takemori H. Xiong Z.Q. Zhou Y. Neuroscience. 2009; 159: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin prevented the dephosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of CRTC1 (Fig. 6, A, B, and E), which is consistent with previous findings (18Bittinger M.A. McWhinnie E. Meltzer J. Iourgenko V. Latario B. Liu X. Chen C.H. Song C. Garza D. Labow M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2156-2161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 19Screaton R.A.

Cell. 2004; 119: 61-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Together, these data demonstrate that nuclear translocation of CRTC1 results from NMDA receptor-mediated activation of calcineurin. Finally and most importantly, nuclear translocation of CRTC1 by NMDA receptor-mediated activation of calcineurin was shown to be essential for the effects of BDNF on dendritic growth of cortical neurons. Thus, prevention of nuclear localization of CRTC1 by MK-801 or FK506 or by stimulating cortical neurons in the absence of glutamate suppressed BDNF-induced increases in dendritic length and complexity (Fig. 7, AâC), indicating that regulation of dendritic growth by BDNF requires glutamate-mediated activation of NMDA receptors and calcineurin.Previous studies in ferret cortical brain slices have demonstrated that BDNF increases dendritic growth of layer 4 pyramidal neurons (9McAllister A.K. Katz L.C. Lo D.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Interestingly, application of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid prevented BDNF from increasing the complexity of basal and apical dendrites (9McAllister A.K. Katz L.C. Lo D.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). These observations support our findings and indicate that regulation of dendritic growth of cortical neurons by BDNF requires activation of NMDA receptors. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the cooperative actions of BDNF and glutamate in the regulation of dendritic development were not known. Here, we identified the cellular mechanisms underlying these concerted actions by showing that activation of MAPK and phosphorylation of CREB by BDNF are necessary but not sufficient to mediate the effects of BDNF on dendritic development. Indeed, inhibition of NMDA receptors or stimulation of cortical neurons in the absence of glutamate prevented the increased dendritic growth by BDNF (Fig. 7, A and C). Further analysis revealed that activation of NMDA receptors triggered the nuclear translocation of CRTC1 (Fig. 6, A and B), whose interaction with CREB was shown to be essential for the regulation of cortical dendritic growth by BDNF (Fig. 4D).Together, these results support the conclusion that regulation of dendritic growth by BDNF requires both the stimulation of CREB phosphorylation by BDNF and the induction of CRTC1 nuclear translocation by glutamate through NMDA receptor activation. These data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 is necessary but not always sufficient for CREB-dependent transcription (15Bonni A. Ginty D.D. Dudek H. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). For instance, in PC12 cells that extend neurites upon exposure to the neurotrophin NGF, it has been shown that NGF induces the phosphorylation of CREB but is unable to activate CREB-mediated transcription (15Bonni A. Ginty D.D. Dudek H. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that, in addition to phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133, the cooperation of CREB with transcription coactivators may be required to effectively stimulate CREB-dependent transcription in response to NGF. Our data support this hypothesis by revealing a previously unrecognized mechanism by which CREB and the coactivator CRTC1 mediate the effects of BDNF on dendritic length and complexity.There is compelling evidence supporting functional and cooperative interactions between BDNF and glutamate. Thus, in developing cortical and hippocampal neurons, glutamate and BDNF co-regulate one another such that glutamate increases the expression and secretion of BDNF (35Lessmann V. Gottmann K. Malcangio M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2003; 69: 341-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 36Zafra F. CastrÃ©n E. Thoenen H. Lindholm D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), and conversely, BDNF enhances glutamate release (31Takei N. Numakawa T. Kozaki S. Sakai N. Endo Y. Takahashi M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27620-27624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, BDNF enhances glutamatergic synaptic transmission through pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms (37Nicoll R.A. Schmitz D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Data from the present study provide evidence for a novel cooperative interaction between BDNF- and glutamate-mediated signaling that converges on CREB to regulate the expression of target genes involved in dendritic development.A role for activity in shaping dendritic morphology is well established (4Cline H.T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 38Sin W.C. Haas K. Ruthazer E.S. Cline H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 39Wong R.O. Ghosh A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). For instance, visual stimulation of Xenopus laevis tadpoles, which enhances synaptic activity on tectal neurons, promotes dendritic growth in an NMDA receptor-dependent manner (38Sin W.C. Haas K. Ruthazer E.S. Cline H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Because excitatory activity regulates the expression and secretion of BDNF, predominantly by glutamate signaling, this suggests that the cooperative interaction between BDNF- and glutamate-mediated signaling, described in this study, may have important implications in activity-dependent dendritic growth by facilitating the transcription of CREB target genes that contribute to the development of dendritic morphology. IntroductionDendrites are the primary sites where neurons receive and integrate information from a vast number of synaptic inputs. The specific branching pattern of dendrites determines the number and type of synapses received by a neuron (1Whitford K.L. Dijkhuizen P. Polleux F. Ghosh A. Annu. Rev.

Indeed, defects in dendritic growth are associated with some forms of mental retardation, including Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome (2Benavides-Piccione R. Ballesteros-YÃ¡Ã±ez I. de LagrÃ¡n M.M.

Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 5Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2627-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This multistep process is regulated both by intrinsic genetic programs that are capable of generating a basic dendritic arborization and by external signals such as neuronal activity, guidance molecules, and growth factors that are essential for sculpting dendrites to their final form (1Whitford K.L. Dijkhuizen P. Polleux F. Ghosh A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 127-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 6Dijkhuizen P.A. Ghosh A. J.

There is compelling in vitro and in vivo evidence that BDNF, a member of the neurotrophin family, regulates dendritic morphology. In particular, BDNF plays an important role in controlling the dendritic length and branching of pyramidal neurons in the developing visual cortex (8McAllister A.K. Lo D.C. Katz L.C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 9McAllister A.K. Katz L.C. Lo D.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In addition, BDNF overexpression in pyramidal neurons induces sprouting of basal dendrites (10Horch H.W. KrÃ¼ttgen A. Portbury S.D. Katz L.C. Neuron. 1999; 23: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and release of BDNF from single cells elicits local dendritic growth in nearby neurons (11Horch H.W. Katz L.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, the underlying mechanisms by which BDNF exerts its effects on dendritic growth remain largely unknown.Neurotrophins trigger a variety of biological responses by activating Trk receptor tyrosine kinases (12Reichardt L.F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Binding of neurotrophins to Trk receptors leads to the activation of three major intracellular signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, and phospholipase CÎ³1 (PLCÎ³1) 2The abbreviations used are: PLCÎ³1phospholipase CÎ³1CREBcAMP response element-binding proteinCRTCCREB-regulated transcription coactivator. (12Reichardt L.F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Neurotrophin signaling through the MAPK, PI3K, and PLCÎ³1 pathways regulates neuronal differentiation, neuronal survival, and synaptic plasticity, respectively (12Reichardt L.F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Trk-mediated signaling can propagate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription through the activation of several transcription factors (12Reichardt L.F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is activated by BDNF (13Finkbeiner S. Tavazoie S.F. Maloratsky A. Jacobs K.M. Harris K.M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1031-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) and plays a key role in mediating dendritic development in response to neuronal activity (14Redmond L. Ghosh A. Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although CREB activation requires phosphorylation of serine 133, there is evidence that phosphorylation of CREB is not always sufficient to initiate gene transcription (15Bonni A. Ginty D.D. Dudek H. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 16Ravnskjaer K. Kester H. Liu Y. Zhang X. Lee D. Yates 3rd, J.R. Montminy M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that additional factors such as CREB-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs), also known as transducers of regulated CREB activity (17Conkright M.D. Canettieri G.

Cell. 2003; 12: 413-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), may control CREB-mediated gene transcription. CRTCs are latent cytoplasmic coactivators that shuttle to the nucleus in response to increased levels of calcium and cAMP (18Bittinger M.A. McWhinnie E. Meltzer J. Iourgenko V. Latario B. Liu X.

After translocation into the nucleus, CRTCs associate with the basic leucine zipper domain of CREB independently of its phosphorylation status and increase CREB transcriptional activity (17Conkright M.D. Canettieri G.

Among CRTC family members, CRTC1 is primarily expressed in the brain and is involved in activity-dependent transcription of BDNF and in late-phase long-term potentiation (21KovÃ¡cs K.A. Steullet P.

Although there is compelling evidence supporting a critical role of BDNF in regulating dendritic morphology, the signaling pathways and downstream effectors necessary for BDNF to promote dendritic development of cortical neurons remain to be identified.In this study, we show that activation of MAPK, CREB, and CRTC1 mediates BDNF-induced changes in cortical dendritic morphology. We provide evidence that nuclear translocation of CRTC1 results from NMDA receptor-mediated activation of calcineurin and is essential for the regulation of cortical dendritic development by BDNF."
https://openalex.org/W2075174315,"Today the majority of wild great ape populations are found outside of the network of protected areas in both Africa and Asia, therefore determining if these populations are able to survive in forests that are exploited for timber or other extractive uses and how this is managed, is paramount for their conservation.In 2007, the ""Kinabatangan Orang-utan Conservation Project"" (KOCP) conducted aerial and ground surveys of orang-utan (Pongo pygmaeus morio) nests in the commercial forest reserves of Ulu Segama Malua (USM) in eastern Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Compared with previous estimates obtained in 2002, our recent data clearly shows that orang-utan populations can be maintained in forests that have been lightly and sustainably logged. However, forests that are heavily logged or subjected to fast, successive coupes that follow conventional extraction methods, exhibit a decline in orang-utan numbers which will eventually result in localized extinction (the rapid extraction of more than 100 m(3) ha(-1) of timber led to the crash of one of the surveyed sub-populations). Nest distribution in the forests of USM indicates that orang-utans leave areas undergoing active disturbance and take momentarily refuge in surrounding forests that are free of human activity, even if these forests are located above 500 m asl. Displaced individuals will then recolonize the old-logged areas after a period of time, depending on availability of food sources in the regenerating areas.These results indicate that diligent planning prior to timber extraction and the implementation of reduced-impact logging practices can potentially be compatible with great ape conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2047193578,"Background Glaucoma is a major blinding disease characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and axons. Optineurin is one of the candidate genes identified so far. A mutation of Glu50 to Lys (E50K) has been reported to be associated with a more progressive and severe disease. Optineurin, known to interact with Rab8, myosin VI and transferrin receptor (TfR), was speculated to have a role in protein trafficking. Here we determined whether, and how optineurin overexpression and E50K mutation affect the internalization of transferrin (Tf), widely used as a marker for receptor-mediated endocytosis. Methodology/Principal Findings Human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and rat RGC5 cells transfected to overexpress wild type optineurin were incubated with Texas Red-Tf to evaluate Tf uptake. Granular structures or dots referred to as foci formed in perinuclear regions after transfection. An impairment of the Tf uptake was in addition observed in transfected cells. Compared to overexpression of the wild type, E50K mutation yielded an increased foci formation and a more pronounced defect in Tf uptake. Co-transfection with TfR, but not Rab8 or myosin VI, construct rescued the optineurin inhibitory effect, suggesting that TfR was the factor involved in the trafficking phenotype. Forced expression of both wild type and E50K optineurin rendered TfR to colocalize with the foci. Surface biotinylation experiments showed that the surface level of TfR was also reduced, leading presumably to an impeded Tf uptake. A non-consequential Leu157 to Ala (L157A) mutation that displayed much reduced foci formation and TfR binding had normal TfR distribution, normal surface TfR level and normal Tf internalization. Conclusions/Significance The present study demonstrates that overexpression of wild type optineurin results in impairment of the Tf uptake in RPE and RGC5 cells. The phenotype is related to the optineurin interaction with TfR. Our results further indicate that E50K induces more dramatic effects than the wild type optineurin, and is thus a gain-of-function mutation. The defective protein trafficking may be one of the underlying bases why glaucoma pathology develops in patients with E50K mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2098687626,"Dopamine (phasic release) is implicated in conditioned responses. Imaging studies in cocaine abusers show decreases in striatal dopamine levels, which we hypothesize may enhance conditioned responses since tonic dopamine levels modulate phasic dopamine release. To test this we assessed the effects of increasing tonic dopamine levels (using oral methylphenidate) on brain activation induced by cocaine-cues in cocaine abusers. Brain metabolism (marker of brain function) was measured with PET and (18)FDG in 24 active cocaine abusers tested four times; twice watching a Neutral video (nature scenes) and twice watching a Cocaine-cues video; each video was preceded once by placebo and once by methylphenidate (20 mg). The Cocaine-cues video increased craving to the same extent with placebo (68%) and with methylphenidate (64%). In contrast, SPM analysis of metabolic images revealed that differences between Neutral versus Cocaine-cues conditions were greater with placebo than methylphenidate; whereas with placebo the Cocaine-cues decreased metabolism (p<0.005) in left limbic regions (insula, orbitofrontal, accumbens) and right parahippocampus, with methylphenidate it only decreased in auditory and visual regions, which also occurred with placebo. Decreases in metabolism in these regions were not associated with craving; in contrast the voxel-wise SPM analysis identified significant correlations with craving in anterior orbitofrontal cortex (p<0.005), amygdala, striatum and middle insula (p<0.05). This suggests that methylphenidate's attenuation of brain reactivity to Cocaine-cues is distinct from that involved in craving. Cocaine-cues decreased metabolism in limbic regions (reflects activity over 30 minutes), which contrasts with activations reported by fMRI studies (reflects activity over 2-5 minutes) that may reflect long-lasting limbic inhibition following activation. Studies to evaluate the clinical significance of methylphenidate's blunting of cue-induced limbic inhibition may help identify potential benefits of this medication in cocaine addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2007251619,"The adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) is increasingly recognized as a novel therapeutic target in Parkinson disease. In striatopallidal neurons, the G-protein Î±olf subtype is required to couple this receptor to adenylyl cyclase activation. It is now well established that the Î²Î³ dimer also performs an active role in this signal transduction process. In principal, sixty distinct Î²Î³ dimers could arise from combinatorial association of the five known Î² and 12 Î³ subunit genes. However, key questions regarding which Î²Î³ subunit combinations exist and whether they perform specific signaling roles in the context of the organism remain to be answered. To explore these questions, we used a gene targeting approach to specifically ablate the G-protein Î³7 subtype. Revealing a potentially new signaling paradigm, we show that the level of the Î³7 protein controls the hierarchial assembly of a specific G-protein Î±olfÎ²2Î³7 heterotrimer in the striatum. Providing a probable basis for the selectivity of receptor signaling, we further demonstrate that loss of this specific G-protein heterotrimer leads to reduced A2AR activation of adenylyl cyclase. Finally, substantiating an important role for this signaling pathway in pyschostimulant responsiveness, we show that mice lacking the G-protein Î³7 subtype exhibit an attenuated behavioral response to caffeine.

G-protein-coupled receptors represent the single largest family of target proteins for drug development. Their actions require the participation of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins) whose roles in these diverse signaling pathways may be determined by their specific Î±Î²Î³ subunit combinations. The existence of 16 Î±, 5 Î², and 12 Î³ subtypes creates the potential to generate a large number of distinct G-protein Î±Î²Î³ heterotrimers (1Hildebrandt J.D. Biochem.

To address these questions, a gene-targeting approach has been used to delete the various Î± subunit genes in mice, leading to the identification of physiological functions for most of them (5Offermanns S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By contrast, little attention has focused on the Î² and Î³ subunit genes. In particular, several features of the Î³ subunit genes suggest they may perform heterogeneous functions in vivo. Analogous to their Î± partners, the various Î³ subtypes show substantial structural diversity and exhibit pleiotropic patterns of expression (2Robishaw J.D. Berlot C.H. Curr. Opin.

Accordingly, we have undertaken a gene targeting approach to systematically ablate the individual Î³ subtypes in mice (6Schwindinger W.F. Betz K.S. Giger K.E. Sabol A. Bronson S.K. Robishaw J.D. J.

Within the brain, the striatum collects and processes information from the cerebral cortex and thalamus affecting the control of voluntary movements (8Matamales M. Bertran-Gonzalez J. Salomon L.

Accounting for >90% of neurons within the striatum, the medium spiny neurons are comprised of two distinct subpopulations that are classified on the basis of their distinct circuitries (9Cauli O. Morelli M. Behav. Pharmacol. 2005; 16: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The striato-nigral (SN) neurons projecting to the substania nigra pars reticulata and entopeduncular nucleus constitute the direct tract, whereas the striato-pallidal (SP) neurons projecting to the lateral part of the globus pallidus comprise the indirect tract (8Matamales M.

Typically, a coordinated balance between these two tracts produces normal movements, whereas a preponderance of one tract over the other is implicated in producing motor abnormalities associated with basal ganglia disorders (10Albin R.L.

In the SN neurons, the D1R acts through the G-protein Î±olf subunit to stimulate cAMP production (12Corvol J.C. Studler J.M. Schonn J.S. Girault J.A. HervÃ© D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Based on recent analyses of Gng7â/â mice, this action is also dependent on the Î³7 subtype (6Schwindinger W.F.

Intriguingly, in the SP neurons, the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) also couples through the G-protein Î±olf subunit to enhance cAMP production even though this pathway produces the opposite behavioral effect (12Corvol J.C.

Notably, these results indicate that assembly of the Î±olfÎ²2Î³7 heterotrimer is an ordered process that is controlled by the amount of the Î³7 subtype. Moreover, loss of the G-protein Î³7 subunit led to defects in both D1R (6Schwindinger W.F. Betz K.S. Giger K.E. Sabol A. Bronson S.K. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol.

Importantly, these findings contribute to a growing literature that suggests that blockade of A2AR signaling in the striatum may be an effective strategy for treating various neurological and addictive disorders. Disruption of Gng7, the gene encoding the G-protein Î³7 subunit in mice, was described previously (6Schwindinger W.F. Betz K.S. Giger K.E. Sabol A. Bronson S.K. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol.

Gng7+/â mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) for 5 generations, or separately to BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories) for 5 generations. Gng7+/â mice were intercrossed to produce the Gng7â/â mice and wild-type littermates used in these experiments. In this work, we will describe these mice as âon a C57BL/6 background,â or âon a BALB/c background.â However, after only 5 generations of backcrosses, there is still some contribution to their genetic makeup from the original ES cells (129SvEvBrd, Lexicon Genetics, Inc., The Woodlands, TX), from the dam that was bred with the chimera (C57BL/6 albino, Lexicon), and from the Cre recombinase expressing strain that we utilized (BALB/c-TgN(CMV-Cre)#Cgn, Jackson Laboratories). Hence, it was essential to use littermates to control for the possible influence of genetic background to observed responses. On the C57BL/6 background, 16 Gng7â/â mice (8 males and 8 females) and 16 wild-type littermates (8 males and 8 females) were studied. On the BALB/c background, 12 Gng7â/â mice (6 males and 6 females), and 14 wild-type littermates (4 males and 10 females) were studied. Genotypes were determined by PCR analysis of tail biopsy DNA as described previously (6Schwindinger W.F. Betz K.S. Giger K.E. Sabol A. Bronson S.K. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol.

These were backcrossed for up to 9 generations with C57BL/6 mice to obtain homozygous (Gnalâ/â) and their control littermates (Gnal+/+). For comparing homozygous mutant and wild-type mice, 6-week-old male and female mice were used for experiments. Mice were segregated by sex and group housed in plastic microisolator cages in ventilated racks (Thoren Caging Systems, Inc., Hazelton, PA). Mice were given ad lib access to water and Mouse Diet 9F (Purina Mills, LLC, St. Louis, MO). Environmental factors included temperature and humidity control and a 12-hour light/dark cycle. The animal facility is maintained as virus antibody-free and parasite-free. The Geisinger Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved animal research protocols. Striatal tissues were homogenized in Buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.3 mm AEBSF, 30 Î¼m leupeptin, 1 Î¼m pepstatin A) with 10% sucrose using a Brinkmann Homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments Co, Westbury, NY). Membranes were then isolated by centrifugation (65 min at 100,000 Ã g) onto a cushion of Buffer A with 44.5% (w/v) sucrose. The membranes at the interface were transferred to a new tube and twice washed with Buffer A and collected by centrifugation (30 min at 100,000 Ã g). Protein concentrations were determined with Coomassie Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Rockford, IL). Adenylyl cyclase activity was determined by incubating membrane protein (20 Î¼g) at 30 Â°C for 15 min in 0.1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 Ã 106 cpm of [Î±-32P]ATP, 10 Î¼m rolipram, 1 unit/ml adenosine deaminase, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and various agonists as indicated in the text. Reactions were terminated by addition of 0.1 ml of 2% SDS, 40 mm ATP, 1.4 mm cAMP, 10,000 cpm of [3H]cAMP, and heating to 100 Â°C for 3 min. [32P]cAMP was isolated by chromatography on Dowex and Alumina columns, using [3H]cAMP as a recovery marker, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Radioligand binding to A2AR in striatal membranes prepared from Gng7â/â mice and wild-type littermates was performed using either the radiolabeled agonist [125I]2-[2-(4-amino-3-iodo-phenyl)ethylamino]adenosine (125I-APE) or the radiolabeled antagonist 125I-ZM241385 as described previously (14Luthin D.R.

The agonist, 125I-APE binds to two affinity states of the A2AR, a high affinity state corresponding to receptor-G-protein complexes, and a low affinity state corresponding to receptors uncoupled from G-proteins (15Murphree L.J.

Because GTPÎ³S added to membranes uncouples receptors from G-proteins, 50 Î¼m GPTÎ³S was added to some membranes to measure agonist binding to largely uncoupled receptors. In the absence of added GTPÎ³S, 125I-APE binds preferentially to G-protein coupled receptors. 125I-APE also binds to uncoupled receptors, but may under measure total receptor number because a fraction of the radioligand may dissociate for the low affinity site during washing of filters. Hence, the total number of receptors (Bmax) was more accurately detected as the number of specific binding sites for the high affinity antagonist, 125I-ZM241385. Nonspecific radioligand binding was measured in the presence of 50 Î¼m N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA). To examine the expression of G-protein subunits in mouse striatum, Western blot analysis was performed on cholate-solublized membranes that were prepared as described previously (6Schwindinger W.F.

To examine levels of mRNA for Î±olf, Î²2, Î³7, and DARPP-32, RNA was prepared from striatum of six Gng7â/â mice and six wild-type littermates at the N24 backcross to C57BL/6 and real-time RT-PCR was conducted as described previously (20Schwindinger W.F.

Primers were as follows: Gnal (CCT TCC TAC TTG CCT GAC CGC; TGA CGA TAG TGC TTT TCC CGG), Gng7 (GCT GGG ATC GAA CGC ATC AAG; CAG GAA GAT CCC GGC ATT CAC), Gnb2 (TCA TAG GTC ACG AGT CGG ACA TCA; ATG GCA TCC CAG ATG TTG CAG TTG), Ppp1r1b (CAC CAC CCA AAG TCG AAG AGA; CGA AGC TCC CCT AAC TCA TCCT), and to correct for variation in cDNA yield Eef1a1 (GGA ATG GTG ACA ACA TGC TG; CGT TGA AGC CTA CAT TGT CC). Locomotor activity was quantified in CLAMS cages (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). The cages consist of clear plastic boxes (20 cm Ã 10 cm Ã 12.5 cm) fitted with three rows of 8 photoelectric sensors (x, y, and z directions). The mice were placed in the CLAMS cages at 11 am and remained in the cages for 4 h. During this time the mice had ad lib access to water. Every minute the numbers of individual (total) and consecutive (ambulatory) photobeam breaks for each of 3 sensor arrays, and the number of contacts with the sipper tube were recorded. For caffeine trials, mice were removed from the cages after 1 h and given an intraperitoneal injection of saline or caffeine (5 ml/kg). Mice that had been habituated to the CLAMS cages and to the injection procedure with saline were used in drug trials. The locomotor response to drug is expressed as an increment over the response to saline. Locomotor activities were studied at age 10.0 Â± 0.8 weeks for C57BL/6 background mice and age 8.5 Â± 0.3 weeks for BALB/c background mice. The response to caffeine was studied at age 23.6 Â± 3.0 weeks for C57BL/6 background mice and age 14.6 Â± 0.3 weeks for BALB/c background mice. Sample statistics and Student's t-tests were computed using Excel (Microsoft). Data are presented as means Â± S.E. of the mean. Locomotor activity was compared by repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), using JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Carey, NC). The A2AR is primarily responsible for the psychostimulant action of caffeine (21Ledent C. Vaugeois J.M. Schiffmann S.N. Pedrazzini T. El Yacoubi M. Vanderhaeghen J.J. Costentin J. Heath J.K.

Because blockade of this receptor has been shown to reverse the hypolocomotor phenotype resulting from dopamine deficiency (23Salamone J.D. Ishiwari K. Betz A.J. Farrar A.M. Mingote S.M. Font L.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5848-5852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the A2AR signaling components are increasingly recognized as valid therapeutic targets for treating Parkinson disease and for reducing the side effects of levodopa therapy (25Bara-Jimenez W.

In SP neurons, the G-protein Î±olf subunit has been shown to positively couple this receptor to stimulation of cAMP production (27Kull B. Svenningsson P. Fredholm B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 12Corvol J.C. Studler J.M. Schonn J.S. Girault J.A. HervÃ© D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, little information is available on the obligatory Î² and Î³ components involved in this context. By applying biochemical and behavioral approaches to a novel mouse model, we found that the G-protein Î³7 subunit is specifically required for both A2AR signaling and psychostimulant response to caffeine. Identifying a mechanistic basis for this requirement, we show that the Î³7 protein drives the preferential assembly of a G-protein Î±olfÎ²2Î³7 heterotrimer in the striatum that is involved in a key signaling pathway controlling locomotion and reward. Regulation of cAMP production in medium spiny neurons represents a primary target of many neurotransmitters and psychoactive drugs that affect short- and long-term locomotor responses (28Borgkvist A. Fisone G. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2007; 31: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Virtually all medium spiny neurons, including SN and SP neurons, express substantial levels of Î³7 mRNA (29Watson J.B. Coulter 2nd, P.M. Margulies J.E. de Lecea L. Danielson P.E. Erlander M.G.

Because adenylyl cyclase signaling by the D1R was shown to be dependent on Î³7 expression in SN neurons (6Schwindinger W.F. Betz K.S. Giger K.E. Sabol A. Bronson S.K. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6575-6579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we explored whether adenylyl cyclase signaling by the A2AR is similarly dependent on expression of Î³7 in SP neurons. As a biochemical assay, we used the selective A2AR agonist, CGS-21680, to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity in striatal membranes prepared from Gng7â/â mice. By comparison to their wild type littermates, adenylyl cyclase activity in response to 10 Î¼m or 25 Î¼m CGS-21680 was reduced by 30â40% in striatal membranes from Gng7â/â mice (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, cAMP production in response to 100 Î¼m forskolin was also reduced by â¼35% in striatal membranes from Gng7â/â mice (Fig. 1B). Because forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was reduced, we could not assess whether the impaired response to the A2AR agonist was due to a defect in G-protein coupling and/or adenylyl cyclase activation. Therefore, as a second biochemical assay, we used high affinity agonist binding to directly measure the actual interaction between the A2AR and the G-protein. Initial saturation binding experiments were performed with the A2AR agonist, 125I-APE, on pooled samples of striatal membranes from either Gng7â/â mice or their wild-type littermates (12 mice in each group). In the wild-type sample, the addition of GTPÎ³S dramatically reduced agonist binding by greater than 75%, indicating a significant portion of the A2AR was associated with G-protein (Fig. 2A). In contrast, in the knock-out sample, addition of GTPÎ³S produced little reduction in A2AR agonist binding (Fig. 2B), suggesting most A2AR was no longer coupled to G-protein. Finally, there was no significant difference in the binding of the A2AR antagonist, 125I-ZM241385, between the samples (Fig. 2C), indicating the total number of A2AR was comparable between the two genotypes. Taken together, these results indicate a striking reduction in the fraction of the A2AR that was coupled to G-protein in striatal membranes from Gng7â/â mice. Subsequent binding studies were performed on striatal membranes from individual mice representing each genotype. To calculate the fraction of the A2AR pool that was coupled to G-protein, we determined the ratio of specific GTPÎ³S-sensitive 125I-APE agonist binding sites relative to 125I-ZM421385 antagonist binding sites in striatal membranes from both genotypes. By comparison to their wild-type littermates, the fraction of the A2AR pool that was coupled to G-protein was markedly reduced in striatal membranes from Gng7â/â mice (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these results confirm that A2AR signaling shows a specific requirement for G-protein Î³7 expression and that its loss is associated with an impaired ability of this receptor to couple to G-protein. One mechanism that could account for the observed defects in both G-protein coupling and adenylyl cyclase activation is a coordinate reduction in the cellular amount of the G-protein Î±s or Î±olf subunit. These two structurally related isoforms are both able to stimulate cAMP production (12Corvol J.C. Studler J.M. Schonn J.S. Girault J.A. HervÃ© D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and are both expressed in the striatum (32HervÃ© D. LÃ©vi-Strauss M. Marey-Semper I. Verney C. Tassin J.P. Glowinski J. Girault J.A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2237-2248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that loss of the Î³7 subunit coordinately reduced levels of the Î±olf protein in the striatum (6Schwindinger W.F. Betz K.S. Giger K.E. Sabol A. Bronson S.K. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6575-6579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To confirm and extend this finding, we performed immunoblot analysis on micropunch samples from dorsal striatum (caudate) and ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) of Gng7â/â mice on two different genetic backgrounds (i.e. C57BL/6 and BALB/c). By comparison to their wild-type littermates, Î±olf protein levels were strikingly reduced by >85% in both dorsal and ventral striatal membranes from knock-out animals on a C57BL/6 genetic background (Fig. 3A). The effect was remarkably specific in that Î±s protein levels (i.e. 45- and 52-kDA forms) were not affected in the dorsal striatum and were reduced by only 20% in the ventral striatum of knock-out mice (Fig. 3B). Attesting to the generality of this finding, immunoblot analysis of the corresponding regions of knock-out mice on a BALB/c genetic background yielded similar results (supplemental Fig. S1). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the cellular level of the Î±olf but not the Î±s subunit is dependent on expression of the Î³7 subunit. Next, we investigated how loss of the Î³7 protein impacts the levels of particular Î² protein(s) in the striatum. Because targeting of the Î²Î³ dimer to the plasma membrane is dependent upon post-translational lipid modifications of the Î³ subunit (33IÃ±iguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J.

Cell. 1992; 3: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we reasoned that loss of the Î³7 protein could affect the level of a specific Î² subtype in striatal membranes from Gng7â/â mice. By comparison to their wild-type littermates, Î²2 protein levels were selectively reduced by 31% with no significant changes in the amounts of Î²1 and Î²4 proteins (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these findings show both coordinate and selective suppression of the Î±olf, Î²2, and Î³7 subunits at the protein level. To assess whether the Î±olf subunit plays a reciprocal role in this process, we used the Gnalâ/â mouse model (13Belluscio L. Gold G.H. Nemes A. Axel R. Neuron. 1998; 20: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) to determine whether loss of the Î±olf protein causes a corresponding suppression of the Î³7 protein. By comparison to their wild type littermates, Î³7 protein levels were not significantly different in striatal membranes from Gnalâ/â mice (Fig. 4), indicating that the expression of the Î³7 but not the Î±olf protein drives the assembly of a specific G-protein heterotrimer in the striatum. One mechanism that could account for suppression of the Î±olf protein is a reduced level of the corresponding mRNA transcript. To test this possibility, we performed real time RT-PCR analysis on striatal tissue from Gng7â/â mice and their wild-type littermates on the C57BL/6 background. Despite the loss of Î±olf protein (Fig. 4), the level of Î±olf mRNA was not significantly reduced in the striatum of Gng7â/â mice (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the level of Î²2 mRNA was not significantly different in wild type and Gng7â/â str"

Hypertonic stress induced in inner medullary (IMCD3) cells by addition of NaCl to the medium substantially up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of AQP1, suggesting that its activation occurs at a transcriptional and a translational levels. In contrast, no up-regulation of AQP1 was observed when these cells were exposed to the same tonicity by addition of urea. To explore the transcriptional activation of aqp1 under hypertonic stress, we examined the role of the transcription factor associated with hypertonicity, TonEBP. Treatment of IMCD3 cells with the TonEBP inhibitor rottlerin or silencing its expression with specific shRNA technology led to a substantial reduction in AQP1 expression under hypertonic conditions. Moreover, we defined a conserved TonEBP binding site located 811 bp upstream of the aqp1 exon that is essential for its expression. Single site-directed mutation of this TonE site led to a 54 Â± 5% (p < 0.01) decrease in AQP1 luciferase-driven activity under hypertonic stress. TonEBP mutant mice display marked decrement in the expression of AQP1 in the inner medulla. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that TonEBP is necessary for the regulation of AQP1 expression in the inner medulla of the kidney under hypertonic conditions."

Thrombin is a pivotal serine proteinase product of the blood coagulation cascade. In addition to catalyzing fibrinogen cleavage and platelet activation to form the blood clot, it also plays essential regulatory roles (1Davie E.W. Kulman J.D. Semin. Thromb.

It catalyzes proteolytic activation steps that amplify flux toward thrombin formation following initiation of the coagulation cascade. Thrombin also functions as a negative regulator by activating protein C in the anticoagulant pathway (3Esmon C.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2006; 32: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These opposing roles of thrombin in coagulation derive from its ability to act with specificity on a range of protein substrates, with differing sequences flanking the cleavage sites, in reactions that are regulated by cofactors and two anion-binding exosites (ABE1 and ABE2) 2The abbreviations used are: ABEanion-binding exositeF12fragment 1.2DAPAdansyl-l-arginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amideFPRckd-Phe-l-Pro-l-Arg chloromethyl ketoneBisTris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propaneIIathrombinP2prethrombin 2IIaiFPRck-inactivated IIa. found on opposite faces of the proteinase (4Bode W.

Thrombin and the other serine proteinases of blood coagulation contain catalytic domains bearing the chymotrypsin fold (6Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In this family, the zymogen precursor is converted to proteinase by cleavage following Arg15 (7Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). 3Residues in IIa and P2 are numbered according to the homologous residues in chymotrypsinogen (4Bode W. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2006; 32: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The nascent N terminus inserts in a sequence-specific manner into an N-terminal binding pocket to form a salt bridge with Asp194 (7Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Salt bridge formation is associated with changes in activation domains, optimization of the primary specificity pocket to facilitate substrate binding, and a flip in the Gly193 amide bond to form the oxyanion hole (7Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These transitions imbue the product with proteolytic activity. Early studies with chymotrypsin suggested the persistence of zymogen-like species at near-neutral pH, related to the partial deprotonation of the new N terminus responsible for salt bridge formation (8Fersht A.R. Requena Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is nevertheless implicitly assumed that irreversible cleavage at Arg15 and the concerted transitions that ensue highly favor proteinase formation. This is despite the likely presence of intervening equilibria between substates that lie on the pathway for conversion of zymogen to fully stabilized proteinase. A notable exception is factor VIIa which possesses poor catalytic activity and has been proposed to be zymogen-like when free and stabilized in the proteinase state when bound to tissue factor (9Higashi S.

Na+ is considered an essential player in thrombin allostery (10Di Cera E. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The Na+-binding site, absent in the zymogen but present in the proteinase, is proposed to control transitions of the enzyme between a putatively inactive E* form, a Na+-free slow form, and a Na+-bound fast species (10Di Cera E. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 11Bah A. Carrell C.J. Chen Z. Gandhi P.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2009; 284: 24098-24105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These enzymic species are considered to exhibit varying specificity and contribute differentially to the functions of thrombin as anticoagulant versus procoagulant enzyme (10Di Cera E. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The explosive growth in mutagenesis and x-ray crystallography investigating these phenomena has yielded a myriad of structures of variously distorted mutant forms of the enzyme interpreted to represent specific regulated states (10Di Cera E. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 13Di Cera E. IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The alternative suggestion that they instead represent zymogen-like species of thrombin forms the basis for this investigation (14Huntington J.A. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 7: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Zymogen activation to yield thrombin also produces large increases in the affinity of ligands for ABE1 (15Bock P.E. Panizzi P. Verhamme I.M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Based on differences in affinity for the zymogen relative to proteinase, substrates, inhibitors, Na+, and ABE1 ligands are all expected to energetically favor the proteinase. These ideas are supported by recent findings in NMR studies (16Lechtenberg B. Johnson D.J. Freund S. Huntington J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion of prothrombin to thrombin releases the N-terminal fragment 1.2 region (F12) as a propiece that reversibly associates with the proteinase as well as a precursor zymogen species through ABE2 (17Arni R.K. Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Wu T.P. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4727-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). F12 represents the authentic protein ligand for ABE2, with particular relevance to the process of thrombin formation. The recent observation that F12 binds to a zymogen precursor with higher affinity than to thrombin unexpectedly suggests that the conversion of zymogen to proteinase is accompanied by reciprocal changes in ligand affinity for the two exosites in thrombin (18Kamath P. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30164-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Whereas ligand binding to ABE1 is expected to favor the proteinase, ligation at ABE2 would instead favor the zymogen. If zymogen-like substates of thrombin can be significantly populated following zymogen cleavage, such reciprocal effects of liganding at ABE1 and ABE2 would provide a previously unanticipated mechanism for the regulation of its function. We now employ F12 as a tool in thermodynamic measurements to assess whether thrombin can exhibit zymogen-like behavior. Our finding that thrombin can interconvert between zymogen- and proteinase-like states in a ligand-dependent manner provides a new framework for understanding how its multiple functions are regulated. The thrombin inhibitor dansyl-l-arginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (DAPA; Hematologic Technologies), the peptidyl substrate l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanilide (S2366; Chromogenix), d-Phe-l-Pro-l-Arg chloromethyl ketone (FPRck; Calbiochem), and BisTris propane (Sigma) were from the indicated suppliers. Stock solutions of S2236 and DAPA were prepared in water, and concentrations were determined using E342 = 8270 mâ1 cmâ1 (S2236) and E340 = 4105 mâ1 cmâ1 (DAPA) (19Lottenberg R. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Choline chloride (ICN Biomedicals) was recrystallized from boiling ethanol and dried extensively in vacuo to yield a white, odorless, crystalline powder. Alternatively, high purity choline chloride (catalogue no. 219770500) was obtained from Acros Organics. Both types of choline chloride yielded equivalent results that were different from those obtained with lower grades of the salt. Prothrombin variants bearing the indicated mutations were expressed in HEK293 cells and purified from conditioned medium as described previously (21Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The variants were preparatively converted to thrombin (IIa) or to prethrombin 2 (P2) and purified as described (21Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The variants of P2 or IIa are subscripted to indicate the substitutions in the catalytic domain: IIaTAT contains Thr-Ala-Thr in place of Ile16-Val17-Glu18; P2S195A and IIaS195A contain Ala in place of Ser195; IIaS195A,W215A,E217A contains Ala substitutions at Ser195, Trp215, Glu217; and IIaD102N,S195A contains Asn in place of Asp102 and Ala in place of Ser195. The variant IIaE217K,S195A (with Lys substituted for Glu217 and Ala for Ser195) was prepared as described previously (22Johnson D.J. Adams T.E. Li W. Huntington J.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). F12 was prepared and purified from prothrombin isolated from plasma using established procedures (21Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IIa was prepared by preparative activation of prothrombin from plasma, followed by purification (23Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). IIai was prepared by inactivating plasma-derived thrombin with FPRck, followed by purification as described (21Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the following molecular weights and extinction coefficients (E280, mgâ1 cm2): F12, 34,800 and 1.12; and all P2 and thrombin variants, 37,500 and 1.94 (24Mann K.G. Elion J. Butkowski R.J. Downing M. Nesheim M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 286-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed using an iTC200 system (MicroCal) at 25 Â°C. All protein species were dialyzed for 18 h versus 10 liters of 20 mm BisTris propane, 0.15 m NaCl, and 5 mm Ca2+ (pH 7.4); concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration using an Ultracel-10K device (Amicon), if necessary; and centrifuged to remove particulates before use. The cell (204 Î¼l) contained either P2S195A or the indicated thrombin variant (5.5â23.9 Î¼m), and the injection syringe (45 Î¼l) contained F12 (97.9â436.4 Î¼m). Heat flow was measured with continuous stirring, following injections of F12 spaced at 180-s intervals. In a typical experiment, the first injection was 0.5 Î¼l, followed by 20 injections of 2 Î¼l each. Trivial heat flow due to ligand dilution and buffer mismatch was determined from an identical series of injections of F12 into dialysate. In some cases, the additional control of injecting dialysate into the cell containing P2S195A or a thrombin variant was also performed. For studies with DAPA, the indicated concentration of inhibitor was present in the syringe and the cell. For measurements with increasing NaCl concentrations, proteins were dialyzed into buffer containing either 150 mm NaCl or choline chloride. The desired protein and NaCl concentrations were obtained by mixing the two dialyzed samples. Small differences in thermodynamic constants reported here in comparison with a previous study done using Hepes (18Kamath P. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30164-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) at least partly reflect the use of BisTris propane as a buffer to permit studies with varying NaCl concentrations. Proteolysis during the experiment was limited by pursuing studies with S195A derivatives of IIa or P2 whenever possible. Lack of proteolysis during the experiment was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis of samples following dialysis and of expended reaction mixtures. Reaction mixtures (200 Î¼l) in wells of a 96-well plate containing the indicated concentrations of S2366 were initiated with either 1 or 2 nm thrombin. Initial rates of substrate hydrolysis were determined in a SpectraMax kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices) by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm. When necessary, initial rates were expressed in concentration terms using E405 = 9887 mâ1 cmâ1 (19Lottenberg R. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and an effective path length of 0.59 cm for a 200-Î¼l reaction volume. Studies were performed in 20 mm BisTris propane, 0.1% (w/v) PEG-8000, 5 mm Ca2+, and the indicated concentrations of NaCl with ionic strength maintained at 0.15 m using choline chloride. Buffers were adjusted to pH 7.4 or 8.0 with HCl following equilibration of the solution to either 25 or 37 Â°C. Initial velocities at 37 Â°C were determined by performing experiments in a room thermostatted at 37 Â°C. Origin scripts provided with the instrument were used to process heat flow traces, compute concentrations in the cell, integrate peaks, and subtract areas for the buffer control. Data were then analyzed using SedPhat (25Houtman J.C. Brown P.H. Bowden B. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Samelson L.E. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The A + B hetero-association model was used to obtain fitted values of Kd, ÎH, and base line and the calculated values of ÎG and ÎS, assuming a stoichiometry of 1. Slight deviations from the assumed stoichiometry were accommodated by fitting a value for the non-binding and heat silent fraction of incompetent protein in the cell. For global fits in the three-component experiments, analysis was according to the A + B + C hetero-association model. Errors in fitted parameters were computed by the Monte Carlo method to yield mean 67% confidence limits. Errors were propagated into the calculated terms (26Bevington P.R. Robinson K.D. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. 2nm Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Initial velocities were globally analyzed according to Scheme 3 employing the rapid equilibrium assumption using Dynafit (27Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Errors in the fitted parameters reflect linear approximations of 95% confidence limits. Thermodynamic studies have previously established that F12 binds with â¼20-fold higher affinity to the zymogen P2 than it does to thrombin (18Kamath P. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30164-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the binding of F12 to a thrombin variant (IIaTAT) bearing Thr-Ala-Thr in place of the N-terminal Ile16-Val17-Glu18 sequence, intended to impair salt bridge formation and the conformational transition to proteinase. In agreement with this intent, IIaTAT exhibits undetectable activity (<0.02%) toward peptidyl substrates (28Bianchini E.P. Orcutt S.J. Panizzi P. Bock P.E. Krishnaswamy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10099-10104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry of F12 binding to IIaTAT yielded heat traces and an isotherm (Fig. 1) intermediate to those expected from previous measurements of F12 binding to P2 or thrombin (18Kamath P. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30164-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, the thermodynamic constants for F12 binding are apparently sensitive to subtle aspects of proteinase formation beyond simply reporting on the cleavage, or lack thereof, at the Arg15âIle16 bond. To place the thermodynamic parameters obtained with cleaved but zymogen-like IIaTAT in context, we employed additional reference states capable of binding F12 but differentially poised along the pathway for the conversion of zymogen to proteinase: P2S195A is the uncleaved zymogen; IIaS195A (catalytic Ser195 substituted with Ala) was employed as the proteinase with an unoccupied active site; and IIai is wild-type thrombin covalently inactivated with FPRck to lock the enzyme into its most stable âproteinase-likeâ configuration by irreversibly occupying the active site. Isotherms for F12 binding yielded a family of curves wherein both shape and amplitude changed with the increasingly proteinase-like character of the reference species (Fig. 2). Fitted thermodynamic constants revealed that F12 binding to the zymogen P2S195A exhibited the highest affinity with large negative enthalpic and entropic contributions (Table 1). The equilibrium dissociation constant for F12 binding increased overall by â¼40-fold, progressing from zymogen, to cleaved but zymogen-like (IIaTAT), to proteinase with an unoccupied active site (IIaS195A), and to the ultimate stabilized proteinase (IIai) (Table 1). In comparison with the modest increase in ÎG, progression through this series yielded very large increases in both ÎH and TÎS (Table 1).TABLE 1Thermodynamic constants for the binding of F12 to reference statesSpeciesKdÎGÎHÎSFiaBinding stoichiometry was assumed to be 1.

Open table in a new tab Large and compensating changes in the thermodynamic constants were evident as a linear relationship between ÎH and ÎS with the reference states positioned along this plot in order of their increasing proteinase-like character (Fig. 2, inset). The extra thermodynamic information content of such enthalpy-entropy compensation has been debated (29Sharp K. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, a quasi-linear relationship between ÎH and ÎS, determined by calorimetry, is expected for the binding of a ligand to related states of a protein in reversible equilibrium with each other (29Sharp K. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 30Eftink M.R. Anusiem A.C. Biltonen R.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3884-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The linear relationship between ÎH and ÎS indicates that a common source of additivity distinguishes F12 binding to the different reference states with increasing proteinase-like character (29Sharp K. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 31Lumry R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 628-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We surmise that this relationship defines the thermodynamic trajectory for the conversion of zymogen to proteinase. The ability of the species to interconvert along this trajectory represents an essential feature of this interpretation. DAPA binds with high affinity to the active site of thrombin (20Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Titrations of IIaTAT with F12 in the presence of different fixed concentrations of DAPA yielded isotherms with decreasing amplitudes (Fig. 3). At high concentrations of DAPA, the isotherms resembled those obtained with the ultimate proteinase-like state (IIai) (Fig. 3). The data could be globally analyzed to yield thermodynamic constants for the stepwise binding interactions of DAPA and F12 with IIaTAT to form a ternary complex (Scheme 1). In contrast to the nanomolar affinity of DAPA for thrombin, the inferred binding of DAPA to IIaTAT was â¼1000-fold weaker (Scheme 1), consistent with the zymogen-like character of this species (28Bianchini E.P. Orcutt S.J. Panizzi P. Bock P.E. Krishnaswamy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10099-10104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The inferred constants for F12 binding to IIaTAT saturated with DAPA were similar to those obtained for the binding of F12 to IIai (Scheme 1 and Table 1). The results indicate that binding of DAPA to the zymogen-like variant IIaTAT stabilizes it in a proteinase-like state.SCHEME 1Linked thermodynamics for F12 and DAPA binding to IIaTAT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To provide a mechanism-independent test of this conclusion, ÎH and ÎS pairs were derived from individual fits of the traces. Values obtained for F12 binding to IIaTAT with increasing concentrations of DAPA were found to extend along the linear trajectory toward the IIai reference state (Fig. 4). The foregoing studies were conducted at 150 mm NaCl to replicate the concentration of Na+ in blood. We examined the binding of F12 to IIaS195A in the presence of decreasing concentrations of Na+ with ionic strength maintained at 0.15 m with choline chloride. Integrated heats increased with decreasing concentrations of Na+, yielding isotherms that increasingly resembled those obtained with the zymogen-like thrombin variant (Fig. 5). Global analysis of these data yielded thermodynamic constants for the stepwise binding interactions of Na+ and F12 with IIaS195A to form a ternary complex (Fig. 5 and Scheme 2). Minor differences were evident in isotherms for F12 binding to P2S195A or to IIai in the presence or absence of 150 mm Na+ (Fig. 5, inset). The zymogen is not expected to contain a Na+-binding site. Furthermore, IIai is irreversibly locked into the proteinase configuration and minimally affected by bound Na+ (16Lechtenberg B. Johnson D.J. Freund S. Huntington J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 32Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The observations suggest minor contributions from heat effects arising from Na+ binding to F12 and point to the validity of the global analysis according to Scheme 2. The principal findings are that IIaS195A is saturated with Na+ at 150 mm NaCl and that F12 binding to IIaS195A in the absence of Na+ closely mirrors its binding to zymogen-like IIaTAT at 150 mm NaCl (Scheme 2). The logarithmic relationship between affinity and energetic terms accounts for the close similarity in thermodynamic constants despite an â¼4-fold difference in inferred Kd for F12 binding to IIaTAT versus IIaS195A in the absence of Na+ (Schemes 1 and 2). Thus, bound Na+ is part of the stabilized structure of the proteinase state, and its dissociation converts IIaS195A to a more zymogen-like form. Accordingly, ÎH and ÎS pairs obtained from individual fits of the traces were found distributed along the linear trajectory extending toward IIaTAT with decreasing Na+ (Fig. 4).SCHEME 2Linked thermodynamics for F12 and Na+ binding to IIaS195A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There is a discrepancy between Kd = 5.8 Â± 0.5 mm for Na+ binding to thrombin obtained from our linkage analysis (Scheme 2) and published values of â¼35 mm at 25 Â°C and â¼120 mm at 35 Â°C (10Di Cera E. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To assess whether this discrepancy arose from a peculiar property of IIaS195A, we pursued initial velocity studies of peptidyl substrate hydrolysis to infer the binding of Na+ to wild-type thrombin (33Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of Na+ yielded a modest increase in the rate of S2366 hydrolysis (Fig. 6). Global analysis according to the kinetic model for nonessential activation (Scheme 3) provided an adequate description of the data (Fig. 6). The inferred binding constant for Na+ (KE,N) was in agreement with that determined from the thermodynamic linkage studies (Table 2). This further validates the conclusions derived from studies of the Na+-dependent binding of F12 to IIaS195A.TABLE 2Kinetic constants for the Na+-dependent modulation of peptidyl substrate cleavage by thrombinTpHKE,SKEN,Skcat(E)kcat(EN)KE,NKES,NÎ¼mÎ¼msâ1sâ1mmmm25 Â°C7.490 Â± 5150 Â± 560 Â± 2130 Â± 1.64.4 Â± 0.347.3 Â± 0.525 Â°C8.080 Â± 496 Â± 571 Â± 1121 Â± 1.45.7 Â± 0.556.8 Â± 0.737 Â°C7.4330 Â± 80170 Â± 35159 Â± 20229 Â± 1933.7 Â± 13.616.9 Â± 6.537 Â°C8.0280 Â± 1470 Â± 8164 Â± 4252 Â± 6159 Â± 2339.8 Â± 7.1 Open table in a new tab Recognizing the importance attached to the significance of Na+ affinity measured at physiologic temperature (10Di Cera E.

While increasingly common in model species, full-length cDNA resources in aquaculture species are scarce.Through in silico analysis of catfish (Ictalurus spp.) ESTs, a total of 10,037 channel catfish and 7,382 blue catfish cDNA clones were identified as potentially encoding full-length cDNAs. Of this set, a total of 1,169 channel catfish and 933 blue catfish full-length cDNA clones were selected for re-sequencing to provide additional coverage and ensure sequence accuracy. A total of 1,745 unique gene transcripts were identified from the full-length cDNA set, including 1,064 gene transcripts from channel catfish and 681 gene transcripts from blue catfish, with 416 transcripts shared between the two closely related species. Full-length sequence characteristics (ortholog conservation, UTR length, Kozak sequence, and conserved motifs) of the channel and blue catfish were examined in detail. Comparison of gene ontology composition between full-length cDNAs and all catfish ESTs revealed that the full-length cDNA set is representative of the gene diversity encoded in the catfish transcriptome.This study describes the first catfish full-length cDNA set constructed from several cDNA libraries. The catfish full-length cDNA sequences, and data gleaned from sequence characteristics analysis, will be a valuable resource for ongoing catfish whole-genome sequencing and future gene-based studies of function and evolution in teleost fishes."

Methods We identified N = 1,548,746 singleton births born in Denmark between January 1st 1979 through December 31st 2004, and their next of kin. Altogether, 39,857 children were exposed to bereavement during their prenatal life. The main outcome of interest was hospitalization for type-1 diabetes (ICD 8: 249; ICD 10: E10). Results We found the strongest association for type-1 diabetes among children exposed to traumatic father or sibling deaths (aIRR: 2.03, 1.22â3.38); the association was mainly seen for girls (aIRR: 2.91, 1.61â5.26). Conclusions We found evidence to suggest that female fetuses exposed to severe prenatal stress are at increased risk for developing type-1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1983084256,"Dynamic regulation of cell adhesion receptors is required for proper cell migration in embryogenesis, tissue repair, and cancer. Integrins and Syndecan4 (SDC4) are the main cell adhesion receptors involved in focal adhesion formation and are required for cell migration. SDC4 interacts biochemically and functionally with components of the Wnt pathway such as Frizzled7 and Dishevelled. Non-canonical Wnt signaling, particularly components of the planar cell polarity branch, controls cell adhesion and migration in embryogenesis and metastatic events. Here, we evaluate the effect of this pathway on SDC4. We have found that Wnt5a reduces cell surface levels and promotes ubiquitination and degradation of SDC4 in cell lines and dorsal mesodermal cells from Xenopus gastrulae. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that Dsh plays a key role in regulating SDC4 steady-state levels. Moreover, a SDC4 deletion construct that interacts inefficiently with Dsh is resistant to Wnt5a-induced degradation. Non-canonical Wnt signaling promotes monoubiquitination of the variable region of SDC4 cytoplasmic domain. Mutation of these specific residues abrogates ubiquitination and results in increased SDC4 steady-state levels. This is the first example of a cell surface protein ubiquitinated and degraded in a Wnt/Dsh-dependent manner."

Based on consensus sequences, the GABAA receptor Î²2 subunit contains three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, Asn-32, Asn-104, and Asn-173. Homology modeling indicates that Asn-32 and Asn-104 are located before the Î±1 helix and in loop L3, respectively, near the top of the subunit-subunit interface on the minus side, and that Asn-173 is located in the Cys-loop near the bottom of the subunit N-terminal domain. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that all predicted Î²2 subunit glycosylation sites were glycosylated in transfected HEK293T cells. Glycosylation of each site, however, produced specific changes in Î±1Î²2 receptor surface expression and function. Although glycosylation of Asn-173 in the Cys-loop was important for stability of Î²2 subunits when expressed alone, results obtained with flow cytometry, brefeldin A treatment, and endo-Î²-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion suggested that glycosylation of Asn-104 was required for efficient Î±1Î²2 receptor assembly and/or stability in the endoplasmic reticulum. Patch clamp recording revealed that mutation of each site to prevent glycosylation decreased peak Î±1Î²2 receptor current amplitudes and altered the gating properties of Î±1Î²2 receptor channels by reducing mean open time due to a reduction in the proportion of long open states. In addition to functional heterogeneity, endo-Î²-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion and glycomic profiling revealed that surface Î²2 subunit N-glycans at Asn-173 were high mannose forms that were different from those of Asn-32 and N104. Using a homology model of the pentameric extracellular domain of Î±1Î²2 channel, we propose mechanisms for regulation of GABAA receptors by glycosylation. Î³-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors are heteropentameric glycoproteins. Based on consensus sequences, the GABAA receptor Î²2 subunit contains three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, Asn-32, Asn-104, and Asn-173. Homology modeling indicates that Asn-32 and Asn-104 are located before the Î±1 helix and in loop L3, respectively, near the top of the subunit-subunit interface on the minus side, and that Asn-173 is located in the Cys-loop near the bottom of the subunit N-terminal domain. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that all predicted Î²2 subunit glycosylation sites were glycosylated in transfected HEK293T cells.

https://openalex.org/W2081318754,"Memory CD8+ T cells represent an important effector arm of the immune response in maintaining long-lived protective immunity against viruses and some intracellular bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes (L.m). Memory CD8+ T cells are endowed with enhanced antimicrobial effector functions that perfectly tail them to rapidly eradicate invading pathogens. It is largely accepted that these functions are sufficient to explain how memory CD8+ T cells can mediate rapid protection. However, it is important to point out that such improved functional features would be useless if memory cells were unable to rapidly find the pathogen loaded/infected cells within the infected organ. Growing evidences suggest that the anatomy of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) fosters the cellular interactions required to initiate naive adaptive immune responses. However, very little is known on how the SLOs structures regulate memory immune responses. Using Listeria monocytogenes (L.m) as a murine infection model and imaging techniques, we have investigated if and how the architecture of the spleen plays a role in the reactivation of memory CD8+ T cells and the subsequent control of L.m growth. We observed that in the mouse, memory CD8+ T cells start to control L.m burden 6 hours after the challenge infection. At this very early time point, L.m-specific and non-specific memory CD8+ T cells localize in the splenic red pulp and form clusters around L.m infected cells while naÃ¯ve CD8+ T cells remain in the white pulp. Within these clusters that only last few hours, memory CD8+ T produce inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-Î³ and CCL3 nearby infected myeloid cells known to be crucial for L.m killing. Altogether, we describe how memory CD8+ T cells trafficking properties and the splenic micro-anatomy conjugate to create a spatio-temporal window during which memory CD8+ T cells provide a local response by secreting effector molecules around infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2127952389,"Background Colonization with bacterial species from the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is associated with fast health decline among individuals with cystic fibrosis. In order to investigate the virulence of the Bcc, several alternative infection models have been developed. To this end, the fruit fly is increasingly used as surrogate host, and its validity to enhance our understanding of host-pathogen relationships has been demonstrated with a variety of microorganisms. Moreover, its relevance as a suitable alternative to mammalian hosts has been confirmed with vertebrate organisms. Methodology/Principal Findings The aim of this study was to establish Drosophila melanogaster as a surrogate host for species from the Bcc. While the feeding method proved unsuccessful at killing the flies, the pricking technique did generate mortality within the populations. Results obtained with the fruit fly model are comparable with results obtained using mammalian infection models. Furthermore, validity of the Drosophila infection model was confirmed with B. cenocepacia K56-2 mutants known to be less virulent in murine hosts or in other alternative models. Competitive index (CI) analyses were also performed using the fruit fly as host. Results of CI experiments agree with those obtained with mammalian models. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that Drosophila is a useful alternative infection model for Bcc and that fly pricking assays and competition indices are two complementary methods for virulence testing. Moreover, CI results indicate that this method is more sensitive than mortality tests."

These neobiosynthesized gangliosides move via vesicular transport to the plasma membrane, becoming components of the external leaflet. Gangliosides can undergo endocytosis followed by recycling to the cell surface or sorting to the Golgi complex or lysosomes for remodeling and catabolism. Recently, glycosphingolipid catabolic enzymes (glycohydrolases) have been found to be associated with the plasma membrane, where they display activity on the membrane components. In this work, we demonstrated that ecto-ganglioside glycosyltransferases may catalyze ganglioside synthesis outside the Golgi compartment, particularly at the cell surface. Specifically, we report the first direct evidence of expression and activity of CMP-NeuAc:GM3 sialyltransferase (Sial-T2) at the cell surface of epithelial and melanoma cells, with membrane-integrated ecto-Sial-T2 being able to sialylate endogenously synthesized GM3 ganglioside as well as exogenously incorporated substrate. Interestingly, we also showed that ecto-Sial-T2 was able to synthesize GD3 ganglioside at the cell surface using the endogenously synthesized cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) available at the extracellular milieu. In addition, the expression of UDP-GalNAc:LacCer/GM3/GD3 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) was also detected at the cell surface of epithelial cells, whose catalytic activity was only observed after feeding the cells with exogenous GM3 substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2018086273,"The specificity in phosphorylation by kinases is determined by the molecular recognition of the peptide target sequence. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the protein kinase A (PKA) specificity determinants are less studied than in mammalian PKA. The catalytic turnover numbers of the catalytic subunits isoforms Tpk1 and Tpk2 were determined, and both enzymes are shown to have the same value of 3 sâ1. We analyze the substrate behavior and sequence determinants around the phosphorylation site of three protein substrates, Pyk1, Pyk2, and Nth1. Nth1 protein is a better substrate than Pyk1 protein, and both are phosphorylated by either Tpk1 or Tpk2. Both enzymes also have the same selectivity toward the protein substrates and the peptides derived from them. The three substrates contain one or more Arg-Arg-X-Ser consensus motif, but not all of them are phosphorylated. The determinants for specificity were studied using the peptide arrays. Acidic residues in the position P+1 or in the N-terminal flank are deleterious, and positive residues present beyond P-2 and P-3 favor the catalytic reaction. A bulky hydrophobic residue in position P+1 is not critical. The best substrate has in position P+4 an acidic residue, equivalent to the one in the inhibitory sequence of Bcy1, the yeast regulatory subunit of PKA.

The results also suggest that protein substrates are better co-activators than peptide substrates. Protein phosphorylation is one of the most fundamental mechanisms for signal transduction. The specificity of signal transduction depends upon the ability of each kinase to precisely phosphorylate particular sites on specific substrate proteins. Protein kinase A (PKA) 3The abbreviations used are: PKAprotein kinase ATAPtandem affinity purificationISinhibitory siteSDsynthetic defined medium. is one of the best characterized members of this protein family (1Taylor S.S. Kim C. Vigil D. Haste N.M. Yang J. Wu J. Anand G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of its substrate targets is known to be critical for regulating a multitude of cellular processes, including metabolism, gene transcription, ion flux, growth, and cell death (2Walsh D.A.

The specificity in phosphorylation is determined by at least two major factors: peptide specificity and substrate and kinase localization. The effectiveness of protein phosphorylation by protein kinases in general, including PKA, is believed to depend on the primary structure of the protein around the phosphorylation site; synthetic peptides have thus been used to define the consensus phosphorylation sequences for PKA (3Kennelly P.J.

The basic consensus phosphorylation sites for this enzyme are Arg-Arg-X-(Ser/Thr), (Arg/Lys)-X-X-(Ser/Thr), and (Arg/Lys)-X-(Ser/Thr) (3Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

The molecular recognition of the peptide sequence surrounding the phosphorylated residue of a substrate usually is referred to as the âpeptide specificityâ of a protein kinase. The phosphorylated residue is conventionally named P0, the substrate residues immediately N- and C-terminal to the P0 position as Pâ1 and P+1, respectively, and so on. These substrate residues bind to their corresponding subsites on the catalytic sites of the protein kinases. Statistical analysis of proteins known to be phosphorylated has shown that many of the phosphorylation sites in the substrate proteins do not correspond exactly with the complete consensus sequence determinant (8Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. JÃ¤rv J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A screening of 150 physiological substrates of mammalian PKA, unique gene products for which one or more phosphorylation sites are known, permitted the evaluation of consensus sequences for PKA in a physiological context (9Shabb J.B. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The results indicated strong preferences for arginines at P-2 and/or P-3. The canonical Arg-Arg-X-Ser was the most abundant consensus sequence, representing around one-half of all sites. Though arginines are the preferred basic residues at P-2 and P-3, one every six sites contains at least one Lys at these positions, indicating a lower efficiency in the in vivo use of this determinant. Serine is by far preferred over threonine as the phosphate acceptor; other more subtle preferences at positions outside of the P-2 and P-3 positions also emerge upon closer inspection. There is a slight preference for Arg at the P-4 to P-7 positions and an increased occurrence of the hydrophobic residues Phe, Ile, Leu, or Val at P+1 (9Shabb J.B. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). There also is an increased frequency of the small residues Ser, Gly, and Pro at P-1. These positional biases are consistent with numerous in vitro studies utilizing peptides based on well characterized substrates such as the porcine pyruvate kinase LRRASLG heptapeptide kemptide, with biochemical and crystallographic analysis of PKA inhibitor peptide interactions (10Walsh D.A.

Whereas the substrate specificity determinants for mammalian PKA have been analyzed extensively, the specificity determinants for other organisms are much less understood. Denis et al. (15Denis C.L. Kemp B.E. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17932-17935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have analyzed Saccharomyces cerevisiae PKA substrate determinants using synthetic peptides derived from the local phosphorylation site sequence around Ser230 in the yeast transcriptional activator ADR1 and shown common specificity determinants with mammalian PKA substrates on the proximal N-terminal side and up to the +4 position of the C-terminal side of the phosphoacceptor. Previous results from our group have demonstrated that in yeast, a PKA substrate such as pyruvate kinase 1 (Pyk1) is less efficient as substrate than a peptide containing the phosphorylatable Ser22 residue despite having a higher affinity (16Portela P. Moreno S. Rossi S. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, the behavior of a protein kinase toward its substrate could be different depending on whether the substrate is an entire protein or the peptide derivative indicating that the ability of a kinase to modify a protein at a specific site is influenced by its structural context. In S. cerevisiae, PKA is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation (17Herman P.K. Curr. Opin Microbiol. 2002; 5: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 18Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The regulatory subunit is encoded by the BCY1 gene, and the C subunit is encoded by the TPK1, TPK2, and TPK3 genes. Yeast is a good model with which to search for and identify PKA substrates as its genome is completely known. Several PKA substrates have been described, and, very recently, proteomic approaches that simplify the search for new potential PKA substrates have been reported (19Budovskaya Y.V. Stephan J.S.

However, further work is needed to demonstrate that the candidate proteins identified are indeed PKA substrates and to identify their target sequences. The three Tpk1, Tpk2, and Tpk3 catalytic subunits appear to have both overlapping and distinct cellular functions (22Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M.

Nature. 2005; 438: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) indicated that Tpk1, Tpk2, and Tpk3 recognized 256, 29, and 79 substrates, respectively; however, only eight were recognized by all three kinases, and 39 were recognized by two of the three suggesting that each kinase has unique substrate specificity. The classic model of PKA activation proposes that the interaction of cAMP with R subunit decreases the affinity between R and C, and, as a consequence, the holoenzyme dissociates, thus freeing the catalytic subunit to phosphorylate its targets. However, several reports suggest that cAMP does not fully dissociate the holoenzyme, and a new role for the substrates has been proposed in PKA activation (26Yang S. Fletcher W.H. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6267-6271Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Viste K. Kopperud R.K. Christensen A.E. DÃ¸skeland S.O. J. Biol.

A complete understanding of the biological role of the S. cerevisiae PKA requires the complete characterization of the enzyme and of its targets. In this paper, we assess the sequence features surrounding the phosphorylation sites of three protein substrates. We demonstrate that Tpk1 and Tpk2 have the same selectivity and catalytic activity toward a number of peptidic and protein substrates. We clearly demonstrate that both peptide and protein substrates sensitize the holoenzyme to activation by cAMP. Yeast media were prepared as described (30Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981Google Scholar). Strains were grown on rich medium containing 2% bactopeptone, 1% yeast extract, and 2% galactose (YPGal), or 2% glucose (YPG), or 2% raffinose (YPR). Synthetic medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, plus the necessary additions to fulfill auxotrophic requirements (SD) were used to maintain the selectable plasmids. Solid medium contained 2% agar. Yeast strains used were as follows: KT 1115, Mata leu2 ura3 his3 pep4Î; NTH1-HA-His, KT1115 + pBG1805-NTH1-HA-His; PYK1-HA-His, KT1115 + pBG1805-PYK1-HA-His; PYK2-HA-His, KT1115 + pBG1805-PYK2-HA-His; JT20454(W), Mata his3 leu2 ura3 trp1 tpk1::ade8 tpk2::HIS3 tpk3::TRP1 msn2::LEU2 msn4::TRP1 + pPYK101; 033c TAP, S288C, MATa his3Î1 leu2Î0 met15Î0 ura3Î0; S330:W303, Mata tpk2::tpk1::KmR; S331:W303, Mata tpk2::tpk3::KmR; S332:W303, Mata tpk3::tpk1::KmR; S330 BCY1-TAP:W303, Mata tpk2::tpk1::KmR BCY1TAP; S331 BCY1-TAP:W303, Mata tpk2::tpk3::KmR BCY1TAP; and S332 BCY1-TAP:W303, Mata tpk2::tpk3::KmR BCY1TAP. Nth1 (neutral trehalase)-His, Pyk1-His, and Pyk2-His fusion proteins were purified from a KT1115 strain transformed with BG1805 plasmid containing cDNA from the following ORFs YDR001C, YAL038W, or YOR347C, under a Gal1 promoter (Open Biosystems). For the expression 25-ml SDâUra, 2% raffinose media culture was grown overnight and then diluted in 200 ml SDâUra, 2% raffinose media. The culture was grown up to A600 = 1.2 and added to 100 ml of 3Ã YP, 6% galactose, to a final concentration of 1Ã YP, 2% galactose and harvested after overnight incubation. The pellets were stored at â70 Â°C until used. For the purification, the cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 Ã g to remove the cellular debris. Resin nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) was added, and the mix was incubated overnight at 4 Â°C. The resin was washed with buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8). The proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8). Pyk1 protein without tag was purified from the S. cerevisiae strain JT20454 containing pPYK101 vector (plasmid containing Pyk1 cDNA under its own promoter), using a previously described method (31Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6803-6813Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The yeast strain overexpresses Pyk1 when grown in 2% glucose media. Briefly, the semipurification of the enzyme involved two chromatography steps, DEAE-cellulose, and phosphocellulose and ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitated protein was stored at â20 Â°C. The yeast PKA holoenzyme (TPKs-Bcy1) was purified from a yeast tandem affinity purification (TAP)-fusion strain that contains the ORF of TAP-tagged Bcy1 (YJL033W; Open Biosystems). The standard TAP procedure (32Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. SÃ©raphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar) was applied but using only one specific affinity purification step: binding to IgG-Sepharose 4B through the protein A IgG binding domains of the ORF. This source of immobilized holoenzyme was used for PKA activation experiments. The yeast Tpk1 or Tpk2 enzymes were purified from yeast TAP-fusion strains, which express only one isoform of Tpk and the TAP-tagged Bcy1, constructed essentially as described (33Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3306) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fragment containing the C-terminal coding region of Bcy1 fused to the TAP epitope including the HIS3 selectable marker was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from the Bcy1-TAP strain using the primers F 5â²-AGACCATGATTATTTCGGTG-3â² and R 5â²-GTAGTAACAGCAGTAGTAGA-3â². The strains S331 and S332 were transformed with the PCR products by the lithium acetate method. Integration at the corresponding locus was tested by PCR. Expression of the protein fusions was tested by Western blot using anti-TAP or anti-Bcy1 antibodies. Tpk1 or Tpk2 enzymes were purified using the standard TAP procedure using the first affinity purification with IgG-Sepharose 4B. After exhaustive washing, Tpk1 or Tpk2 were eluted with 50 mm cAMP. These sources of pure enzyme were used immediately for phosphorylation experiments without storage. For the experiments in which the source of enzyme was the mixture of the three Tpk enzymes, the enzyme purification was made using the same protocol, but the strain used in this case was a Bcy1 TAP-tagged wild-type strain containing the three functional Tpk isoforms. Tpk1 and Tpk2 units from purified enzymes were defined as the pmol of enzyme that transfer 1 pmol of phosphate to kemptide/min, at 30Â°C, under the standard assay conditions. The amount of each enzyme was estimated by SDS-PAGE silver staining against a calibration curve of BSA. The identity of each enzyme after purification was verified by mass spectrometric data from tryptic digestion of SDS-PAGE gel bands obtained using a MALDI-TOF-TOF spectrometer, Ultraflex II (Bruker) from the mass spectrometry facility Centro de Estudios QuÃ­micos y BiolÃ³gicos por EspectrometrÃ­a de Masa, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Argentina. The catalytic turnover number of Tpk1 and Tpk2 was calculated using the protein concentration estimated by SDS-PAGE and the catalytic activity using kemptide at saturating concentration as substrate of the same purification sample. PKA activity was determined by assay of phosphotransferase activity with kemptide, Ser22, Nth1-1, Nth1-2, or Pyk1 peptides as substrates. The assay was initiated by mixing different amounts of PKA sources (either soluble Tpk1, Tpk2, or purified immobilized Tpk-BCY1 holoenzyme) with 15 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, phosphatase inhibitor mixture (10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O710H2O, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm (NH4)6MO7O24) and EDTA-free protease inhibitor (buffer A), 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm [Î³-32P]ATP (1000 dpm/pmol) plus the protein or peptide substrates at the concentrations indicated in each experiment, plus variable concentrations of cAMP, when added. A standard assay, for unit definition, contains a saturating concentration of 300 Î¼m kemptide. Incubations were for 10 min at 30 Â°C. PKA assays were linear with time and enzyme protein concentration. PKA activity is expressed in pmol of phosphate incorporated into substrate/min at 30 Â°C. When using peptides as substrates, aliquots of the incubation mixture were processed according to the phosphocellulose paper method (34Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). For protein substrates, aliquots of the reaction mixture were analyzed through SDS-PAGE. The incorporation of phosphate into the substrate was determined by digital image analysis and further densitometric quantitation and is expressed in arbitrary units. Alternatively, the amount of incorporation of phosphate into the substrate was determined by scintillation counting of the phosphorylated protein band excised from SDS-PAGE gels. For the holoenzyme activation assays, immobilized purified PKA holoenzymes were used for measurement of kinase activity at various cAMP concentrations as described above using different substrates and calculating the A0.5 value for cAMP under each condition. Two statistics analysis tests were applied to validate the curves. The D'Agostino and Pearson normality test, which indicated that the curves, showed deviation not significant from the model. We also applied the ALLFIT program, which is used for the statistical analysis of families of sigmoidal dose-response curves using the four-parameter logistic equations. All curves had a good statistical significance with p > 0.05, indicating the quality of the curve fit. The F ratio test was not significant within each of the two groups of proteins (Nth1 and Ser22 on one side and Pyk1, Pyk2, and kemptide on the other) indicating that the data shared the two parameters: IC50 and slope. However, the F ratio test corresponding to the comparison of the IC50 and slope from one group of peptides (Nth1 and Ser 22) with the other (Pyk1, Pyk2 and kemptide) is significant. Cellulose-bound peptide arrays were prepared automatically according to standard spot synthesis protocols by using a spot synthesizer (Abimed Analysen-Technik, Langenfeld, Germany) by Susan Taylor's laboratory, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California at San Diego). The membranes were first wet in ethanol and further placed in phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2) containing 0.2 mg/ml BSA overnight at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated at 30 Â°C for 45 min in phosphorylation buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 Î¼m ATP. The phosphorylation reaction was performed in phosphorylation buffer plus 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 100 Î¼m ATP, 200 Î¼Ci [Î³-32P]ATP, and 150 pmol of Tpk subunits during 1 h at 30 Â°C. The membrane was rinsed 10 Ã 15 min with 1 m NaCl, 3 Ã 5 min with H2O, 3 Ã 15 min with H3PO4 5%, and 3 Ã 5 min with H2O and 3 Ã 2 min with ethanol. The membrane was dried and subjected to digital image analysis (Bio-Imaging Analyzer Bas-1800II and Image Gauge version 3.12, FujiFilm). A global analysis of in vitro protein phosphorylation in yeast has shown that Tpks display differential protein selectivity (21Ptacek J. Devgan G. Michaud G. Zhu H. Zhu X. Fasolo J. Guo H. Jona G.

Nature. 2005; 438: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). To define which are the differences in the target sequences that determine the unique substrate specificity for each Tpk, we assessed the kinetic behavior of peptide substrates derived from three proteins, Pyk1 (pyruvate kinase 1), Pyk2 (pyruvate kinase 2), and Nth1 (neutral trehalase) that have been identified as physiological substrates of PKA in yeast (16Portela P. Moreno S. Rossi S. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 35Portela P. Howell S. Moreno S. Rossi S. J. Biol.

Both Pyk1 and Nth1 proteins have been described in the global analysis of protein phosphorylation in yeast as being selective substrates for Tpk1; in fact, the selectivity of Tpk2 was limited to a few numbers of proteins suggesting a strict recognition of substrates (21Ptacek J. Devgan G. Michaud G. Zhu H. Zhu X. Fasolo J. Guo H. Jona G. Breitkreutz A. Sopko R. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Rachidi N. Lee S.J. Mah A.S. Meng L. Stark M.J. Stern D.F. De Virgilio C. Tyers M. Andrews B. Gerstein M. Schweitzer B. Predki P.F. Snyder M. Nature. 2005; 438: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). As a first step, we corroborated the in vitro phosphorylation of the three proteins by a purified mixture of Tpks as an enzyme source, using purified His-Nth1, His-Pyk1, and His-Pyk2 as substrates (supplemental Fig. 1). Pyk1 and Pyk2 have only one RRXS motif in their primary sequence. We have demonstrated previously that Pyk1 is a Tpk1 substrate and that the major PKA phosphorylation site is Ser22 (16Portela P. Moreno S. Rossi S. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The sequence surrounding the Ser22 position in Pyk1 is conserved in the yeast isoform Pyk2 at Ser24. We have demonstrated that Pyk2 protein also is phosphorylated in vitro by Tpk1 with a better specificity constant than Pyk1 (35Portela P. Howell S. Moreno S. Rossi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30477-30487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To design the peptides for this study, we have selected the amino acid sequences from P-6 to P+4 surrounding the phosphorylation site P0, as these residues are described to be influenced by direct interaction with the kinase in the catalytic site (9Shabb J.B. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 10Walsh D.A. Glass D.B. Mitchell R.D. Curr. Opin Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We also include a shorter peptide, Ser22, common to both Pyk1 and Pyk2. Nth1 also has been defined as a PKA substrate (36Uno I. Matsumoto K. Adachi K. Ishikawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10867-10872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wera S. De Schrijver E. Geyskens I. Nwaka S. Thevelein J.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Nth1 amino acid sequence shows three potential phosphorylation sites, Ser20, Ser21, and Ser83 included in a consensus PKA phosphorylation motif RRXS. Genetic results have correlated the phosphorylation of all the three serines with trehalase activation by PKA (37Wera S. De Schrijver E. Geyskens I. Nwaka S. Thevelein J.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A recent global study of in vivo yeast phosphoproteome detects peptides containing Ser phosphorylated at these three positions for Nth1 (20Gnad F. de Godoy L.M. Cox J. Neuhauser N. Ren S. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 4642-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Table 1 summarizes the sequences of the peptides designed for the kinetic study.TABLE 1Peptides derived from protein substrates Open table in a new tab Purified preparations of Tpk1 and Tpk2 were used as an enzyme source to measure their kinetic parameters with the different peptide substrates. The purification of Tpk3 from a strain expressing Bcy1-TAP and only the Tpk3 isoform was unsuccessful, even though the purification was made from very large amounts of cultures, and the activity was assayed with different concentrations of substrate and/or ATP. The results of Km, kcat, and the derived Kesp values are summarized in a Table inserted within Fig. 1. Several important conclusions are derived from these results. The first is that the Km and kcat for Tpk1 and Tpk2 with all the assayed peptides are the same, indicating no selectivity between the two isoforms. A catalytic turnover number of 3 sâ1 has been estimated using kemptide as substrate for Tpk1 and Tpk2. This value is almost 10-fold lower than the turnover of mammalian C subunits, which is in the range of 20 sâ1 (38Lieser S.A. Aubol B.E. Wong L. Jennings P.A. Adams J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The second and important conclusion is that although all the substrates include a RRXS consensus m"

Contrary to this, our study reveals that it regulates the defense pathways of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) to enhance its pathogenicity. In a murine model of typhoid fever, we observed higher bacterial load in Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph node, spleen and liver, when infected with curcumin-treated Salmonella. Curcumin increased the resistance of S. Typhimurium against antimicrobial agents like antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. This increased tolerance might be attributed to the up-regulation of genes involved in resistance against antimicrobial peptides - pmrD and pmrHFIJKLM and genes with antioxidant function - mntH, sodA and sitA. We implicate that iron chelation property of curcumin have a role in regulating mntH and sitA. Interestingly, we see that the curcumin-mediated modulation of pmr genes is through the PhoPQ regulatory system. Curcumin downregulates SPI1 genes, required for entry into epithelial cells and upregulates SPI2 genes required to intracellular survival. Since it is known that the SPI1 and SPI2 system can be regulated by the PhoPQ system, this common regulator could explain curcumin's mode of action. This data urges us to rethink the indiscriminate use of curcumin especially during Salmonella outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2102435105,"Cucumisin is a subtilisin-like serine protease (subtilase) that is found in the juice of melon fruits (Cucumis melo L.). It is synthesized as a preproprotein consisting of a signal peptide, NH(2)-terminal propeptide, and 67-kDa protease domain. We investigated the role of this propeptide (88 residues) in the cucumisin precursor. Complementary DNAs encoding the propeptides of cucumisin, two other plant subtilases (Arabidopsis ARA12 and rice RSP1), and bacterial subtilisin E were expressed in Escherichia coli independently of their mature enzymes. The cucumisin propeptide strongly inhibited cucumisin in a competitive manner with a K(i) value of 6.2 Â± 0.55 nm. Interestingly, cucumisin was also strongly inhibited by ARA12 and RSP1 propeptides but not by the subtilisin E propeptide. In contrast, the propeptides of cucumisin, ARA12, and RSP1 did not inhibit subtilisin. Deletion analysis clearly showed that two hydrophobic regions, Asn(32)-Met(38) and Gly(97)-Leu(103), in the cucumisin propeptide were important for its inhibitory activity. Site-directed mutagenesis also confirmed the role of a Val(36)-centerd hydrophobic cluster within the Asn(32)-Met(38) region in cucumisin inhibition. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the cucumisin propeptide had a secondary structure without a cognate protease domain and that the thermal unfolding of the propeptide at 90 Â°C was only partial and reversible. A tripeptide, Ile(35)-Val(36)-Tyr(37), in the Asn(32)-Met(38) region was thought to contribute toward the formation of a proper secondary structure necessary for cucumisin inhibition. This is the first report on the function and structural information of the propeptide of a plant serine protease."
https://openalex.org/W2020400701,"The myocardium responds to hemodynamic stress through cellular growth and organ hypertrophy. The impact of cytoskeletal elements on this process, however, is not fully understood. While alpha-actin in cardiomyocytes governs muscle contraction in combination with the myosin motor, the exact role of beta-actin has not been established. We hypothesized that in adult cardiomyocytes, as in non-myocytes, beta-actin can facilitate cytoskeletal rearrangement within cytoskeletal structures such as Z-discs. Using a feline right ventricular pressure overload (RVPO) model, we measured the level and distribution of beta-actin in normal and pressure overloaded myocardium. Resulting data demonstrated enriched levels of beta-actin and enhanced translocation to the Triton-insoluble cytoskeletal and membrane skeletal complexes. In addition, RVPO in vivo and in vitro hypertrophic stimulation with endothelin (ET) or insulin in isolated adult cardiomyocytes enhanced the content of polymerized fraction (F-actin) of beta-actin. To determine the localization and dynamics of beta-actin, we adenovirally expressed GFP-tagged beta-actin in isolated adult cardiomyocytes. The ectopically expressed beta-actin-GFP localized to the Z-discs, costameres, and cell termini. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements of beta-actin dynamics revealed that beta-actin at the Z-discs is constantly being exchanged with beta-actin from cytoplasmic pools and that this exchange is faster upon hypertrophic stimulation with ET or insulin. In addition, in electrically stimulated isolated adult cardiomyocytes, while beta-actin overexpression improved cardiomyocyte contractility, immunoneutralization of beta-actin resulted in a reduced contractility suggesting that beta-actin could be important for the contractile function of adult cardiomyocytes. These studies demonstrate the presence and dynamics of beta-actin in the adult cardiomyocyte and reinforce its usefulness in measuring cardiac cytoskeletal rearrangement during hypertrophic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2160336490,"Background During locomotion, vision is used to perceive environmental obstacles that could potentially threaten stability; locomotor action is then modified to avoid these obstacles. Various factors such as lighting and texture can make these environmental obstacles appear larger or smaller than their actual size. It is unclear if gait is adapted based on the actual or perceived height of these environmental obstacles. The purposes of this study were to determine if visually guided action is scaled to visual perception, and to determine if task experience influenced how action is scaled to perception. Methodology/Principal Findings Participants judged the height of two obstacles before and after stepping over each of them 50 times. An illusion made obstacle one appear larger than obstacle two, even though they were identical in size. The influence of task experience was examined by comparing the perception-action relationship during the first five obstacle crossings (1â5) with the last five obstacle crossings (46â50). In the first set of trials, obstacle one was perceived to be 2.0 cm larger than obstacle two and subjects stepped 2.7 cm higher over obstacle one. After walking over the obstacle 50 times, the toe elevation was not different between obstacles, but obstacle one was still perceived as 2.4 cm larger. Conclusions/Significance There was evidence of locomotor adaptation, but no evidence of perceptual adaptation with experience. These findings add to research that demonstrates that while the motor system can be influenced by perception, it can also operate independent of perception."
https://openalex.org/W1979991119,"NF-ÎºB is an important transcription factor involved in various biological responses, including inflammation, cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis. ÎºB-Ras was identified as an IÎºB-interacting small GTPase and is reported to disturb cytokine-induced NF-ÎºB activation. In this study, we established that ÎºB-Ras is a novel type of nuclear-cytoplasmic small GTPase that mainly binds to GTP, and its localization seemed to be regulated by its GTP/GDP-binding state. Unexpectedly, the GDP-binding form of the ÎºB-Ras mutant exhibited a more potent inhibitory effect on NF-ÎºB activation, and this inhibitory effect seemed to be due to suppression of the transactivation of a p65/RelA NF-ÎºB subunit. ÎºB-Ras suppressed phosphorylation at serine 276 on the p65/RelA subunit, resulting in decreased interaction between p65/RelA and the transcriptional coactivator p300. Interestingly, the GDP-bound ÎºB-Ras mutant exhibited higher interactive affinity with p65/RelA and inhibited the phosphorylation of p65/RelA more potently than wild-type ÎºB-Ras. Taken together, these findings suggest that the GDP-bound form of ÎºB-Ras in cytoplasm suppresses NF-ÎºB activation by inhibiting its transcriptional activation."

A better understanding of the molecular events underlying hair cell regeneration in birds may allow for identification and eventually manipulation of relevant pathways in mammals to stimulate regeneration and restore hearing in deaf patients.Gene expression was profiled in forskolin treated (i.e., proliferating) and quiescent control auditory epithelia of post-hatch chicks using an Affymetrix whole-genome chicken array after 24 (n = 6), 48 (n = 6), and 72 (n = 12) hours in culture. In the forskolin-treated epithelia there was significant (p<0.05; >two-fold change) upregulation of many genes thought to be relevant to cell cycle control and inner ear development. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed on the data and identified myriad microRNAs that are likely to be upregulated in the regenerating tissue, including microRNA181a (miR181a), which is known to mediate proliferation in other systems. Functional experiments showed that miR181a overexpression is sufficient to stimulate proliferation within the basilar papilla, as assayed by BrdU incorporation. Further, some of the newly produced cells express the early hair cell marker myosin VI, suggesting that miR181a transfection can result in the production of new hair cells.These studies have identified a single microRNA, miR181a, that can cause proliferation in the chicken auditory epithelium with production of new hair cells."
https://openalex.org/W1974321772,"The human APOBEC3G (A3G) protein is a cellular polynucleotide cytidine deaminase that acts as a host restriction factor of retroviruses, including HIV-1 and various transposable elements. Recently, three NMR and two crystal structures of the catalytic deaminase domain of A3G have been reported, but these are in disagreement over the conformation of a terminal beta-strand, beta2, as well as the identification of a putative DNA binding site. We here report molecular dynamics simulations with all of the solved A3G catalytic domain structures, taking into account solubility enhancing mutations that were introduced during derivation of three out of the five structures. In the course of these simulations, we observed a general trend towards increased definition of the beta2 strand for those structures that have a distorted starting conformation of beta2. Solvent density maps around the protein as calculated from MD simulations indicated that this distortion is dependent on preferential hydration of residues within the beta2 strand. We also demonstrate that the identification of a pre-defined DNA binding site is prevented by the inherent flexibility of loops that determine access to the deaminase catalytic core. We discuss the implications of our analyses for the as yet unresolved structure of the full-length A3G protein and its biological functions with regard to hypermutation of DNA."

The practice of studying immune responses to complicated pathogens with this tool demands extensive knowledge of T cell epitopes and the availability of peptide:MHC complexes for array fabrication as well as a specialized data analysis approach for result interpretation.We co-immobilized peptide:DR0401 complexes, anti-CD28, anti-CD11a and cytokine capture antibodies on the surface of chamber slides to generate a functional array that was able to detect rare Ag-specific T cell populations from previously primed in vitro T cell cultures. A novel statistical methodology was also developed to facilitate batch processing of raw array-like data into standardized endpoint scores, which linearly correlated with total Ag-specific T cell inputs. Applying these methods to analyze Influenza A viral antigen-specific T cell responses, we not only revealed the most prominent viral epitopes, but also demonstrated the heterogeneity of anti-viral cellular responses in healthy individuals. Applying these methods to examine the insulin producing beta-cell autoantigen specific T cell responses, we observed little difference between autoimmune diabetic patients and healthy individuals, suggesting a more subtle association between diabetes status and peripheral autoreactive T cells.The data analysis system is reliable for T cell specificity and functional testing. Peptide:MHC cellular microarrays can be used to obtain multi-parametric results using limited blood samples in a variety of translational settings."
https://openalex.org/W1989509205,"Background Host defense against invading pathogens is triggered by various receptors including toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of TLRs is a pivotal step in the initiation of innate, inflammatory, and antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Human Î²-defensin 2 (HBD-2) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide secreted upon Gram-negative bacterial perturbation in many cells. Stimulation of various TLRs has been shown to induce HBD-2 in oral keratinocytes, yet the underlying cellular mechanisms of this induction are poorly understood. Principal Findings Here we demonstrate that HBD-2 induction is mediated by the Sphingosine kinase-1 (Sphk-1) and augmented by the inhibition of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) via the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) dependent pathway. HBD-2 secretion was dose dependently inhibited by a pharmacological inhibitor of Sphk-1. Interestingly, inhibition of GSK-3Î² by SB 216763 or by RNA interference, augmented HBD-2 induction. Overexpression of Sphk-1 with concomitant inhibition of GSK-3Î² enhanced the induction of Î²-defensin-2 in oral keratinocytes. Ectopic expression of constitutively active GSK-3Î² (S9A) abrogated HBD-2 whereas kinase inactive GSK-3Î² (R85A) induced higher amounts of HBD-2. Conclusions/Significance These data implicate Sphk-1 in HBD-2 regulation in oral keratinocytes which also involves the activation of PI3K, AKT, GSK-3Î² and ERK 1/2. Thus we reveal the intricate relationship and pathways of toll-signaling molecules regulating HBD-2 which may have therapeutic potential."

Through a differentiation assay with Xenopus animal cap embryonic stem cells, we confirmed that XH2AX is required for the activin-induced anterior neural specification of the ectoderm. Furthermore, we found that Chk1 is an essential kinase to phosphorylate histone XH2AX at Thr16, which is involved in the biological function of this histone.

During Xenopus laevis embryogenesis, one of the most important processes is gastrulation. Gastrulation converts the embryonic ball into the three layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) and establishes definitive anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes. Neural specification of anteroposterior patterning is generated on the basis of the neural ectoderm and requires inductive interaction between the dorsal mesoderm and presumptive neuroectoderm. The initial basal state of the neural ectoderm comprises the anterior part, and additional factors are required to generate the posterior portions of the nervous system (15Eyal-Giladi H. Arch.

The involvement of histone variants in the X. laevis development process has been reported previously. For example, histone variants of the H1 linker histone were reported to control embryonic gene expression patterns in X. laevis. The depletion of histone H2AZ, a variant of histone H2A, perturbs gastrulation, leading to embryos with malformed, shortened trunks (19Iouzalen N. Moreau J. MÃ©chali M.

Recently, a role for histone modification in X. laevis development was reported (23Wysocka J. Swigut T. Milne T.A. Dou Y. Zhang X. Burlingame A.L. Roeder R.G. Brivanlou A.H. Allis C.D.

Perturbation of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation in X. laevis resulted in a mesodermal and endodermal patterning defect (23Wysocka J. Swigut T. Milne T.A. Dou Y. Zhang X. Burlingame A.L. Roeder R.G. Brivanlou A.H. Allis C.D. Cell.. 2005; 121: 859-872Google Scholar). Histone H2A deubiquitination mediates embryonic anteroposterior patterning through the regulation of hox gene expression (24Joo H.Y. Zhai L. Yang C. Nie S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Chang C. Wang H. Nature.. 2007; 449: 1068-1072Google Scholar). These results thus suggest that general chromatin components are involved in pattern formation processes during early X. laevis development. However, to date, the physiological function of histone H2AX in vertebrate development has not yet been elucidated. Moreover, the role of histone H2AX post-translational modification in vertebrate development is unexplored. In this study, we report the function of histone H2AX in anterior neural development of X. laevis as a developmental model of vertebrates. Notably, we identified Chk1 (checkpoint kinase 1) as a functional kinase of histone H2AX Thr16 and this phosphorylation might be important for the function of histone H2AX in anterior neural development. Taken together, our results suggest a novel embryonic function of histone proteins, as well as Chk1 as a novel histone H2AX-modifying kinase in X. laevis. X. laevis embryos were obtained by artificial fertilization. Vitelline membranes were removed by immersing embryos in a 2% cysteine solution (pH 8). Embryos at the one- or two-cell stage were injected in the animal pole with mRNA as described in the figure legends. Animal caps, the area around the animal (pigmented) pole of the blastula embryos, were dissected from the injected embryos at stages 8â9 and cultured to various stages in 67% Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 50 Î¼g/ml gentamycin for 1 or 2 days. Activin was added to l-15 medium (25Ariizumi T. Takahashi S. Chan T.C. Ito Y. Michiue T. Asashima M. Curr. Protocols Stem Cell Biol. 2009; PubMed Google Scholar, 26Xu R.H. Dong Z. Maeno M. Kim J.

For RT-PCR, total RNA was extracted from whole embryos or cultured explants using TRIzol reagent (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR primers and cycling conditions are described at the Xenopus Molecular Marker Resource (XMMR, University of Texas). The morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (Gene Tools, LLC, Philomath, OR) directed against Xenopus histone H2AX (referred to as XH2AX-MO) was TGACGGCTTTTCCTCTGCCCGACAT, and its mismatching control (Control-MO) was TcACGGgTTTTCgTCTcCCCGAgAT. The morpholino antisense oligonucleotide of Xenopus Chk1 was 5â²-TTCAACAAACGGAACTGCCATTTTG-3â². In situ hybridization was performed with digoxigenin-labeled probes as described previously (20Ridgway P. Brown K.D. Rangasamy D. Svensson U. Tremethick D.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 43815-43820Google Scholar). For expression in Xenopus embryos, an XH2AX cDNA (Swiss-Prot accession number Q6GM86) was screened by RT-PCR using stage 11 embryos and cloned into the pCS2-FLAG vector at the EcoRI/XbaI restriction sites. To examine XH2AX-MO specificity, the XH2AX cDNA was cloned into the pCS2-HA vector at the BamHI/EcoRV sites. For rescue experiments, the XH2AX region (amino acid residues 1â8) targeted by morpholino was deleted by PCR and cloned into the pCS2-FLAG vector at the EcoRI/XbaI sites (referred to as FLAG-XH2AX-8aa). The Xenopus Chk1 cDNA (cDNA clone MGC 79140) was cloned into pCS2-FLAG or the HA vector at the EcoRI/XbaI or BamHI/EcoRV sites. The T16A mutant of histone XH2AX was generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To make the GST fusion protein, full-length XH2AX, an N-terminal fragment of XH2AX (amino acids 1â39), the same N-terminal fragment with the T16A mutant, or a C-terminal fragment of XH2AX (amino acids 102â138) was cloned into the pGEX vector at the BamHI/XhoI sites. The embryonic lysates were homogenized in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 containing 1 mm PMSF, 15 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, and 1Ã proteinase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and then used for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. The protein bands were visualized using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blotting, peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA (Roche), anti-phosphothreonine (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and monoclonal anti-actin (Sigma) antibodies were used. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed by incubating extracts overnight with monoclonal anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-phospho-Thr16 XH2AX antibody was obtained by immunizing rabbits against peptide RGKAVSKTRAKAK(pT)RSSRAG, followed by purification using a column linked to the non-phosphorylated peptide and a final purification using a column linked to the phosphorylated peptide (Bio-Synthesis Inc., Lewisville, TX). The indicated GST-XH2AX proteins (25 ng) were mixed together with the active Chk1 or Chk2 protein (Upstate Biotechnology), 0.2 mm ATP, and 1Ã kinase buffer (Invitrogen) and incubated at 30 Â°C for 30 min. Equal amounts of reactive products were divided into two portions for Western blotting and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Embryos were injected with the mRNA of FLAG-Chk1. Each of 30 embryos expressing FLAG-Chk1 was homogenized on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor including phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem)) and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at 4 Â°C. After two or three washes with lysis buffer and one wash with kinase buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF), the kinase reaction was performed as described above. We first determined the spatiotemporal expression pattern of XH2AX during X. laevis development to investigate a potential role for this histone. Using RT-PCR, we analyzed the temporal expression of XH2AX mRNA throughout embryogenesis. Temporally, XH2AX is expressed both maternally and zygotically throughout early development. XH2AX expression is markedly increased from the early neurula stage to the tail bud stage (Fig. 1A). To examine the spatial expression pattern of XH2AX, we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization during the embryonic stages. The unfertilized Xenopus egg is polarized along the animal to vegetal axis before fertilization, as shown by the pigmentation of the animal hemisphere and the presence of larger yolk platelets in the vegetal hemisphere. Spatially, XH2AX is detected in the animal hemisphere (Fig. 1B) and not in the vegetal hemisphere of the embryo during cleavage (Fig. 1C). During gastrulation, XH2AX is broadly detected in the animal hemisphere (Fig. 1D) throughout the marginal zone except the blastopore region (Fig. 1E). At the neurula and tail bud stages, XH2AX shows a restricted expression pattern in the anterior region containing the anterior central nervous system (Fig. 1, F and G). At later stages, XH2AX is localized in the brain, eye, otic vesicle, and branchial arches (Fig. 1, H and I). Transverse sections of embryos stained for H2AX show restricted XH2AX mRNA expression into the edge of the anterior region except for the hatching gland (Fig. 1J); anterior neural tissue, including eye, brain, and branchial arches (Fig. 1K); and the somite region (Fig. 1L). This result suggests that XH2AX might have a potential role in anterior neural development. To investigate the physiological role of XH2AX in X. laevis development, we performed a loss-of-function study using a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide directed against XH2AX (XH2AX-MO). We generated an XH2AX-MO that targets the first 25 nucleotides of the XH2AX mRNA coding sequence (Fig. 2A). As a specificity control, the same 5-mismatched morpholino oligonucleotide (Control-MO) was used (Fig. 2A). XH2AX-MO was effective in specifically reducing the level of the 3â²-terminal end HA-tagged H2AX protein (XH2AX-HA), whereas Control-MO had no effect on the translation of XH2AX mRNA (Fig. 2B). Injection of XH2AX-MO into the animal region at the one- or two-cell stage caused anterior neural defects, including microcephaly and eye defects (Fig. 2C), compared with uninjected normal embryos (Fig. 2D). The Control-MO-injected embryos showed a normal phenotype, indicating the specificity of XH2AX-MO (Fig. 2E). A hematoxylin-stained transverse section of the head region showed small eyes or eyes with defects (Fig. 2, F and G) compared with normal embryos that were not injected (Fig. 2H). Anterior neural defects were quantified and represented by histogram as the percent of embryos displaying developmental defects (Fig. 2I). The results indicate that the severity of the phenotypic defect induced by XH2AX-MO was dose-dependent. To characterize the phenotypic defects induced by depletion of XH2AX at the molecular level, we used RT-PCR to examine the expression of several neural markers in XH2AX-MO-injected embryos. Otx2, Rx1, and Pax6 are general anterior neural markers. N-CAM, a general pan-neural marker, and N-tubulin, a general neural differentiation marker, were used for RT-PCR. Consistent with the morphological defects, injection of XH2AX-MO suppressed the expression of general anterior neural markers (Otx2, Rx1, and Pax6), the pan-neural marker (N-CAM), and the neural differentiation marker (N-tubulin). The Control-MO-injected embryos had no effect on the expression of these markers (Fig. 2J, lane 6). Additionally, we examined the expression of the mesoderm marker actin and the posterior marker HoxB9. XH2AX-MO could not suppress the expression of actin or HoxB9 (Fig. 2J). These results provide evidence for a specific role of XH2AX in anterior neural development, but not in mesoderm and posterior formation at the molecular level. To further investigate the effect of XH2AX-MO in neural formation, including anterior neural tissue, XH2AX-MO was injected into the marginal zone of two dorsal (DMZ) or ventral (VMZ) blastomeres of four-cell stage embryos (Fig. 2K). The DMZ of amphibian embryos is a key embryonic region involved in body axis organization and neural induction (28Papan C. Boulat B. Velan S.S. Fraser S.E. Jacobs R.E. Dev. Biol... 2007; 305: 161-171Google Scholar, 29Shih J. Keller R. Development.. 1992; 116: 887-899Google Scholar). Compared with the phenotype of control embryos that were not injected (Fig. 2L), the embryos injected with XH2AX-MO dorsally showed severe defects in neural formation, including the anterior neural tissue (Fig. 2M), which is similar to the phenotypes caused by XH2AX depletion in the animal region of one-cell stage embryos. In contrast, embryos injected ventrally with XH2AX-MO showed no significant changes in phenotype (data not shown). Consistent with these phenotypes, RT-PCR analysis showed that the dorsally XH2AX-depleted embryos repressed neural markers, including specific anterior neural markers (Fig. 2N, lane 2), compared with either control embryos (lane 3) or ventrally XH2AX-depleted embryos (lane 1) without affecting the mesoderm markers actin and globin. These RT-PCR results are also paralleled with those changes caused by XH2AX-MO injection into the animal region. Taken together, these results indicate that depletion of XH2AX disrupts normal anterior neural development without affecting mesoderm induction. We then examined whether overexpression of XH2AX in XH2AX-MO-injected embryos could rescue the normal phenotype and reinstate the expression of neural molecular markers. For the rescue experiment, we used wild-type XH2AX-8aa mRNA, which lacks the MO-binding sites and is resistant to its translational inhibition as confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). The anterior neural defects observed in XH2AX-MO-injected embryos were effectively rescued by co-injection of wild-type XH2AX-8aa (Fig. 3B). XH2AX-MO-injected embryos showed a severe anterior neural defective phenotype (Fig. 3B, Type A panel). However, by coexpression with XH2AX-8aa, the normal phenotype was rescued (Fig. 3B, Type B and C panels) in a dose-dependent manner. The data are represented in the histogram as the percent of embryos displaying the particular phenotype (Fig. 3C). At the molecular level, the expression of anterior neural markers (Pax6, Rx1, and Otx2) and the pan-neural marker (N-CAM) (Fig. 3C, lane 1) in XH2AX-MO-injected embryos was also effectively rescued by coexpression of wild-type XH2AX-8aa (Fig. 3D, lane 2). Additionally, we performed in situ hybridization using whole embryos to analyze the expression of Pax6. Consistent with other results, the in situ hybridization analysis revealed that wild-type XH2AX-8aa could rescue Pax6 (Fig. 3G) previously suppressed by XH2AX-MO (Fig. 3, F and Fâ²). Taken together, these results demonstrate that XH2AX is critical for anterior neural development in X. laevis. To further verify the role of XH2AX in anterior neural development, we performed animal cap assays with activin, a well known morphogen of dorsoventral and anteroposterior neural axis determination. The so-called animal cap assay (isolation and differentiation of animal cap cells) is a useful method for investigating the mechanism of cell differentiation at the molecular level. The cells of the animal caps retain pluripotentiality, and upon exposure to specific inducers, the animal cap can differentiate into neural, mesodermal, or endodermal tissues, equivalent to mammalian embryonic stem cells (25Ariizumi T. Takahashi S. Chan T.C. Ito Y. Michiue T. Asashima M. Curr. Protocols Stem Cell Biol. 2009; PubMed Google Scholar, 27Okabayashi K. Asashima M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev... 2003; 13: 502-507Google Scholar). A high dose of activin can induce more anterior neural markers (30Ruiz i Altaba A. Melton D.A. Nature.. 1989; 341: 33-38Google Scholar, 31Green J.B. Smith J.C. Nature.. 1990; 347: 391-394Google Scholar, 32Green J.B. Cook T.L. Smith J.C. Grainger R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A... 1997; 94: 8596-8601Google Scholar, 33Thomsen G. Woolf T. Whitman M. Sokol S. Vaughan J. Vale W. Melton D.A. Cell.. 1990; 63: 485-493Google Scholar) in the animal cap assay. To investigate whether depletion of XH2AX can inhibit activin-induced anterior neural marker expression, animal caps isolated from XH2AX-MO-injected embryos were incubated with or without activin. XH2AX-MO, but not Control-MO, effectively inhibited the activin-induced expression of anterior neural markers, including pan-neural markers (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2â4). Consistent with these results, depletion of XH2AX inhibited the elongation of animal cap explants induced by activin (Fig. 4, D and E). Animal cap explants cultured in the absence of activin (Fig. 4B) or derived from embryos injected with wild-type XH2AX alone or XH2AX-MO alone (Fig. 4C) did not show any detectable morphological changes or expression of anterior neural specific markers (supplemental Fig. S1). Additionally, the suppressed expression of neural markers, as well as the defective phenotype of animal caps induced by XH2AX-MO, was effectively rescued by co-overexpression of wild-type XH2AX-8aa mRNA (Fig. 4, EâH, lanes 2â4). Overexpression of XH2AX was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4I). Interestingly, consistent with the data from whole embryos (Fig. 2, G and K), the expression of the mesoderm marker actin, induced by activin, was not changed by XH2AX-MO (Fig. 4, A and H). To determine whether overexpression of XH2AX can be incorporated into chromatin in embryos, histone proteins were isolated by acidic extraction (34Shechter D. Dormann H.L. Allis C.D. Hake S.B. Nat. Protocols.. 2007; 2: 1445-1457Google Scholar) from the nuclei of embryos. The incorporation of overexpressed FLAG-XH2AX into chromatin was confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody (supplemental Fig. S2). Histone H2B was detected as a control to verify histone extraction. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that XH2AX is required for anterior neural formation without affecting mesoderm formation. Covalent modification of histone variants is closely linked to transcriptional regulation and is required for many biological processes, including the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into specific tissue lineage (6Bhaumik S.R. Smith E. Shilatifard A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol... 2007; 14: 1008-1016Google Scholar, 35Margueron R. Trojer P. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet.

These studies provide evidence supporting the possibility that histone covalent modifications play crucial roles throughout development. A recent study showed that histone H3 phosphorylation at Thr11 by Chk1 has an important role in transcriptional regulation in unperturbed cells (37Shimada M. Niida H. Zineldeen D.H. Tagami H. Tanaka M. Saito H. Nakanishi M. Cell.. 2008; 132: 221-232Google Scholar). Additionally, it was suggested that Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of additional sites on chromatin might prove to be functionally important. Chk1 is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine-specific kinase classified as a checkpoint kinase because of its critical role in regulating cell cycle checkpoint responses to DNA damage (38Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell.. 2003; 3: 421-429Google Scholar, 39Boddy M.N. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Science.. 1998; 280: 909-912Google Scholar, 40Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P.

Recent studies have extended the role of Chk1 into genome maintenance, as a chromatin-modifying transcription factor in unperturbed proliferating cells, and as a target for anticancer therapy (37Shimada M. Niida H. Zineldeen D.H. Tagami H. Tanaka M. Saito H. Nakanishi M. Cell.. 2008; 132: 221-232Google Scholar, 42Enders G.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 17749-17752Google Scholar, 43Zaugg K. Su Y.W.

Furthermore, Chk1-deficient mice are embryonic lethal, indicating that Chk1 is essential for cell growth and differentiation at the early stages of development (44Takai H. Tominaga K. Motoyama N. Minamishima Y.A. Nagahama H. Tsukiyama T. Ikeda K. Nakayama K. Nakanishi M. Nakayama K. Genes Dev... 2000; 14: 1439-1447Google Scholar). To understand the function of Chk1 in X. laevis normal development, we observed the phenotypes of Chk1-depleted embryos by injecting Chk1-MO into the dorsal or ventral regions at the four-cell stage (Fig. 5A). Chk1-MO was effective in specifically reducing the level of the C-terminal end HA-tagged Chk1 protein (Fig. 5B). Dorsally Chk1-depleted embryos showed a severe defect in the anterior neural tissue (Fig. 5C) compared with control embryos (Fig. 5D). Consistent with this result, the dorsally Chk1-depleted embryos repressed the expression of anterior neural markers without affecting the mesoderm markers (Fig. 5E). In contrast, ventrally Chk1-depleted embryos showed no significant changes in phenotype (data not shown). These results agree well with the phenotype observed in dorsally XH2AX-depleted embryos (Fig. 2, M and N). Moreover, expression of the Chk1 protein was restricted to the anterior region, including the eye (Fig. 5F), in stage 40 embryos, and the distribution of Chk1 is consistent with the XH2AX expression pattern (Fig. 1I). To further investigate the relationship between Chk1 and XH2AX, we examined the localization of injected Chk1 and XH2AX proteins by immunostaining. As expected, the injected Chk1 and XH2AX proteins were localized in the nucleus (supplemental Fig. S3). Furthermore, the direct association of these proteins was examined by immunoprecipitation assay in vivo. HA-Chk1 is co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-XH2AX by anti-Myc antibody. A reverse immunoprecipitation experiment confirmed this result (Fig. 6A). This physical interaction between Chk1 and XH2AX in vivo suggested that Chk1 might have a role as an XH2AX kinase.FIGURE 6XH2AX is phosphorylated by Chk1 at Thr16 of the N terminus.

A schematic representation of the structure of XH2AX (Fig. 6B) and expression of GST-recombinant XH2AX constructs are shown (Fig. 6C). We purified recombinant full-length XH2AX (GST-XH2AX), an N-terminal fragment (GST-XH2AX-NT, amino acids 1â40), a C-terminal fragment (GST-XH2AX-CT, amino acids 102â138), and an N-terminal mutant of XH2AX in which Thr16 was replaced with alanine (GST-XH2AX-NT-T16A) (Fig. 6C). At least one threonine residue of XH2AX was phosphorylated by Chk1 (Fig. 6D). To determine which portion of XH2AX is phosphorylated by Chk1 at threonine residues, we tested the phosphorylation of XH2AX-NT and XH2AX-CT by Chk1. Using this approach, we demonstrated that the N terminus of XH2AX is responsible for the phosphorylation by Chk1 (Fig. 6E). Additionally, we showed that Chk2 could not phosphorylate threonine residues of XH2AX (Fig. 6F, lanes 7â9). This result suggests the specificity of Chk1 for the N-terminal phosphorylation of XH2AX at threonine residues. We recently discovered that Ser16 of human H2AX (analogous to Thr16 of XH2AX) might be a crucial phosphorylation site. To determine whether Chk1 can specifically phosphorylate Thr16 of XH2AX, we tested the phosphorylation of wild-type XH2AX-NT and XH2AX-NT-T16A by Chk1. In vitro kinase assay revealed that Chk1 phosphorylated wild-type XH2AX-NT, but not XH2AX-NT-T16A (Fig. 6G), indicating that Thr16 is a primary site of phosphorylation by Chk1. To determine the specificity of XH2AX phosphorylation at Thr16 in more detail, we developed an anti-phospho-Thr16 XH2AX antibody as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Consistent with the results obtained with the anti-phosphothreonine antibody (Fig. 6, DâG), our data confirmed that Chk1 could specifically phosphorylate Thr16 of XH2AX (Fig. 6H). To confirm that Chk1 phosphorylates Thr16 of XH2AX, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged Chk1 from embryos expressing FLAG-tagged Chk1 and performed an in vitro kinase assay using wild-type XH2AX-NT and XH2AX-NT-T16A as substrates. Wild-type XH2AX-NT, but not the T16A mutant, was remarkably phosphorylated by the anti-FLAG-Chk1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6I, lanes 5 and 6) compared with the control (lanes 3 and 4). Chk1-MO knockdown assay results (Fig. 5) indicated that the function of Chk1 in DMZ, but not VMZ, of embryos is important in neurogenesis. To evaluate the ability of Chk1 to phosphorylate XH2AX Thr16 in the DMZ and VMZ of embryos, recombinant wild-type XH2AX-NT and mutant XH2AX-NT-T16A proteins were used as substrates of anti-FLAG-Chk1 immunoprecipitates from embryos dorsally or ventrally expressing FLAG-tagged Chk1. Consistent with the biological effect of Chk1 in DMZ and VMZ, Chk1 immunoprecipitated from DMZ, not from VMZ, obviously phosphorylated Thr16 of XH2AX (Fig. 6J). These results demonstrate that Chk1 specifically phosphorylates Thr16 of XH2AX. To address the biological role of Thr16 phosphorylation in anterior neurogenesis of the X. laevis embryo, we determined whether the expression of the XH2AX-T16A mutant could rescue the anterior neural defective phenotype induced by XH2AX-MO. XH2AX-MO-injected embryos showed a severe anterior neural defective phenotype (Fig. 7A), and the normal phenotype could be rescued by wild-type XH2AX or XH2AX-T16A (Fig. 7B). The recovery ratio is represented by histogram as a percent of embryos displaying a particular phenotype (Fig. 7C). The XH2AX-T16A mutant was less able to rescue the normal phenotype (10% rescue) compared with wild-type XH2AX (60% rescue) (Fig. 7C). Compared with wild-type XH2AX, the XH2AX-T16A mutant could not rescue the activin-induced inhibited elongation of animal cap explants exhibited by XH2AX-MO embryos (Fig. 7, DâH) or the activin-induced expression of anterior neural markers (Fig. 7I, lanes 2â4). Taken together, these results indicate that XH2AX Thr16 is phosphorylated by Chk1 and is required for anterior neural formation of X. laevis. Several lines of evidence have firmly established a canonical role for phosphorylated XH2AX (Î³-XH2AX). Distinct from other H2A variants, H2AX contains a C-terminal tail with a serine residue that is phosphorylated quickly by ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene) in response to DNA damage. Î³-H2AX recruits and retains DNA damage factors, thus playing a crucial role in both checkpoint activation and DNA repair (6Bhaumik S.R. Smith E. Shilatifard A. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Mol. Cell.. 2005; 20: 801-809Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated, for the first time, a novel non-canonical function of XH2AX in the anterior neural development of X. laevis as a developmental model of vertebrates. We discovered that phosphorylation of XH2AX at Thr16 has a critical role in anterior neural formation. Although the role of other histone variants has been reported in X. laevis development, the physiological function of H2AX had not yet been elucidated in vertebrate development. Moreover, very little is known about the role of histone post-translational modification in vertebrate development. Therefore, our findings represent a novel function of histones that expands the knowledge of the role of histones beyond DNA damage and into a new biological function in development. According to our results, knockdown of XH2AX resulted in defects of anterior and neural formation without affecting mesoderm and posterior tissue formation in whole embryos or animal caps treated with activin. Although we did not clarify how XH2AX regulates the expression of anterior neural markers, this result provides interesting new evidence suggesting that anterior neural defects might be the primary effect of the depletion of XH2AX. Chk1 has been known to restrain mitotic entry in response to DNA damage and replication blocks, in part by inhibiting Cdk activity (39Boddy M.N. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Science.. 1998; 280: 909-912Google Scholar, 40Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P. Science.. 1997; 277: 1495-1497Google Scholar, 41Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science.. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Google Scholar). In our study, we elucidated an additional role for Chk1 in X. laevis development. Consistent with XH2AX, knockdown of Chk1 in DMZ, but not VMZ, resulted in a severe defect in neural formation, including anterior tissue, without affecting mesoderm formation (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, we found that Chk1 phosphorylation of XH2AX was detectable in DMZ (Fig. 6J). As indicated, the DMZ of amphibian embryos is a key embryonic region involved in body axis organization and neural induction. The DMZ houses the Spemann-Mangold organizer induced by TGF-Î² and Vg1-like signals, and grafts of DMZ to the ventral side induce secondary neural axes from the ventral tissue of the host (29Shih J. Keller R. Development.. 1992; 116: 887-899Google Scholar). Thus, our findings suggest that the kinase activity of Chk1 toward XH2AX might be regulated by signals originating from DMZ, which indicates that Chk1, as well as XH2AX, has a critical role in neurogenesis. C-terminal Ser139 phosphorylation of XH2AX (Î³-XH2AX) by ATM/ATR and JNK is a well known response to DNA damage and leads to initiation of DNA repair or apoptosis (11Lu C. Zhu F. Cho Y.Y. Tang F. Zykova T. Ma W.Y. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 23: 121-132Google Scholar, 45Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 47759-47762Google Scholar, 46Chowdhury D. Keogh M.C. Ishii H. Peterson C.L. Buratowski S. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell.. 2005; 20: 801-809Google Scholar). Recently, Tyr142 was reported as a new phosphorylation site on H2AX with a role in regulating the DNA damage response (47Xiao A. Li H. Shechter D. Ahn S.H. Fabrizio L.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ishibe-Murakami S. Wang B. Tempst P. Hofmann K. Patel D.J. Elledge S.J. Allis C.D. Nature.. 2009; 457: 57-62Google Scholar). Here, we found that Thr16 is a novel phosphorylation site on XH2AX that is associated with neural specification rather than the DNA damage response. We also discovered that Chk1 is a novel kinase responsible for phosphorylating XH2AX at Thr16. To demonstrate the specificity of Chk1 for XH2AX, we showed that Chk2, another Chk family member, could not phosphorylate XH2AX at any threonine residue (Fig. 6F). We also observed that Chk1, as well as Chk2, could phosphorylate serine residues in the XH2AX N terminus (data not shown), and the function of the phosphorylation of these sites is the subject of future studies. In conclusion, we propose a novel role for XH2AX and Chk1 in anterior neural formation during X. laevis development. Phosphorylation of XH2AX (Thr16) by Chk1 is important for the biological role of XH2AX in neural specification during X. laevis development. These findings suggest that XH2AX phosphorylation is important not only in the DNA damage response but also in X. laevis development.

However, the mechanistic basis underpinning this discrimination is weak. In mannitol 2-dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas fluorescens, stabilization of (partial) negative charge on the substrate oxyanion by the side chains of Asn-191 and Asn-300 is a key feature of catalysis in the direction of alcohol oxidation. We have disrupted this ability through individual and combined substitutions of the two asparagines by aspartic acid. Kinetic data and their thermodynamic analysis show that the internal equilibrium of enzyme-NADH-fructose and enzyme-NAD+-mannitol (Kint) was altered dramatically (104- to 105-fold) from being balanced in the wild-type enzyme (Kint â 3) to favoring enzyme-NAD+-mannitol in the single site mutants, N191D and N300D. The change in Kint reflects a selective slowing down of the mannitol oxidation rate, resulting because Asn â Asp replacement (i) disfavors partial abstraction of alcohol proton by Lys-295 in a step preceding catalytic hydride transfer, and (ii) causes stabilization of a nonproductive enzyme-NAD+-mannitol complex. N191D and N300D appear to lose fructose binding affinity due to deprotonation of the respective Asp above apparent pK values of 5.3 Â± 0.1 and 6.3 Â± 0.2, respectively. The mutant incorporating both AsnâAsp substitutions behaved as a slow âfructose reductaseâ at pH 5.2, lacking measurable activity for mannitol oxidation in the pH range 6.8â10. A mechanism is suggested in which polarization of the substrate carbonyl by a doubly protonated diad of Asp and Lys-295 facilitates NADH-dependent reduction of fructose by N191D and N300D under optimum pH conditions. Creation of an effectively âone-wayâ reductase by active-site redesign of a parent dehydrogenase has not been previously reported and holds promise in the development of carbonyl reductases for application in organic synthesis.
