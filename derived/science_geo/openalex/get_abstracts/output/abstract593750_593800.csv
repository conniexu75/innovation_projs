https://openalex.org/W2749576414,"Lanthanides have been investigated extensively for potential applications in quantum information processing and high-density data storage at the molecular and atomic scale. Experimental achievements include reading and manipulating single nuclear spins, exploiting atomic clock transitions for robust qubits and, most recently, magnetic data storage in single atoms. Single-molecule magnets exhibit magnetic hysteresis of molecular origin-a magnetic memory effect and a prerequisite of data storage-and so far lanthanide examples have exhibited this phenomenon at the highest temperatures. However, in the nearly 25 years since the discovery of single-molecule magnets, hysteresis temperatures have increased from 4 kelvin to only about 14 kelvin using a consistent magnetic field sweep rate of about 20 oersted per second, although higher temperatures have been achieved by using very fast sweep rates (for example, 30 kelvin with 200 oersted per second). Here we report a hexa-tert-butyldysprosocenium complex-[Dy(Cpttt)2][B(C6F5)4], with Cpttt = {C5H2tBu3-1,2,4} and tBu = C(CH3)3-which exhibits magnetic hysteresis at temperatures of up to 60 kelvin at a sweep rate of 22 oersted per second. We observe a clear change in the relaxation dynamics at this temperature, which persists in magnetically diluted samples, suggesting that the origin of the hysteresis is the localized metal-ligand vibrational modes that are unique to dysprosocenium. Ab initio calculations of spin dynamics demonstrate that magnetic relaxation at high temperatures is due to local molecular vibrations. These results indicate that, with judicious molecular design, magnetic data storage in single molecules at temperatures above liquid nitrogen should be possible."
https://openalex.org/W2624566613,"The first direct detections of gravitational waves from merging binary black holes open a unique window into the binary black hole formation environment. One promising environmental signature is the angular distribution of the black hole spins; systems formed through dynamical interactions among already-compact objects are expected to have isotropic spin orientations whereas binaries formed from pairs of stars born together are more likely to have spins preferentially aligned with the binary orbital angular momentum. We consider existing gravitational wave measurements of the binary effective spin, the best-measured combination of spin parameters, in the four likely binary black hole detections GW150914, LVT151012, GW151226, and GW170104. If binary black hole spin magnitudes extend to high values we show that the data exhibit a $2.4\sigma$ ($0.015$ odds ratio) preference for an isotropic angular distribution over an aligned one. By considering the effect of 10 additional detections, we show that such an augmented data set would enable in most cases a preference stronger than $5\sigma$ ($2.9 \times 10^{-7}$ odds ratio). The existing preference for either an isotropic spin distribution or low spin magnitudes for the observed systems will be confirmed (or overturned) confidently in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2747754797,"Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Pancreatic islet transplantation could be an effective treatment option for type 1 diabetes once several issues are resolved, including donor shortage, prevention of islet necrosis and loss in pre- and post-transplantation, and optimization of immunosuppression. This study seeks to determine the cause of necrotic loss of isolated islets to improve transplant efficiency.The oxygen tension inside isolated human islets of different sizes was simulated under varying oxygen environments using a computational in silico model. In vitro human islet viability was also assessed after culturing in different oxygen conditions. Correlation between simulation data and experimentally measured islet viability was examined. Using these in vitro viability data of human islets, the effect of islet diameter and oxygen tension of the culture environment on islet viability was also analyzed using a logistic regression model.Computational simulation clearly revealed the oxygen gradient inside the islet structure. We found that oxygen tension in the islet core was greatly lower (hypoxic) than that on the islet surface due to the oxygen consumption by the cells. The hypoxic core was expanded in the larger islets or in lower oxygen cultures. These findings were consistent with results from in vitro islet viability assays that measured central necrosis in the islet core, indicating that hypoxia is one of the major causes of central necrosis. The logistic regression analysis revealed a negative effect of large islet and low oxygen culture on islet survival.Hypoxic core conditions, induced by the oxygen gradient inside islets, contribute to the development of central necrosis of human isolated islets. Supplying sufficient oxygen during culture could be an effective and reasonable method to maintain isolated islets viable."
https://openalex.org/W2748951404,"Monocytes play a critical role in the innate and adaptive immune systems, performing phagocytosis, presenting antigen, and producing cytokines. They are a heterogeneous population that has been divided in humans into classical, intermediate, and non-classical subsets, but the roles of these subsets are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the expression patterns of MHC class II (MHCII) and associated molecules and find that the intermediate monocytes express the highest levels of the MHC molecules, HLA-DR (tested in n = 30 samples), HLA-DP (n = 30), and HLA-DQ (n = 10). HLA-DM (n = 30), which catalyzes the peptide exchange on the MHC molecules, is also expressed at the highest levels in intermediate monocytes. To measure HLA-DM function, we measured levels of MHCII-bound CLIP (class II invariant chain peptide, n = 23), which is exchanged for other peptides by HLA-DM. We calculated CLIP:MHCII ratios to normalize CLIP levels to MHCII levels, and found that intermediate monocytes have the lowest CLIP:MHCII ratio. We isolated the different monocyte subsets (in a total of 7 samples) and analyzed their responses to selected cytokines as model of monocyte activation: two M1-polarizing cytokines (IFNγ, GM-CSF), an M2-polarizing cytokine (IL-4) and IL-10. Classical monocytes exhibit the largest increases in class II pathway expression in response to stimulatory cytokines (IFNγ, GM-CSF, IL-4). All three subsets decrease HLA-DR levels after IL-10 exposure. Our findings argue that intermediate monocytes are the most efficient constitutive antigen presenting subset, that classical monocytes are recruited into an antigen presentation role during inflammatory responses and that IL-10 negatively regulates this function across all subsets."

However, the mechanism of the Wnt signaling pathway in glioma cells has yet to be elucidated. Small-molecule Wnt modulators such as ICG-001 and AZD2858 were used to inhibit and stimulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Techniques including cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, Matrigel cell invasion assay, cell cycle assay and Genechip microarray were used. Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis have enriched many biological processes and signaling pathways. Both the inhibiting and stimulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways could influence the cell cycle, moreover, reduce the proliferation and survival of U87 glioma cells. However, Affymetrix expression microarray indicated that biological processes and networks of signaling pathways between stimulating and inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway largely differ. We propose that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway might prove to be a valuable therapeutic target for glioma."
https://openalex.org/W2748808405,"Age-related dementia is one of the most devastating disorders affecting the elderly. Recently, emerging data suggest that impaired insulin signaling is the major contributor in the development of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), which is the most common type of senile dementia. In the present study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of metformin (Met) and saxagliptin (Saxa), as insulin sensitizing agents, in a rat model of brain aging and AD using D-galactose (D-gal, 150 mg/kg/day, s.c. for 90 successive days). Six groups of adult male Wistar rats were used: normal, D-gal, Met (500 mg/kg/day, p.o), and Saxa (1 mg/kg/day, p.o) control groups, as well as D-gal/Met and D-gal/Sax treated groups. Impaired learning and memory function was observed in rats treated with D-gal using Morris water maze test. Biochemical and histopathological findings also revealed some characteristic changes of AD in the brain that include the increased content of acetylcholine, glutamate, and phosphorelated tau, as well as deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Induction of insulin resistance in experimentally aged rats was evidenced by increased blood glycated hemoglobin, brain contents of insulin and receptors for advanced glycated end-products, as well as decreased brain insulin receptor level. Elevation of oxidative stress markers and TNF-α brain content was also demonstrated. Met and Saxa, with a preference to Met, restored the normal memory and learning functions in rats, improved D-gal-induced state of insulin resistance, oxidative stress and inflammation, and ameliorated the AD biochemical and histopathological alterations in brain tissues. Our findings suggest that D-gal model of aging results in a diminishing of learning and memory function by producing a state of impaired insulin signaling that causes a cascade of deleterious events like oxidative stress, inflammation, and tau hyper-phosphorylation. Reversing of these harmful effects by the use of insulin-sensitizing drugs like Met and Saxa suggests their involvement in alleviation insulin resistance as the underlying pathology of AD and hence their potential use as anti-dementia drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2746853028,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are more readily prone to have impaired physical activity than the general population. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between physical activity and adverse clinical outcomes and quality of life (QOL) in CKD. One hundred and sixty-one patients with CKD stages 1-5 was enrolled from February 2013 to September 2013 and followed up until June 2016. Physical activity was measured using high handgrip strength, 30-second chair stand, and 2-minute step. The QOL was assessed using the Taiwan version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF. Clinical outcomes included commencing dialysis, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and first hospitalization. Of all participants, 1 kgf increase in handgrip strength was significantly associated with 0.13 score increase in total scores of QOL and 0.05 score increase in physical domain of QOL in adjusted analysis. One time increase in 30-second chair stand was significantly correlated with 0.14 score increase in psychological domain of QOL. Over a mean follow-up period of 29.1±11.2 months, 37 (23.0%) reached commencing dialysis, 11(6.8%) had MACEs, and 50(31.1%) had first hospitalization. High handgrip strength (hazard ratio (HR): 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.96) and high 2-minute step (HR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.95) were significantly associated with decreased risk for commencing dialysis in multivariate analysis. Thirty-second chair-stand was negatively associated with MACEs (HR: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.47-0.89) and first hospitalization (HR: 0.84, 95%CI: 0.74-0.95). In conclusion, physical activity is a potential predictor of QOL and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2749957791,"The complement system is an essential component of innate immunity and plays a major role in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). In this study, we investigated the impact of human C1-inhibitor (C1INH) on the early inflammatory response to IRI and the subsequent progression to fibrosis in mice. We evaluated structural damage, renal function, acute inflammatory response, progression to fibrosis and overall survival at 90-days post-injury. Animals receiving C1INH prior to reperfusion had a significant improvement in survival rate along with superior renal function when compared to vehicle (PBS) treated counterparts. Pre-treatment with C1INH also prevented acute IL-6, CXCL1 and MCP-1 up-regulation, C5a release, C3b deposition and infiltration by neutrophils and macrophages into renal tissue. This anti-inflammatory effect correlated with a significant reduction in the expression of markers of fibrosis alpha smooth muscle actin, desmin and picrosirius red at 30 and 90 days post-IRI and reduced renal levels of TGF-β1 when compared to untreated controls. Our findings indicate that intravenous delivery of C1INH prior to ischemic injury protects kidneys from inflammatory injury and subsequent progression to fibrosis. We conclude that early complement blockade in the context of IRI constitutes an effective strategy in the prevention of fibrosis after ischemic acute kidney injury."
https://openalex.org/W2749520806,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the breast cancer subtype that displays a high risk of early recurrence and short overall survival. Improvement of the prognosis of patients with TNBC requires identifying a predictive factor of recurrence, which would make it possible to provide beneficial personalized treatment. However, no clinically reliable predictive factor is currently known. In this study, we investigated the predictive factor of recurrence in TNBC using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry for lipid profiling of breast cancer specimens obtained from three and six patients with recurrent and non-recurrent TNBC, respectively. The signal for phosphatidylcholine (PC) (32:1) at m/z 732.5 was significantly higher in the recurrence group compared to the non-recurrence group (P = 0.024). PC (32:1) was more abundant in the cancer epithelial area than it was in the surrounding stroma, suggesting that abnormal lipid metabolism was associated with malignant transformation. Our results indicate PC (32:1) as a candidate predictive factor of TNBC recurrence. A future prospective study investigating whether personalized therapy based on PC (32:1) intensity improves the prognosis of patients with TNBC is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2747161897,"Objectives Drawing from a baseline sample of a cohort study, the study examines the extent and correlates of serostatus non-disclosure to sex partners and family members, and reasons for non-disclosure among HIV-infected pregnant women in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Methods This longitudinal cohort study recruited 1709 pregnant women living with HIV who attended three of the largest maternity centres in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, for delivery between September 2015 and May 2016. Relevant items on demographics, serostatus awareness, disclosure to sex partners and family members, and lifestyle behaviours were obtained using structured interviews. Age-stratified binary logistic regression models were used to determine the significant correlates of non-disclosure among the participants. Results A higher rate of HIV serostatus non-disclosure to sex partners (25.6%) in comparison to family members (20%) was reported by the participants. Younger age, not living with partners and alcohol use were significantly associated with non-disclosure of HIV serostatus to sex partners. Non-disclosure of HIV serostatus to sex partners was significantly (p<0.05) associated with poor adherence to the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), failure to keep clinic appointments and high viral load at the delivery of the baby. Perceived fear of intimate partner violence, fear of rejection, guilt of not disclosing at the onset of the relationship, sex partner’s non-disclosure of HIV serostatus, and guilt of unfaithfulness were some of the reasons for non-disclosure of HIV serostatus to sex partners. Conclusions Non-disclosure of HIV serostatus is a public health concern with serious implications for both mother-to-child transmission, as well as horizontal transmission, in our setting. Strategic efforts toward ending the epidemic of HIV and AIDS in South Africa should address the sociocultural and behavioural determinants of non-disclosure."

Clinical and laboratory measures were correlated with ultrasound findings using Spearman´s correlation coefficient. Differences in serum calprotectin levels in patients with variable disease activity according to the DAS28-ESR and CDAI scores were assessed using ANOVA. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the predictive values of calprotectin, CRP and SJC for CDAI and PD US synovitis scores.Serum calprotectin was significantly associated with DAS28-ESR (r = 0.321, p<0.001), DAS28-CRP (r = 0.346, p<0.001), SDAI (r = 0.305, p<0.001), CDAI (r = 0.279, p<0.001) scores and CRP levels (r = 0.556, p<0.001). Moreover, calprotectin was significantly correlated with GS (r = 0.379, p<0.001) and PD synovitis scores (r = 0.419, p<0.001). The multivariate regression analysis showed that calprotectin is a better predictor of the CDAI score and PD US synovitis than CRP.The results of this study support an additional role of calprotectin in assessing inflammatory activity in patients with RA."
https://openalex.org/W2747169154,"Tumor hypoxia is relevant for tumor growth, metabolism, resistance to chemotherapy and metastasis. We have previously shown that hyperoxia, using hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT), attenuates tumor growth and shifts the phenotype from mesenchymal to epithelial (MET) in the DMBA-induced mammary tumor model. This study describes the effect of HBOT on tumor growth, angiogenesis, chemotherapy efficacy and metastasis in a triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer model, and evaluates tumor growth using a triple positive BT-474 breast cancer model.5 x 105 cancer cells were injected s.c. in the groin area of NOD/SCID female mice. The BT-474 group was supplied with Progesterone and Estradiol pellets 2-days prior to tumor cell injection. Mice were divided into controls (1 bar, pO2 = 0.2 bar) or HBOT (2.5 bar, pO2 = 2.5 bar, 90 min, every third day until termination of the experiments). Treatment effects were determined by assessment of tumor growth, proliferation (Ki67-staining), angiogenesis (CD31-staining), metastasis (immunostaining), EMT markers (western blot), stromal components collagen type I, Itgb1 and FSP1 (immunostaining) and chemotherapeutic efficacy (5FU).HBOT significantly suppressed tumor growth in both the triple positive and negative tumors, and both MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 showed a decrease in proliferation after HBOT. No differences were found in angiogenesis or 5FU efficacy between HBOT and controls. Nevertheless, HBOT significantly reduced both numbers and total area of the metastastatic lesions, as well as reduced expression of N-cadherin, Axl and collagen type I measured in the MDA-MB-231 model. No change in stromal Itgb1 and FSP1 was found in either tumor model.Despite the fact that behavior and prognosis of the triple positive and negative subtypes of cancer are different, the HBOT had a similar suppressive effect on tumor growth, indicating that they share a common oxygen dependent anti-tumor mechanism. Furthermore, HBOT significantly reduced the number and area of metastatic lesions in the triple negative model as well as a significant reduction in the EMT markers N-cadherin, Axl and density of collagen type I."
https://openalex.org/W2748044131,"The use of the Internet and social applications has many benefits for the elderly, but numerous investigations have shown that the elderly do not perceive online social networks as a friendly social environment. Therefore, TreeIt, a social application specifically designed for the elderly, was developed for this study. In the TreeIt application, seven mechanisms promoting social interaction were designed to allow older adults to use social networking sites (SNSs) to increase social connection, maintain the intensity of social connections and strengthen social experience. This study’s main objective was to investigate how user interface design affects older people’s intention and attitude related to using SNSs. Fourteen user interface evaluation heuristics proposed by Zhang et al. were adopted as the criteria to assess user interface usability and further grouped into three categories: system support, user interface design and navigation. The technology acceptance model was adopted to assess older people’s intention and attitude related to using SNSs. One hundred and one elderly persons were enrolled in this study as subjects, and the results showed that all of the hypotheses proposed in this study were valid: system support and perceived usefulness had a significant effect on behavioral intention; user interface design and perceived ease of use were positively correlated with perceived usefulness; and navigation exerted an influence on perceived ease of use. The results of this study are valuable for the future development of social applications for the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2594016532,"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful technique for the gene-expression profiling of organisms that uses the capabilities of next-generation sequencing technologies. Developing gene-expression-based classification algorithms is an emerging powerful method for diagnosis, disease classification and monitoring at molecular level, as well as providing potential markers of diseases. Most of the statistical methods proposed for the classification of gene-expression data are either based on a continuous scale (eg. microarray data) or require a normal distribution assumption. Hence, these methods cannot be directly applied to RNA-Seq data since they violate both data structure and distributional assumptions. However, it is possible to apply these algorithms with appropriate modifications to RNA-Seq data. One way is to develop count-based classifiers, such as Poisson linear discriminant analysis and negative binomial linear discriminant analysis. Another way is to bring the data closer to microarrays and apply microarray-based classifiers. In this study, we compared several classifiers including PLDA with and without power transformation, NBLDA, single SVM, bagging SVM (bagSVM), classification and regression trees (CART), and random forests (RF). We also examined the effect of several parameters such as overdispersion, sample size, number of genes, number of classes, differential-expression rate, and the transformation method on model performances. A comprehensive simulation study is conducted and the results are compared with the results of two miRNA and two mRNA experimental datasets. The results revealed that increasing the sample size, differential-expression rate and decreasing the dispersion parameter and number of groups lead to an increase in classification accuracy. Similar with differential-expression studies, the classification of RNA-Seq data requires careful attention when handling data overdispersion. We conclude that, as a count-based classifier, the power transformed PLDA and, as a microarray-based classifier, vst or rlog transformed RF and SVM classifiers may be a good choice for classification.

https://openalex.org/W2748831721,"The aims of the study were to determine the blood feeding preferences of sandflies and to identify species of Leishmania that infected phlebotomines in Caxias, Maranhão, Brazil, an area that is highly endemic for leishmaniasis. Sandflies were captured in light traps located in the peridomiciliary environments of randomly selected houses in urban and rural settings between 1800 and 0600 hours on new moon days between March 2013 and February 2015. DNA extracts from 982 engorged female sandflies were submitted to fragment length polymorphism analysis to identify infecting species of Leishmania, and blood sources were identified for 778 of these specimens. Infection by Leishmania infantum was detected in Lutzomyia longipalpis, Lu. whitmani and Lu. termitophila; L. infantum/L. braziliensis in Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmani and Lu. trinidadensis; L. shawi in Lu. longipalpis; L. mexicana in Lu. longipalpis; L. braziliensis in Lu. longipalpis and Lu. whitmani; L. guyanensis in Lu. longipalpis and Lu. termitophila; L. amazonensis in Lu. longipalpis and L. lainsoni or L. naiffi in Lu. longipalpis, while Lu. longipalpis and Lu. trinidadensis were infected with unidentified Leishmania sp. Blood sources were identified in 573 individual phlebotomines and the preferred hosts were, in decreasing order, chicken, dog, rodent and human with lower preferences for pig, horse, opossum and cattle. Lu. longipalpis and Lu. whitmani performed mixed feeding on man, dog and rodent, while Lu. longipalpis was the most opportunistic species, feeding on the blood of all hosts surveyed, but preferably on dog/chicken, dog/rodent and rodent/chicken. Our findings reveal the concomitant circulation of Leishmania species that cause visceral leishmaniasis and tegumentary leishmaniasis in the study area, and explain the occurrence of autochthonous human cases of both clinical forms of leishmaniasis in Caxias, Maranhão. The results support our hypothesis that, in the municipality of Caxias, transmission of Leishmania occurs in close proximity to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2750443473,"to analyse the impact of in-hospital care on severe maternal morbidity using WHO's near-miss approach in the low-resource, high mortality setting of Zanzibar's referral hospital.Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, a tertiary care facility, in Zanzibar, Tanzania.We identified all cases of morbidity and mortality in women admitted within 42 days after the end of pregnancy at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital in the period from April to October 2016. The severity of complications was classified using WHO's near-miss approach definitions: potentially life-threatening condition (PLTC), maternal near-miss (MNM) or maternal death (MD). Quality of in-hospital care was assessed using the mortality index (MI) defined as ratio between mortality and severe maternal outcome (SMO) where SMO = MD + MNM, cause-specific case facility rates and comparison with predicted mortality based on the Maternal Severity Index model.5551 women were included. 569 (10.3%) had a potentially life-threatening condition and 65 (1.2%) a severe maternal outcome (SMO): 37 maternal near-miss cases and 28 maternal deaths. The mortality index was high at 0.43 and similar for women who developed a SMO within 12 hours of admission and women who developed a SMO after 12 hours. A standardized mortality ratio of 6.03 was found; six times higher than that expected in moderate maternal mortality settings given the same severity of cases. Obstetric haemorrhage was found to be the main cause of SMO. Ruptured uterus and admission to ICU had the highest case-fatality rates. Maternal death cases seemed to have received essential interventions less often.WHO's near-miss approach can be used in this setting. The high mortality index observed shows that in-hospital care is not preventing progression of disease adequately once a severe complication occurs. Almost one in two women experiencing life-threatening complications will die. This is six times higher than in moderate mortality settings."
https://openalex.org/W2749228711,"The epidemiology of hepatitis C in Cambodia is not well-known. We evaluated the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and risk factors in the HIV cohort of Sihanouk Hospital Center of Hope in Phnom Penh to strengthen the evidence for suitable HCV testing strategies among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Cambodia. All consenting adult PLWH without a history of HCV treatment were tested for HCV between November 2014 and May 2016 according to the CDC algorithm (HCV antibody II electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay, followed by COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® TaqMan® HCV PCR and INNO-LIA® HCV Score immunoblot end-testing). Genotyping was performed using the line probe assay Versant HCV genotype 2.0®. The study enrolled a total of 3045 patients (43% males, median age: 42.5 years, <1% high-risk). HCV antibodies were detected in 230 (7.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.6-8.5). Upon further testing, HCV antibodies were confirmed in 157 (5.2%; 95% CI 4.4-6.0) and active HCV in 106 (3.5%; 95% CI 2.8-4.2). Viremic prevalence peaked among men aged 50-55 years (7.3%) and women aged >55 years (11.2%). Genotype 1b (45%) and 6 (41%) were predominant. Coinfected patients had a higher aspartate-to-platelet ratio index, lower platelets, a lower HBsAg positivity rate and more frequent diabetes. Based on logistic regression, blood transfusion antecedents (adjusted odds ratio 2.9; 95% CI 1.7-4.9), unsafe medical injections (2.0; 1.3-3.2), and partner (3.4; 1.5-7.6) or household member (2.4; 1.3-3.2) with liver disease were independently associated with HCV in women. However, having a tattoo/scarification (1.9; 1.1-3.4) and household member (3.1; 1.3-7.3) with liver disease were associated with HCV in men. Thus, our study found intermediate endemicity of active hepatitis C in a large Cambodian HIV cohort and provides initial arguments for targeted HCV screening (>50 years, partner/household member with liver disease, diabetes, increased aspartate-to-platelet ratio index) as efficient way forward."
https://openalex.org/W2747002281,"Fuchs’ endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a progressive, vision impairing disease. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a trinucleotide repeat polymorphism, thymine-guanine-cytosine (TGC), in the TCF4 gene have been associated with the risk of FECD in some populations. We previously reported association of SNPs in TCF4 with FECD risk in the Australian population. The aim of this study was to determine whether TGC repeat polymorphism in TCF4 is associated with FECD in the Australian population. In 189 unrelated Australian cases with advanced late-onset FECD and 183 matched controls, the TGC repeat polymorphism located in intron 3 of TCF4 was genotyped using a short tandem repeat (STR) assay. The repeat length was verified by direct sequencing in selected homozygous carriers. We found significant association between the expanded TGC repeat (≥ 40 repeats) in TCF4 and advanced FECD (P = 2.58 × 10−22; OR = 15.66 (95% CI: 7.79–31.49)). Genotypic analysis showed that 51% of cases (97) compared to 5% of controls (9) were heterozygous or homozygous for the expanded repeat allele. Furthermore, the repeat expansion showed stronger association than the most significantly associated SNP, rs613872, in TCF4, with the disease in the Australian cohort. This and haplotype analysis of both the polymorphisms suggest that considering both the polymorphisms together rather than either of the two alone would better predict susceptibility to FECD in the Australian population. This is the first study to report association of the TGC trinucleotide repeat expansion in TCF4 with advanced FECD in the Australian population."
https://openalex.org/W2748512887,"The diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) remains challenging, due to the limited sensitivity of microscopy, the poor performance of serological methods in immunocompromised patients and the lack of standardization of molecular tests. The aim of this study was to implement a combined diagnostic workflow by integrating serological and molecular tests with standardized clinical criteria. Between July 2013 and June 2015, the proposed workflow was applied to specimens obtained from 94 in-patients with clinical suspicion of VL in the Emilia-Romagna region, Northern Italy. Serological tests and molecular techniques were employed. Twenty-one adult patients (22%) had a confirmed diagnosis of VL by clinical criteria, serology and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction; 4 of these patients were HIV-positive. Molecular tests exhibited higher sensitivity than serological tests for the diagnosis of VL. In our experience, the rK39 immunochromatographic test was insufficiently sensitive for use as a screening test for the diagnosis of VL caused by L. infantum in Italy. However, as molecular tests are yet not standardized, further studies are required to identify an optimal screening test for Mediterranean VL."
https://openalex.org/W2745387615,"The lower Miocene Pirabas Formation in the North of Brazil was deposited under influence of the proto-Amazon River and is characterized by large changes in the ecological niches from the early Miocene onwards. To evaluate these ecological changes, the elasmobranch fauna of the fully marine, carbonate-rich beds was investigated. A diverse fauna with 24 taxa of sharks and rays was identified with the dominant groups being carcharhiniforms and myliobatiforms. This faunal composition is similar to other early Miocene assemblages from the proto-Carribbean bioprovince. However, the Pirabas Formation has unique features compared to the other localities; being the only Neogene fossil fish assemblage described from the Atlantic coast of Tropical Americas. Phosphate oxygen isotope composition of elasmobranch teeth served as proxies for paleotemperatures and paleoecology. The data are compatible with a predominantly tropical marine setting with recognized inshore and offshore habitats with some probable depth preferences (e.g., Aetomylaeus groups). Paleohabitat of taxa particularly found in the Neogene of the Americas (†Carcharhinus ackermannii, †Aetomylaeus cubensis) are estimated to have been principally coastal and shallow waters. Larger variation among the few analyzed modern selachians reflects a larger range for the isotopic composition of recent seawater compared to the early Miocene. This probably links to an increased influence of the Amazon River in the coastal regions during the Holocene."

While great advances have been made in the optimization of culture conditions and cell line selection to improve productivity, protein mis-folding remains a common limitation to high levels of production of therapeutic proteins. Accumulation of mis- and unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes ER stress and initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR) that results in an activation of protein folding machinery, translation attenuation in an effort to proper folding of the newly synthesized peptides or may even lead to apoptosis if the correct folding is not restored. As a result, UPR associated apoptosis often results in lower protein expression. To better understand the molecular mechanisms in these pathways, we developed a reporter construct that detects Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-alpha mediated splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) to monitor the course of UPR activation in cell lines expressing monoclonal antibodies. Using this reporter we observed a clear activation of UPR in cells treated with known ER stress causing pharmacological agents, such as Tunicamycin (Tm) and Thapsigargin (Tg), as well as in stable IgG expressing cells during fed-batch cultures. Furthermore, we developed a stress metric that we term as ER stress index (ERSI) to gauge basal ER stress in cells which we used as a predictive tool for isolation of high IgG expressing cell lines. This reporter system, with its ability to monitor the stress involved in recombinant protein expression, has utility to assist in devising engineering strategies for improved production of biotherapeutic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2747004414,"Agricultural application of sewage sludge (SS) after carbonization is a plausible way for disposal. Despite its benefits of improving soil fertility and C sequestration, heavy metals contained in sewage sludge biochars (SSB) are still a concern. In this study, two types of heavy metal stabilizers were chosen: fulvic acid (FA) and phosphogypsum (with CaSO4, CS, as the main component). The two stabilizers were incorporated into SS prior to 350°C carbonization for 1 h at the rates of 1%, 2%, or 4%. The obtained SSBs were then analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Total and available concentrations of four heavy metals, i.e., Zn, Pb, Cd, and Ni, in the SSBs were determined. In addition, a series of pot soil culture experiments was conducted to investigate the effects of stabilizers incorporation into SSB on heavy metal bioavailability and the uptake by plants (corn as an indicator) and plant biomass yield, with SS and SSB (no stabilizers) as controls. The results showed that incorporation of both FA and CS increased functional groups such as carboxyl, phenol, hydroxyl, amine and quinine groups in the SSBs. The percentage of heavy metals in sulfuric and oxidizable state and residual state of SSBs were significantly increased after carbonization, and hence the mobility of the heavy metals in SSBs was decreased. The introduction of the stabilizers (i.e., FA or CS) significantly lowered the total and available concentrations of Zn, Pb, Cd, and Ni. The reduction in available heavy metal concentration increased with incorporation rate of the stabilizers from 1% to 4%. In the treatments with FA or CS incorporated SSB, less heavy metals were taken up by plants and more plant biomass yields were obtained. The mitigating effects were more pronounced at higher rates of FA or CS stabilizer. These findings provide a way to lower bioavailability of heavy metals in SS or SSB for land application or horticulture as a peat substitute."
https://openalex.org/W2749051880,"Background This study aimed to assess whether feeding a diet containing fish oil was efficacious in reducing tumor- and subsequent chemotherapy-associated myosteatosis, and improving tumor response to treatment. Methods Female Fischer 344 rats were fed either a control diet for the entire study (control), or switched to a diet containing fish oil (2.0 g /100 g of diet) one week prior to tumor implantation (long term fish oil) or at the start of chemotherapy (adjuvant fish oil). Chemotherapy (irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil) was initiated 2 weeks after tumor implantation (cycle-1) and 1 week thereafter (cycle-2). Reference animals received no tumor or treatment and only consumed the control diet. All skeletal muscle measures were conducted in the gastrocnemius. To assess myosteatosis, lipids were assessed histologically by Oil Red O staining and total triglyceride content was quantified by gas chromatography. Expression of adipogenic transcription factors were assessed at the mRNA level by real-time RT-PCR. Results Feeding a diet containing fish oil significantly reduced tumor- and subsequent chemotherapy-associated increases in skeletal muscle neutral lipid (p<0.001) and total triglyceride content (p<0.03), and expression of adipogenic transcription factors (p<0.01) compared with control diet fed animals. The adjuvant fish oil diet was as effective as the long term fish oil diet in mitigating chemotherapy-associated skeletal muscle fat content, and in reducing tumor volume during chemotherapy compared with control fed animals (p<0.01). Conclusion Long term and adjuvant fish oil diets are equally efficacious in reducing chemotherapy-associated myosteatosis that may be occurring by reducing expression of transcription factors involved in adipogenesis/lipogenesis, and improving tumor-response to chemotherapy in a neoplastic model."
https://openalex.org/W2746605592,"Background Hispanic/Latino populations are a genetically admixed and heterogeneous group, with variable fractions of European, Indigenous American and African ancestries. The molecular profile of breast cancer has been widely described in non-Hispanic Whites but equivalent knowledge is lacking in Hispanic/Latinas. We have previously reported that the most prevalent breast cancer intrinsic subtype in Colombian women was Luminal B as defined by St. Gallen 2013 criteria. In this study we explored ancestry-associated differences in molecular profiles of Luminal B tumors among these highly admixed women. Methods We performed whole-transcriptome RNA-seq analysis in 42 Luminal tumors (21 Luminal A and 21 Luminal B) from Colombian women. Genetic ancestry was estimated from a panel of 80 ancestry-informative markers (AIM). We categorized patients according to Luminal subtype and to the proportion of European and Indigenous American ancestry and performed differential expression analysis comparing Luminal B against Luminal A tumors according to the assigned ancestry groups. Results We found 5 genes potentially modulated by genetic ancestry: ERBB2 (log2FC = 2.367, padj<0.01), GRB7 (log2FC = 2.327, padj<0.01), GSDMB (log2FC = 1.723, padj<0.01, MIEN1 (log2FC = 2.195, padj<0.01 and ONECUT2 (log2FC = 2.204, padj<0.01). In the replication set we found a statistical significant association between ERBB2 expression with Indigenous American ancestry (p = 0.02, B = 3.11). This association was not biased by the distribution of HER2+ tumors among the groups analyzed. Conclusions Our results suggest that genetic ancestry in Hispanic/Latina women might modify ERBB2 gene expression in Luminal tumors. Further analyses are needed to confirm these findings and explore their prognostic value."

OCT scans were reviewed by two observers.Presence of peripapillary retinal splitting identified on OCT raster scans.Eleven of 990 glaucoma and glaucoma suspect eyes (1.1%) of 7 patients (2 females, 5 males, mean age 64.5 ± 9.2 years) had peripapillary retinal splitting. Two of these 11 eyes had extension of the splitting into the macula but none to the fovea. Of these 11 patients, 2 (28.6%) were glaucoma suspects, 3 (42.9%) had primary open-angle glaucoma, 1 (14.3%) had chronic angle-closure glaucoma and 1 (14.3%) had pigmentary glaucoma. 7/11 (63.6%) eyes had vitreous traction to the disc visualized on OCT and 6/11 eyes (54.5%) had beta-zone peripapillary atrophy.We observed peripapillary retinal splitting in 1.1% of a series of 990 glaucoma and glaucoma-suspect eyes. Evidence of adherent vitreous with traction and peripapillary atrophy was found in a majority of the involved eyes. A comparison to an age and axial length matched cohort is required to determine if this is a condition that is associated with glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2748884788,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are evolutionarily conserved and multifunctional effector molecules playing pivotal roles in development and homeostasis. In this study we explored the involvement of the five Arabidopsis thaliana At-MMPs in plant defence against microbial pathogens. Expression of At2-MMP was most responsive to inoculation with fungi and a bacterial pathogen followed by At3-MMP and At5-MMP, while At1-MMP and At4-MMP were non-responsive to these biotic stresses. Loss-of-function mutants for all tested At-MMPs displayed increased susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea and double mutant at2,3-mmp and triple mutant at2,3,5-mmp plants developed even stronger symptoms. Consistent with this, transgenic Arabidopsis plants that expressed At2-MMP constitutively under the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter showed enhanced resistance to the necrotrophic pathogen. Similarly, resistance to the biotrophic Arabidopsis powdery mildew fungus Golovinomyces orontii was also compromised particularly in the at2,3-mmp / at2,3,5-mmp multiplex mutants, and increased in At2-MMP overexpressor plants. The degree of disease resistance of at-mmp mutants and At2-MMP overexpressor plants also correlated positively with the degree of MAMP-triggered callose deposition in response to the bacterial flagellin peptide flg22, suggesting that matrix metalloproteinases contribute to pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in interactions of Arabidopsis with necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2745905010,"Measurement of glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM) in faeces has become a widely used and effective tool for evaluating the amount of stress experienced by animals. However, the potential sampling bias resulting from an oversampling of individuals when collecting ""anonymous"" (unknown sex or individual) faeces has rarely been investigated. We used non-invasive genetic sampling (NIGS) to investigate potential interpretation errors of GCM measurements in a free-living population of mountain hares during the mating and post-reproductive periods. Genetic data improved the interpretation of results of faecal GCM measurements. In general GCM concentrations were influenced by season. However, genetic information revealed that it was sex-dependent. Within the mating period, females had higher GCM levels than males, but individual differences were more expressed in males. In the post-reproductive period, GCM concentrations were neither influenced by sex nor individual. We also identified potential pitfalls in the interpretation of anonymous faecal samples by individual differences in GCM concentrations and resampling rates. Our study showed that sex- and individual-dependent GCM levels led to a misinterpretation of GCM values when collecting ""anonymous"" faeces. To accurately evaluate the amount of stress experienced by free-living animals using faecal GCM measurements, we recommend documenting individuals and their sex of the sampled population. In stress-sensitive and elusive species, such documentation can be achieved by using NIGS and for diurnal animals with sexual and individual variation in appearance or marked individuals, it can be provided by a detailed field protocol."
https://openalex.org/W2747171059,"To investigate the association between the additive effects of genetic variants associated with intraocular pressure (IOP) and IOP, vertical cup-to-disc ratio (VCDR), and high tension glaucoma (HTG) or normal tension glaucoma (NTG) as phenotypic features of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the additive effects of IOP-related genetic variants for predicting IOP elevation, Japanese patients with HTG (n = 255) and NTG (n = 261) and 246 control subjects were genotyped for nine IOP-related genetic variants near CAV2, GAS7, GLCCI1/ICA1, ABCA1, ARHGEF12, FAM125B, FNDC3B, ABO, and PTPRJ/AGBL2. The total number of risk alleles of these genetic variants was calculated for each participant as a genetic risk score (GRS), and the association between the GRS and the maximum IOP, mean VCDR, and phenotype (HTG or NTG) of POAG was evaluated. As the GRS increased, the maximum IOP (P = 0.012) and VCDR (P = 0.010) significantly increased. The GRS (9.1±1.9) in patients with HTG was significantly higher (P = 0.011) than that (8.7±1.8) in control subjects. The patients with GRS≥12 as a cut-off value had a 2.54 times higher (P = 0.0085) risk on HTG (maximum IOP≥22mmHg) compared with all patients. The IOP-related GRS approach substantiated that the IOP and VCDR were increased by the additive effects of IOP-related genetic variants in POAG. The high IOP-related GRS in patients with HTG but not NTG shows that there are differences in the genetic background between HTG and NTG and supports the notion that the phenotype (HTG or NTG) in patients with POAG depends on the additive effects of IOP-related genetic variants. The above-mentioned cut-off value of IOP-related GRS may be clinically useful for predicting the risk of IOP elevation."

https://openalex.org/W2745517165,"This study evaluates the extent to which an individual’s stated altruistic sentiments can be influenced by context–most importantly, by the age and social proximity of the other person and by the nature of what is being sacrificed. We measure willingness to sacrifice own health for another person’s health and willingness to sacrifice own wealth for another person’s wealth. To evaluate these sentiments, two surveys were administered to representative samples of Americans which contained hypothetical scenarios with context randomly assigned; the first survey posed a dictator game question and the second survey was designed to elicit marginal rates of substitution between own and other’s health/wealth. As expected, we find less altruism towards those who are more socially distant (e.g., strangers relative to family). We find individuals are more health altruistic towards young children and more wealth altruistic towards adults, and health altruism tends to be lowest for survey respondents near retirement age. We find no relationship between levels of altruism and the distance between the respondent’s state of birth and state of current residence. These findings improve society’s understanding of situational altruism and kinship and reciprocity as motivations for altruism, and they have practical implications concerning the economic valuation of human lives used to guide public policy-making."
https://openalex.org/W2748073182,"Published guidelines have helped to standardize the care of patients with traumatic brain injury; however, there remains substantial variation in the decision to pursue or withhold aggressive care. The International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic calculator offers the opportunity to study and decrease variability in physician aggressiveness. The authors wish to understand how IMPACT's prognostic calculations currently influence patient care and to better understand physician aggressiveness. The authors conducted an anonymous international, multidisciplinary survey of practitioners who provide care to patients with traumatic brain injury. Questions were designed to determine current use rates of the IMPACT prognostic calculator and thresholds of age and risk for death or poor outcome that might cause practitioners to consider withholding aggressive care. Correlations between physician aggressiveness, putative predictors of aggressiveness, and demographics were examined. One hundred fifty-four responses were received, half of which were from physicians who were familiar with the IMPACT calculator. The most frequent use of the calculator was to improve communication with patients and their families. On average, respondents indicated that in patients older than 76 years or those with a >85% chance of death or poor outcome it might be reasonable to pursue non-aggressive care. These thresholds were robust and were not influenced by provider or institutional characteristics. This study demonstrates the need to educate physicians about the IMPACT prognostic calculator. The consensus values for age and prognosis identified in our study may be explored in future studies aimed at reducing variability in physician aggressiveness and should not serve as a basis for withdrawing care."
https://openalex.org/W2745495483,"Floral phytochemicals are ubiquitous in nature, and can function both as antimicrobials and as insecticides. Although many phytochemicals act as toxins and deterrents to consumers, the same chemicals may counteract disease and be preferred by infected individuals. The roles of nectar and pollen phytochemicals in pollinator ecology and conservation are complex, with evidence for both toxicity and medicinal effects against parasites. However, it remains unclear how consistent the effects of phytochemicals are across different parasite lineages and environmental conditions, and whether pollinators actively self-medicate with these compounds when infected.Here, we test effects of the nectar alkaloid anabasine, found in Nicotiana, on infection intensity, dietary preference, and survival and performance of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens). We examined variation in the effects of anabasine on infection with different lineages of the intestinal parasite Crithidia under pollen-fed and pollen-starved conditions.We found that anabasine did not reduce infection intensity in individual bees infected with any of four Crithidia lineages that were tested in parallel, nor did anabasine reduce infection intensity in microcolonies of queenless workers. In addition, neither anabasine nor its isomer, nicotine, was preferred by infected bees in choice experiments, and infected bees consumed less anabasine than did uninfected bees under no-choice conditions. Furthermore, anabasine exacerbated the negative effects of infection on bee survival and microcolony performance. Anabasine reduced infection in only one experiment, in which bees were deprived of pollen and post-pupal contact with nestmates. In this experiment, anabasine had antiparasitic effects in bees from only two of four colonies, and infected bees exhibited reduced-rather than increased-phytochemical consumption relative to uninfected bees.Variation in the effect of anabasine on infection suggests potential modulation of tritrophic interactions by both host genotype and environmental variables. Overall, our results demonstrate that Bombus impatiens prefer diets without nicotine and anabasine, and suggest that the medicinal effects and toxicity of anabasine may be context dependent. Future research should identify the specific environmental and genotypic factors that determine whether nectar phytochemicals have medicinal or deleterious effects on pollinators."
https://openalex.org/W2749748423,"Adolescents commonly experience loss due to death, and perceived closeness to the deceased can often increase the intensity of bereavement. Adolescents and early young adult (AeYA) oncology patients may recall previous losses or experience new losses, possibly of other children with cancer, while coping with their own increased risk of mortality. The bereavement experiences of AeYA patients are not well described in the literature.This analysis of bereavement sought to describe the prevalence and types of losses, the support following a death, and the impact of loss on AeYAs aged 13-21 years with malignant disease (or a hematologic disorder requiring allogeneic transplant). Participants were receiving active oncologic therapy or had completed therapy within the past 3 years. Participants completed a bereavement questionnaire and inventories on depression, anxiety, and somatization. The cross-sectional study enrolled 153 AeYAs (95% participation), most (88%) of whom had experienced a loss due to death. The most commonly reported losses were of a grandparent (58%) or friend (37%). Peer deaths were predominantly cancer related (66%). Many participants (39%) self-identified a loss as ""very significant."" As loss significance increased, AeYAs were more likely to report that it had changed their life ""a lot/enormously"" (P<0.0001), that they were grieving ""slowly or never got over it"" (P<0.0001), and that they felt a need for more professional help (P = 0.026). Peer loss was associated with increased risk of adverse psychological outcomes (P = 0.029), as was parental loss (P = 0.018).Most AeYAs with serious illness experience the grief process as slow or ongoing. Peer or parental loss was associated with increased risk of negative mental health outcomes. Given the high prevalence of peer loss, screening for bereavement problems is warranted in AeYAs with cancer, and further research on grief and bereavement is needed in AeYAs with serious illness."
https://openalex.org/W2746096892,"The keratinase (kerA) gene from Bacillus licheniformis PWD-1 was expressed and purified in insect cells. First, the sequence encoding Ker-His-Flag was designed based on the amino acid sequence of the protein and peptide and codon optimization in order to ensure the high expression in insect cells. In the next step, the synthetic DNA was inserted into the pUC57 vector and then sub-cloned in the pFastBac™-1 donor vector by BamHI/HindIII restriction sites. The constructed vector was transformed to E. coli DH10Bac™ cell to generate recombinant bacmid carrying Ker-His-Flag. Recombinant viruses were produced by infecting insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells with bacmid DNA and used for proteins production. Target proteins were purified from the cell supernatants by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography and evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blot. The purified product contained two peptides with molecular weights of 38 kDa and 30 kDa and had an optimal pH and temperature at 8.0 and 45°C for keratinolytic activity, respectively. The final product had a specific activity of about 635 U/mg. In summary, we have demonstrated that the open reading frame containing recombinant Ker-His-Flag was expressed and secreted by leader peptide of mellittin from Apis mellitera in insect cells and affinity purification through 8His-Flag tag. It presents an alternative technology for producing keratinases. To our knowledge, it was the first report on the expression of functional keratinase from Bacillus licheniformis in insect cells system."

Currently, whether CMV infection is associated with the progression of hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage (TOD) remains to be identified. We aimed to examine the relationship between CMV infection and the progression of hypertension and hypertensive TOD, which could provide clues on the possible mediating mechanisms, in the Han Chinese population. A total of 372 patients with hypertension and 191 healthy controls (Han participants from Xinjiang, China) were included in the study. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and qPCR were used to detect CMV infection. C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) titers were also analyzed using an ELISA kit. Moreover, cardiovascular disease markers were evaluated by echocardiography, carotid ultrasonography, and tomographic scans. Essential hypertension (EH) patients exhibited a marked increase in CMV IgG antibody, CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels. Higher grade of hypertension and hypertensive TOD had higher CMV IgG antibody and CRP levels. The CMV IgG antibody titers were positively correlated with arterial BP, greater grade of hypertension and hypertensive TOD, and CRP and IL-6 levels. The higher quartile of CMV IgG titer and CRP level were associated with the incidence of hypertension and the progression of hypertension and hypertensive TOD. In the Han Chinese population, high CMV IgG titers are associated with the progression of hypertension and hypertensive TOD. CMV IgG titer >4.25 U could be an independent predictor of hypertension and progression of hypertension, while that >4.85 U could be an independent risk factor for hypertensive TOD. The underlying mechanism may be largely mediated by chronic inflammation."

However, the differences between men and women who debut with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) regarding cannabis use have not been largely explored. The aim of this study was to identify the specific sex factors and differences in clinical evolution associated with cannabis use.Sociodemographic characteristics at baseline were considered in our sample of FEP patients to find differences depending on sex and the use of cannabis. Clinical, functional and neurocognitive variables at baseline, 1-year, and 3-years follow-up were also explored.A total of 549 patients, of whom 43% (N = 236) were cannabis users, 79% (N = 186) male and 21% (N = 50) female, were included in the study. There was a clear relationship between being male and being a user of cannabis (OR = 5.6). Cannabis users were younger at illness onset. Longitudinal analysis showed that women significantly improved in all three dimensions of psychotic symptoms, both in the subgroup of cannabis users and in the non-users subgroup. Conversely, subgroups of men did not show improvement in the negative dimension. In cognitive function, only men presented a significant time by group interaction in processing speed, showing a greater improvement in the subgroup of cannabis users.Despite knowing that there is a relationship between cannabis use and psychosis, due to the high prevalence of cannabis use among male FEP patients, the results showed that there were very few differences in clinical and neurocognitive outcomes between men and women who used cannabis at the start of treatment compared to those who did not."
https://openalex.org/W2749963990,"Acetaminophen (APAP) is a commonly used analgesic and antipyretic that can cause hepatotoxicity due to production of toxic metabolites via cytochrome P450 (Cyp) 1a2 and Cyp2e1. Previous studies have shown conflicting effects of fructose (the major component in Western diet) on the susceptibility to APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. To evaluate the role of fructose-supplemented diet in modulating the extent of APAP-induced liver injury, male C57BL/6J mice were given 30% (w/v) fructose in water (or regular water) for 8 weeks, followed by oral administration of APAP. APAP-induced liver injury (determined by serum levels of liver enzymes) was decreased by two-fold in mice pretreated with fructose. Fructose-treated mice exhibited (~1.5 fold) higher basal glutathione levels and (~2 fold) lower basal (mRNA and activity) levels of Cyp1a2 and Cyp2e1, suggesting decreased bioactivation of APAP and increased detoxification of toxic metabolite in fructose-fed mice. Hepatic mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70 was also found increased in fructose-fed mice. Analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons from the cecal samples of vehicle groups showed that the fructose diet altered gut bacterial community, leading to increased α-diversity. The abundance of several bacterial taxa including the genus Anaerostipes was found to be significantly correlated with the levels of hepatic Cyp2e1, Cyp1a2 mRNA, and glutathione. Together, these results suggest that the fructose-supplemented diet decreases APAP-induced liver injury in mice, in part by reducing metabolic activation of APAP and inducing detoxification of toxic metabolites, potentially through altered composition of gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2963060993,"Graphlets are small connected induced subgraphs of a larger graph G. Graphlets are now commonly used to quantify local and global topology of networks in the field. Methods exist to exhaustively enumerate all graphlets (and their orbits) in large networks as efficiently as possible using orbit counting equations. However, the number of graphlets in G is exponential in both the number of nodes and edges in G. Enumerating them all is already unacceptably expensive on existing large networks, and the problem will only get worse as networks continue to grow in size and density. Here we introduce an efficient method designed to aid statistical sampling of graphlets up to size k = 8 from a large network. We define graphettes as the generalization of graphlets allowing for disconnected graphlets. Given a particular (undirected) graphette g, we introduce the idea of the canonical graphette as a representative member of the isomorphism group Iso(g) of g. We compute the mapping , in the form of a lookup table, from all 2k(k − 1)/2 undirected graphettes g of size k ≤ 8 to their canonical representatives , as well as the permutation that transforms g to . We also compute all automorphism orbits for each canonical graphette. Thus, given any k ≤ 8 nodes in a graph G, we can in constant time infer which graphette it is, as well as which orbit each of the k nodes belongs to. Sampling a large number N of such k-sets of nodes provides an approximation of both the distribution of graphlets and orbits across G, and the orbit degree vector at each node."

https://openalex.org/W2749604917,"Background The Chinese version of the Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation (CARE-C) item set was developed to facilitate the assessment of post-acute care (PAC) patients in Taiwan. Considering that the length of hospital stay (LOS) has a significant effect on the total healthcare cost, determining whether the CARE-C scores could predict the LOS of PAC patients is of great interest to the PAC providers. Methods This prospective trial included PAC patients with stroke or central nervous system injuries. The demographic data and CARE-C scores were collected after admission and before discharge. A multivariable stepwise linear regression model was used to identify the predictors of the LOS using age, sex, tube placement status, CARE-C component scores at admission, and score differences between admission and discharge as independent variables. Results This study included 178 patients (66 women and 112 men), with a mean age of 61.9 ± 15.6 years. Indwelling urinary catheter placement status at admission (β = 0.241, p = 0.002) was a positive predictor of the LOS, whereas age (β = −0.189, p = 0.010), core transfer subscale score at admission (β = −0.176, p = 0.020), and difference in continence subscale score (β = −0.203, p = 0.008) were negative predictors of the LOS. The model explained 14% of the total variance. Conclusions Indwelling urinary catheter placement status at admission, age, core transfer subscale score at admission, and difference in the CARE-C continence subscale score were identified as predictors of the LOS. The explanatory power of these predictors might be limited due to the regulations of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance."
https://openalex.org/W2749816233,"Objectives Vascular calcification is a frequent complication in chronic haemodialysis patients and is associated with adverse outcomes. Serum calcium and phosphate levels and imbalances in calcification regulators are thought to contribute to the process. In this regard, the dialysate calcium concentration is a modifiable tool for modulating the risk of vascular calcification. We explored pre- and post-dialysis phosphate and calcium concentrations in stable chronic haemodialysis patients treated by dialysis with the KDIGO-suggested 1.5 mmol/L calcium dialysate to investigate the effects on ex vivo calcification of rat aortic rings. Approach and results At the end of haemodialysis, mean serum calcium levels were increased in 88% of paired pre-/post-dialysis samples, while mean serum phosphate and parathyroid hormone levels were decreased. Rat aortic ring cultures grown at the same calcium and phosphate concentrations revealed that pre- and post-dialysis resulted in a similar degree of calcification. By contrast, haemodialysis with unchanged serum calcium resulted in a 5-fold reduction in calcium deposition. Conclusion Dialysis with the widely prescribed 1.5 mmol/L calcium dose results in persistent high serum calcification potential in a sizable proportion of patients, driven by increased post-dialysis calcium concentration. This could potentially be mitigated by individualising dialysate calcium dosage based on pre-dialysis serum calcium levels."
https://openalex.org/W2748288853,"Alzheimer disease (AD) stands out amongst highly prevalent diseases because there is no effective treatment nor can the disease be reliably diagnosed at an early stage. A hallmark of AD is the accumulation of aggregation-prone amyloid β peptides (Aβ), the main constituent of amyloid plaques. To identify Aβ-dependent changes to the global proteome we used the recently introduced APPNL-F mouse model of AD, which faithfully recapitulates the Aβ pathology of the disease, and a workflow that interrogated the brain proteome of these mice by quantitative mass spectrometry at three different ages. The elevated Aβ burden in these mice was observed to cause almost no changes to steady-state protein levels of the most abundant >2,500 brain proteins, including 12 proteins encoded by well-confirmed AD risk loci. The notable exception was a striking reduction in immunoglobulin heavy mu chain (IGHM) protein levels in homozygote APPNL-F/NL-F mice, relative to APPNL-F/wt littermates. Follow-up experiments revealed that IGHM levels generally increase with age in this model. Although discovered with brain samples, the relative IGHM depletion in APPNL-F/NL-F mice was validated to manifest systemically in the blood, and did not extend to other blood proteins, including immunoglobulin G. Results presented are consistent with a cause-effect relationship between the excessive accumulation of Aβ and the selective depletion of IGHM levels, which may be of relevance for understanding the etiology of the disease and ongoing efforts to devise blood-based AD diagnostics."

In this study, we performed experiments with Tigriopus californicus to analyze the behavior of both a capturer (male) and a captured individual (female or male) in formation of a guarding pair. While capturer males were attracted by both females and males, capture of virgin males was terminated in a significantly shorter time than that of virgin females. However, when presented freshly killed females or males, regardless of the sex of the body, capturer males continued to clasp the body for a comparable time as in an attempt on a living female. Our results suggest that a sex-specific rejection signal actively sent by captured males prevents male-male pair formation. Experiments also suggest that mated females reject an attempt of pair formation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest involvement of active rejection by a captured individual in facilitation of reproductively successful male-female guarding pair formation in the genus Tigriopus."

RING1 can bind DNA and act as a transcriptional repressor, play an important role in the aggressive phenotype in melanoma. The interactions between CD147 and RING1 were identified with a yeast two-hybrid and RING1 interacted with CD147 through the transmembrane domain. RING1 inhibits CD147's capability promoting melanoma cell migration. In conclusion, the study identified novel interactions between CD147 and RING1, recovered CD147 nuclear envelope distribution in melanoma cells, and suggested a new mechanism underlying how cytoplasmic CD147 promotes melanoma development."
https://openalex.org/W2748004893,"Augmented breaths, also known as sighs, constitute the normal repertoire of breathing in freely behaving humans and animals. The breaths are believed to be generated by neurones in the preBötzinger complex but under modulatory influence from higher brain centres, particularly in the limbic system due to the strong correlations between the expression of emotional behaviours such as anxiety and the occurrence of augmented breaths. The current study examines the role of the hippocampus in the motor expression of augmented breaths, and also examines the characteristics of eupneic breaths surrounding a sigh before and after stimulating the hippocampus in urethane anaesthetised Sprague-Dawley rats. Neurochemical microstimulation using the excitatory amino acid, D,L-Homocysteic acid, was used to locate areas in the hippocampus with the potential to modulated the motor expression of augmented breaths. The CA1 neurone cluster of the ventral hippocampus was found to completely suppress the expression of augmented breaths without affecting the intrinsic properties of the breaths. A similar neurone cluster, but in the dorsal field of the hippocampus, was also investigated and found to have no effects over the expression of augmented breaths. The data supports the hypothesis that there is a structural or functional relationship between neurones of the ventral hippocampus and brainstem nuclei that control augmented breaths. The implications of these findings in the context of behaviours are discussed but with due consideration of experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2745673677,"Patients with head and neck (H&N) cancer are commonly treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy, which can increase the risk of oral infection, dental caries, and periodontal disease. The present study investigated dental care consumption and costs in patient with H&N cancer before and after the cancer diagnosis. Data from Swedish regional and national registers were used to follow up dental care utilization and dental procedure costs. The analysis included 2,754 patients who had been diagnosed with H&N cancer (exposed cohort) in Stockholm County, Sweden, during 2000-2012 and 13,036 matched persons without cancer (unexposed cohort). The exposed cohort was sub-grouped into irradiated and non-irradiated patients for analysis. The exposed cohort underwent a moderately higher number of dental procedures per year than the unexposed cohort in both the year of the cancer diagnosis and the year after cancer diagnosis; in addition, these numbers were higher in the irradiated than in the non-irradiated subgroup of the exposed cohort. Dental care consumption and costs in the exposed cohort declined over time but remained at a slightly higher level than in the unexposed cohort over the long term (more than two years). Examinations and preventive procedures accounted for most of the higher consumption in the short term (2 years) and at the longer term follow-up. Swedish national insurance subsidized costs for dental treatment, which were highest in the irradiated subgroup and lowest in the unexposed cohort. Direct costs to the patient, however, were similar among the groups. Swedish national health insurance protects patients with H&N cancer from high dental expenditures. Further studies on the cost-effectiveness of preventive dental care for patients are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2746805859,"Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses of intercross populations between widely used mouse inbred strains provide a powerful approach for uncovering genetic factors that influence susceptibility to atherosclerosis. Epistatic interactions are common in complex phenotypes and depend on genetic backgrounds. To dissect genetic architecture of atherosclerosis, we analyzed F2 progeny from a cross between apolipoprotein E-null mice on DBA/2J (DBA-apoE) and C57BL/6J (B6-apoE) genetic backgrounds and compared the results with those from two previous F2 crosses of apolipoprotein E-null mice on 129S6/SvEvTac (129-apoE) and DBA-apoE backgrounds, and B6-apoE and 129-apoE backgrounds. In these round-robin crosses, in which each parental strain was crossed with two others, large-effect QTLs are expected to be detectable at least in two crosses. On the other hand, observation of QTLs in one cross only may indicate epistasis and/or absence of statistical power. For atherosclerosis at the aortic arch, Aath4 on chromosome (Chr)2:66 cM follows the first pattern, with significant QTL peaks in (DBAx129)F2 and (B6xDBA)F2 mice but not in (B6x129)F2 mice. We conclude that genetic variants unique to DBA/2J at Aath4 confer susceptibility to atherosclerosis at the aortic arch. A similar pattern was observed for Aath5 on chr10:35 cM, verifying that the variants unique to DBA/2J at this locus protect against arch plaque development. However, multiple loci, including Aath1 (Chr1:49 cM), and Aath2 (Chr1:70 cM) follow the second type of pattern, showing significant peaks in only one of the three crosses (B6-apoE x 129-apoE). As for atherosclerosis at aortic root, the majority of QTLs, including Ath29 (Chr9:33 cM), Ath44 (Chr1:68 cM) and Ath45 (Chr2:83 cM), was also inconsistent, being significant in only one of the three crosses. Only the QTL on Chr7:37 cM was consistently suggestive in two of the three crosses. Thus QTL analysis of round-robin crosses revealed the genetic architecture of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2747202606,"The present study investigated the effects of equol on cardiovascular K+ channel currents. The cardiovascular K+ channel currents were determined in HEK 293 cells stably expressing cloned differential cardiovascular K+ channels with conventional whole-cell patch voltage-clamp technique. We found that equol inhibited hKv1.5 (IC50: 15.3 μM), hKv4.3 (IC50: 29.2 μM and 11.9 μM for hKv4.3 peak current and charge area, respectively), IKs (IC50: 24.7 μM) and IhERG (IC50: 31.6 and 56.5 μM for IhERG.tail and IhERG.step, respectively), but not hKir2.1 current, in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, equol increased BKCa current with an EC50 of 0.1 μM. It had no significant effect on guinea pig ventricular action potentials at concentrations of ≤3 μM. These results demonstrate that equol inhibits several cardiac K+ currents at relatively high concentrations, whereas it increases BKCa current at very low concentrations, suggesting that equol is a safe drug candidate for treating patients with cerebral vascular disorders."
