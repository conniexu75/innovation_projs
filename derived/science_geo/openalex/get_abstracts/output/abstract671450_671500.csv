Post-vaccine symptoms were more prominent for those with prior infection after the first dose, but symptomology was similar between groups after the second dose."

Our workflow is based on the kallisto and bustools programs, and is near optimal in speed with a constant memory requirement providing scalability for arbitrarily large datasets. The workflow is modular, and we demonstrate its flexibility by showing how it can be used for RNA velocity analyses."

Since then, there has been a perceived reduction in the amount of pesticides used and a shift in the kinds of pesticides available. Schulz et al. looked at the type, amount, and toxicity of pesticides applied over the last 25 years. They found that despite decreasing total amounts applied and decreased impacts on vertebrates, toxicity—in particular to insects and aquatic invertebrates—has increased substantially.

Xia et al. present a photonic platform in which the underlying dynamics are driven and tuned by the interplay among topology, non-Hermiticity, and nonlinearity (see the Perspective by Roztocki and Morandotti). Using photonic lattices consisting of laser-written waveguides that are continuous (“gain”) and sectioned (“loss”) and coupled to an interface defect, they demonstrate the nonlinear control of parity-time symmetry and nonlinearity-induced restoration and/or destruction of non-Hermitian topological states. Such concepts are applicable to a broad spectrum of non-Hermitian systems that have intensity-dependent gain or loss and may enable new approaches for light manipulation.

Boron-based catalysts can have high selectivity to propene, but the water by-product can deactivate the catalyst by hydrolyzing boron. Zhou et al. synthesized boron-doped silicate zeolites containing isolated boron sites that were stable against hydrolysis. The catalyst could achieve one-pass propane conversions up to ∼44% with selectivities for propene and &gt;80% for ethene. They observed no deactivation after a 210-hour continuous test.

https://openalex.org/W3149863433,"The birth of modern rainforests The origin of modern rainforests can be traced to the aftermath of the bolide impact at the end of the Cretaceous. Carvalho et al. used fossilized pollen and leaves to characterize the changes that took place in northern South American forests at this time (see the Perspective by Jacobs and Currano). They not only found changes in species composition but were also able to infer changes in forest structure. Extinctions were widespread, especially among gymnosperms. Angiosperm taxa came to dominate the forests over the 6 million years of recovery, when the flora began to resemble that of modern lowland neotropical forest. The leaf data also imply that the forest canopy evolved from relatively open to closed and layered, leading to increased vertical stratification and a greater diversity of plant growth forms.

https://openalex.org/W3145419749,"The relationship between chromatin organization and gene regulation remains unclear. While disruption of chromatin domains and domain boundaries can lead to misexpression of developmental genes, acute depletion of regulators of genome organization has a relatively small effect on gene expression. It is therefore uncertain whether gene expression and chromatin state drive chromatin organization or whether changes in chromatin organization facilitate cell-type-specific activation of gene expression. Here, using the dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo as a model system, we provide evidence for the independence of chromatin organization and dorsoventral gene expression. We define tissue-specific enhancers and link them to expression patterns using single-cell RNA-seq. Surprisingly, despite tissue-specific chromatin states and gene expression, chromatin organization is largely maintained across tissues. Our results indicate that tissue-specific chromatin conformation is not necessary for tissue-specific gene expression but rather acts as a scaffold facilitating gene expression when enhancers become active."

Since pancreatic islets are central to type 2 diabetes (T2D), we profiled 15,298 islet cells by using combinatorial barcoding snATAC-seq and identified 12 clusters, including multiple alpha, beta and delta cell states. We cataloged 228,873 accessible chromatin sites and identified transcription factors underlying lineage- and state-specific regulation. We observed state-specific enrichment of fasting glucose and T2D genome-wide association studies for beta cells and enrichment for other endocrine cell types. At T2D signals localized to islet-accessible chromatin, we prioritized variants with predicted regulatory function and co-accessibility with target genes. A causal T2D variant rs231361 at the KCNQ1 locus had predicted effects on a beta cell enhancer co-accessible with INS and genome editing in embryonic stem cell-derived beta cells affected INS levels. Together our findings demonstrate the power of single-cell epigenomics for interpreting complex disease genetics."

Instead of achieving multivalency by attachment to preexisting scaffolds, here we unite form and function by the computational design of nanocages in which one structural component is an antibody or Fc-ligand fusion and the second is a designed antibody-binding homo-oligomer that drives nanocage assembly. Structures of eight nanocages determined by electron microscopy spanning dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral architectures with 2, 6, 12, and 30 antibodies per nanocage, respectively, closely match the corresponding computational models. Antibody nanocages targeting cell surface receptors enhance signaling compared with free antibodies or Fc-fusions in death receptor 5 (DR5)-mediated apoptosis, angiopoietin-1 receptor (Tie2)-mediated angiogenesis, CD40 activation, and T cell proliferation. Nanocage assembly also increases severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pseudovirus neutralization by α-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and Fc-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) fusion proteins."

This effect was explained in terms of a shift current mechanism. Science , this issue p. 68"
https://openalex.org/W3144036649,"Acquisition of cell fate is thought to rely on the specific interaction of remote cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), for example, enhancers and target promoters. However, the precise interplay between chromatin structure and gene expression is still unclear, particularly within multicellular developing organisms. In the present study, we employ Hi-M, a single-cell spatial genomics approach, to detect CRM-promoter looping interactions within topologically associating domains (TADs) during early Drosophila development. By comparing cis-regulatory loops in alternate cell types, we show that physical proximity does not necessarily instruct transcriptional states. Moreover, multi-way analyses reveal that multiple CRMs spatially coalesce to form hubs. Loops and CRM hubs are established early during development, before the emergence of TADs. Moreover, CRM hubs are formed, in part, via the action of the pioneer transcription factor Zelda and precede transcriptional activation. Our approach provides insight into the role of CRM-promoter interactions in defining transcriptional states, as well as distinct cell types."
https://openalex.org/W3147847912,"Assembling for transcription initiation Eukaryotic transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) requires the assembly of a preinitiation complex (PIC) on core promoters. The binding of TATA box–binding protein (TBP) to the TATA box promoter has been thought to be a general rule in PIC assembly and transcription initiation. However, most coding genes lack a TATA box, and nearly all Pol II–mediated gene transcription requires the TBP-containing multisubunit complex transcription factor IID (TFIID). Chen et al. determined the structures of human TFIID-based PIC in sequential assembly states and revealed that TFIID supports distinct PIC assembly on TATA-containing and TATA-lacking promoters. The finding resolves the long-standing mystery of how one set of general transcription machinery initiates transcription on diverse promoters. Science , this issue p. eaba8490"
https://openalex.org/W3152071080,"How to model hallucinations in mice There has not been enough progress in our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying psychosis. Studying psychotic disorders in animal models is difficult because the diagnosis relies on self-reported symptoms that can only be assessed in humans. Schmack et al. developed a paradigm to probe and rigorously measure experimentally controlled hallucinations in rodents (see the Perspective by Matamales). Using dopamine-sensor measurements and circuit and pharmacological manipulations, they demonstrated a brain circuit link between excessive dopamine and hallucination-like experience. This could potentially be useful as a translational model of common psychotic symptoms described in various psychiatric disorders. It may also help in the development of new therapeutic approaches based on anatomically selective modulation of dopamine function. Science , this issue p. eabf4740 ; see also p. 33"
https://openalex.org/W3151198053,"The neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Currently approved SMA treatments aim to restore SMN, but the potential for SMN expression beyond physiological levels is a unique feature of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-SMN gene therapy. Here, we show that long-term AAV9-mediated SMN overexpression in mouse models induces dose-dependent, late-onset motor dysfunction associated with loss of proprioceptive synapses and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, aggregation of overexpressed SMN in the cytoplasm of motor circuit neurons sequesters components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, leading to splicing dysregulation and widespread transcriptome abnormalities with prominent signatures of neuroinflammation and the innate immune response. Thus, long-term SMN overexpression interferes with RNA regulation and triggers SMA-like pathogenic events through toxic gain-of-function mechanisms. These unanticipated, SMN-dependent and neuron-specific liabilities warrant caution on the long-term safety of treating individuals with SMA with AAV9-SMN and the risks of uncontrolled protein expression by gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3142817706,"Direct targeting of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway to suppress extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in KRAS and BRAF mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) has proven clinically unsuccessful, but promising results have been obtained with combination therapies including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition. To elucidate the interplay between EGF signalling and ERK activation in tumours, we used patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from KRAS and BRAF mutant CRCs. PDOs resemble in vivo tumours, model treatment response and are compatible with live-cell microscopy. We established real-time, quantitative drug response assessment in PDOs with single-cell resolution, using our improved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based ERK biosensor EKAREN5. We show that oncogene-driven signalling is strikingly limited without EGFR activity and insufficient to sustain full proliferative potential. In PDOs and in vivo, upstream EGFR activity rigorously amplifies signal transduction efficiency in KRAS or BRAF mutant MAPK pathways. Our data provide a mechanistic understanding of the effectivity of EGFR inhibitors within combination therapies against KRAS and BRAF mutant CRC."

https://openalex.org/W3139716940,"Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and 14 (METTL14) are core subunits of the methyltransferase complex that catalyses messenger RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. Despite the expanding list of m6A-dependent functions of the methyltransferase complex, the m6A-independent function of the METTL3 and METTL14 complex remains poorly understood. Here we show that genome-wide redistribution of METTL3 and METTL14 transcriptionally drives the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in an m6A-independent manner. METTL14 is redistributed to the enhancers, whereas METTL3 is localized to the pre-existing NF-κB sites within the promoters of SASP genes during senescence. METTL3 and METTL14 are necessary for SASP. However, SASP is not regulated by m6A mRNA modification. METTL3 and METTL14 are required for both the tumour-promoting and immune-surveillance functions of senescent cells, which are mediated by SASP in vivo in mouse models. In summary, our results report an m6A-independent function of the METTL3 and METTL14 complex in transcriptionally promoting SASP during senescence."
https://openalex.org/W3151212872,"DNA repair within neurons Humans have only a limited capacity to generate new neurons. These cells thus need to repair errors in the genome. To better understand this process, Reid et al. developed Repair-seq, a method to locate DNA repair within the genome of stem cell–derived neurons. DNA repair hotspots (DRHs) were more likely to occur within specific genomic features such as gene bodies as well as in genomic formations, open chromatin, and active regulatory regions. This method showed that repair was enriched at sites involved in neuronal function and identity. Furthermore, proteomic data indicated that genes in DRHs are enriched in Alzheimer's disease and that DRHs are more active in aging. These observations link neuronal DNA repair to aging and neurodegeneration. Science , this issue p. 91"
https://openalex.org/W3144626303,"Despite the wide adoption of emergency remote learning (ERL) in higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is insufficient understanding of influencing factors predicting student satisfaction for this novel learning environment in crisis. The present study investigated important predictors in determining the satisfaction of undergraduate students (N = 425) from multiple departments in using ERL at a self-funded university in Hong Kong while Moodle and Microsoft Team are the key learning tools. By comparing the predictive accuracy between multiple regression and machine learning models before and after the use of random forest recursive feature elimination, all multiple regression, and machine learning models showed improved accuracy while the most accurate model was the elastic net regression with 65.2% explained variance. The results show only neutral (4.11 on a 7-point Likert scale) regarding the overall satisfaction score on ERL. Even majority of students are competent in technology and have no obvious issue in accessing learning devices or Wi-Fi, face-to-face learning is more preferable compared to ERL and this is found to be the most important predictor. Besides, the level of efforts made by instructors, the agreement on the appropriateness of the adjusted assessment methods, and the perception of online learning being well delivered are shown to be highly important in determining the satisfaction scores. The results suggest that the need of reviewing the quality and quantity of modified assessment accommodated for ERL and structured class delivery with the suitable amount of interactive learning according to the learning culture and program nature."
https://openalex.org/W3139686968,"Dysregulated translation is a common feature of cancer. Uncovering its governing factors and underlying mechanism are important for cancer therapy. Here, we report that enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), previously known as a transcription repressor and lysine methyltransferase, can directly interact with fibrillarin (FBL) to exert its role in translational regulation. We demonstrate that EZH2 enhances rRNA 2'-O methylation via its direct interaction with FBL. Mechanistically, EZH2 strengthens the FBL-NOP56 interaction and facilitates the assembly of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein. Strikingly, EZH2 deficiency impairs the translation process globally and reduces internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation initiation in cancer cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of EZH2 in cancer-related translational regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3140895223,"Abstract Endothelial cells (ECs) adapt their metabolism to enable the growth of new blood vessels, but little is known how ECs regulate metabolism to adopt a quiescent state. Here, we show that the metabolite S -2-hydroxyglutarate ( S -2HG) plays a crucial role in the regulation of endothelial quiescence. We find that S -2HG is produced in ECs after activation of the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), where it limits cell cycle progression, metabolic activity and vascular expansion. FOXO1 stimulates S -2HG production by inhibiting the mitochondrial enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. This inhibition relies on branched-chain amino acid catabolites such as 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, which increase in ECs with activated FOXO1. Treatment of ECs with 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate elicits S -2HG production and suppresses proliferation, causing vascular rarefaction in mice. Our findings identify a metabolic programme that promotes the acquisition of a quiescent endothelial state and highlight the role of metabolites as signalling molecules in the endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W3143007768,"Quantum gases of light, as photons or polariton condensates in optical microcavities, are collective quantum systems enabling a tailoring of dissipation from e.g. cavity loss. This makes them a tool to study dissipative phases, an emerging subject in quantum manybody physics. Here we experimentally demonstrate a non-Hermitian phase transition of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate to a new dissipative phase, characterized by a biexponential decay of the condensate's second-order coherence. The phase transition occurs due to the emergence of an exceptional point in the quantum gas. While Bose-Einstein condensation is usually connected to ordinary lasing by a smooth crossover, the observed phase transition separates the novel, biexponential phase from both lasing and an intermediate, oscillatory condensate regime. Our findings pave the way for studies of a wide class of dissipative quantum phases, for instance in topological or lattice systems."

In the clinic, incidental or imaginal reminders are used for safe retrieval of traumatic memories of experiences that occurred elsewhere. However, it is unknown whether indirectly retrieved traumatic memories are sensitive to disruption. Here we used a backward (BW) conditioning procedure to indirectly retrieve and manipulate a hippocampus (HPC)-dependent contextual fear engram in male rats. We show that conditioned freezing to a BW conditioned stimulus (CS) is mediated by fear to the conditioning context, activates HPC ensembles that can be covertly captured and chemogenetically activated to drive fear, and is impaired by post-retrieval protein synthesis inhibition. These results reveal that indirectly retrieved contextual fear memories reactivate HPC ensembles and undergo protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation. Clinical interventions that rely on indirect retrieval of traumatic memories, such as imaginal exposure, may open a window for editing or erasure of neural representations that drive pathological fear."

https://openalex.org/W3151554208,"FOXO3 is a member of the FOXO transcription factors thought to play a tumor-suppressor role in gastrointestinal cancer, while tumor-promoting function of FOXO3 has also been reported. These results suggest a context-dependent function of FOXO3 in tumor development. However, the relationship between the FOXO3 expression pattern and its role in tumorigenesis has not been elucidated. We examined the FOXO3 expression in 65 human primary gastric cancer and patient-derived xenograft tissues by immunohistochemistry and identified three subtypes according to subcellular localization: FOXO3-nuclear accumulated (FOXO3-Nuc), FOXO3-nuclear/cytoplasmic or cytoplasmic distributed (FOXO3-Cyt), and FOXO3-negative. In the FOXO3-Cyt gastric cancer cells, the expression of the constitutive active mutant FOXO3 (Act-ER FOXO3) induced the nuclear accumulation of FOXO3 and significantly suppressed colony formation and proliferation. The inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway by inhibitor treatment also suppressed the proliferation of FOXO3-Cyt gastric cancer cells, which was associated with the nuclear accumulation of endogenous FOXO3. Furthermore, the expression of Act-ER FOXO3 by an endogenous promoter significantly suppressed gastric tumorigenesis in Gan mice, a model of gastric cancer. Finally, treatment of FOXO3-Cyt human gastric cancer-derived organoids with an AKT inhibitor significantly suppressed the survival and proliferation. These results indicate that FOXO3 is a latent tumor suppressor for FOXO3-Cyt-type gastric cancer cells and that activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway protects this type of gastric cancer cell from FOXO3-mediated growth suppression via constitutive nuclear export. Thus, the inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway and nuclear translocation of endogenous FOXO3 may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of FOXO3-positive and cytoplasmic-type gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3143740751,"In this paper, an extensive simulation program is conducted to find out the optimal ANN model to predict the shear strength of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) concrete beams containing both flexural and shear reinforcements. For acquiring this purpose, an experimental database containing 125 samples is collected from the literature and used to find the best architecture of ANN. In this database, the input variables consist of 9 inputs, such as the ratio of the beam width, the effective depth, the shear span to the effective depth, the compressive strength of concrete, the longitudinal FRP reinforcement ratio, the modulus of elasticity of longitudinal FRP reinforcement, the FRP shear reinforcement ratio, the tensile strength of FRP shear reinforcement, the modulus of elasticity of FRP shear reinforcement. Thereafter, the selection of the appropriate architecture of ANN model is performed and evaluated by common statistical measurements. The results show that the optimal ANN model is a highly efficient predictor of the shear strength of FRP concrete beams with a maximum R 2 value of 0.9634 on the training part and an R 2 of 0.9577 on the testing part, using the best architecture. In addition, a sensitivity analysis using the optimal ANN model over 500 Monte Carlo simulations is performed to interpret the influence of reinforcement type on the stability and accuracy of ANN model in predicting shear strength. The results of this investigation could facilitate and enhance the use of ANN model in different real-world problems in the field of civil engineering."
https://openalex.org/W3147573802,"Abstract Despite increasing options for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer, development of drug resistance is inevitable. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a prime suspect for acquired therapy resistance, as prostate cancer (PCa) cells are able to increase GR signaling during anti-androgen therapy and thereby circumvent androgen receptor (AR)-blockade and cell death. As standard AR-directed therapies fail to block the GR and GR inhibitors might result in intolerable side effects, the identification of GR signature genes, which are better suited for a targeted approach, is of clinical importance. Therefore, the specific epithelial and stromal GR signature was determined in cancer-associated fibroblasts as well as in abiraterone and enzalutamide-resistant cells after glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. Microarray and ChIP analysis identified MAO-A as a directly up-regulated mutual epithelial and stromal GR target, which is induced after GC treatment and during PCa progression. Elevated MAO-A levels were confirmed in in vitro cell models, in primary tissue cultures after GC treatment, and in patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with GCs. MAO-A expression correlates with GR/AR activity as well as with a reduced progression-free survival. Pharmacological MAO-A inhibition combined with 2 nd generation AR signaling inhibitors or chemotherapeutics results in impaired growth of androgen-dependent, androgen-independent, and long-term anti-androgen-treated cells. In summary, these findings demonstrate that targeting MAO-A represents an innovative therapeutic strategy to synergistically block GR and AR dependent PCa cell growth and thereby overcome therapy resistance."

Legal exports rose from approximately 50 individuals in 2008 to a maximum of 1,771 skeletons in 2016, and has led to ongoing concerns over possible laundering of non-lion, multiple-source and wild-sourced bones. South Africa is required under its obligations to CITES to employ mechanisms for monitoring and reporting trade, and to limit the potential for illegal trade and laundering of lion and other large felid bones. Monitoring tools for legal trade are critical to compliance with CITES. Here we evaluate the CITES-compliance procedure implemented by South Africa for export of lion bones and identify six essential general points for consideration in the implementation of animal export quota compliance protocols. We provide specific insight into the South African lion bone export monitoring system through: i) outlining the protocols followed; ii) assessing the utility of cranial morphology to identify species; iii) evaluating skeleton consignment weight as a monitoring tool; and iv) presenting molecular (DNA) species assignment and pairwise-comparative sample matching of individuals. We describe irregularities and illicit behaviour detected in the 2017 and 2018 lion bone quotas.

https://openalex.org/W3151258826,"Background We performed metabolomic profiling to identify metabolites that correlate with disease progression and death. Methods We performed a study of adults hospitalized with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Cases (n = 32) were defined by a composite outcome of death or transfer to the intensive care unit during the 60-day follow-up period. Controls (n = 64) were survivors who did not require transfer to the ICU. Four hundred and eight metabolites from eight families were measured on plasma sample at enrollment using a mass spectrometry based Biocrates platform. Conditional logistic regression was used to summarize the association of the individual metabolites and families with the composite outcome and its major two components. Results The ten metabolites with the strongest association with disease progression belonged to five different metabolite families with sphingolipids being the most common. The acylcarnitines, glycerides, sphingolipids and biogenic metabolite families had the largest odds ratios based on the composite endpoint. The tryptophan odds ratio for the composite is largely associated with death (OR 17.33: 95% CI, 1.60–187.76). Conclusions Individuals that develop disease progression when infected with Influenza H1N1 have a metabolite signature that differs from survivors. Low levels of tryptophan had a strong association with death. Registry ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01056185"

However, the factors influencing the spatial disparity of population hollowing (SDPH) in traditional villages within a prefecture-level city have not been fully quantitatively researched. Based on the factors that influence general villages, this study incorporated historical and cultural factors related to traditional village characteristics to construct a targeted influencing factor index system and then identified the key factors by applying the geo-detector method. With the percentage of resident population (PRP) used as a metric, this study examined Lishui, one of China’s traditional village agglomeration regions, as an example to explore SDPH in traditional villages. The results of this study were revealed in the following. (1) The average PRP value in traditional villages in Lishui was 0.68, with clear spatial disparities between the northern region (0.73) and the southern region (0.57). (2) The factors driving the SDPH included both natural and anthropogenic factors; of these, altitude, the number of public facilities, and the number of communication base stations were the most significant influencing factors. In contrast, historical and cultural factors have relatively low impacts. (3) The interaction relationships of pair factors were often enhanced on a bivariate basis, with the highest enhanced impact occurring from the interaction of two variables: the degree of intangible cultural inheritance and altitude. (4) The intervals of the variables leading to the hollowing of the population above a moderate level can be detected. This method can effectively analyze the factors influencing SDPH in traditional villages; can help reveal the interaction impact of pair factors; and can help identify the factors’ risk intervals."

The objective of this study was to characterize the adult users of a TTS for non-critical emergencies, describe the types of advice given and their subsequent observation, and assess the influence of TTS on the use of the healthcare system in a sanitary region of Switzerland. Methods Data from a TTS based in the French part of Switzerland were analyzed. This service consists of a medical contact center for non-critical emergencies, with trained nurses available 24/7. A random selection of 2,034 adult calls was performed between July and December 2018. Research students contacted users 2 to 4 weeks after the initial call and assessed sociodemographic and clinical data, as well as the impact of the advice received on the use of the healthcare system. Results A sample of 412 users was included in the analyses. The average age was 49.0 (SD 20.4) years; 68.5% were women and 72.8% of Swiss origin. The two main recommendations provided by nurses were to consult the emergency department (ED) (44.6%, n = 184) and to contact a physician on duty (33.2%, n = 137). The majority of users followed the advice given by the nurses (substantial agreement [k = 0.79] with consulting the ED and perfect agreement [k = 0.87] with contacting a physician on duty). We calculated that calling the TTS could decrease the intention to visit the ED by 28.1%. Conclusion TTS for non-critical emergencies have the potential to decrease the use of ED services."

A brief ports phase was followed by an urban phase that took place in smaller inland cities and finally, it attained the rural area and established several foci where the ecological conditions were suitable for its continued existence. However, the geographic dispersion of plague in Brazil is still poorly studied. To better understand the disease dynamics, we accessed satellite-based data to trace the spatial occurrence and distribution of human plague cases in Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil and using the municipality of Exu as study case area. Along with the satellite data, a historical survey using the Plague Control Program files was applied to characterize the spatial and temporal dispersion of cases in the period of 1945–1976. Kernel density estimation, spatial and temporal clusters with statistical significance and maximum entropy modeling were used for spatial data analysis, by means of the spatial analysis software packages. The use of geostatistical tools allowed evidencing the shift of the infection from the urban to the wild-sylvatic areas and the reemergence of cases after a period of quiescence, independent of the reintroduction from other plague areas."
https://openalex.org/W3149719865,"Quantification of HIV-1 RNA is essential for clinical management of HIV patients. The limited throughput and significant hands-on time required by most HIV Viral load (VL) tests makes it challenging for laboratories with high test volume, to turn around patient results quickly. The Hologic Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx Assay (Aptima), has the potential to alleviate this burden as it is high throughput and fully automated. This assay is validated for both plasma and dried blood spots (DBS), which are commonly used in resource limited settings. The objective of this study was to compare the performance of Aptima to Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay (Abbott RT), which was used as reference. This was a cross-sectional prospective study where HIV VL in finger stick (FS) DBS, venous blood (VB) DBS and plasma, collected from 258 consenting adults visiting 5 medical facilities in Kenya, Africa were tested in Aptima. The results were compared to plasma VL in Abbott RT at the medical decision point (MDP) of 1000 copies/mL and across Aptima assay range. The total agreement at MDP between plasma HIV VL in Abbott RT and plasma, FS and VB DBS tested in Aptima were 97.7%, 92.2% and 95.3% respectively with kappa statistic of 0.95, 0.84 and 0.90. The positive and negative agreement for all 3 sample types were >92%. Regression analysis between VL in Abbott RT plasma and various sample types tested in Aptima had a Pearson's correlation coefficient ≥0.91 with systematic bias of < 0.20 log copies/mL on Bland-Altman analysis. The high level of agreement in Aptima HIV VL results for all 3 sample types with Abbott RT plasma VL along with the high throughput, complete automation, and ease of use of the Panther platform makes Aptima a good option for HIV VL monitoring for busy laboratories with high volume of testing."
https://openalex.org/W3151880919,"Objective Although high visit-to-visit blood pressure variability (BPV) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events, the frequency of high BPV is unknown. We conducted this study to define the frequency of high BPV in primary care patients, clinical correlates, and association with antihypertensive therapies. Methods Retrospective cohort study using electronic medical record data (with previously validated case definitions based on billing codes, free text analysis of progress notes, and prescribing data) from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network of 221,803 adults with multiple clinic visits over a 2-year period. We a priori defined a standard deviation&gt;13.0 mm Hg in visit-to-visit systolic blood pressure (SBP) as “high BPV” based on prior literature. Results Overall, 85,455 (38.5%) patients had hypertension (mean 6.56 visits with SBP measurement, mean SBP 134.4 with Standard Deviation [SD] 11.3, 33.2% exhibited high BPV) and 136,348 did not (mean 3.96 visits with SBP measurement, mean SBP 120.9 with SD 8.2, 16.5% had high BPV). BPV increased with age regardless of whether individuals had hypertension or not; at all ages BPV varied across antihypertensive treatment regimens and was greater in those receiving renin angiotensin blockers or beta-blockers (p&lt;0.001). High BPV was more frequent in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or Parkinson’s disease. Conclusions High visit-to-visit BPV is present in one sixth of non-hypertensive adults and one third of hypertensive individuals and is more common in those with comorbidities. The frequency of high BPV varies across antihypertensive treatment regimens."
https://openalex.org/W3137839887,"Threatening stimuli seem to capture attention more swiftly than neutral stimuli. This attention bias has been observed under different experimental conditions and with different types of stimuli. It remains unclear whether this adaptive behaviour reflects the function of automatic or controlled attention mechanisms. Additionally, the spatiotemporal dynamics of its neural correlates are largely unknown. The present study investigates these issues using an Emotional Flanker Task synchronized with EEG recordings. A group of 32 healthy participants saw response-relevant images (emotional scenes from IAPS or line drawings of objects) flanked by response-irrelevant distracters (i.e., emotional scenes flanked by line drawings or vice versa). We assessed behavioural and ERP responses drawn from four task conditions (Threat-Central, Neutral-Central, Threat-Peripheral, and Neutral-Peripheral) and subjected these responses to repeated-measures ANOVA models. When presented as response-relevant targets, threatening images attracted faster and more accurate responses. They did not affect response accuracy to targets when presented as response-irrelevant flankers. However, response times were significantly slower when threatening images flanked objects than when neutral images were shown as flankers. This result replicated the well-known Emotional Flanker Effect. Behavioural responses to response-relevant threatening targets were accompanied by significant modulations of ERP activity across all time-windows and regions of interest and displayed some meaningful correlations. The Emotional Flanker Effect was accompanied by a modulation over parietal and central-parietal regions within a time-window between 550-690ms. Such a modulation suggests that the attentional disruption to targets caused by response-irrelevant threatening flankers appears to reflect less neural resources available, which are seemingly drawn away by distracting threatening flankers. The observed spatiotemporal dynamics seem to concur with understanding of the important adaptive role attributed to threat-related attention bias."

https://openalex.org/W3145390510,"Health assessments have potential to improve health of older people. This study compares long-term health care utilisation, physical functioning, and mortality for women aged 75 years or over who have had a health assessment and those who have not. Prospective data on health service use, physical functioning, and deaths among a large cohort of women born 1921–26 were analysed. Propensity score matching was used to produce comparable groups of women according to whether they had a health assessment or not. The study population included 6128 (67.3%) women who had an assessment, and 2971 (32.7%) women who had no assessment. Propensity matching produced 2101 pairs. Women who had an assessment had more use of other health services, longer survival, and were more likely to survive with high physical functioning compared to women with no assessment. Among women who had good baseline physcial functioning scores, women who had an assessment had significantly lower odds of poor outcomes at 1000 days follow-up compared to women who had no assessment (OR: 0.67, 95%CI: 0.52, 0.85). This large observational study shows the real-world potential for assessments to improve health outcomes for older women. However, they also increased health service use. This increased healthcare is likely to be an important mechanism in improving the women’s health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3152322777,"Swallow is a complex behavior that consists of three coordinated phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Esophageal distension (EDist) has been shown to elicit pharyngeal swallow, but the physiologic characteristics of EDist-induced pharyngeal swallow have not been specifically described. We examined the effect of rapid EDist on oropharyngeal swallow, with and without an oral water stimulus, in spontaneously breathing, sodium pentobarbital anesthetized cats ( n = 5). Electromyograms (EMGs) of activity of 8 muscles were used to evaluate swallow: mylohyoid (MyHy), geniohyoid (GeHy), thyrohyoid (ThHy), thyropharyngeus (ThPh), thyroarytenoid (ThAr), cricopharyngeus (upper esophageal sphincter: UES), parasternal (PS), and costal diaphragm (Dia). Swallow was defined as quiescence of the UES with overlapping upper airway activity, and it was analyzed across three stimulus conditions: 1) oropharyngeal water infusion only, 2) rapid esophageal distension (EDist) only, and 3) combined stimuli. Results show a significant effect of stimulus condition on swallow EMG amplitude of the mylohyoid, geniohyoid, thyroarytenoid, diaphragm, and UES muscles. Collectively, we found that, compared to rapid cervical esophageal distension alone, the stimulus condition of rapid distension combined with water infusion is correlated with increased laryngeal adductor and diaphragm swallow-related EMG activity (schluckatmung), and post-swallow UES recruitment. We hypothesize that these effects of upper esophageal distension activate the brainstem swallow network, and function to protect the airway through initiation and/or modulation of a pharyngeal swallow response."
https://openalex.org/W3145098952,"Emotional bookkeeping is the process by which primates integrate the emotional effects of social interactions to form internal representations of their affiliative relationships. The dynamics and speed of this process, which comprises the formation, maintenance and fading out of affiliative relationships, are not clear. Empirical data suggest that affiliative relationships are slowly formed and do not easily fade out. The EMO-model, an agent-based model designed to simulate the social life of primates capable of emotional bookkeeping, was used to explore the effects of different types of internal relationship dynamics and speeds of increase and decrease of relationship strength. In the original EMO-model the internal dynamics involves a fast built-up of a relationship independent of its current quality, alongside a relatively fast fading out of relationship quality. Here we explore the effect of this original dynamics and an alternative dynamics more in line with empirical data, in combination with different speeds of internal relationship quality increase and decrease, on the differentiation and stability of affiliative relationships. The alternative dynamics leads to more differentiated and stable affiliative relationships than the original dynamics, especially when the speed with which internal relationship quality increases is low and the speed with which it decreases is intermediate. Consequently, individuals can groom different group members with varying frequency and support a rich social life with stable preferred partners and attention to several others. In conclusion, differentiated and stable affiliative relationships are especially formed when friends are not made too quickly and not forgotten too easily."
https://openalex.org/W3151600925,"Spinner dolphins on Hawai'i Island's west coast (Stenella longirostris longirostris) rest by day in protected bays that are increasingly popular for recreation. Because more frequent interactions of people with these dolphins is likely to reduce rest for dolphins and to explain recent decline in dolphin abundance, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposed stricter rules regarding interactions with spinner dolphins near the main Hawaiian Islands and plans to increase enforcement. Simultaneous investment in public education about both interaction rules and their biological rationale has been and is likely to be relatively low. To test the hypothesis that more educational signage will reduce human-generated disturbance of dolphins, a paper questionnaire was distributed to 351 land-based, mostly unguided visitors at three dolphin resting bays on Hawai'i Island's west coast. Responses indicated that visitors wanted to see dolphins, were ignorant of interaction rules, were likely to read signs explaining rules and their biological rationales, and were likely to follow known rules. Therefore, investment in effective educational signage at dolphin resting bays is recommended as one way to support conservation of spinner dolphins on Hawai'i Island's west coast and similar sites in the Hawaiian archipelago."
https://openalex.org/W3142315073,"As perceivers, we need to understand context to make social judgments about emotion, such as judging whether emotion is appropriate. We propose a graphic novel-like method, the emotion storyboard, for use in research on social judgments of emotion. Across two studies, participants were randomly assigned to read emotion storyboards or written vignettes to compare the efficacy of the emotion storyboard to that of vignettes in studies on social judgments of emotion. In Study 1, undergraduates ( N = 194) answered comprehension questions and rated story clarity and immersion. Participants also made social judgments of emotion by rating main character emotion control and appropriateness of intensity. To further compare the efficacy of the methods, in Study 2, Amazon Mechanical Turk workers ( N = 213) answered comprehension questions while response times were recorded, rated clarity, answered a race manipulation check, and rated main character emotion type appropriateness. Overall, emotion storyboards resulted in greater clarity ratings, greater race manipulation check accuracy, and in some instances, enhanced comprehension and comprehension response times relative to vignettes. In emotion storyboards, main character emotion was rated more controlled and more appropriate in intensity, but not different in emotion type appropriateness, than in vignettes. Overall, the method offers a new method of examining social elements of emotion that enhances comprehension and maximizes experimental efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3149337095,"After I returned from a monthslong research trip, my partner sat me down to talk. We'd moved in together shortly before my departure and, in my absence, she'd been pondering our future. “I don't want to leave Toronto. I love it here and so do you,” she said. I was in the third year of my Ph.D., and she worried my career plans would lead us elsewhere, first for a postdoc and then for a faculty position. Deep down, I knew this conversation was coming. Until then I hadn't given the issue much thought, but I knew she was right. I wanted to be with her more than I wanted to be a professor.



> “The conversations opened my eyes to a universe of career options.” 

My partner's career as an operating room nurse was mobile in theory. But she loved the hospital where she worked, loved Toronto (the city where she grew up), and wanted to stick close to friends and family. She wanted to build our life where we were, to make the city our home.

During my time in grad school, I had grown to love Toronto as well. The energy in the streets was exhilarating, and as a Filipino immigrant to Canada, I enjoyed the cultural diversity. But I wasn't aware of jobs that would allow me to stay without compromising the academic career I had been working toward for my entire life.

My partner's concerns about our future forced me to focus on my career plans and to reassess the academic career path I'd been blindly following up to that point. And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that path might not be right for me after all. There were aspects of academia I didn't like, such as the power disparity between students and professors and the pervasive view that only academic success was real success. I also realized many careers outside academia—in industry and policy, for instance—offered a chance to make a more rapid impact in the real world.

I started to explore options by contacting Ph.D. graduates who had followed career paths I found interesting, asking for informational interviews. I spoke with venture capitalists, energy company executives, management consultants, former politicians, and startup founders. I'd always end the phone call with the same question: “If you could talk to yourself when you were in your mid-20s, knowing everything you know now, what advice would you give?” Often, the answer was that career paths are not straight or neatly assembled. It's important to be willing to fail and pivot to something new, as doing so often leads you to better places.

The conversations opened my eyes to a universe of career options and showed me that no one path interested me most; rather, I wanted to experience them all! From then on, I started to envision my career as a set of chapters: Perhaps I'd start with one option, then move on to another at some point in the future. That perspective freed me to explore many possibilities without worrying that diving into one meant giving up a chance to pursue another.

When I was in my last year of graduate school, I looked into starting a company to build the clean-energy technology I'd been researching during my Ph.D. But my adviser felt the technology was too early for commercialization, so I started to look for jobs. One day on LinkedIn, I noticed a job posting for a government position. A national lab wanted someone to lead the development of technologies to help Canada reach net zero carbon emissions. I hadn't been seeking government jobs, but I was excited. The work had the potential to make a real impact—and it was based in Toronto. I applied, was offered the job, and accepted.

Two years later, I can say with confidence that my career transition was right for me. I might not stay in this job forever, but it feels like the perfect first step for me to take postgraduation. I love what I do—and I get to wake up every morning with a smile on my face next to the person I love most. I wouldn't trade that for anything."
https://openalex.org/W3152367169,"Background Knowledge of HIV drug resistance informs the choice of regimens and ensures that the most efficacious options are selected. In January 2014, a policy change to routine resistance testing was implemented in Ontario, Canada. The objective of this study was to investigate the policy change impact of routine resistance testing in people with HIV in Ontario, Canada since January 2014. Methods We used data on people with HIV living in Ontario from administrative databases of the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) and Public Health Ontario (PHO), and ran ordinary least squares (OLS) models of interrupted time series to measure the levels and trends of 2-year mortality, 2-year hospitalizations and 2-year emergency department visits before (2005–2013) and after the policy change (2014–2017). Outcomes were collected in biannual periods, generating 18 periods before the intervention and 8 periods after. We included a control series of people who did not receive a resistance test within 3 months of HIV diagnosis. Results Data included 12,996 people with HIV, of which 8881 (68.3%) were diagnosed between 2005 and 2013, and 4115 (31.7%) were diagnosed between 2014 and 2017. Policy change to routine resistance testing within 3 months of HIV diagnosis led to a decreasing trend in 2-year mortality of 0.8% every six months compared to the control group. No significant differences in hospitalizations or emergency department visits were noted. Interpretation The policy of routine resistance testing within three months of diagnosis is beneficial at the population level."
