It, is most rapid between pH 5.5 and 6, and at, pH 2.8, less rapid at intermediate pH values and under more alkaline conditions (pH 8.5 to 10). The variation in rate is a consequence of the fact that different types of amino acid residues in the ribonuclease molecule react with iodoacetate at the different pH values. Amino acid analyses showed that at pH 5.5 to 6, a histidine residue is involved, at pH 8.5 to pH 10 reaction occurs with the e-amino groups of lysine residues, whereas at pH 2.8, the thio- ether sulfur of one or more methionine residues is alkyla,ted. After removal of iodoacetate, the various reaction mixtures were chromatographed on columns of IRC-50 in an attempt to isolate purified carboxymethylated derivatives. From the mixture present after reaction at pH 5.5, it was possible to isolate a chromatographically homogeneous protein that was totally in- active and differed from ribonuclease A only in that the imidaz- ole group of a single histidine residue had been carboxymethyl- ated. The fact, that the pH optimum for the reaction leading to the formation of imidazole carboxymethyl ribonuclease is around pH 5.5 to 6, instead of at the more alkaline pH values observed for the alkylation of cy-N-acetylhistidine, suggests that inactivation takes place as a result of substitution on a particular one of the four histidine residues present in ribonuclease."

Measurements on human materials suggest a lag of about 1 year for both breath CO 2 and blood, with the suggestion of a somewhat higher value for lung tissue. These results are in reasonable agreement with predictions based on independent evidence."

Affected homozygotes have no blood catalase activity, whereas heterozygotes show activities intermediate between this inactivity and the activity of normal controls, without overlap. Pedigrees show a high frequency of consanguineous marriages."

https://openalex.org/W1545090014,"Sodium acetate labeled with carbon-14 and a recently developed method of cholesterol ester fractionation were used to investigate the rates at which newly synthesized cholesterol is incorporated into various cholesterol esters in rat liver. Results indicate that the incorporation rates are heterogeneous, differing according to the constituent fatty acids, and that these rates do not represent a simple esteriflcation process in equilibrium with a pool of fatty acids. The pertinence of these findings to the regulation of cholesterol metabolism by the rat is considered. (C.H.)"

https://openalex.org/W2005993273,The effectiveness of stimuli in air depends upon the direction of polarization. For sporangiophores immersed in a medium of refractive index similar to that of the protoplasm this dependence disappears. These facts indicate that one is dealing with simple Fresnel reflection losses and not with dichroism of oriented photoreceptors.

The red pigment is readily extracted with water, and spectrophotometric analysis shows the characteristic peaks of myoglobin at 575 and 539 mµ. Although the odontophore is considered to be cartilaginous, it contains, not a chondroitin sulfate, but a polyhexose sulfate. This unusual chemical composition may be responsible for the absorption of myoglobin by the odontophore."

Results from studies of the oxidation of carbon-14 labeled compounds indicate that the increase in glucose oxidation by rat small intestine mucosa following x irradiation is due entirely to increased citric acid cycle activity. In addition, the results suggest that x irradiation causes a decrease in oxidation of glucose by extraglycolytic pathways but does not affect the oxidation of glucose by way of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway.

By refractionation of the active band, three peptides with relaxin activity were isolated."
