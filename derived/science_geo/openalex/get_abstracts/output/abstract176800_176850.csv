https://openalex.org/W1966771136,"The genome of the human immunodeficiency virus is highly prone to recombination, although it is not obvious whether recombinants arise infrequently or whether they are constantly being spawned but escape identification because of the massive and rapid turnover of virus particles. Here we use fluorescence in situ hybridization to estimate the number of proviruses harboured by individual splenocytes from two HIV patients, and determine the extent of recombination by sequencing amplified DNA from these cells. We find an average of three or four proviruses per cell and evidence for huge numbers of recombinants and extensive genetic variation. Although this creates problems for phylogenetic analyses, which ignore recombination effects, the intracellular variation may help to broaden immune recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2050741655,"DNA sequence variants in specific genes or regions of the human genome are responsible for a variety of phenotypes such as disease risk or variable drug response. These variants can be investigated directly, or through their non-random associations with neighbouring markers (called linkage disequilibrium (LD)). Here we report measurement of LD along the complete sequence of human chromosome 22. Duplicate genotyping and analysis of 1,504 markers in Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) reference families at a median spacing of 15 kilobases (kb) reveals a highly variable pattern of LD along the chromosome, in which extensive regions of nearly complete LD up to 804 kb in length are interspersed with regions of little or no detectable LD. The LD patterns are replicated in a panel of unrelated UK Caucasians. There is a strong correlation between high LD and low recombination frequency in the extant genetic map, suggesting that historical and contemporary recombination rates are similar. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing genome-wide maps of LD."
https://openalex.org/W2125873842,"Several orphan G protein-coupled receptors homologous to gonadotropin and thyrotropin receptors have recently been identified and named as LGR4–8. INSL3, also known as Leydig insulin-like peptide or relaxin-like factor, is a relaxin family member expressed in testis Leydig cells and ovarian theca and luteal cells. Male mice mutant for INSL3 exhibit cryptorchidism or defects in testis descent due to abnormal gubernaculum development whereas overexpression of INSL3 induces ovary descent in transgenic females. Because transgenic mice missing the LGR8 gene are also cryptorchid, INSL3 was tested as the ligand for LGR8. Here, we show that treatment with INSL3 stimulated cAMP production in cells expressing recombinant LGR8 but not LGR7. In addition, interactions between INSL3 and LGR8 were demonstrated following ligand receptor cross-linking. Northern blot analysis indicated that the LGR8 transcripts are expressed in gubernaculum whereas treatment of cultured gubernacular cells with INSL3 stimulated cAMP production and thymidine incorporation. The present study identified the ligand for an orphan G protein-coupled receptor based on common phenotypes of ligand and receptor null mice. Demonstration of INSL3 as the ligand for LGR8 facilitates understanding of the mechanism of testis descent and allows studies on the role of INSL3 in gonadal and other physiological processes."

https://openalex.org/W2092273695,"Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) is an important regulator of bone formation and osteoblast activity. However, its mechanism of action on bone cells is largely unknown. A major route for FGF signaling is through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We showed recently that this pathway is important for activation and phosphorylation of Cbfa1/Runx2, an osteoblast-related transcription factor (Xiao, G., Jiang, D., Thomas, P., Benson, M. D., Guan, K., Karsenty, G., and Franceschi, R. T. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 4453-4459). The present study examined the mechanism of FGF-2 regulation of the mouse osteocalcin gene in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells. FGF-2 stimulated osteocalcin mRNA and promoter activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells. Similar results were obtained in mouse bone marrow stromal cells. This stimulation required Runx2 and its DNA binding site in the osteocalcin promoter. FGF-2 also dramatically increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) followed by phosphorylation of Runx2. Furthermore, a specific ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibitor, U0126, completely blocked both FGF-2-stimulated Runx2 phosphorylation and osteocalcin promoter activity, indicating that this regulation requires the MAPK pathway. Deletion studies showed that the C-terminal PST domain of Runx2 is required for the FGF-2 response. This study is the first demonstration that Runx2 is phosphorylated and activated by FGF-2 via the MAPK pathway and suggests that FGF-2 plays an important role in regulation of Runx2 function and bone formation."

https://openalex.org/W2135925543,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic mitogen, plays a crucial role in angiogenesis under various pathophysiological conditions. We have recently demonstrated that VEGF165, one of the VEGF isoforms, binds connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and that its angiogenic activity is inhibited in the VEGF165·CTGF complex form (Inoki, I., Shiomi, T., Hashimoto, G., Enomoto, H., Nakamura, H., Makino, K., Ikeda, E., Takata, S., Kobayashi, K. and Okada, Y. (2002) FASEB J. 16, 219–221). In the present study, we further examined the susceptibility of the VEGF165·CTGF complex to matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, and -13), ADAMTS4 (aggrecanase-1), and serine proteinases, and evaluated the recovery of the angiogenic activity of VEGF165 after the treatment. Among the MMPs, MMP-1, -3, -7, and -13 processed CTGF of the complex into the major NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments, whereas VEGF165 was completely resistant to the MMPs. On the other hand, elastase and plasmin cleaved both CTGF and VEGF165 of the complex, but they were completely resistant to ADAMTS4. By digestion of the immobilized VEGF165·CTGF complex with MMP-3 or MMP-7, both NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments of CTGF were dissociated and released from the complex into the liquid phase. The in vitro angiogenic activity of VEGF165 blocked in the VEGF165·CTGF complex was reactivated to original levels after CTGF digestion of the complex with MMP-1, -3, and -13. Recovery of angiogenic activity was further confirmed by in vivoangiogenesis assay using a Matrigel injection model in mice. These results demonstrate for the first time that CTGF is a substrate of MMPs and that the angiogenic activity of VEGF165 suppressed by the complex formation with CTGF is recovered through the selective degradation of CTGF by MMPs. MMPs may play a novel role through CTGF degradation in VEGF-induced angiogenesis during embryonic development, tissue maintenance, and/or pathological processes of various diseases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic mitogen, plays a crucial role in angiogenesis under various pathophysiological conditions. We have recently demonstrated that VEGF165, one of the VEGF isoforms, binds connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and that its angiogenic activity is inhibited in the VEGF165·CTGF complex form (Inoki, I., Shiomi, T., Hashimoto, G., Enomoto, H., Nakamura, H., Makino, K., Ikeda, E., Takata, S., Kobayashi, K. and Okada, Y.

Med. 1999; 77: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The angiogenic activity of VEGF in vivo may be regulated by the gene expression of the VEGF isoforms and their receptors, fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1 = VEGFR-1) (8de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar) and kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR = VEGFR-2) (9Terman B.I.

However, another important regulation mechanism is extracellular inhibition of activity through complex formation with proteins, which include platelet factor-4 and soluble forms of VEGF receptors (10Maione T.E.

By screening a human chondrocyte cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system, we have recently demonstrated that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) inhibits VEGF165-induced in vitroand in vivo angiogenesis through binding to VEGF165 (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K.I. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). CTGF is a member of the CCN (CTGF/cysteine-rich 61/nephroblastoma-overexpressed gene) family and consists of 349 amino acids with four distinct domains, i.e.insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP), von Willebrand factor type C repeat (vWFC), thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSP-1), and COOH-terminal (CT) domains (14Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 15Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Because both VEGF and CTGF are expressed in physiological conditions including growth plate morphogenesis and wound healing and pathological fibrosis such as hepatic fibrosis and myocardial fibrosis, the angiogenic activity of VEGF under pathophysiological conditions may be controlled by interaction with CTGF. However, this regulation mechanism can be affected by proteinases, since VEGF and CTGF are susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Plasmin is known to digest VEGF165and inactivate its angiogenic activity (16Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vandlen R. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7788-7795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Several fragments of CTGF have been detected in culture media of various cells (17Yang D.H. Kim H.S. Wilson E.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Oh Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 2593-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), biological fluids such as sera (17Yang D.H. Kim H.S. Wilson E.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Oh Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 2593-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and uterine luminal flushing (18Brigstock D.R. Steffen C.L. Kim G.Y. Vegunta R.K. Diehl J.R. Harding P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20275-20282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, no information is available for the proteinases that digest CTGF and modulate the angiogenic activity of the VEGF165·CTGF complex. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a gene family of structurally and functionally related zinc endopeptidases that consist of 23 different members in human (19Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). MMPs play an essential role in physiological turnover and pathological degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules such as proteoglycans and collagens (20Okada Y. Ruddy S. Harris Jr., E.D. Sledge C.B. Kelly's Textbook of Rheumatology. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2001: 55-72Google Scholar). However, recent studies indicate that MMPs can also digest molecules other than ECM components. Mcquibban et al. (21McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) demonstrate that monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3) is clipped by MMP-2 and that the cleaved chemokine becomes an antagonist of chemoattractive activity. Interleukin-1β, Fas ligand, and IGFBP-3 are also susceptible to MMPs including MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, and/or -9 (22Ito A. Mukaiyama A. Itoh Y. Nagase H. Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. Sasaguri Y. Mori Y. J.

Thus, it might be possible that MMPs are capable of degrading the VEGF165·CTGF complex to affect biological activity. In the present study, we examined the susceptibility of the VEGF165·CTGF complex to six different MMPs including MMP-1 (tissue collagenase), MMP-2 (gelatinase A), MMP-3 (stromelysin-1), MMP-7 (matrilysin), MMP-9 (gelatinase B), and MMP-13 (collagenase-3) and assayed the angiogenic activity of the complex after MMP treatment. The data demonstrate for the first time that MMP-1, -3, -7, and -13 selectively degrade CTGF bound to VEGF165, which itself is resistant to MMPs, and that the angiogenic activity of VEGF165 is recovered by dissociation of CTGF fragments from VEGF165 after digestion. Recombinant CTGF was prepared as described previously (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K.I. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Briefly, CTGF cDNA amplified by PCR from a chondrocyte cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was cloned into pCMVtag4a (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and expressed as FLAG-tagged protein. Culture media were harvested 3 days after transfection of the CTGF expression vector into COS-7 cells, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and subjected to anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity column chromatography (Sigma-Aldrich). Recombinant CTGF was eluted with 6 m urea, washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35 and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35 (TNCB buffer) immediately after elution (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K.I. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Purified CTGF showed two bands of 38 and 35 kDa on silver-stained gels after SDS-PAGE, which correspond to the glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K.I. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The biological activity of recombinant CTGF was confirmed by tube formation assay (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K.I. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce). Aliquots of purified CTGF were radioiodinated according to the method of Fraker and Speck (26Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) and used for binding assay. The zymogens of MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, and -13 were purified and activated by incubation with p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) according to previous methods (27Okada Y. Harris Jr., E.D.

Concentrations of MMPs were determined by titration with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases as described previously (32Shimada T. Nakamura H. Ohuchi E. Fujii Y. Murakami Y. Sato H. Seiki M.

Recombinant human ADAMTS4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4, which is aggrecanase-1) was purified according to our method (33Nakamura H. Fujii Y. Inoki I. Sugimoto K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38885-38890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and activity was verified in an assay using aggrecan as a substrate (34Hashimoto G. Aoki T. Nakamura H. Tanzawa K. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Concentration of ADAMTS4 was determined using BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce). Plasminogen (Sigma-Aldrich) and pro-elastase (Calbiochem) were activated with streptokinase (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) and trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. Polyclonal antibodies against the IGFBP and CT domains of CTGF (anti-IGFBP and anti-CT antibodies, respectively) were raised in rabbits by injecting bovine serum albumin (BSA)-conjugated oligopeptides corresponding to the amino acid sequences of the IGFBP domain (residues 83–95, DFGSPANRKIGVC) and CT domain (residues 257–273, IRTPKISKPIKFELSGC), respectively. IgG was isolated from the antisera by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography. Specific reaction to CTGF was demonstrated by immunoblotting of culture media of 293T cells (an immortalized human embryonic kidney cell line) transfected with pCMVtag4a/CTGF plasmid as described previously (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K.I. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Non-glycosylated recombinant VEGF165 produced in Escherichia coli was purchased from Pepro Tech EC Ltd. (London, UK). VEGF165·CTGF complex was prepared by incubation of VEGF165 with CTGF at a molar ratio of 1:1 at 4 °C for 24 h as described previously (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K.I. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Digestion of the complex was initially examined by incubation of the substrate at 37 °C for 24 h with MMPs, ADAMTS4, elastase, or plasmin in an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:30 in TNCB buffer. Because CTGF in the complex was efficiently digested with MMP-1, -3, -7, and -13, time course digestion was performed by incubation of the complex with these MMPs for different periods ranging from 0 to 24 h in the same enzyme-to-substrate ratio. The reactions were terminated with 20 mm EDTA, and the digestion products were analyzed on silver-stained gels after SDS-PAGE and by immunoblotting using anti-IGFBP (1 μg/ml), anti-CT (1 μg/ml), or anti-VEGF antibodies (10 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) according to our method (30Okada Y.

CTGF alone was also digested with MMP-1, -3, -7, and -13 at 37 °C for 24 h to confirm the digestion of CTGF without complex formation. CTGF (10 μg) was incubated with MMP-1, -3, -7 or -13 at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:30 at 37 °C for 24 h for MMP-1, -3, and -7 and for 4 h for MMP-13 in a total reaction volume of 100 μl in TNCB buffer. Reactions were stopped by treatment with 20 mm EDTA, and the digestion products were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and located by staining with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The bands of interest were excised and sequenced by Edman degradation using Procise 491 Protein Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (33Nakamura H. Fujii Y. Inoki I. Sugimoto K. Tanzawa K.

Microtiter plates with 96 wells (Immunomodule, NalgeNunc, Rochester, NY) were coated with 50 μl of VEGF165 (500 ng/well) for 16 h at 4 °C. Then the plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Brij 35 and subsequently blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. 125I-Labeled CTGF (1∼3 × 105 cpm, 10 ng/well) was bound to each well by incubation for 24 h at 4 °C. After washing carefully twice with PBS containing 0.05% Brij 35, the bound proteins were digested with MMP-3 (1 ng) or MMP-7 (1 ng) in TNCB buffer or buffer alone for 0.5, 4, or 24 h at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures were collected, and CTGF fragments were immunoprecipitated with 50 μl of anti-IGFBP antibody or anti-CT antibody, which were then trapped onto protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). CTGF remaining on the wells was dissociated by treatment with 1 n NaOH. Radioactivity of the precipitates and NaOH-dissociated fractions was counted by γ-counter ARC-600 (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). Tube formation assay using bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) in type I collagen gel was carried out as described previously (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I.

Briefly, type I collagen (3 mg/ml) (Vitrogen, Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA) was mixed with 10-fold concentrated M199 (Invitrogen) and 0.1 n NaOH at a ratio of 8:1:1, respectively. The mixture (500 μl) was dispensed to 24-well culture plates and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to form collagen fibrils. BAEC were trypsinized and plated on the collagen gel at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. They were cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum overnight. After removal of the media, 500 μl of the collagen mixture was overlaid on the cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were stimulated for 3 days with VEGF165, CTGF, VEGF165·CTGF complex, VEGF165·CTGF complex digested with MMPs or MMPs by adding media containing these molecules onto the top of the collagen gel layers. For VEGF165·CTGF complex formation, VEGF165 (40 ng) was incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with increasing concentrations of CTGF (40 and 200 ng and 1 μg) in M199 medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Digestion mixtures of the complex, which were made by incubation of VEGF165 (40 ng) with CTGF (100 ng) for 24 h at 4 °C, were prepared by digestion of the complex with MMP-1, -3, and -13 (3 ng each) for 24 h at 37 °C. To demonstrate that recovered angiogenic activity after digestion of the VEGF165·CTGF complex with MMP-1, -3, or -13 is derived from VEGF165, the MMP digestion mixtures prepared as mentioned above were incubated with 40 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-VEGF IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or non-immune mouse IgG (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h at 37 °C and then used for tube formation assay. As for a control, the cells were also stimulated with CTGF (100 ng) or CTGF (100 ng) digested with MMP-1, -3, or -13 (3 ng each) for 24 h at 37 °C. After 3 days of culture, each well was photographed, and the tubular length of the cells was measured in five different areas in 0.25 mm2 using NIH Image 1.62 as described previously (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K.I. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The length was expressed as mm/mm2. Experiments were repeated three times, and similar results were obtained. In vivo angiogenesis assay using a Matrigel injection model was performed as previously described (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K.I. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Before injection, 500 μl of Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) was mixed with 50 μl of PBS, VEGF165 (50 ng), VEGF165 (50 ng)-CTGF (100 ng) complex, complex digested with MMP-3 (3 ng) for 24 h at 37 °C, MMP-3 digestion mixture incubated with anti-VEGF IgG (50 μg; Upstate Biotechnology) or non-immune mouse IgG (50 μg; DAKO) for 1 h at 37 °C, CTGF (100 ng), CTGF (100 ng) digested with MMP-3 (3 ng) for 24 h at 37 °C, or MMP-3 (3 ng). MMP-3 activity was inactivated before mixing with Matrigel by incubation with sheep polyclonal anti-human MMP-3 IgG (0.5 μg) (35Okada Y. Takeuchi N. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Nagase H. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1989; 48: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Matrigel containing these factors was injected subcutaneously near the abdominal midline of 4-week-old male C57BL/6J mice. Cutaneous tissues with Matrigel plugs were removed 5 days after injection, fixed in periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. The serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and immunostained with rabbit anti-vWF antibody (1:200; DAKO) or non-immune rabbit IgG. The degree of angiogenesis was determined by counting vWF-positive cells and blood vessels with an apparent luminal area/mm2 area using NIH Image 1.62 according to our previous method (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K.I. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Measured values were expressed as mean ± S.D. In the tube formation assay, the difference of tubular length treated with VEGF165 and VEGF165·CTGF complex was analyzed by Bonferroni/Dunn test. In the in vivo angiogenesis assay, the differences of spindle cells and blood vessels between two independent groups were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test. These tests were performed using StatView 5.0. p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. Our previous studies (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K.I. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the angiogenic activity of glycosylated VEGF165 is inhibited with CTGF by in vitro and in vivo assays. To further confirm the inhibitory effect of CTGF on the angiogenic activity of non-glycosylated recombinant VEGF165 used in the present study, the activity was assayed by tube formation assay. As shown in Fig. 1, A andB, VEGF165 stimulated the tubular extension 5.5-fold more than the untreated control. In contrast, VEGF165-induced tube formation was remarkably reduced in the presence of CTGF. Increasing concentrations of CTGF inhibited the activity with a peak at 200 ng/ml. These data are consistent with our previous data of CTGF inhibition of angiogenesis using glycosylated VEGF165 (13Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K.I. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K.I. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), indicating that glycosylated chains of VEGF165 are not involved in the inhibitory effect of CTGF. VEGF165 and CTGF were complexed by incubating them at a molar ratio of 1:1 for 16 h at 4 °C, and then the complex was digested at 37 °C for 24 h with 6 different MMPs (MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, and -13), ADAMTS4, elastase, or plasmin. When the reaction products of the VEGF165·CTGF complex with MMPs were analyzed on silver-stained gels, CTGF of 35 and 38 kDa was cleaved by MMP-1, -3, -7, and -13 into a few fragments with lower molecular weights ranging from 19 to 23 kDa (data not shown). However, because VEGF165 of 19 kDa co-migrated with these fragments, some digestion fragments could not be differentiated from VEGF165. On the other hand, when the reaction mixtures were analyzed by immunoblotting with two different anti-CTGF antibodies specific to the IGFBP domain or CT domain, intact CTGF disappeared, and several 19∼23-kDa bands immunoreactive with these antibodies were observed in the digestion products with MMP-1, -3, -7, and -13 (Fig.2, A and B). In addition, weak immunoreactive bands were also detected by digestion with MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Fig. 2, A and B), although they were not detectable on silver-stained gels (data not shown). CTGF was also digested by elastase and plasmin into small peptides, most of which were not observed by immunoblotting with antibodies (Fig. 2,A and B), or on a silver-stained gel (data not shown). However, CTGF was resistant to ADAMTS4 (Fig. 2, Aand B). In contrast to the susceptibility of CTGF to MMPs, VEGF165 was completely resistant to digestion with MMPs and ADAMTS4 under these conditions, whereas both elastase and plasmin cleaved VEGF165 of 19 kDa into 13-kDa fragments (Fig.2 C). To compare the susceptibility of the VEGF165·CTGF complex to degradation with MMP-1, -3, -7, and -13, all of which digested CTGF in a 24-h incubation, time course digestion was carried out and monitored by immunoblotting with anti-CT antibody. Among the four MMPs examined, MMP-13 appeared to most efficiently digest CTGF in the complex, since intact CTGF was degraded fastest. A complete digestion of CTGF was observed after a 4-h incubation with MMP-13 (Fig.3 D) and after an 8-h incubation with MMP-3 (Fig. 3 B). However, MMP-1 and MMP-7 required a 24-h incubation (Fig. 3, A and C). When CTGF alone was digested with MMP-1, -3, -7, and -13 and the digestion patterns of CTGF were compared with those obtained by VEGF165·CTGF complex digestion with MMPs, the fragments detected with anti-IGFBP and anti-CT antibodies were identical between the samples of CTGF alone and VEGF165·CTGF complex (data not shown). Thus, NH2-terminal sequence analyses of the CTGF fragments generated by digestion with MMP-1, -3, -7, and -13 were performed by incubation of CTGF alone with MMPs. As shown in TableI, the NH2-terminal sequences of the COOH-terminal fragments of CTGF were successfully determined. However, the NH2-terminal sequence of intact CTGF was not obtained, indicating that its NH2 terminus is blocked. Besides intact CTGF, the NH2-terminal sequences of several 19∼23-kDa CTGF fragments recognized with anti-IGFBP antibody could not be obtained, suggesting that these fragments contain the NH2 terminus of CTGF. By CTGF digestion with these MMPs, CTGF was cleaved at several peptide bonds including the Ala181-Tyr182 (MMP-3 and -7), Arg183-Leu184 (MMP-7 and -13), Met194-Ile195 (MMP-1, -3, -7, and -13), or Cys199-Leu200 bond (MMP-1, -7, and -13) (TableI), all of which are located between the vWFC and TSP domains. Among them, the Met194-Ile195 bond wa"

Close genetic relatedness predisposes individuals towards altruism, and as haploid germ cells of an ejaculate will have genotypic similarity of 50%, it is predicted that spermatozoa may display cooperation and altruism to gain an advantage when inter-male sperm competition is intense. We report here the probable altruistic behaviour of spermatozoa in an eutherian mammal. Spermatozoa of the common wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, displayed a unique morphological transformation resulting in cooperation in distinctive aggregations or 'trains' of hundreds or thousands of cells, which significantly increased sperm progressive motility. Eventual dispersal of sperm trains was associated with most of the spermatozoa undergoing a premature acrosome reaction. Cells undergoing an acrosome reaction in aggregations remote from the egg are altruistic in that they help sperm transport to the egg but compromise their own fertilizing ability."

Moreover, CV-N also binds free N-linked oligosaccharides, having nanomolar affinity for the D1D3 isomer of Man-8 and oligomannose-9 (Man-9) (10Bewley C.A. Otero-Quintero S. J. Am. Chem.

Three-dimensional domain swapping is an oligomerization process in which two or more protein chains exchange identical domains (20Schlunegger M.P. Bennett M.J. Eisenberg D. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 61-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monomeric CV-N consists of two similar domains with an overall ellipsoidal shape. Although the sequence of the protein is duplicated with over 60% identity between residues 1–50 and 51–101, domain definitions based on the primary and tertiary structures do not coincide exactly. Sequence-defined domain A consists of residues 1–50, whereas residues 51–101 form domain B. Each domain contains mostly β-strands and loops. Two intramolecular disulfide bonds (C8-C22, C58-C73) are important for the structural stability and anti-HIV activity (21Gustafson K.R. Sowder R.C. Henderson L.E. Cardellina J.H. McMahon J.B.

A change of torsion angles in the hinge region (residues 49–54) separates domains A and B of CV-N into an extended form in which they do not contact each other. A domain-swapped dimer is formed by two such symmetrically related extended monomers in which domain A comes in contact with domain B′ from a different chain, the overall structure of each pseudo-monomer (AB′ and A′B) being virtually identical to the compact monomer with the exception of the hinge residues. Although the structures of individual pseudo-monomers resemble the compact monomer very closely, the relative orientation of the pseudo-monomers vary widely between different structures (19Barrientos L.

Crystal packing seems to thermodynamically favor the dimeric form, selectively trapping this form in the growing crystals, decreasing the abundance of the dimer in solution, and shifting the equilibrium from monomer to dimer. Since the antiviral activity of CV-N results from its binding to carbohydrates, understanding the structural basis of such interactions is important for the potential development of this protein as an anti-AIDS agent. In the present study, we report medium resolution structures of the complexes of wild-type CV-N with the oligosaccharide Man-9 (Fig. 1A) and with a synthetic hexamannoside (Fig. 1B). Man-9 was purchased from Glyko Inc. (Novato, CA). Solution phase synthesis of the branched hexamannoside has been described previously (23Ratner D.M. Plante O.J. Seeberger P.H. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2002; 2002: 826-833Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The calorimetric titrations were performed on a VP™-isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) titration calorimeter from Microcal, Inc. (Northampton, MA). In a typical experiment, 10-μl aliquots of a CHES solution were injected from a 250-μl syringe into a rapidly mixing (300 rpm) solution of CV-N (cell volume, 1.3472 ml). Control experiments involved injecting identical amounts of the CHES solution into buffer without CV-N. The concentration of CV-N was 0.463 mm, and that of CHES was 6.48 mm. Titrations were carried out at 30 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5. The isotherms, corrected for dilution/buffer effects, were fit using the Origin ITC Analysis software according to the manufacturer’s protocols. A nonlinear least square method was used to fit the titration data and to calculate the errors. From the binding curve values for enthalpy, stoichiometry, and binding affinity were extracted. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated using ΔG = −RTlnKa, ΔG = ΔH −TΔS. Wild-type CV-N was cloned, expressed, and purified from Escherichia coli as reported previously (24Mori T. Gustafson K.R.

Only crystals grown at high pH in silica hydrogel (Hampton Research) were successfully utilized for preparation of complexes with oligosaccharides. These crystals were grown from droplets containing an equal mixture of protein and precipitant (1 m sodium citrate and 0.1 m CHES, pH 10.3). After 14 days at room temperature, the crystals grew to 0.2 × 0.15 × 0.1 mm. Crystals were soaked for 48 h in 1 mm Man-9 or hexamannose immediately before data collection. CV-N-hexamannose co-crystals grew under a range of conditions under which the wild-type CV-N alone would not crystallize. X-ray data for the CV-N-oligosaccharide complexes were collected at 100 K on beamline X9B, National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory, with the ADSC Quantum4 CCD detector, at 0.92-Å wavelength. A cryoprotectant, consisting of 80% mother liquor and 20% ethylene glycol, was used. Data were processed with HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The structures of the pseudo-monomers of CV-N seen in both crystal forms are very similar (Fig. 2A), but their relative orientation is quite different (19Barrientos L. Louis J.M. Botos I. Mori T. Han Z. O'Keefe B.R. Boyd M.R. Wlodawer A. Gronenborn A. Structure. 2002; 10: 673-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and the intermolecular contacts are distinct. Only the tetragonal crystals could be used successfully for the determination of the structures of oligosaccharide complexes. Two branched high mannose oligosaccharides were used in this study. Man-9 was derived from natural sources, and its structure corresponds to an oligosaccharide that is part of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. The structure (Fig. 1A) is made up of a reducing end consisting of two β1→4-linked N-acetyl glucosamine residues that form a chitobiose unit followed by 9 mannose residues that form a branching, triantennary structure. The second oligosaccharide (Fig. 1B) is a synthetic structure with six mannoses linked similarly to the core structure of Man-9, excluding the chitobiose unit on the reducing end (replaced by a pentyl group) and the terminal mannose units from the triantennary arms of Man-9. CV-N has been reported to bind to Man-9 with nanomolar (13–20 nm) affinity (10Bewley C.A. Otero-Quintero S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3892-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Shenoy, S. R., Barrientos, L. G., Ratner, D. M., O'Keefe, B. R., Seeberger, P. H., Gronenborn, A. M., and Boyd, M. R. (2002) Chem. Biol. (Lond.), in pressGoogle Scholar) and to a synthetic hexamannoside with low micromolar (2.6 μm) affinity (13Shenoy, S. R., Barrientos, L. G., Ratner, D. M., O'Keefe, B. R., Seeberger, P. H., Gronenborn, A. M., and Boyd, M. R. (2002) Chem. Biol. (Lond.), in pressGoogle Scholar). There are two distinct sugar-binding sites in a CV-N monomer, located ∼35 Å away from each other: a high affinity primary site and a low affinity secondary site (10Bewley C.A. Otero-Quintero S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3892-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These sites were mapped to the surface of CV-N by NMR perturbation studies even before any direct structural data on oligosaccharide binding became available. Residues 41–44, 50–56, and 74–78 define the primary site, whereas residues 1–7, 22–26, and 92–95 form the secondary site (10Bewley C.A. Otero-Quintero S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3892-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In a domain-swapped dimer, there are four sugar-binding sites: two primary sites near the hinge region and two secondary sites on the opposite sides of the dimer, where it is not influenced by the conformation of the hinge region. In the domain-swapped dimer, the sugar-binding sites are formed by intertwined loops of residues belonging to both monomers. For example, the secondary site is created by residues 1–7 and 22–26 from the first monomer and residues 92′-95′ and 101′ from the second monomer. The primary sugar-binding site consists of a deep pocket in the close proximity of the hinge region, which can accommodate an α1→2-linked dimannose molecule (30Bewley C.A. Structure. 2001; 9: 931-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). In our structures (TableI), there was no sugar bound in the primary site over a wide pH range, regardless of crystal soaking or co-crystallization with the oligosaccharide. Instead, there was a well defined, tightly bound CHES molecule from the crystallization solution, partially obstructing the pocket and forming a strong hydrogen bond anchoring the sulfate oxygen atom O13 to Arg-76 NH2 of CV-N. Further interactions with CV-N were mainly hydrophobic, through the cyclohexyl ring of CHES. The buffer molecule did not bind the secondary sugar-binding site, even in the absence of any sugar. As crystals can be grown in other buffers in the same pH range (CAPS, CAPSO, AMP, glycine, and ethanolamine), it was unlikely that the CHES molecule was involved in any critical packing interactions. We assessed the binding affinity of CHES to CV-N using the technique of ITC (Table II). We have used ITC previously to characterize the binding interactions of various oligomannoses to CV-N (13Shenoy, S. R., Barrientos, L. G., Ratner, D. M., O'Keefe, B. R., Seeberger, P. H., Gronenborn, A. M., and Boyd, M. R. (2002) Chem. Biol. (Lond.), in pressGoogle Scholar). The binding interaction between CHES and CV-N was very weak (Kd value of ∼0.1–0.5 mm) and characterized by few polar/electrostatic interactions (ΔH value of ∼0.2 kcal/mol). This was unlike the oligomannose-CV-N interactions in which strong favorable binding enthalpies (ΔH value of ∼−20 kcal/mol) had resulted in submicromolar CV-N binding affinities (Kd 0.02–50 μm) for the oligomannoses (13Shenoy, S. R., Barrientos, L. G., Ratner, D. M., O'Keefe, B. R., Seeberger, P. H., Gronenborn, A. M., and Boyd, M. R. (2002) Chem. Biol. (Lond.), in pressGoogle Scholar). Given these calorimetric data, it is highly unlikely that CHES could have prevented oligosaccharide binding.Table IIIsothermal titration calorimetry results for CHES bindingΔHTΔSΔG2-aΔG = −RTlnKa; T = 303 K.KdN(CHES:CV-N)kcal/molkcal/molkcal/molmmCHES0.156 ± 0.0095.036 ± 0.511−4.881 ± 0.5110.3 ± 0.21.002-a ΔG = −RTlnKa; T = 303 K.

Structure. 2001; 9: 931-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) structures of CV-N reveals the changing geometry of the primary sugar-binding site upon domain swapping (Fig. 3). We can only speculate on the significance, if any, of this shift in the relative orientation of the two domains. Since the primary sugar-binding site is in close proximity to the hinge region, the position of the hinge and relative orientation of the domains has a direct impact on the shape of the primary sugar-binding site. In the monomer, the pocket is intact, accommodating a disaccharide in a stacked conformation (30Bewley C.A. Structure. 2001; 9: 931-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), whereas in all domain-swapped structures, some of the essential protein-oligosaccharide hydrogen bonds cannot be established, leaving only the shape complementarity of oligosaccharide and pocket. Specifically, in the low pH (trigonal) crystal structure (15Yang F. Bewley C.A. Louis J.M. Gustafson K.R. Boyd M.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Wlodawer A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the sugar-binding pocket as seen in the compact monomeric structures (Fig.3A) is partially changed. The OG oxygen of Ser-52 is displaced from its optimal position in which it provides a hydrogen bond to an oxygen atom from a mannose ring, disrupting one of the important hydrogen bonds and making sterically unfavorable the binding of any saccharide (Fig. 3B). This is the case in all trigonal crystal structures at pH 4.6–8.5, which adopt the same domain orientation and do not show oligosaccharide binding in the primary site. The high pH (tetragonal) crystal structures have a different relative orientation of the domains but still show a perturbed binding pocket. In this case, Asn-53 from the hinge region moves farther into the pocket, reducing its volume (Fig. 3C) and introducing unfavorable geometry for the specific binding of a mannose ring. Because of these steric considerations, sugar binding in this pocket may not be favorable and was not observed in any of the tetragonal crystal structures at various pH values. Since we do not observe binding into the primary sugar-binding site, the question arises whether the binding of Man-9 into this pocket is also carried out by three stacked rings, as in the secondary binding site, or by two stacked rings only, as reported previously for the dimannoside (30Bewley C.A. Structure. 2001; 9: 931-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The secondary sugar-binding site is located ∼35 Å away from the primary site and is not affected by the geometry of the hinge, presenting the same conformation both in monomeric and domain-swapped dimeric CV-N. Comparing the two structures, the stacked position of the rings is evident from the clear electron density. Three rings are seen in the case of Man-9 (Fig.4A), and two are seen in the case of hexamannoside (Fig. 4B). Inspection of the Man-9 structure obtained by molecular dynamics (31Woods R.J. Pathiaseril A. Wormald M.R. Edge C.J. Dwek R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 372-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) reveals that branches D1 and D3 are more accessible for extended interaction than arm D2. The three terminal rings from both arm D1 and arm D3 were modeled into the electron density and refined. Due to the α1→6 linkage, the geometry of arm D3 is not compatible with the observed electron density; only mannose rings in an α1→2-linked conformation can fit into the Man-9 electron density map. This observation is in agreement with previous results that show that the oligosaccharides interface with CV-N via a branch containing mainly α1→2-linked rings. The position of mannose rings C and 4 (residues 505 and 504) from arm D1 is very similar to the model suggested from the solution structure of a CV-N disaccharide complex (30Bewley C.A. Structure. 2001; 9: 931-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the stacked rings interact much more tightly with the protein than suggested by the NMR model, making 10 hydrogen bonds for the Man-9 and 9 hydrogen bonds for the hexamannoside binding interface (Table III). Seven of these hydrogen bonds are conserved between the binding rings 4 and C of the two oligosaccharides, but they are not comparable with the dimannoside hydrogen bonds. Mannose ring 4 of the hexamannoside with five sugar-protein hydrogen-bonds the most tightly. However, the higher number of hydrogen bonds for rings 4 and C of hexamannoside does not provide extra affinity as compared with Man-9. In this respect, the terminal ring D1 (residue 506) of Man-9 must be responsible for the orders of magnitude higher affinity of this ligand. The D1 ring forms three hydrogen bonds with Gly-2 and Lys-3 and could also interact with the flexible Glu-101 from domain B. These important interactions of the terminal ring D1 were not accounted for in a recent mutagenesis study of the secondary sugar-binding site using a two-ring binding interface model (32Chang L.C. Bewley C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The branching mannose ring (residue 503) can also be identified in both maps, suggesting that the α1→2-linked stacked rings are of the main D1 arm. Since the only difference between the D1 branches in Man-9 and hexamannoside is the lack of one α1→2-linked mannose ring (residue 506) at the end of the branch in the latter, the density unequivocally identifies the D1 arm as the binding interface.Table IIIOligosaccharide–protein hydrogen bondsMan-9Ring name3-aAccording to nomenclature from Fig. 1.CV-NDistanceÅ 504 O34B Asp-95 N3.2 504 O44A Thr-25 N2.92 504 O64A Glu-23 OE23.2 505 O3CA Lys-3 N3.54 505 O3CB Asn-93 N2.67 505 O4CA Thr-7 N3.52 505 O4CA Thr-7 OG12.87 506 O3D1A Gly-2 N3.13 506 O3D1A Lys-3 NZ3.16 506 O4D1A Lys-3 NZ3.66Hexamannoside 504 O34B Asp-95 N2.9 504 O44B Asp-95 N3.03 504 O44B Gly-96 N3.62 504 O44A Thr-25 N3.57 504 O64A Glu-23 OE23.16 505 O3CB Asn-93 N2.79 505 O3CA Lys-3 N3.4 505 O4CA Thr-7 N3.63 505 O4CA Thr-7 OG13.093-a According to nomenclature from Fig. 1. Open table in a new tab The electron density was very clear for the binding interface (residues 504–506) and the branching ring 3 (residue 503) but is less well defined for the rest of the sugar molecule, which is pointing away from the protein. The well defined rings (residues 504–506) were modeled and refined first. These mannopyranose rings adopt the chair conformation with the nonreducing pyranose ring stacked over the reducing mannopyranose. NMR and computational studies show that the conformations of disaccharide fragments of an oligosaccharide fall within the allowed regions of the corresponding disaccharide φ and ψ angle maps (33Rao V.S.R. Qasba P.K. Balaji P.V. Chandrasekaran R. Conformation of Carbohydrates. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1998Google Scholar). If the pyranose rings are treated as flexible during the energy minimization studies of disaccharides, then the φ and ψ conformational space accessed is larger than when the pyranose rings are treated as rigid (33Rao V.S.R. Qasba P.K. Balaji P.V. Chandrasekaran R. Conformation of Carbohydrates. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1998Google Scholar). This seems to be the case of our structures, in which φ and ψ values show more variation, possibly because of the flexibility of the mannopyranose rings. Comparison of the torsion angles for the α1→2 linkages present in the binding interface (Table IV) shows a rather good agreement of the values of φ and ψ for the terminal D1 → C ring linkage in Man-9 with the dimannoside solution structure and the methyl-dimannoside crystal structure (34Srikrishnan T. Chowdhary M.S. Matta K.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 186: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The values of φ and ψ are in good agreement for the C → 4 ring linkage in Man-9 and hexamannoside. However, φ shows a 35–50° deviation, and ψ a 5–35° deviation, when compared with the D1 → C linkage in Man-9 and the dimannoside solution structure. Since ring D1 is absent in the hexamannoside, this difference in the torsion angles could be attributed to the steric constraints of the flanking mannopyranoside ring 3 (residue 503) and those of the protein-binding site. The flexible D2 and D3 arms, which point to the solution, can adopt multiple conformations without steric strain on the binding interface. Of the two identical secondary binding sites, one had better electron density. In this site, the bound Man-9 molecule reaches over to a symmetry-related CV-N molecule, contacting residues 15, 59, and 61. These additional interactions might explain the better anchoring of the Man-9 molecule in this site and therefore its better electron density. In the other site, only the D1 arm binding rings and the branching Man-3 were modeled in and refined.Table IVOligosaccharide torsion angles for α1 → 2 linkagesLinkage between ringsOligosaccharideφψdegreesdegreesC → 4Man-9−4.522.7C → 4hexamannoside−3.610.7D1 → CMan-9−39.445.92 → 1dimannoside4-aFrom CV-N/dimannoside solution structure (1iiy.pdb) (30).−48.836.92 → 1methyl-dimannoside4-bFrom methyl-dimannoside crystal structure (34).−55.514.54-a From CV-N/dimannoside solution structure (1iiy.pdb) (30Bewley C.A.

Open table in a new tab The GlcNAc ring 1 (residue 501) from Man-9 is pointing into the solvent, its most remote atom being located ∼14 Å from the CV-N surface. Since this distance was measured in the most extended conformation of Man-9 bound to the secondary binding site, closer positioning of the GlcNAc ring might be possible given the flexibility of the two intermediate rings. GlcNAc 1 is anchored by an Asn residue on the surface of gp120, positioning bound gp120 much closer to CV-N than suggested previously (10Bewley C.A. Otero-Quintero S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3892-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, besides oligosaccharide-mediated interactions, discrete protein-protein interactions might also play a role in the gp120-CV-N binding (12Shenoy S.R. O'Keefe B.R. Bolmstedt A.J. Cartner L.K. Boyd M.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 704-710PubMed Google Scholar). Several co-crystallization conditions were identified for CV-N with hexamannoside. However, the co-crystal structures did not show any sugar binding. This lack of hexamannoside binding to the secondary binding site of CV-N is similar to the results of solution phase NMR experiments in which binding of the hexamannoside to the secondary binding site was not detected (13Shenoy, S. R., Barrientos, L. G., Ratner, D. M., O'Keefe, B. R., Seeberger, P. H., Gronenborn, A. M., and Boyd, M. R. (2002) Chem. Biol. (Lond.), in pressGoogle Scholar). Also, soaks with a synthetic nonamannoside and trimannoside did not yield binding in their respective crystal structures. In both synthetic oligosaccharides, a short hydrophobic pentyl segment substituted GlcNAc 1 and 2. Nonamannoside had a tendency to disorder the crystals, raising the mosaicity significantly. The Man-9-CV-N complex structure shows that the branching Man-3 is already protruding from the binding site, interacting partially with the flexible loop region (residues 22–27). The position of the pentyl is further restricted in nonamannoside by the bulk of the longer branches and might not interact favorably with the flexible loop region, lowering considerably the binding affinity of the sugar and at the same time having a chaotropic effect on the ordered molecules in the crystal. CV-N undergoes conformational changes upon binding of gp120 and gp41 (6Esser M.T. Mori T. Mondor I. Sattentau Q.J. Dey B. Berger E.A. Boyd M.R. Lifson J.D. J.

Commun. 1998; 248: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with an average 11% loss of β-sheet and 2% loss of helical structure. We attempted to determine whether this reflects in the flexibility of the loop in the uncomplexed and sugar-bound forms of CV-N by comparing the B-factors of these structures. There is a well conserved trend of higher than average B-factors in the regions with residues 20–30, 50–57, and 70–80 (data not shown). Not surprisingly, these are residues directly involved in the architecture of sugar-binding sites. This suggests a flexible pocket architecture, which is able to accommodate two or three stacked rings, depending on the structure of the oligosaccharide. The crystallographic data presented here give visual definition to the molecular basis of the unique specificity of CV-N for Man-8 and Man-9 moieties. The additional binding affinity of CV-N for Man-8 and Man-9 as compared with Man-6 or hexamannoside is the result of the additional binding energy derived from the third mannose ring. The physiological significance of this difference is manifested in the relative paucity of Man-8 and Man-9 residues on normal mammalian glycoproteins. Man-8 and Man-9 oligosaccharides are rarely found in the human system and then usually only on glycoproteins destined for short term use and rapid degradation (e.g. tissue plasminogen activator). In the case of certain viral glycoproteins, however, Man-8 and Man-9 oligosaccharides are more prevalent. Such is the case of HIV gp120, where as many as 11 high mannose oligosaccharides can be present with five to six of these generally in the form of Man-8 or Man-9 (36Yeh J.C. Seals J.R. Murphy C.I. van Halbeek H. Cummings R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11087-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has been shown that CV-N inhibits the binding of the broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibody 2G12 (6Esser M.T. Mori T. Mondor I. Sattentau Q.J. Dey B. Berger E.A. Boyd M.R. Lifson J.D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4360-4371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of gp120 with excess CV-N prevents subsequent binding of 2G12 to gp120; however, CV-N binding to gp120 that was preincubated with excess 2G12 was only slightly reduced as compared with binding to gp120 alone (37Scanlan C.N. Pantophlet R. Wormald M.R. Ollmann S.E. Stanfield R. Wilson I.A. Katinger H. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M. Burton D.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7306-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). These data suggest that 2G12 binds only a subset of the Man1α→2Man termini present on gp120, whereas CV-N binds essentially all such residues (37Scanlan C.N. Pantophlet R. Wormald M.R. Ollmann S.E.

The ability of CV-N to target these virus-associated oligosaccharides with high affinity, whereas only binding with relatively low affinity to other, more common, mammalian oligosaccharides (e.g. Man-6) is the basis for the potential utility of this agent as an anti-HIV microbicide.

High voltage-activated channels are comprised of the L-types (CaV1) and the N-, P/Q-, and R-types (CaV2). The third family (CaV3) is comprised of the members of the low voltage-activated/T-type Ca2+ channels. Although primarily gated by fluctuations of membrane potential, an essential aspect of the function of these channels is their capacity to respond to extracellular signals via membrane receptors and intracellular second messengers that, in turn, alter channel activity. As for many ionic channels, growing evidence indicates that the specificity and speed of these regulations require a promiscuous organization of the constitutive channel subunits with membrane receptors and complexes of intracellular molecules. In that context, the role of scaffolding proteins in orchestrating these networks is crucial. Accordingly, the regulation of voltage-gated calcium channels by anchored pools of protein kinases is a key factor in controlling intracellular calcium levels. Efficient phosphorylation is accomplished through formation of kinase-channel complexes. For example, protein kinase A (PKA)1 is anchored near L-type calcium channels by different AKAPs in brain, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and myocardium (3Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

Consequently these interactions are needed for the activity-dependent regulation of contractile force in skeletal muscle (6Sculptoreanu A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

Furthermore, in heterologous systems, PKA-dependent phos- phorylation of both α1C (CaV1.2) and α1S (CaV1.1) L-type channels does not appear to occur in the absence of AKAP proteins (5Gao T. Yatani A.

Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Two distinct membrane-anchored AKAPs (AKAP15/18 and AKAP79/150) have been studied in that context, and a direct interaction between the skeletal muscle L-type channel α1S and AKAP15 has been recently identified (11Hulme J.T. Ahn M. Hauschka S.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 30: 30Google Scholar). Whereas AKAP15/18 is prominent in muscles, AKAP79/150 is abundantly expressed in neurons and has a pattern of localization similar to that of α1C (12Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E. Warner C.

A high proportion of AKAP79/150 and α1C is concentrated in the primary branches of dendrites where they associate with β2-adrenergic receptors (16Davare M.A. Avdonin V. Hall D.D. Peden E.M. Burette A. Weinberg R.J. Horne M.C. Hoshi T. Hell J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) to form postsynaptic signaling complexes that regulate synaptic transmission. In the present study, we have examined in heterologous expression models the effect of AKAP79 coexpression on α1C calcium channel activity to further delineate the determinant of their interactions. We found that AKAP79 directly regulates the surface expression of α1C but, surprisingly, independently of PKA activation. A proline-rich region contained within the α1C II-III intracellular linker coordinates this effect. We propose that this sequence, common to various L-type channels, may act as an inhibitory motif that can be masked by AKAP79, favoring the delivery to the plasma membrane of preassembled L-type Ca2+channel signaling complexes. We have previously described the generation of chimeras between α1C and α1E(17Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The II-III loops of α1C and α1E were amplified by PCR and subcloned into c-Myc/pcDNA3. A similar procedure was used to fuse AKAP79 or AKAP79Δ388 with a c-Myc epitope. Deletion of the PP motif on the α1C II-III loop (amino acids 854 to 864) was created by overlapping PCR, using as template a wild-type α1C cDNA engineered to contain two unique silent restriction sites (MluI and SpeI) flanking the II-III loop region (18Stotz S.C. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33001-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The amplified 780-base pairMluI-SpeI fragment was reintroduced into the template DNA. Accuracy of the different sequences was analyzed by sequencing (Genome Express) and restriction digests. The following cDNA sequences inserted in expression vectors have been used (GenBankTM accession numbers), α1A,M64373; α1C, M67515; α1E, L15453; β1b, NM017346; β2a, M80545; α2-δ1b,AF286488; α1G, AF126965; α1H, NM021098; AKAP79, NM004857. For transient expression in Xenopusoocytes, nuclear injection was performed as previously reported (19Altier C. Spaetgens R.L. Nargeot J. Bourinet E. Zamponi G.W. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When AKAP79 was coexpressed with the Ca2+ channel subunits, we used a ratio of 1 (AKAP), 3 (Ca2+ channel mix). When needed, this mix was supplemented with the II-III loop constructs at a ratio of 3 (cDNA mix), 1 (II-III loop). As control, the empty vector was used to obtain the same dilution. Oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C for 2–4 days in ND96 medium on rotating platform. For mammalian cell expression, human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were used and transfected with calcium phosphate as described previously (17Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Macroscopic oocyte currents were recorded using a two-electrode voltage clamp as previously described (19Altier C. Spaetgens R.L. Nargeot J. Bourinet E. Zamponi G.W. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with 5 mm barium as charge carrier. An AxoPatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) was used for cell-attached recordings with 7–12 MΩ sylgard-coated pipettes filled with a solution containing (in mm): 100 BaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. 1 μm FPL64176 was also added to the pipette solution to facilitate the resolution of single channel events. Oocytes were placed in a high potassium solution to reduce the membrane potential to 0 mV. Whole cell recordings in HEK cells were performed with an AxoPatch-200B amplifier using an external solution containing (in mm): 10 BaCl2, 160 TEACl, 10 HEPES (pH to 7.4 with TEAOH). Pipettes of 1–2 MΩ resistance were filled with an internal solution containing (in mm): 110 CsCl, 3 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3 Mg-ATP, 0.6 GTP (pH to 7.2 with CsOH). All chemicals used were purchased from Sigma except for the peptide Ht-31 provided by Dr. N. Lamb (Montpellier, France). Ht-31 was injected during the recording by an additional microelectrode. pCLAMP7 software was used for data acquisition; analysis was performed with pCLAMP6, Excel, and GraphPad Prism software. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. and compared using Student’s t test. Surface expression of α1Cprotein was measured using the immunoassay recently described (20Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). The hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was inserted into the extracellular S5-H5 loop of domain II. Complementary oligonucleotides encoding the HA epitope flanked with extra amino acids to enlarge the loop were annealed to form an MluI adaptor and ligated into a unique silent MluI site introduced at base pair 2055 by site-directed mutagenesis on the α1CcDNA. The amino acid sequence of the HA-tagged α1Creads680DEMQTRHYPYDVPDYAVTFDEMQTRRS706at the epitope insertion site (HA epitope shown in bold type, extra residues are in italics). The epitope is therefore 12 amino acids distant from the S5 end and from the start of the H5. Two days after cDNA injection, currents were recorded. Oocytes were then placed for 30 min in ND96 with 1% bovine serum albumin to block unspecific binding, incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in ND96–1% bovine serum albumin, washed at 4 °C, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (goat anti-rat FAB fragments, Jackson ImmunoResearch). After several washes with 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at 4 °C, individual oocytes were washed with normal ND96 solution at room temperature and then placed in 50 μl of SuperSignal® ELISA Femto substrate (Pierce). Chemiluminescence was quantified immediately in a Luminoskan microplate reader (Labsystems Inc., Finland). All data were normalized to the level of signal obtained for the HA-α1C channel complex with its ancillary α2-δ and β1bsubunits. Oocytes protein samples were prepared as follows. Oocytes were homogenized in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, supplemented with a protein inhibitor mix (Roche Diagnostics). Homogenates were shaken for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 14000 ×g for 2 min. HEK samples were prepared as in Ref. 21Sharp A.H. Black J.L. Dubel S.J. Sundarraj S. Shen J. Yunker A.M. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 599-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 6 or 8% gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and then immunoblotted. The blot was blocked with 5% powdered nonfat milk. c-Myc-tagged proteins were detected with mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibodies at 1:300 dilution (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HA-tagged proteins were detected with a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody at 1:1000 dilution (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:5000 dilution (sheep anti-mouse, Amersham Biosciences, or goat anti-rat FAB fragments, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection. When coexpressed with AKAP79, α1C channels exhibited a 2 to 4-fold increase in current density (Fig.1A). This augmentation was not associated with any significant changes in whole cell current kinetics nor with a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, unlike what is typically seen following PKA-dependent regulation of native L-type calcium currents (Fig. 1B, α1C α2-δ β1b, V0.5 = −12.5 ± 0.5 mV, n = 20; α1C α2-δ β1b + AKAP79, V0.5 = −13.8 ± 0.4 mV, n = 19). The AKAP79-mediated enhancement of current amplitude did not require the presence of a calcium channel β1b subunit (Fig. 1,B and C; +β1b, IAKAP/I = 3.1 ± 0.2, n = 26; −β1b, IAKAP/I = 2.9 ± 0.5,n = 8) and was not altered following coexpression of distinct forms of β-subunits (not shown), indicating that the effect of AKAP79 is intrinsic to the L-type calcium channel α1subunit. Moreover, coexpression of AKAP79 had no effect on the current amplitudes of members of the CaV2 (α1A, α1E) or CaV3 (α1G, α1H) calcium channel subfamilies (Fig. 1C), indicating that AKAP79 selectively affects L-type calcium channels. One well characterized function of AKAPs is to bring PKA to the vicinity of its substrates to allow their phosphorylation, as observed for a number of ionic channels and plasma membrane-anchored AKAPs (22Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). To test whether activation of PKA that was associated with AKAP79 mediated enhancement of L-type channel currents, we applied several pharmacological agents that perturb PKA-dependent phosphorylation. First of all, long term incubation (24 h) of the oocytes with the broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor H7 (100 μm) did not significantly alter the magnitude of the AKAP effect (Fig. 1D), suggesting that tonic channel phosphorylation is unlikely to underlie the up-regulation of L-type currents. Second, the stimulation of the PKA cascade by an acute application of 50 μm forskolin did not result in any functional change in α1C channel activity in the presence (Fig. 1D) or absence of AKAP79. Third, to test whether the PKA-AKAP interaction is a prerequisite for the AKAP79 effects, we injected the oocytes during the time course of the recordings with the AKAPlbc-derived peptide Ht-31 (50 μm final concentration) that contains the critical RII-binding domain and is known to prevent association of PKA with AKAPs (23Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with H7 or forskolin, application of the Ht-31 peptide did not antagonize the AKAP79-induced current increase (Fig. 1D). Finally, we created a truncated AKAP79 construct in which the PKA-interacting RII domain had been deleted through insertion of a premature stop codon after residue 388 (Fig. 1E). In addition, both the mutant and the wild-type AKAP79 were fused to a c-Myc epitope to verify their expression. Consistent with the Ht-31 injections, both Δ388 and full-length AKAP79 promoted similar increases in α1C channel activity (Fig. 1F, IAKAP79 c-Myc/I = 3.36 ± 0.3, n = 7; IAKAP79Δ388 c-Myc/I = 3.28 ± 0.1,n = 26). Collectively, these data indicate that the ability of AKAP79 to enhance L-type calcium channel levels occurs independently of its role in PKA signaling, hinting at a novel action that might perhaps be related to its function as a scaffolding protein (24Dodge K. Scott J.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476 (1–2): 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The increase in current level could in principle be due to one or a combination of three factors, single channel conductance, maximum open probability (Po), or an increase in the number of functional channels. To distinguish among these possibilities, we first examined the effect of the calcium channel agonist FPL64176, which is known to enhance the Po. If the major function of AKAP79 were due to a selective effect on Po, then one might expect a smaller FPL-mediated effect on channels coexpressed with AKAP79. The magnitude of FPL increase, however, was similar with or without AKAP (−AKAP, 3.08-fold ± 0.3, n = 7, +AKAP, 2.93-fold ± 0.3, n = 8). Although such observations would not be discriminative for small Po changes, they suggest that AKAP79 does not act in majority by increasing Po. Next, we performed cell-attached single channel recordings to examine a putative AKAP79 effect on unitary conductance (Fig.2, A and B). In the presence of AKAP79, the number of channels per patch was consistently increased and the number of patches without channels reduced. However, the conductance remained unaltered (Fig. 2B). Thus, rather than changing channel function, AKAP79 appears to act by increasing channel density. To determine whether AKAP79 indeed altered the plasma membrane expression of the channel complex, we directly measured plasma membrane protein levels based on the immunoassay described by Zerangueet al. (20Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). We inserted the HA epitope into the domain II S5-H5 extracellular loop of α1C, and to ensure a good accessibility of the epitope we introduced extra flanking residues known to optimize the recognition by the antibody (25Schwake M. Pusch M. Kharkovets T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13343-13348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The tagged channel was recognized by the anti-HA antibody in Western blots (Fig.3A), and its currents were still augmented following AKAP79 coexpression. Moreover, its biophysical properties were identical to that seen with the wild-type (WT) channels, suggesting that the insertion of the additional sequence did not disrupt channel conformation. The assay to measure surface expression consists of an enzymatic amplification of HA recognition by using a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and a maximum sensitivity-enhanced chemiluminescent substrate adapted to luminometric detection. After electrophysiological recordings, individual non-permeabilized oocytes were processed with the primary and secondary antibodies. Channel surface expression on individual oocytes, directly related to the intensity of chemiluminescence, was subsequently quantified with a luminometer. For positive and negative controls we used an HA-tagged Kir2.1 potassium channel (known to give a good signal in this assay, Ref. 20Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) and the WT α1C channel, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3B, the WT L-type channel alone yielded a signal no higher than background, whereas HA-Kir2.1 produced consistent chemiluminescence. Because the ancillary β-subunit is known to increase calcium current levels by disrupting an endoplasmic reticulum retention mechanism (26Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. De Waard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), we first tested the accuracy of the assay by asking whether coexpression of the β-subunit alters surface expression of the HA-α1C subunit. Indeed, surface expression of HA-α1C was increased by about 3-fold upon coexpression with β1b (Fig. 3B). However, this could not account for all of the observed increase in current amplitude (∼7-fold, Fig. 1B), consistent with the dual role of this regulatory subunit in controlling both the expression and the biophysical properties of the pore subunit (27Canti C. Davies A. Berrow N.S. Butcher A.J. Page K.M. Dolphin A.C. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1439-1451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, coexpression of AKAP79 promotes a further increase in surface expression of the HA-α1C(+α2+β1b) channel complex (2 ± 0.27-fold, Fig. 2D) that is consistent with the observed stimulation of current density. Thus, combination of electrophysiology and surface protein measurements supports the notion that AKAP79 appears to increase expression of α1C in the plasma membrane. We tested a series of chimeric calcium channels (17Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Altier C. Spaetgens R.L. Nargeot J. Bourinet E. Zamponi G.W. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) to map the structural determinants in α1C that increase current levels in the presence of AKAP79. We utilized a family of chimeric channels that were previously generated by switching transmembrane domains from the α1C L-type channel with corresponding regions from the AKAP79-insensitive α1E channel. Note that each domain that was swapped also contained the preceding intracellular loop (i.e. II-III loop with domain III). As shown in Fig. 4A, the effects of AKAP79 were maintained by replacement of domains I, II, or IV of α1C with those of α1E (ECCC, CECC, EECC, and CCCE). By contrast, substitution of domain III of α1Cabolished the AKAP79 effects (Fig. 4, A and B), implicating domain III and the associated II-III linker as a key determinant. Because cytoplasmic regions are the prime candidates for mediating interactions with intracellular proteins, we further studied the role of the II-III linker. We first examined whether overexpression of the α1C II-III linker or subregions of this loop could act to inhibit the AKAP79 effect. These loops (as well as the corresponding region of α1E as a negative control) were fused to a c-Myc epitope in an expression vector (Fig.5A), and their correct expression was verified by Western blot from oocytes used for electrophysiological recording. Protein sizes were confirmed by metabolic labeling (not shown) as well as by blotting the same proteins transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 5B). Using a 3:1 ratio of channel subunits AKAP79 to II-III loop, the expression of the α1E II-III linker did not alter the magnitude of the AKAP79 effect. In contrast, the effect of AKAP79 was reduced to control levels in the presence of the α1C II-III linker (Fig.5B, II-III C). This effect appeared to be selectively due to the carboxyl half (II-III C2) of the domain II-III linker, suggesting that the presence of a possible interacting domain on II-III C and II-III C2 is able to quench the AKAP79 effect.Figure 5Overexpression of the α1C II-III loop prevents AKAP79-mediated trafficking.A, schematic representation of the II-III loop expression constructs that were fused to a c-mycepitope to verify expression.

Note that II-III C and II-III C2 act as dominant negatives of the AKAP effect.Inset, Western blots illustrating the correct expression of the linker constructs. The Western blots were generated from oocytes subsequent to electrophysiological recordings. Note that the various linker proteins have the same size when expressed in HEK cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Upon examination of the amino acid sequence of the carboxyl half of the α1C II-III linker, we noted a conspicuous polyproline motif (Fig.6A, designated PPregion) that is conserved in three of the four L-type calcium channel α1 subunits identified to date. Because proline motifs are frequently implicated in protein-protein interactions, we deleted this 11-amino acid cluster containing the 5 prolines (to generate α1C-ΔPP) and examined the ability of AKAP79 to enhance currents carried by the mutant channel. The deletion did not affect channel properties per se; however, it completely negated the AKAP79 effect (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the deletion resulted in current densities that were similar to those seen with the WT channels coexpressed with AKAP79 (Fig. 6C). This effect was not confined to the Xenopus oocyte expression system, because an even larger increase (∼8-fold) in current density was obtained when the channels were expressed in HEK cells (Fig.6C). Overall, our data indicate that the PP region is antagonistic to channel surface expression and that AKAP79 may serve to counteract the role of the PP motif. Ion channels do not operate as free floating entities in the plasma membrane but rather associate with intracellular molecules that are important for their trafficking to the membrane, their sorting toward subcellular sites, and their association with specific molecules to form specialized signal transduction complexes. A number of interacting partners have been recognized for various Ca2+channel subunits (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound AKAP proteins are part of L-type Ca2+ channel signaling networks (5Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 8Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R.E. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J.

The data presented here indicate that in addition to its known role on kinase and phosphatase regulation, the postsynaptic scaffolding AKAP79 largely promotes surface expression of L-type Ca2+ channels. It is now well established that the surface expression of plasma membrane proteins can be regulated by a number of specific sequences (28Ma D. Zerangue N. Raab-Graham K. Fried S.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2002; 33: 715-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These include quality control and forward trafficking signals that regulate supply to the membrane as well as internalization motifs that control protein retrieval from the surface by endocytosis. In our experiments we characterized an 11-amino acid cluster enriched in proline residues that mediates the AKAP79-induced surface expression. Although several ion channels contain well established endocytotic motifs, none of these such as the di-lysine or the tyrosine-based (YxxΦ) signals (29Madrid R., Le Maout S. Barrault M.B. Janvier K.

Increased surface expression resulting from an interaction of different constitutive subunits of a channel complex such as the one we describe here are more often linked to quality control mechanisms involving the shielding of endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval signals in the fully assembled channels (20Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 30Zerangue N. Malan M.J. Fried S.R. Dazin P.F. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Schwappach B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2431-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Such a role has been described for the calcium channel β-subunit, which occludes a retention signal within the α1 subunit domain I-II linker (26Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. De Waard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Similarly, AKAP79 may act on the PP region of CaV1 channels by a similar mechanism, although this will be addressed in the future. Nonetheless, these data together with those of earlier studies (26Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. De Waard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 31Gao T. Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L., Ma, H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25436-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggest that individual calcium channels may contain a variety of surface expression determinants that differ among the three CaV subfamilies, providing a specific regulation of their cellular dynamic. We show here that only three CaV1 pore-forming subunits contain the PP region in their II-III loop. Similarly, the β-subunit occlusion of the I-II loop retention signal is likely restricted to CaV1 and CaV2 channels because members of the CaV3 family have divergent I-II linkers and are not regulated by β-subunits. AKAP79 has been shown to interact with a number of proteins, suggesting the possibility that it might physically bind to the PP region. However, we could not detectin vitro binding between AKAP79 and α1CII-III-linker fusion proteins (not shown), indicating that AKAP79 and α1C interact only weakly and perhaps only transiently, if at all. Alternatively, it is possible that AKAP79 might interact with the L-type calcium channel via one or more adaptor proteins, as reported for the AKAP79/AMPA receptor interaction (32Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, future biochemical and molecular studies will be required to unravel all the details of these events to fully interpret the cell biological mechanism by which α1C surface expression is enhanced. From a physiological point of view, there is growing evidence that signaling pathways are structurally, spatially, and temporally tightly regulated. Biochemical data obtained from intact neurons have shown that the murine homologue of AKAP79 (AKAP150) interacts with α1C and the β2-adrenergic receptor in dendritic spines, possibly implicating AKAPs in receptor signaling to L-type calcium channels via PKA (16Davare M.A. Avdonin V.

M., Burette, A., Weinberg, R. J., Horne, M. C., Hoshi, T., and Hell, J. W. (2001) A. 271.9, Society for Neuroscience meeting, San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar). Within the context of this colocalization, however, our data suggest a novel role of AKAP79 in calcium channel modulation that occurs independently of PKA signaling. At the same time, AKAP79 may promote the association of molecular complexes comprising L-type Ca2+ channels and lead to their preferential trafficking/targeting to postsynaptic dendritic spines, as well as enhance calcium current densities. In view of the physiological role of L-type calcium channels in the activation of calcium-dependent enzymes and, perhaps more importantly, the triggering of calcium-dependent gene transcription (34Dolmetsch R.E. Pajvani U. Fife K. Spotts J.M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2001; 294: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), a dynamic regulation of L-type calcium channel levels via AKAP proteins may provide an important feedback mechanism for regulating these processes via controlling L-type channel surface expression. Furthermore, like L-type channels, AKAP79/150 proteins have been shown to stimulate cAMP-response element-binding protein-dependent gene transcription (35Feliciello A., Li, Y. Avvedimento E.V.

Derived from JTS6 plasmid carrying the STE6 gene, JTS6-H5 is a single copy CEN plasmid that carries the selectable marker URA3 and the STE6/CFTR hybrid gene H5, where sequences corresponding to Ste6p amino acid residues Arg-441–Ile-516 were replaced by the corresponding region from CFTR (F494-L558). Similarly, the CFTRΔF508 sequence was used to make plasmid H5-ΔF508. A fragment containing 193 bp of CFTRΔF508 DNA flanked by STE6 sequences, 101 bp on the amino terminus and 100 bp on the carboxyl terminus, was generated by PCR amplification of plasmid H5-ΔF508 using the following primers: forward (5′-GTTCTACGATAGCTATAATGGAT-3′), and reverse (5′-GCCTAATTGCCTTCATCAACAG-3′). To generate random point mutations within this fragment, PCR reactions were performed under mutagenic conditions (42Tindall K.R. Kunkel T.A.

The transformed JPY201 cells were plated in Sc-Ura medium, selective for transformants expressing the URA3 gene, and then mated with the yeast strain 22–2D4 (MATα, ura3-52,leu2-3,112, trp1).

After 8 h, cells were replica-printed to a medium selective for diploids (yeast nitrogen base supplemented with leucine). After a retest, plasmid DNA was isolated from single haploid JPY201 colonies that gave rise to diploid colonies and sequenced. For a quantitative mating assay, JPY201 cells transformed with each H5 variant were grown to log phase in 0.1% glucose Sc-URA medium. From each culture, 3 × 106cells were mixed with an equal number of 22-2D4 cells and collected by filtration onto a filter that was then placed on a yeast extract/peptone/dextrose plate for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were resuspended, sonicated briefly, and plated from serial dilutions onto selective plates. Plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C, and diploid colonies were counted (45Trueheart J.

Growth medium was minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology) and 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 units/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen). The vaccinia virus/bacteriophage T7 hybrid expression system (47Elroy-Stein O. Fuerst T.R. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6126-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) was used for transient expression of the CFTR variants in HeLa cells, as described previously (28Teem J.L. Berger H.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. Tsui L.C. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, sub-confluent 100-mm plates of HeLa cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (10 MOI) and transfected with pTM plasmids carrying each CFTR variant cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter. Cells were incubated for 18 h and lysed.Transient Expression of CFTR in FRT CellsFRT epitheloid cells and FRT cell lines stably expressing CFTR wt and CFTR ΔF508 (48Sheppard D.N. Carson M.R. Ostedgaard L.S. Denning G.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L405-L413PubMed Google Scholar) were gifts from Michael Welsh, University of Iowa. FRT cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. Growth medium was Coon's modification of Ham's F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology) and 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 units/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen). Dividing FRT cells were trypsinized in a solution containing 0.25% trypsin and 0.1% EDTA, pelleted, and resuspended in serum-free F-12 Coon's medium. Aliquots of cell suspension equivalent to 5 × 105 cells were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, pelleted, and resuspended in F-12 Coon's medium containing DMRIE-cholesterol reagent (Invitrogen) complexed with pSwick plasmid, carrying each CFTR variant cDNA. Cells were transfected at 37 °C for 2 h with slow rotation and plated on Millicell hemagglutinin-permeable cell culture inserts (pore size, 0.45 μm, Millipore Co.). Transepithelial chloride currents were recorded 4 days after transfection.Generation of FRT Stable Cell LinesFRT cells were co-transfected with pSwick CFTR and pcDNA plasmid (Invitrogen) using the DMRIE-cholesterol reagent. Clonal cell lines resistant to zeocin (Invitrogen) were expanded and screened for CFTR expression using short circuit chloride current measurements in Ussing chambers.Western Blot Analysis of CFTR ProteinCell LysatesFor analysis of CFTR processing, transiently transfected HeLa cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 17.4 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After unbroken cells and nuclei were discarded by low speed centrifugation, proteins in the lysates were denatured in SDS-gel loading buffer and stored at −20 °C.Protein-enriched FractionCells growing on 100-mm plates were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, collected in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in ice-cold 1 ml TEAA buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 3 mm EGTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 17.4 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a 5-min incubation in TEAA, the cell suspension was passed 10 times through a 27-gauge needle. Nuclei and cell debris were pelleted (5 min/4,000 × g) and discarded, and the cleared supernatant was submitted to high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g/30 min). The pelleted membranes were resuspended in SDS-gel loading buffer and stored at −20 °C.Immunoblot AnalysisFifty micrograms of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE on 6% gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations Inc.). CFTR variants were probed with the monoclonal antibody M3A7, which recognizes an epitope within the CFTR NBD2 (9Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody peroxidase conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) was added, and protein bands were visualized using ECL (AmershamBiosciences).ElectrophysiologyFRT cell lines stably expressing CFTR variants or transiently transfected were plated at 2.5 × 105cells/cm2 on Millicell-hemagglutinin cell culture inserts. Transepithelial resistance was monitored daily (Millicell Electrical Resistance System, Millipore Co.) and was typically greater than 3000 ohms/cm2 after 4 days. FRT monolayers were mounted in modified Ussing chambers (Jim's Instruments, Iowa City, IA) and continually gassed with O2. Temperature was maintained at 37 °C. Transepithelial chloride gradient was imposed by bathing the basolateral surface with a recording solution containing 135 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mmK2HPO4, 0.6 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm dextrose, pH 7.4, and the apical surface with a similar recording solution, except that 135 mm sodium gluconate replaced the 135 mm NaCl, bringing the chloride concentration to 4.8 mm. The potential difference between the potential sensing electrodes was compensated. The transepithelial voltage was clamped to zero (voltage clamp channel module, model 558C-5, Dept. of Bioengineering, University of Iowa), and transepithelial resistance was monitored by recording current deflections in response to 2-s pulses of 1 or 5 mV every 50 s. The short circuit currents were recorded continuously on a charter recorder (model SR6335, Western Graphtec, Inc.). After a stable base-line current was observed (usually within less than 10 min), IBMX, forskolin, and genistein (Sigma) were added to the apical chamber, as described for each experiment, and the current, reflecting the flow of chloride promoted by its concentration gradient (I sc), was recorded as a downward deflection. The I sc was calculated as the difference between the base-line and the sustained phase of the response (plateau), or the peak current. Values were normalized by the area of the insert (0.6 cm2), and results were then expressed in μA/cm2.Statistical AnalysisData are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Current values were compared before normalization by the Student's t test or by one-way ANOVA with a Student-Newman-Keuls follow-up test at a 95% (p < 0.05) or greater confidence level.DISCUSSIONTwo novel ΔF508 revertant mutations were identified just upstream (I539T) and within (G550E) the core consensus ABC signature motif LSGGQ in the NBD1 of CFTR. Each mutation partially restored processing of mutant CFTRΔF508 expressed in HeLa cells, with I539T being the most effective. Increased cAMP-activated chloride permeability was also observed in FRT monolayers expressing CFTRΔF/I539T and CFTRΔF/G550E to levels 6- and 12-fold higher than CFTRΔF508, respectively. The larger fraction of processed CFTRΔF/I539T and CFTRΔF/G550E observed relative to CFTRΔF508, thus, represents functional channels localized at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, functional studies using a double revertant allele (CFTRΔF/DB) showed that I539T and G550E mutations act synergistically to increase CFTRΔF508 chloride currents to ∼29% of CFTR wt, representing a 38-fold increase over the CF mutant. Processing of CFTRΔF/DB, as indicated by the fully glycosylated form of CFTR, was correspondingly increased. Therefore, the processing defect of CFTRΔF508 was substantially rescued by second-site mutations in the region of the LSGGQ motif of NBD1, leading to increased functional activity of mutant channels at the plasma membrane.The I539T and G550E mutations were identified as revertants of the CF-causing mutation ΔF508. It might, thus, be expected that these revertant mutations, identified by virtue of their effects to reverse the ΔF508 defect, would be specific for suppression of ΔF508. However, results by others suggest that G550E can partially rescue another processing-defective CF mutant, A561E (61Roxo R.M. Amaral M.D. Penque D. Pediatr. Pulmonol. Suppl. 2001; 22: 187Google Scholar). Possibly, the ΔF508 and A561E mutations cause misfolding in a similar manner, allowing each to be partially compensated by G550E. Alternatively, the suppressors may have a general effect to increase CFTR processing. In support of the latter possibility, it was observed that the combination of I539T and G550E within wild type CFTR increased functional activity. Further experiments will be necessary to determine the extent to which ΔF508 revertant mutations I539T and G550E suppress other CF mutations within the NBD1 that are associated with defective protein processing.To further assess the effects of the revertant mutations on CFTRΔF508, we compared the functional activity of CFTRΔF508, CFTRΔF/G550E, and CFTRΔF/I539T under various experimental conditions. Because ΔF508 is a temperature-sensitive mutation (14Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), we determined whether revertant mutations alter the temperature sensitivity of CFTRΔF508. The I539T mutation, when introduced in either CFTRΔF508 or CFTRΔF/G550E, rendered these variants insensitive to low temperature treatment. It is possible that the I539T revertant mutation and the low temperature treatment stabilize the same step in the mutant protein folding pathway; thus, their effects are not additive. The temperature insensitivity of CFTRΔF508 rendered by suppressor mutations has also been observed by others (62Chang X.B. Cui L. Hou Y.X. Jensen T.J. Aleksandrov A.A. Mengos A. Riordan J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast to I539T, G550E had little effect on CFTRΔF508 temperature sensitivity, suggesting that it affects the protein folding pathway differently.In addition to the processing defect, the ΔF508 mutation also impairs the chloride channel function of CFTR. The channelP o of CFTRΔF508 is decreased relative to CFTR wt (21Dalemans W. Barbry P. Champigny G. Jallat S. Dott K. Dreyer D. Crystal R.G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.P. Lazdunski M.

Wang F. Yang I.C. Reenstra W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C988-C998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results from patch-clamp studies using NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing CFTR and CFTR ΔF508 indicate that the ΔF508 mutation affects CFTR activation by attenuating PKA-dependent phosphorylation (22Wang F. Zeltwanger S., Hu, S. Hwang T.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 637-648Crossref Scopus"
https://openalex.org/W1969515810,"We found in the present study that stimulation of the A2A adenosine receptor (A2A-R) using an A2A-selective agonist (CGS21680) rescued the blockage of nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth when the NGF-evoked MAPK cascade was suppressed by an MEK inhibitor (PD98059) or by a dominant-negative MAPK mutant (dnMAPK). This action of A2A-R (designated as the A2A-rescue effect) can be blocked by two inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA) and was absent in a PKA-deficient PC12 variant. Activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway by forskolin exerted the same effect as that by A2A-R stimulation. PKA, thus, appears to mediate the A2A-rescue effect. Results from cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation at serine 133, trans-reporting assays, and overexpression of two dominant-negative CREB mutants revealed that A2A-R stimulation led to activation of CREB in a PKA-dependent manner and subsequently reversed the damage of NGF-evoked neurite outgrowth by PD98059 or dnMAPK. Expression of an active mutant of CREB readily rescued the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth impaired by dnMAPK, further strengthening the importance of CREB in the NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth process. Moreover, simultaneous activation of the A2A-R/PKA/CREB-mediated and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways caused neurite outgrowth that was not suppressed by a selective inhibitor of TrkA, indicating that transactivation of TrkA was not involved.

Nehlig A. Nicolas F. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1435-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To date, four adenosine receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) have been cloned and characterized (2Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 581-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, the A2A-R1 gene is heavily expressed by striatal neurons and colocalizes with the D2 dopamine receptor in GABAergic striopallidal neurons (3Ferre S. O'Connor W.T. Fuxe K. Ungerstedt U. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 5402-5406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, A2A-R was found in cholinergic striatal neurons (4Kirk I.P. Richardson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Evidence from several laboratories suggests that A2A-R is involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity (5Ribeiro J.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and may play a critical role in early neuronal development (6Weaver D.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 20: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Involvement of neurotrophic factors in regulating neuronal development has been well established (7Ventimiglia R. Mather P.E. Jones B.E. Lindsay R.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 8Gibbs R.B. Martynowski C. Brain Res. 1997; 753: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the striatum, nerve growth factor (NGF) is expressed in GABAergic neurons (9Bizon J.L. Lauterborn J.C. Gall C.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 31: 283-298Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar); its receptors (TrkA and p75) are located in cholinergic interneurons, which also express A2A-R (4Kirk I.P. Richardson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Mobley W.C. Woo J.E. Edwards R.H. Riopelle R.J. Longo F.M. Weskamp G. Otten U. Valletta J.S. Johnston M.V. Neuron. 1989; 3: 655-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Colocalization of NGF receptors and A2A-R in the striatum suggests a potential cross-interaction between the signaling pathways evoked by NGF and adenosine. Because PC12 cells express both A2A-R and NGF receptors (11Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar, 12Chern Y. Lai H-L. Fong J.C. Liang Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 950-958PubMed Google Scholar), these cells were chosen in the present study to investigate the potential function of A2A-R in regulating NGF function. PC12 cells have been widely used to delineate the molecular mechanisms evoked by NGF because they differentiate into sympathetic neuronal-like cells upon NGF treatment and acquire numerous neuronal characters (11Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar). NGF has been shown to activate multiple signaling pathways in PC12 cells (13Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 14Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Some of these pathways (e.g. PI3K/Akt, p53) appear to mostly mediate the anti-proliferative effect of NGF, whereas others (e.g. the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK and the PI3K/Rac pathways) have been mainly implicated in the differentiation process (15Szeberenyi J. Erhardt P. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2105-2113PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Integration of multiple signaling pathways activated by NGF might be required to trigger the neuronal differentiation process since sustained activation of either the MAPK or the PI3K pathway by itself is insufficient to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (18Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 19Ashcroft M. Stephens R.M. Hallberg B. Downward J. Kaplan D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4586-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Such complexity in multiple signaling pathways evoked by NGF permits a highly regulated signal cascade to trigger coordinated cellular responses.We have previously demonstrated in PC12 cells that stimulation of A2A-R activates at least two major cellular-signaling cascades transduced by adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) (12Chern Y. Lai H-L. Fong J.C. Liang Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 950-958PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chang Y.H. Conti M. Lee Y-C. Lai H-L. Ching Y-H. Chern Y. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13838-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Activation of both PKA- and PKC-mediated pathways by A2A-R was also observed in striatal cholinergic neurons (24Gubitz A.K. Widdowson L. Kurokawa M. Kirkpatrick K.A. Richardson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that activation of A2A-R potentiates NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, especially at sub-maximal concentrations of NGF. More strikingly, A2A-R stimulation rescues the ability of PC12 cells to proceed with NGF-evoked neurite outgrowth when the MAPK cascade is abated (designated as the A2A-rescue effect). Pharmacological and molecular biological analyses suggest that PKA-stimulated activation of the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) mediates the A2A-rescue effect. Although necessary, activation of CREB is not sufficient to trigger the neurite outgrowth process. Instead, simultaneous activation of the CREB- and the PI3K-mediated pathways induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, indicating that these two pathways function in coordination to trigger the neuronal outgrowth process.DISCUSSIONWe demonstrate in the present study that stimulation of A2A-R significantly enhances NGF-induced neurite outgrowth at suboptimal concentrations of NGF and rescues NGF-induced neurite outgrowth impaired by blockage of the MAPK cascade. This rescue effect of A2A-R requires PKA activation, since it is blocked by two different PKA inhibitors (H-89 and protein kinase inhibitor (PKI)) and is absent from a PKA-deficient PC12 variant (Fig.4). In addition, activating the cAMP/PKA pathway by forskolin also rescues NGF-induced neurite outgrowth impaired by dnMAPK (Fig. 4). Although MAPK is activated by stimulation of A2A-R, MAPK activation is not responsible for the A2A-rescue effect. PKC was also uninvolved in the A2A-rescue effect because a general PKC inhibitor did not alter this action of A2A-R (Table I). Based on the following evidence, we further conclude that CREB serves as a key mediator that functions downstream of PKA to elicit the A2A-rescue effect. First, stimulation of A2A-R led to activation of CREB, which could be blocked by a PKA inhibitor (Fig. 5). Second, A2A-R retained its ability to activate CREB in the presence of PD98059 (Fig. 6). Third, activation of CREB was critical for the A2A-rescue effect since A2A-R action was abated by overexpression of two dominant negative CREB mutants (CREBm1or CREB-R287L; Fig. 7). Finally, overexpression of a dominant positive CREB was sufficient to rescue NGF-induced neurite outgrowth damaged by dnMAPK (Fig. 8). CREB, therefore, appears to be a point of convergence for the MAPK cascade and the cAMP/PKA pathway and mediates the A2A-rescue effect. Because activation of CREB alone by various means is insufficient to induce neurite outgrowth (Figs. 1 and 8), another signal evoked by NGF in addition to CREB is required for inducing neurite outgrowth. Using a dominant negative and a constitutively active mutant of PI3K (▵p85 and p110*, respectively) and an active mutant of CREB (CREB-VP16), we found that simultaneous activation of the CREB-signaling pathway and the PI3K-mediated pathway, another well characterized pathway activated by NGF, is sufficient to induce neurite outgrowth (Figs. 9 and 10). Because this enhancing effect by A2A-R stimulation and p110* was insensitive to the Trk-selective inhibitor, K252a (Fig. 11), cross-talk between A2A-R and TrkA did not play a role in the above observation. Collectively, we demonstrate in the present study that concurrent activation of the CREB- and the PI3K-mediated pathways is sufficient to trigger neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Fig.12).We have previously reported that stimulation of A2A-R leads to an elevation of intracellular cAMP and activation of PKA, which mediate the anti-apoptotic effect in PC12 cells (22Lai H.L. Yang T.H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.H. Lin S.C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Huang N-K. Lin Y-W. Huang C-L. Messing R.O. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13838-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, our data demonstrate that CREB functions downstream of PKA upon A2A-R stimulation to rescue the NGF-evoked neurite outgrowth impaired by blockage of the MAPK cascade. In addition to multiple experiments to demonstrate the necessity of PKA (Fig. 4,A–C) and CREB (Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8), exposure of PC12 cells to H89 blocked the CREB phosphorylation (activation) by A2A-R (Fig. 5). H89 is a selective PKA inhibitor that inhibits PKA in a competitive manner with ATP and has been used to block PKA-mediated responses in many different cells including PC12 cells (48Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the concentration (10 μm) utilized in the present study. Similar to our findings, H89 at 10 μm significantly (but not completely) blocked cAMP-evoked protein phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (48Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The incomplete blockage of the cAMP/PKA-evoked (48Chijiwa T.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or A2A-R-mediated (Fig. 5) responses by H89 at 10 μm might have resulted from its poor membrane-penetrating ability or competition from intracellular endogenous ATP as suggested for another H series PKA inhibitor (H8, Ref. 49Etienne S.

Although H89 also slightly suppressed other kinases, theKi values for other kinases are at least 10-fold (e.g. cGMP-dependent kinase) to ∼3000-fold (e.g. casein kinase II) higher than those for inhibiting PKA. At 10 μm, for which less than 40% of the cAMP/PKA-mediated responses was inhibited (48Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the nonspecific inhibitory effect of H89 toward other kinases was expected to be minimal. Indeed, when PC12 cells were treated with up to 30 μm H89, no significant effects on activities of endogenous cGMP-dependent kinase, PKC, and Ca2+-/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases were observed (48Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although we cannot completely rule out the involvement of kinases other than PKA in mediating the activation of CREB by A2A-R, collective results strongly suggest that PKA plays a major and critical role in mediating the CREB-dependent A2A-rescue effect (Figs.Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8).Implication of CREB in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth observed in the present study is consistent with the well documented concept that CREB plays an important role in various functions of neurotrophins (43Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2358-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 50Walton M.R. Dragunow M. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Our finding is also consistent with a recent report in which overexpression of dominant negative mutants of CREB attenuated NGF-evoked neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (51Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that CREB can be phosphorylated by several kinases including MAPK and PKA (52Greenberg M.E. Shaywitz A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar) and in turn activates a specific set of gene transcriptions through binding to the CRE element (53Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation of Ser133, CREB binds to its coactivator (CREB-binding protein), which then interacts with the basal transcription factors and RNA polymerase II and initiates transcription from the CRE element (39Cesare D.D. Fimia G.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 281-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In the present study, two methods (the CREB trans-reporting system and the phosphorylation analysis of CREB-Ser133) were employed to determine CREB activity. Results from both assays indicate that A2A-R stimulation elevated the NGF-evoked CREB activity reduced by PD98059 (Fig. 6). These results support our hypothesis that CREB mediates the A2A-rescue effect and functions as a key transcription factor for neurite outgrowth. We were surprised to find that the patterns of CREB activity determined using these two methods were not completely correlated (Fig. 6). Although the phosphorylation levels of CREB at Ser133 by NGF and by CGS21680 were similar (Fig.6B), CREB activity upon A2A-R stimulation measured by the CREB trans-reporting system was markedly higher than that by NGF (Fig. 6C). It is also surprising to find that PD98059 decreased the activation of CREB by A2A-R, yet phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 was not affected (Fig. 6,B and C). These discrepancies might be due to different sensitivities of these two assays. Alternatively, A2A-R stimulation might utilize additional machinery in addition to phosphorylation of Ser133 of CREB to enhance CREB activation. Moreover, it is possible that as long as CREB activity is above a critical threshold for neurite outgrowth, the level of CREB activity might not necessarily be correlated with the extent of neurite outgrowth.In addition to CREB, several other transcription factors (e.g. Fra, JunD, CREM (cAMP response element modulator), and ATF (activating transcription factor); designated as CREB isobinders) also bind to the CRE consensus site (39Cesare D.D. Fimia G.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 281-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that NGF triggers a long term increase in the activity of an AP1 complex (containing Fra-2 and JunD), which binds to both AP1 and CRE consensus sites in PC12 cells. Because CREB-related constructs employed in the present study (i.e. CREBm1, CREBR287L, and VP16-CREB) may also interfere with the binding of CREB isobinders to the CRE element or hijack the cellular CRE isobinders, the involvement of CREB isobinders cannot be completely ruled out. Nevertheless, phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 does correlate with neurite outgrowth (Fig. 6), which strengthens our hypothesis that CREB plays a critical role in the neurite outgrowth process. The CRE consensus site is found in many genes (e.g.c-fos, NGF-inducible A gene, NGF-inducible B gene, and the light neurofilament, BclII) important for neuronal functions (43Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2358-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 54Cochran B.H. NIDA Res.

For example, expression of Bcl-2 was activated by NGF through a CREB-mediated mechanism and has been implicated in the survival of sympathetic neurons (43Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2358-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). We have tested the role of Bcl-2 in neurite outgrowth by overexpression of wild-type Bcl-2 in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Because overexpression ofBclII failed to restore the blockage of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by dnMAPK (data not shown), BclII might not play a critical role in mediating the neurite outgrowth process. It remains to be determined which gene(s) trans-activated by CREB mediates the induction of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells.Rapid activation of PI3K in just minutes upon NGF stimulation has been reported in PC12 cells (57Neri L.M. Martelli A.M. Borgatti P. Colamussi M.L. Marchisio M. Capitani S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2299-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is well documented that products of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3,4-diphosphate and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate) can bind to the pleckstrin homology domain of important signal molecules including several GDP/GTP exchange factors (e.g. Sos and Vav) of Rac and subsequently cause activation of Rac1 (58Das B. Shu X. Day G.J. Han J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Broek D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15074-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 59Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Rac is a small GTPase promptly activated by NGF and has previously been implicated in modulating polarized outgrowth of actin cytoskeleton during neuronal differentiation (17Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 60Chen X.Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19901-19905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Using a PI3K inhibitor (LY2940042), Yasuiet al. (17Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) suggest that PI3K regulates an initial marked activation of Rac and its recruitment to the protrusion sites of neurite upon NGF stimulation. Indeed, we found that expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac (RacN17) significantly suppressed neurite outgrowth evoked by p110* and cAMP (data not shown). Rac1N17 contains a mutation at Thr17 and is believed to inhibit the endogenous Rac by reducing its interaction with GDP/GTP exchange factors in a competitive manner. Rac, therefore, might function as one of the downstream targets of PI3K and play an important role in the neurite outgrowth process induced by pPI3K and cAMP. This observation is consistent with previous studies that suggest that the PI3K/Rac pathway is one of the early signals that mediates NGF-induced neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells (17Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 61Posern G. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Feller S.M J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, inhibition of MAPK using PD98059 did not elicit a significant effect on the formation of neurite protrusion or the redistribution of Rac by NGF. The MAPK cascade therefore is not required for initiation of neurite outgrowth but, rather, plays an important role in the extension of neurites (17Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have shown here that upon NGF stimulation, CREB is one of the major factors that functions downstream of the MAPK cascade and works together with the PI3K-mediated pathway to induce neurite outgrowth. Note that the maximal percentage (17.5 ± 2.7%, 3 independent experiments, Fig. 10) of neurite outgrowth induced by 110* plus cAMP is less than that obtained by NGF (Fig. 1). It appears that in addition to the MAPK/CREB- and the PI3K-mediated pathways, another signal(s) evoked by NGF might facilitate the neurite outgrowth process. Also, in addition to Rac, other molecules downstream of PI3K might be required for neurite outgrowth because expression of a constitutively active Rac mutant (Rac1L61; Ref. 31Threadgill R. Bobb K. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) did not result in neurite outgrowth in the absence or presence of cAMP-elevating reagents (data not shown). This finding is in agreement with a previous study using another Rac active mutant (RacV12; Ref. 62Katoh N. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).In the central nervous system, expression of A2A-R is found in many areas of the brain (6Weaver D.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 20: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 63Lee Y-C. Chang C-W., Su, C-W. Lin T-N. Sun S.H. Lai H-L. Chern Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1790-1798PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its dynamic expression during development, A2A-R stimulation has previously been implicated in neuronal differentiation (6Weaver D.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 20: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Using PC12 cells as a neuronal model, we earlier reported that stimulation of A2A-R protected PC12 cells from apoptosis in PKA- and PKC-dependent manners. The MAPK cascade and the PI3K/Akt pathway are not required for the protective effect of A2A-R in PC12 cells (23Huang N-K. Lin Y-W. Huang C-L. Messing R.O. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13838-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An interesting report (46Lee F.S. Chao M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 3555-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) recently described how, in a PC12 variant ((PC12 (615)), which expresses 20-fold more TrkA than that of the parental PC12 cell, A2A-R stimulation causes phosphorylation of NGF receptors (TrkA) and induces activation of Akt (a downstream target of PI3K). Because of the overexpression of TrkA, differentiation of PC12 (615) upon NGF treatment was markedly accelerated (64Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanism mediating the interaction between A2A-R and TrkA in PC12 (615) is largely unclear. It appears that mobilization of intracellular calcium and tyrosine phosphorylation are required for this transactivation of TrkA by adenosine receptors (65Lee F.S. Rajagopal R. Chao M.V. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the PC12 cells employed in the present study, we observed no elevation of intracellular free calcium levels measured by Fura-2 (data not shown) nor activation of Akt upon A2A-R stimulation (23Huang N-K. Lin Y-W. Huang C-L. Messing R.O. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13838-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Such a discrepancy might be due to the fact that various signaling pathways were altered in a TrkA-overexpressing cell lines such as PC12 (615) (64Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Moreover, a selective inhibitor (K252a) of TrkA exerted no effect on neurite outgrowth induced by A2A-R stimulation together with the constitutive activation of PI3K (Fig. 11). Stimulation of A2A-R in parental PC12 cells such as those utilized in the present study, therefore, might promote neurite outgrowth mainly through PKA-CREB mechanisms but not via activation of the receptors (TrkA) of NGF.In the present study, we report that A2A-R stimulation significantly enhances NGF-induced neurite outgrowth at suboptimal concentrations of NGF, implying that A2A-R might be important for neuronal development in vivo. Our finding is consistent with earlier studies that report that adenosine and cAMP increase the rate of NGF-evoked neurite outgrowth (66Huffaker T. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 120: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 67Lambeng N. Michel P.P. Brugg B. Agid Y. Ruberg M. Brain Res. 1999; 821: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The enhancing effect of A2A-R stimulation is likely to be mediated by the PKA/CREB pathway since transient expression of a CREB gain-of-function mutant (Y134F) in PC12 cells resulted in a significant"

We reported a Tat-associated T-cell-derived kinase, which contained CDK2. Here, we provide further evidence that CDK2 is involved in Tat-mediated CTD phosphorylation and in HIV-1 transcription in vitro. Tat-mediated CTD phosphorylation by CDK2 required cysteine 22 in the activation domain of Tat and amino acids 42–72 of Tat.

Cell. 1989; 59: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), which is regulated by phosphorylation of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII consists of heptapeptide YSPTSPS repeats, which are phosphorylated on Ser-2 and Ser-5 residues during transcription (reviewed in Ref. 4Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). CTD is phosphorylated by host cell cycle-dependent protein kinases CDK7 and CDK9 (reviewed in Ref. 5Majello B. Napolitano G. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: 1358-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). General transcription factor TFIIH-associated CDK7 phosphorylates Ser-5 during initiation of transcription, whereas positive transcription elongation factor b-associated CDK9 phosphorylates Ser-2 during elongation of transcription (5Majello B. Napolitano G. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: 1358-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tat associates with the bulge of TAR RNA and also binds to cyclin T1, a cyclin partner of CDK9, which in turn interacts with the loop of TAR RNA (6Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). This allows CDK9/cyclin T1 to be recruited by Tat to the HIV-1 promoter (7Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7056-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).

Although the evidence for the role of CDK9/cyclin T1 in Tat-mediated HIV-1 transcription is overwhelming, our recent data suggest that there may be an additional CTD kinase involved in the Tat response.

Phosphorylated GST-CTD or RNAPII were resolved on 10% or 5% SDS-PAGE correspondingly and subjected to autoradiography and quantitation with a Phosphor Imager (Packard Instruments, Wellesley, MA).

Phosphorylated Tat was resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE and was then subjected to autoradiography and quantitation with the Phosphor Imager (Packard Instruments, Wellesley, MA). HeLa nuclear extract (500 μg) was fractionated on Superose 6 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) in buffer C (40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, concentrated on Microcon YM-10 spin columns (Millipore, Tempe AZ), and analyzed by immunoblotting. The monoclonal antibodies 8WG16 (1.5 mg) against RNAPII were coupled to 0.5 ml ofN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Blue (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The coupled beads were washed and equilibrated with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl). HeLa nuclear extract (750 mg) was loaded on the column. After washing the non-bound proteins with TBS, RNAPII was eluted with 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.4). Assays were performed as we described previously (17Nekhai S. Bottaro D.P. Woldehawariat G. Spellerberg A. Petryshyn R.A. Peptides. 2000; 21: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GST-CTD was labeled by CDK2/cyclin E as described above, except 50 nm ARAFGVPVRTYAHEVVTLWYRA peptide (18Cujec T.P. Okamoto H. Fujinaga K. Meyer J. Chamberlin H. Morgan D.O. Peterlin B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was added to stimulate CTD hyperphosphorylation. The kinase reaction was stopped with 7 mm EDTA prior to the addition of Tat. Then, 50 ng of 32P-labeled GST-CTD was incubated under the condition of the kinase assay, but with purified Tat or Tat peptide for 15 min at 30 °C. Before application on a gel, SDS (2%) was added as described previously (17Nekhai S. Bottaro D.P. Woldehawariat G. Spellerberg A. Petryshyn R.A. Peptides. 2000; 21: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Complexes were resolved on 4% acrylamide gel and then subjected to autoradiography using the Phosphor Imager (Packard Instruments). The HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) template (nucleotides −92 to +180) was amplified by PCR from a plasmid (pDH125) carrying the entire HIV-1 dual tropic HIV-1 genome with the forward primer 5′-biotinylated ACTTTCCGGGGAGGCGTGATC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCCACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTG-3′ (Molecular Resource Facility, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey). The PCR product was phenol/chloroformed and precipitated prior to use. Transcription reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 300 μg of HeLa whole cell extract, 1.0 μg of biotinylated HIV-LTR (−92/+180) DNA, 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) and Tat (1 μg), where indicated, in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 80 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 10 μmZnSO4, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol). For the transcriptional elongating complexes, 0.25 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP were added. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, streptavidin-coated Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences) pre-equilibrated in binding buffer were added to the reactions. The mixtures were further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The immobilized templates were then harvested by centrifugation, and the precipitated complexes were washed extensively with TNE 300 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The purified HIV-1 transcriptional complexes assembled on the immobilized templates were heated for 10 min at 100 °C in SDS-loading buffer. The released proteins were resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Allen, TX). The membrane was analyzed with antibodies against RNAPII, CDK2 and CDK9. The immobilized biotin HIV-1 LTR DNA (0.3 or 3 μg/reaction) was bound to streptavidin-Sepharose beads (high performance, Amersham Biosciences) and used for in vitro transcription, which was performed with DNA and a mixture of basal factors, including HeLa RNAPII (100 ng), e-TFIID (epitope-tagged, 100 ng of TBP and TAF proteins), rTFIIA (40 ng of three recombinant subunits), rTFIIB (1 μl, 20 ng), rTFIIF (50 ng of both subunits), hTFIIH (75 ng from HeLa cells), RHA (50 ng, gift of Dr. C. G. Lee), and p300 (100 ng). In addition, 2.5 mm ATP/CTP/GTP mix and 30 μCi of [32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol, AmershamBiosciences) were added. Also Tat (1 μg) and either CDK9/cyclin T1 (150 ng, gift of Dr. D. Price) or CDK2/cyclin E (200 ng) was added as indicated. The final volume (30 μl) was adjusted with transcription buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 17% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT). 32P-Labeled RNA products were purified and separated on a 6% denaturing acrylamide urea gel, dried, and visualized using PhosphorImager software (AmershamBiosciences). We have recently demonstrated that CDK2/cyclin E phosphorylates CTD (11Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J.C. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem.

Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). The CTD heptapeptide (YSPTSPS) contains two SP repeats that could potentially be recognized by CDK2/cyclin E. To analyze the phosphorylation sites, we used synthetic peptides containing two CTD repeats (hepta-2). We also used mutated CTD peptides containing a Ser-5 mutation in the first hepta repeat (A5), a Ser-2 mutation in the second hepta repeat (A9), a Ser-5 mutation in the second hepta repeat (A12) or two Ser-7 mutations in the first and second hepta peptides (A7/A14) (20Trigon S.

Mutations in Ser-5 of the first repeat (A5) and Ser-2 in the second repeat (A9) greatly reduced (5- to 7-fold) hepta-2 phosphorylation by CDK2/cyclin E (TableI). In contrast, the Ser-5 mutation in the second hepta repeat (A12) or the two Ser-7 mutations in the first and second hepta peptides (A7/A14) only moderately affected (less than 2-fold) hepta-2 phosphorylation (Table I). Addition of Roscovitine, a purine analog that competes with ATP, inhibited hepta-2 phosphorylation in accordance with the earlier observed inhibition of histone H1 phosphorylation by CDK2/cyclin E (21Wang D. de la Fuente C.

The results suggest that CDK2/cyclin E phosphorylates Ser-2 and Ser-5 of CTD heptapeptide repeats in the absence of Tat.Table ICDK2/cyclin E phosphorylates serines 2 and 5 of CTD heptapeptide repeatCTD peptideCDK2/cyclin ECDK2/cyclin E + roscovitine×106Hepta-2:2SPTSPSYSPTSPSY156.80 ± 0.200.09 ± 0.92A5:2SPTAPSYSPTSPSY150.90 ± .070.06 ± 0.21A9:2SPTSPSYAPTSPSY151.20 ± 0.160.04 ± 0.93A12:2SPTSPSYSPTAPSY155.30 ± 0.100.09 ± 0.22A7/A14:2SPTSPAYSPTSPAY154.70 ± 0.030.05 ± 0.38CDK2/cyclin E was immunoprecipitated and incubated with 1 μg of wild type or A5, A9, A12, or A7/A14 mutant CTD peptide.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6958-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effect of Tat on CTD phosphorylation by CDK2/cyclin E. In the absence of Tat, CDK2/cyclin E poorly phosphorylated recombinant GST-CTD (Fig.1A, lane 1). Tat dramatically enhanced both hypo- and hyperphosphorylation of GST-CTD by CDK2/cyclin E in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1A, lanes 2–4). The hyperphosphorylated form of CTD (CTDo), appeared as an apparent higher molecular weight band on SDS-PAGE, whereas the hypophosphorylated CTD (CTDa), migrated together with non-phosphorylated CTD (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–4). Mutation in cysteine-22 (C22G) rendered Tat inactive to stimulate phosphorylation of CTD by CDK2 (Fig. 1A,lanes 5–7). In a control experiment, Tat stimulated GST-CTD phosphorylation by CDK9/cyclin T1 in a concentration-dependent manner (not shown) in accordance with the earlier report (24Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J. Thompson N.E. Jones K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6958-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We subsequently examined the effect of Tat on phosphorylation of RNAPII CTD. Again, CDK2/cyclin E did not phosphorylate RNAPII CTD in the absence of Tat (Fig. 1B,lane 5). Addition of Tat stimulated RNAPII CTD phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1B, lanes 6–8). In this experiment RNAPII CTDo and RNAPII CTDa could not be resolved due to the fewer number of CTD repeats in yeast RNAPII (4Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results presented in this section indicate that Tat dramatically induced CDK2 to phosphorylate CTD. A recent report suggested that two domains of Tat, the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–48) and an arginine-rich motif (ARM, amino acids 49–57), are required to hyperphosphorylate CTD by CDK9/cyclin T1 (24Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J. Thompson N.E. Jones K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6958-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We analyzed the requirement of Tat domains for CTD phosphorylation by CDK2 using chemically synthesized peptides corresponding to several domains of Tat. The N-terminal domain of Tat (amino acids 1–49) did not stimulate CTD phosphorylation (Fig.2, lanes 5–7). Tat with the truncation of first 42 amino acids (Tat 42–72) stimulated CTD hypo- and hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 2, lanes 8–10), although to a lesser extent as compared with the effect of the full-length Tat (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4). To analyze whether a part of the Tat 42–72 peptide could also stimulate CTD phosphorylation, we used peptides that spanned the 42–72 sequence. A peptide containing only the RNA-binding domain of Tat (Tat-(49–60)) did not stimulate CTD hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 2, lanes 14–16). Peptides flanking the RNA-binding domain (Tat 42–54 and Tat 56–70) did not have a stimulatory effect either (Fig. 3,lanes 11–13 and 17–19). Therefore, Tat 42–72 is the minimal activation domain required to achieve CTD phosphorylation.Figure 3CDK2/cyclin E phosphorylates Tat.A, CDK2/cyclin E was incubated with 100, 200, and 400 ng of wild type Tat (lanes 2–4).

Only Tat-(11–24) and Tat-(36–72) inhibited phosphorylation of wt Tat by CDK2/cyclin E. Lane 1, control without competitor. Kinase reactions were resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE and analyzed on a PhosphorImager.

Virol. 1995; 69: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study if CDK2/cyclin E dynamically interacted with Tat we analyzed whether Tat was phosphorylated by CDK2. We discovered that Tat was phosphorylated by CDK2/cyclin E in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3A, lanes 2–4). To analyze which domain of Tat may form dynamic contacts with CDK2/cyclin E during phosphorylation reaction, a competition assay was performed with the excess of Tat peptides, which spanned different domains of Tat. The peptide containing amino acids 11–24 of Tat (Tat-(11–24)) completely blocked Tat phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, lane 3). In contrast, the peptide containing amino acids 6–14 of Tat (Tat-(6–14)) was not inhibitory. Therefore amino acids 15–24 are critical for the CDK2/cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation of Tat. Neither Tat-(49–60) nor Tat-(56–70) interfered with Tat phosphorylation (Fig. 3B,lane 4 and 5). We observed that Tat-(36–72) inhibited Tat phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, lane 6). Therefore, we concluded that amino acids 36–49 of Tat also dynamically interact with CDK2/cyclin E during phosphorylation reaction. Taken together, our observations demonstrate that CDK2/cyclin E dynamically interacts with the N-terminal domain of Tat. It has been suggested that Tat binds to RNAPII CTD through the RNA-binding arginine-rich motif of Tat, based on the observation that TAR RNA inhibited Tat-mediated CTD phosphorylation by CDK9/cyclin T1 (24Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J. Thompson N.E. Jones K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6958-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore it was of interest to directly investigate binding of Tat to CTD. For this purpose, we utilized a modified gel shift assay that was previously developed to study the binding of TAR RNA to short peptides derived from double-stranded RNA-activated kinase (17Nekhai S. Bottaro D.P. Woldehawariat G. Spellerberg A. Petryshyn R.A. Peptides. 2000; 21: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the modified assay, we analyzed retardation of phosphorylated CTD as a function of Tat binding. CTD migrated on 4% polyacrylamide gel as a diffuse band (Fig.4A, lane 1). Addition of full-length Tat resulted in a dose-dependent shift of CTD (Fig. 4A, lanes 2–4). Mutation in the N-terminal domain of Tat (C22G) reduced the efficiency of the shift (Fig. 4A, lanes 5–7). Truncation of first N-terminal 36 or 42 amino acids significantly reduced the ability of mutated Tat to bind to CTD (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and4). Further truncated Tat-(56–70) or isolated RNA-binding domain of Tat-(49–60) did not bind to CTD (Fig. 4B,lanes 5 and 6). However, the isolated activation domain of Tat, Tat-(1–44) bound to CTD (Fig. 4C, lane 5), although less efficiently than full-length Tat (Fig.4C, lane 2). Because the N-terminal peptides, Tat-(6–14) and Tat-(11–24), did not bind CTD (Fig. 4C,lanes 3 and 4), then amino acids 24–44 may contain a CTD binding site in addition to the one or more sites located in the amino acids 42–72. Therefore, Tat interacts with CTD via two binding sites located within amino acids 24–72. To assess whether CDK2 is part of a transcription complex we analyzed whether CDK2 is associated with complexes that contain RNAPII. Following fractionation of HeLa nuclear extract on Superose 6 size exclusion column, CDK2 was found to be present in the high molecular weight fractions that also contained RNAPII (Fig.5A, fractions 15–19). To assess whether CDK2 and RNA PII were part of the same macromolecular complex, an affinity column that immobilized 8WG16 anti-RNAPII monoclonal antibodies was utilized. The HeLa nuclear extract was applied to the affinity column and the retained proteins were eluted with sodium acetate buffer at pH 3.4. Immunoblotting analysis showed that both RNAPII and CDK2 were partially retained by the column, whereas the α-subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF-2, which served as a negative control, was not retained at all (Fig. 5B). The data suggest that RNAPII and a species of CDK2 are part of the same macromolecular complex and that CDK2 could be involved in the control of RNAPII-mediated transcription. To analyze whether CDK2 is part of the preinitiation complex assembled on HIV-1 promoter, preinitiation complex was formed on a biotinylated HIV-1 LTR template that was subsequently immobilized on streptavidin-agarose beads. The retained proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting analysis. RNAPII and CDK9, but not CDK2, associated with the HIV-1 LTR template (Fig.6, lane 6). Addition of Tat did not stimulate association of CDK2 with the HIV-1 LTR template (Fig.6, lanes 3 and 5). To analyze whether CDK2 associates with elongation complex, we performed a similar experiment, except that GTP, CTP, and ATP were added to the transcription reaction to promote initial assembly of the transcriptional apparatus. Also Tat was added to the reaction. In the absence of UTP, RNAPII is paused on the fifth nucleotide of TAR RNA. Analysis of proteins associated with this paused RNAPII complex showed that both CDK2 was present in the paused complex (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 4). These observations suggest that CDK2 is present in early elongation complex. The requirement of CDK2 in HIV-1 transcription was tested in a reconstituted transcription reaction. The reaction was assembled with biotinylated HIV-1 LTR template immobilized on streptavidin-Sepharose beads and with a mixture of basal factors, including RNAPII, e-TFIID (TBP and TAF proteins), rTFIIA, rTFIIB, rTFIIF, hTFIIH, hRHA, and rp300. Under these conditions, we observed very little activated transcription with basal factors (Fig.7, lane 1). Strikingly, addition of recombinant CDK2/cyclin E stimulated activated transcription to about 20-fold (Fig. 7, lane 2). Addition of CDK9/cyclin T1 stimulated activated transcription to about 9-fold (Fig.7, lane 3). Next we analyzed whether CDK2/cyclin E present in HeLa nuclear extract was essential for Tat-dependent transcription on immobilized template. Addition of Tat to HeLa nuclear extract stimulated transcription 65-fold (Fig. 7, compare lane 5 with lane 4). Immunodepletion of CDK2/cyclin E from the HeLa nuclear extract completely abolished the Tat-media"

The mechanism by which purified HSP70s immunize is relatively well understood due to (i) the discovery of CD91, its receptor on antigen-presenting cells (4Binder R.J. Han D.K. Srivastava P.K. Nat.

The current view is that HSP-peptide complexes released from stressed and dead cells are endocytosed by professional antigen-presenting cells through binding to an HSP receptor (CD91) and are represented by MHC-I molecules in a proteasome and TAP-dependent manner (4Binder R.J. Han D.K. Srivastava P.K. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 5Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Castellino et al. have shown that one Hsp70-chaperoned peptide can be cross-presented on MHC-I molecules in a TAP-independent manner (10Castellino F. Boucher P.E. Eichelberg K. Mayhew M. Rothman J.E. Houghton A.N. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). At this point it is unclear whether the processing of this peptide is an exception or if it represents a significant pathway of presentation of antigens chaperoned by Hsp70. It is classically accepted that after uptake of Hsp70-peptide complexes, the antigen-presenting cells migrate to the lymphatic organs where they prime CD8+ T lymphocytes. Importantly, HSPs that chaperone non-immunogenic peptides and “empty” HSPs cannot immunize (11Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Therefore, the biochemical mechanism by which immunogenic peptides associate with HSPs is of primary importance for the initiation of a specific immune response (12Menoret, A., Chaillot, D., Callahan, M., and Jacquin, C. (2002)Int. J. Hyperthermia, in pressGoogle Scholar). The general chaperoning features of HSPs have been studied in detail, mainly in terms of their ability to release their polypeptide substrate (7Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 13Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). However, the initial trigger for substrate binding has not been clearly established. Additionally, because some HSPs are stress-inducible, like Hsp70, whereas some are constitutively expressed, like Hsc70, one may ask if their respective chaperoning functions are identical and whether they are influenced by the biochemical status of the stressed cell (14Callahan, M., Jacquin, C., Chaillot, D., Clark, P., and Menoret, A. (2001) 11th International Meeting for Immunology Stockholm, July 22–27, Abstr. 6459Google Scholar). Remarkably, the common denominator in all the Hsp70-inducing stresses is oxidation of the cytosol (12Menoret, A., Chaillot, D., Callahan, M., and Jacquin, C. (2002)Int. J. Hyperthermia, in pressGoogle Scholar, 14Callahan, M., Jacquin, C., Chaillot, D., Clark, P., and Menoret, A. (2001) 11th International Meeting for Immunology Stockholm, July 22–27, Abstr. 6459Google Scholar). The dramatic change in the redox status of the cytosol is characterized by an increase in permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane (15Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar), oxidation and depletion of non-oxidized glutathione, NAD(P)H2, and hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species (16Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Direct chemically induced oxidative stress can also act as a signal for the induction of Hsp70 through oxidation of protein thiols, formation of a non-native disulfide bond, and glutathione depletion (17Liu H. Lightfoot R. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4805-4812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18McDuffee A.T. Senisterra G. Huntley S. Lepock J.R. Sekhar K.R. Meredith M.J. Borrelli M.J. Morrow J.D. Freeman M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 171: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Inversely, dithiothreitol (DTT), among other reducing agents, inhibits the heat-induced synthesis of Hsp70, whereas oxidized DTT is ineffective (19Huang L.E. Zhang H. Bae S.W. Liu A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30718-30725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these reports illustrate that the raison d’être of the Hsp70 is strongly linked to an environment more oxidative than the normally reducing cytosol. We previously showed that tumor immunogenicity co-segregates with the expression of Hsp70 but not Hsc70 (14Callahan, M., Jacquin, C., Chaillot, D., Clark, P., and Menoret, A. (2001) 11th International Meeting for Immunology Stockholm, July 22–27, Abstr. 6459Google Scholar, 20Menoret A. Patry Y. Burg C. Le Pendu J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 740-747PubMed Google Scholar). The immunological importance of the inducible Hsp70 has also been shown by hyperthermia (21Clark P. Menoret A. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and transfection (22Melcher A. Todryk S. Hardwick N. Ford M. Jacobson M. Vile R.G. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 23Wells A.D. Rai S.K. Salvato M.S. Band H. Malkovsky M. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which expression of Hsp70 but not Hsc70 increases tumor immunogenicity has not yet been unraveled. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that Hsp70 and Hsc70 acquire immunogenic peptides differently during oxidative stress. We have shown that the peptide binding capacities of both chaperones are minimal under reducing conditions but optimal under moderately oxidative conditions. Moreover, Hsp70 is quantitatively a better peptide binder than Hsc70 through out all the conditions tested. The binding of peptides to HSP70s is limited in reducing conditions; however, once the HSP70-peptide complexes are formed, they are poorly dissociated by reducing agents. Mouse Hsp70 and Hsc70 were purified as previously described (24Peng P. Menoret A. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 204: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli (BL21LDE3 LysS, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) transformed with full-length mouse Hsp70 cDNA and full-length mouse Hsc70 cDNA into pM70–1 vector or BALB/cJ mouse liver tissues were homogenized and a 100,000 × g supernatant was obtained. The samples were applied to an ADP-agarose column (Sigma), washed and eluted with buffer D (20 mm Tris acetate, 20 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, pH7.5) containing either 10 mm ADP or ATP. Eluted fractions were applied on a DEAE column and washed and eluted with 20 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The bacterial Hsp70, DnaK, eluting at NaCl concentrations higher than 150 mm, did not contaminate the preparation. 2M. K. Callahan, D. Chaillot, C. Jacquin, P. R. Clark, and A. Meánoret, unpublished data.Purity and homogeneity of Hsc70 and Hsp70 preparations were assessed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Mouse Hsc70 purified from mouse liver tissue and unmodified full-length recombinant mouse Hsc70 purified fromE. Coli were compared and found identical in term of DNA sequence and biochemical properties including apparent molecular size, secondary structure defined by circular dichroism, peptide binding activity, ATPase activity, and foldase activity (data not shown). Proteins were submitted to reducing or oxidative treatment as indicated in the figures legends, mixed with non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gels were Coomassie Blue-stained, dried, and exposed for autoradiography. The MHC-I epitopes, HA518 (NH2IYSTVASSLCOOH, H2-Kd-restricted) and AH1 (NH2SPSYVYHQFCOOH, H2-Ld-restricted) were purchased from Genemed Synthesis Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), iodinated as described before (25Menoret A. Bell G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 237: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), mixed with the Hsc70, Hsp70, or transferrin (Sigma) in buffer E (20 mm phosphate, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) alone or in the presence of reducing or oxidative agents, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C as described elsewhere (24Peng P. Menoret A. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 204: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Purified HSP70s were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in plain buffer E, in buffer E with 10 mm ATP, and in buffer E with 10 mm DTT. The peptides were recovered by filtration on biomax-10 (10 kDa exclusion limit) (Millipore, Bedford, MA), loaded on a C18 column (the Nest Group, Southborough, MA) in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted by a linear acetonitrile gradient as described previously (26Menoret A. Peng P. Srivastava P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hsp70 and Hsc70 (10 μm) were analyzed by circular dichroism on JASCO J-175 at room temperature in CD buffer (5 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaF, pH 7.0) under concentrations of DTT varying from 0 to 1 mm. We have investigated the ability of Hsp70 and Hsc70 to bind peptides by incubating purified proteins with a molar excess of radiolabeled peptides (protein:peptide ratio = 1:20) and traced the presence of radioactivity associated with 70-kDa proteins by gel electrophoresis as previously described (24Peng P. Menoret A. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 204: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 27Blachere N.E., Li, Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). We observed by autoradiography that tissue-derived and recombinant Hsc70 and Hsp70 associated with peptides, whereas a non-chaperone protein of similar molecular weight, transferrin, did not (Fig.1). Quantification of the radiolabeled peptides migrating in the area of 70-kDa indicates that Hsp70 reproducibly binds more peptide than Hsc70 irrespectively of the buffer used for the complexing reaction (data not shown). Surprisingly, association of peptides with both Hsp70 and Hsc70 is promoted in oxidative buffer and considerably reduced by addition of 0.1 mm of reducing agents, such as DTT (Fig. 1A,lanes 5–8) and 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME) (Fig.1A, lanes 9–11), in the reaction mixture. In addition, tissue-derived and recombinant Hsc70s peptide binding capacities follow the same patterns in the different conditions tested (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–2, 5–6, and9–10). We took advantage of the presence of peptides bound to Hsp70/Hsc70 after ADP purification and their absence after ATP purification (24Peng P. Menoret A. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 204: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) to analyze the influence of endogenous peptides bound to HSP70s on their peptide binding capacities in the presence of an excess of exogenous radiolabeled peptides under various conditions (Fig. 1B). We observed identical binding patterns between ADP- and ATP-purified HSP70s, with the difference that empty ATP-purified Hsp70/Hsc70 bind more peptides than the ADP-purified ones in every condition tested. We have determined the quantity of peptide bound per mole of Hsp70 and Hsc70 by cutting the 70-kDa band out of the gels and counting in a γ-counter. Knowing the specific radioactivity of the peptides (cpm/mol of peptide) and assuming that the stoichiometry of binding is only one peptide per molecule of HSP70 as suggested by crystallographic study of Hsp70 peptide binding domain (8Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), we have calculated that a maximum of 25% of chaperones are loaded with exogenous peptides (ATP-purified Hsp70 in oxidative conditions, Fig. 1C). However, the same sample treated with DTT binds only 13% of peptides, confirming that Hsp70 binds peptide more efficiently under oxidative conditions (p < 0.005; probability associated with a Student’s paired t-test). Additionally, we measured that, as shown in Fig. 1, A andB, Hsp70 binds more peptides than Hsc70 under the same conditions (13% instead of 25%, p < 0.01) and that this percentage decreases in reducing milieu from 13 to 5% (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1C). The binding of peptides to HSP70s is probably not optimum under our experimental conditions, likely due to the non-physiological parameters of the experiment, the lack of co-chaperones, and the stringency of the SDS-PAGE analysis. Similar binding has been reported using different loading conditions and peptides with high affinity for Hsp70 (10Castellino F. Boucher P.E. Eichelberg K. Mayhew M. Rothman J.E. Houghton A.N. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The ability of Hsp70 and Hsc70 to bind peptides under a broad range of redox conditions has been tested using the two immunogenic peptides AH1,NH2SPSYVYHQFCOOH, and HA518,NH2IYSTVASSLCOOH. We first observed that under highly reducing conditions (1 mm DTT; Fig. 2A, lane 1) Hsp70-peptide complex formation was weak but clearly detectable. On the contrary, in the same conditions, no peptide could be detected in association with Hsc70. By extending the comparison between Hsp70 and Hsc70 under increasingly oxidative conditions, we observed a similar but shifted pattern of binding. For every concentration of DTT varying on a logarithmic scale from 1 to 10−3 mm, Hsp70 binds more peptide than Hsc70 (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–5). A comparable shifted pattern was observed with another reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol (data not shown). Additionally, we observed that the binding of peptides under increased oxidative conditions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide was not more pronounced than in plain (non-reducing) buffer (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–6). To avoid a misrepresentation of the radioactivity intensity, the autoradiographies were exposed for the same length of time such that the maximum nonspecific binding ever observed with the control protein transferrin was of similar intensity on every autoradiogram. A third peptide, precursor of the H2-Kb-restricted immunodominant epitope of the vesicular stomatitis virus nucleoprotein (NH2SLSDLRGYVYQGLKSGNVSCOOH) was also tested and showed an identical binding pattern under reducing and oxidative conditions compared with AH1 and HA518 (data not shown). The observation that three peptides of unrelated sequences, sizes, and charges behave similarly argues in favor of a structural difference between Hsp70 and Hsc70 in redox conditions rather than a substrate-directed phenomenon. In the previous section, we observed that Hsp70 and Hsc70 chaperoning was minimal under reducing conditions and progressively increased as the milieu became more oxidative (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we investigated possible changes in Hsp70 and Hsc70 secondary structures that may support the increased acquisition of peptides under oxidative stress. We visualized highly purified Hsp70 and Hsc70 (see inset in Fig. 2B) by circular dichroism (CD) in conditions varying from reducing (i.e. high DTT concentration), possibly mimicking a resting cytosol, to more oxidative (i.e. low DTT concentration) that may reflect an oxidative stress (see “Discussion”). The absolute molar ellipticity, i.e. the percentage of amino acids participating in the formation of α-helixes and β-sheets, was similar but minimal for Hsc70 and Hsp70 in presence of 1 mmDTT (Fig. 2B, left panel) probably due to a reversible and mild denaturation. In a more oxidative milieu (0.01 and 0.001 mm DTT), we reproducibly observed a more dramatic gain of secondary structure for Hsp70 than for Hsc70 (Fig.2B, middleand right panels). Identical results have been obtained with unmodified full-length Hsc70 purified from E. Coli and with Hsc70 purified from mouse liver. The minimal absolute molar ellipticity of Hsp70 and Hsc70 under highly reducing conditions suggests that they adopted a conformation with less structured domains that may not easily accept peptides. Conversely, in the presence of more oxidative buffer the proteins may adopt a more structured conformation favorable to association with peptides. In addition, the higher gain in secondary structure of Hsp70 over Hsc70 during oxidation supports the notion that Hsp70 is a chaperone more responsive to environmental stresses than Hsc70. By analogy with the required role of ATP for the release of peptides bound to HSP70s and based on our observation that HSP70s do not chaperone peptides under a strongly reducing environment, we investigated whether a reducing agent may dissociate HSP70-peptide complexes. In a previous study we demonstrated that iodinated synthetic peptides complexed in vitro with HSP70s (using the same method as in the present work) can be dissociated by purification on ATP-agarose but not ADP-agarose chromatography, confirming the ATP-dependent release of HSP70s substrate (24Peng P. Menoret A. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 204: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In Fig.3A, we have tested the reversibility of peptide binding by a reducing agent. The experiment was designed such that the oxidative buffer used for a first incubation became reducing for a second successive complexing reaction by addition of an excess of DTT. By doing so, we could compare the sequence of oxidation/reduction in multi-step complexing reactions ending with identical buffers. We observed that the Hsc70-peptide complexes formed during a first oxidative incubation (1 mmH2O2) were not dissociated by a further incubation in the presence of an excess of reducing agent (10 mm DTT) (Fig. 3A, lane 2). As a control, we showed that peptides incubated with Hsc70 in a reducing buffer (1 mm H2O2 + 10 mm DTT) did not associate with the chaperone protein (Fig.3A, lane 1). Note that the final buffer composition of these two reactions was identical and that the net redox potential was reducing. A complete parallel observation was made for the inducible Hsp70, although the intensity of binding was superior than for the Hsc70, and some peptides remained associated with Hsp70, even in reducing conditions (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and5). This experiment demonstrated that the initial binding of peptides to Hsp70 and Hsc70 could not be easily reversed in the presence of reducing buffer. Additionally, the lack of binding of peptides in 1 mm DTT (as shown in Fig. 2A) is reversible by incubation with an excess of oxidative agent (10 mm H2O2) (Fig. 3A,lanes 3 and 6). Therefore, the lack of association of peptides to Hsp/Hsc70 in reducing conditions is not due to an irreversible denaturation of their peptide binding sites. Moreover, the lack of dissociation of peptides from Hsp70 and Hsc70 upon addition of reducing agent argues also against intrachain disulfide bound formation that would define a domain holding the peptides (see “Discussion”). We then considered the status of naturally bound peptide-HSP complexes. We tested this phenomenon with mouse tissue-derived Hsc70s isolated with their naturally bound peptides as demonstrated previously (11Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Hsc70 treated for 16 h at 37 °C in ATP-containing buffer released a heterogeneous population of peptides that were visualized at 214 nm. On the contrary, treatment with 10 mm DTT for 16 h at 37 °C induced a marginal release of peptides (Fig.3B, top right panel). Comparison of the chromatogram areas indicated that Hsc70 incubated with ATP released between 4.5× more peptide (6.7× more in a second independent experiment) than if incubated with DTT (peptide release was measured as area between buffer and treated sample). It is noteworthy that Hsc70 incubated in oxidative buffer overnight did not release peptides at all (Fig. 3B, oxidative treatment) confirming the stability of the chaperoning in such environment. This suggests that Hsc70 adopts a conformation favorable for a slow release of their substrates in reducing conditions, whereas the peptides remained tightly bound to HSP70s in an oxidative milieu. In this study we have tested the hypothesis that cellular stress involving oxidative conditions influences binding of immunogenic peptides to Hsp70 and Hsc70. Our experiments show that acquisition of peptides by HSP70s is enhanced under oxidative environment and limited under reducing conditions. This phenomenon has been tested for two HSPs, Hsp70 and Hsc70, through a broad range of redox conditions and with three peptides of unrelated sequences. Second, we have shown that Hsp70 is a better peptide binder than Hsc70 in every condition tested. Third, we have demonstrated that peptides bound in oxidative conditions are not released by addition of reducing buffer. These observations have important biochemical and immunological implications in that they link oxidation to immunogenicity. The partial loss of secondary structure of the chaperones in reducing conditions, as shown by circular dichroism, is likely to alter the accessibility of the substrates to the peptide binding site of HSP70s. In a reducing milieu, such as the resting cytosol, HSP70s possibly adopt a conformation in which the peptide binding site of the chaperones is poorly accessible to the substrate. Conversely, upon oxidation of the milieu due to an exogenous stress, the gain of the HSP70s secondary structure is translated into a better accessibility of peptides to the peptide-binding pocket and therefore to a more effective chaperoning. This view is compatible with the general concept that HSP70s associate with polypeptides that unfold during oxidative stress, helping them to regain a functional structure or directing them to a degradation pathway (28Feder M.E. Hofmann G.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 243-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar). This general biochemical mechanism will have important immunological consequences. First, the oxidative stress induces Hsp70 expression, increasing the net quantity of chaperones that can associate immunogenic peptides. Additionally, upon oxidation both Hsp70 and Hsc70 will carry a larger population of peptides. The high stability of the HSP70-peptide complexes formed under oxidation is compatible with their efficient delivery to the antigen, presenting cells that will prime CD8+ T lymphocytes. It has also been proposed and indirectly shown that HSP70s participate in the processing of the endogenous antigen to the MHC-I pathway (23Wells A.D. Rai S.K. Salvato M.S. Band H. Malkovsky M. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Srivastava P.K. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 1054-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Binder R.J. Blachere N.E. Srivastava P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17163-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, an increase in the quantity of peptides chaperoned by HSP70s under oxidative stress may affect direct antigen presentation by MHC I molecules. The constitutive Hsc70 and inducible Hsp70 are generally considered, with rare exceptions (31Angelidis C.E. Lazaridis I. Pagoulatos G.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), to be equivalent proteins exhibiting functional similarities. However, although the overall structures of these two chaperones are almost identical, they do differ in some specific areas (12Menoret, A., Chaillot, D., Callahan, M., and Jacquin, C. (2002)Int. J. Hyperthermia, in pressGoogle Scholar, 14Callahan, M., Jacquin, C., Chaillot, D., Clark, P., and Menoret, A. (2001) 11th International Meeting for Immunology Stockholm, July 22–27, Abstr. 6459Google Scholar). Their carboxyl-terminal domains (amino acid 510–641) differ considerably in structure (“only” 69% amino acid identity). This domain may stabilize the peptide-binding pocket more efficiently in Hsp70 than in Hsc70 and therefore possibly regulates differently the access of the substrates to the peptide-binding pocket. By analogy with the activation of Hsp33 through oxidation of its cysteines (32Barbirz S. Jakob U. Glocker M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18759-18766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 34Raman B. Siva Kumar L.V. Ramakrishna T. Mohan Rao C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it is also possible that oxidized Hsp70 forms intrachain disulfide bonds. We have, in another publication (12Menoret, A., Chaillot, D., Callahan, M., and Jacquin, C. (2002)Int. J. Hyperthermia, in pressGoogle Scholar, 14Callahan, M., Jacquin, C., Chaillot, D., Clark, P., and Menoret, A. (2001) 11th International Meeting for Immunology Stockholm, July 22–27, Abstr. 6459Google Scholar), calculated the theoretical disulfide bond-forming potentials of the cysteines of HSP70s and reported that one cysteine (position 603) is hyper-reactive in Hsp70, whereas none are in Hsc70. In theory, Cys603 of Hsp70 could easily form a disulfide bond with another reactive cysteine on Hsp70 or on another protein. However, no evidence of Hsp70 intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds have been detected. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that under oxidative stress, Cys603 is involved into the overall stabilization of Hsp70 by forming a labile interaction with a poorly reactive site localized on another domain of the protein. At this point, genetic manipulations of Hsp70 are required to determine the amino acids involved in its reactivity to the oxidating milieu and its improved substrate binding ability by comparison with Hsc70. How do the changes in structure measured by CD relate to the physiological state? The redox potentials of Hsp70 and Hsc70 are unknown at this time. Hence, we can compare the previous example of Hsp33, a chaperone activated under oxidative stress that set a precedent for understanding the physiology of this phenomenon. It has been reported that under stress, the redox potential increases from −250/280 mV to about −150 mV, showing that even under oxidative stress the environment stays globally reducing (35Ruddock L.W. Klappa P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R400-R402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The reported redox potential of Hsp33, −170 mV, is close to an oxidative cytosol, explaining the very low activity of Hsp33 under resting cellular condition (33Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Our prediction would be that, like for Hsp33 their values lie closer to the redox of a stressed than a resting cytosol. Because our circular dichroism data indicates that Hsp70 is more reactive to oxidative conditions than Hsc70 we anticipate that the redox potential of Hsp70 would be higher than that of Hsc70. Our previous observation that immunogenicity of tumor cells co-segregate with the expression of Hsp70 but not with Hsc70 was surprising due to their high structural homology (12Menoret, A., Chaillot, D., Callahan, M., and Jacquin, C. (2002)Int. J. Hyperthermia, in pressGoogle Scholar, 14Callahan, M., Jacquin, C., Chaillot, D., Clark, P., and Menoret, A.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 740-747PubMed Google Scholar), implying that subtle differences between these two HSPs may have dramatic biological consequences. The observation that Hsp70 associates with immunogenic peptides quantitatively and qualitatively better than Hsc70 in all of the conditions tested brings a new element in trying to explain the different immunological properties of these two chaperones. It suggests that Hsp70 could be a chaperone designed to preferentially capture and deliver polypeptidic information to the immune system under stress.

CsA prevents the activation of lymphokine genes essential for T cell proliferation by disrupting calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways in leukocytes. Although pharmacologic studies of CsA have focused primarily on T cell responses, there is emerging evidence that this agent may exert potent effects on blood vessels, where it disturbs production of nitric oxide (NO) ultimately promoting arterial hypertension, inducing long-term vascular dysfunction, and contributing to obliterative vasculopathy in chronic transplant rejection (1Gao S.Z.

Because of the powerful immunosuppressive effect of CsA, and its success in the prevention of transplant rejection, this agent underwent extensive clinical evaluation for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Initial studies focused on short courses of high-dose intravenous CsA therapy, and have demonstrated impressive success for the treatment of fulminant colitis and the healing of refractory Crohn's disease fistulas. However, multiple attempts to convert high-dose CsA to an oral maintenance strategy, akin to the success in transplant immunosuppression, have paradoxically failed to demonstrate efficacy (5Brynskov J.

The precise cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie this lack of efficacy in the long term treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation have remained undefined, and may result from the emerging profile of adverse effects of CsA on nonimmune cell populations, including the vascular endothelium. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature are now appreciated to play a central “gatekeeper” role in inflammation through their ability to recruit circulating immune cells into tissues (12Pober J.S. Cotran R.S. Transplantation. 1990; 50: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 13Granger D.N. Kubes P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 662-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Microvascular endothelial activation and adhesion of circulating immune cells is an early and rate-limiting step in the initiation and maintenance of the inflammatory response. Advances in vascular biology have defined an important regulatory role for NO within the blood vessel during inflammation (14Kurose I. Wolf R. Grisham M.B., Aw, T.Y. Specian R.D. Granger D.N. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), where endothelial-derived NO maintains vascular homeostasis through its ability to down-regulate endothelial cell activation and leukocyte binding (15De Caterina R.

The effect of CsA on microvascular endothelial cells, specifically their ability to regulate leukocyte adhesion during inflammatory activation, is currently undefined. The signaling pathways that mediate the inflammatory activation of nonimmune cells, including endothelial cells, are presently under intense investigation. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a conserved family of eukaryotic signal transduction molecules known to play a major role in the activation of multiple cell types in response to inflammatory stimuli (20Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 808-869Crossref Scopus (2833) Google Scholar, 21Gao F. Yue T.L. Shi D.W. Christopher T.A. Lopez B.L. Ohlstein E.H. Barone F.C. Ma X.L. Cardiovasc.

Free Radical Res. 2001; 35: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The MAPK superfamily is comprised of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2; p42/44 MAPK), stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK; c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)), and p38 MAPK. MAPKs are known to play a key role in the activation of endothelial cells, leading to an inflammatory phenotype characterized by increased expression of cell adhesion molecules, and enhanced leukocyte binding (24Yorek M.A. Dunlap J.A. Metabolism. 2002; 51: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Rasmussen L.M. Hansen P.R. Nabipour M.T. Olesen P. Kristiansen M.T. Ledet T. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of multiple proinflammatory genes in endothelial cells is regulated by the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB) (26Ye R.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 839-848PubMed Google Scholar, 27Murley J.S. Kataoka Y. Hallahan D.E. Roberts J.C. Grdina D.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1426-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The impact of CsA on signal transduction pathways in nonimmune cell types is distinct from its well characterized immunosuppressive effect on immune cells (28Ho S. Clipstone N. Timmermann L. Northrop J. Graef I. Fiorentino D. Nourse J. Crabtree G.R. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 80: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). However, the effect of CsA on tissue-specific microvascular endothelial activation has not been defined. We characterized the effect of CsA on the activation of human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC), the microvascular population that mediates leukocyte recruitment during chronic intestinal inflammation in IBD. We hypothesized that CsA would exert a deleterious, “proinflammatory” effect on HIMEC, through selective effects on intracellular signaling cascades during inflammatory activation, leading to a loss of NO production and enhanced leukocyte adhesion. To test this hypothesis, we utilized primary cultures of HIMEC to directly assess the effect of CsA on endothelial-leukocyte interaction. We focused experiments on the effect of CsA on two critical intracellular mechanisms that regulate the inflammatory activation of HIMEC, specifically the expression of iNOS and cell adhesion molecules, as well as the signal transduction pathways that underlie inflammatory activation of these cells. The results of this investigation demonstrate that CsA inhibits the production of iNOS-derived NO in activated HIMEC, normally a key down-regulatory mechanism for limiting endothelial activation induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, CsA differentially inhibited signal transduction pathways during HIMEC activation, blocking activation of p38 MAPK, a major mechanism for iNOS gene transcription (29Da Silva J. Pierrat B. Mary J.L. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28373-28380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), ultimately resulting in a paradoxical, proinflammatory effect of this normally powerful immunosuppressive drug. Macroscopically normal mucosal specimens for HIMEC isolation were obtained from patients undergoing scheduled bowel resection. The use of discarded human tissues was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Medical College of Wisconsin. HIMEC isolation was adapted from dermal microvascular endothelium (30Marks R.M. Czerniecki M. Penny R. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1985; 21: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Binion D.G. West G.A. Ina K. Ziats N.P. Emancipator S.N. Fiocchi C. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1895-1907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In brief, the surgical specimen was rinsed and full-thickness samples of intestinal tissue were obtained. Mucosal strips were dissected, washed, digested in type II collagenase solution (Worthington) and were then subjected to mechanical compression to express clusters of microvascular endothelial cells, which were plated onto fibronectin-coated tissue culture dishes, and grown in HIMEC medium (MCDB 131 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and endothelial cell growth supplement (Upstate Biochemical, Lake Placid, NY)). After 7–10 days, microvascular endothelial cell clusters were physically isolated, and a pure culture was obtained. Endothelial cultures were verified by modified lipoprotein uptake (Dil-ac-LDL, Biomedical Technology, Inc., Stoughton, MA) and expression of factor VIII-associated antigen (32Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All HIMEC experiments were carried out using cells obtained between passages 8 and 14. HIMEC isolates from resected normal intestinal tissue from six patients were utilized for this study. U937 cells, a human monocyte-like cell line, originally derived from a histiocytic lymphoma, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in culture with RPMI 1640 medium and 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells underwent three passages per week and were used between passages 5 and 10, once re-established in culture. CsA (Alexis, San Diego, CA) was added to the endothelial cultures for specified time periods at a concentration of 1–10 μm. Additional immunomodulators were tested including FK506 (1 μm; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and rapamycin (1 μm; Calbiochem). The contribution of signal transduction pathways to HIMEC activation and gene expression were defined using specific inhibitors, including: p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (10 μg/ml; Calbiochem); p42/44 MAPK inhibitor PD98059, which inhibits MEK (7 μg/ml; Calbiochem); the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein (1 μg/ml; Sigma) and herbimycin (1 μm;Calbiochem); the antioxidant curcumin (10 μm; Sigma); and the inhibitor of NFκB activation Bay 11 (5 μm; Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). NG-Monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA, Sigma) (1 mm) orN-iminoethyl-l-lysine (l-NIL, Alexis Biochemicals) (1 mm) were added to endothelial monolayers at the time of induction as competitive inhibitors of nitric-oxide synthase, respectively. In addition, l-NIL was utilized at a dosage of 20 μm, which preferentially inhibits iNOS function (33Binion D.G., Fu, S. Ramanujam K.S. Chai Y.C. Dweik R.A. Drazba J.A. Wade J.G. Ziats N.P. Erzurum S.C. Wilson K.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G592-G603PubMed Google Scholar). Polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD, Sigma) (100 units/ml) was applied to HIMEC monolayers to preferentially increase degradation or inhibit production of intracellular superoxide anions during the 24-h activation with cytokines (TNF-α, 100 units/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and LPS (1 mg/ml, Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma). PEG-SOD was applied to the HIMEC monolayers for 2 h prior to and during the 24-h activation period. Assays of U937 adhesion to HIMEC were measured as described previously (31Binion D.G. West G.A. Ina K. Ziats N.P. Emancipator S.N. Fiocchi C. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1895-1907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In brief, endothelial cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning Glass) at 0.5 × 105 cells/well using HIMEC medium and grown to confluence over 48–72 h. Unless otherwise noted in the figure legends, endothelial cells were stimulated with a combination of TNF-α (100 units/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml). After 24 h of activation, HIMEC monolayers were rinsed and U937 cells (106/ml) were co-cultured on endothelial monolayers and allowed to adhere at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Following a 1-h incubation, nonadherent cells were removed, and residual cells were rinsed 3 times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen) followed by gentle shaking of the tissue culture plate. Monolayers were fixed and stained using a modified Wright's stain (DiffQuik, Baxter Scientific, McGraw, IL), and adherent leukocytes were counted in 10 random high power fields (×20) using an ocular grid. Adhesion was expressed as number of adherent leukocytes/mm2. In addition to the static adhesion assay described above, an endothelial-leukocyte low shear stress flow adhesion assay was used to assess HIMEC activation and function. The endothelial flow chamber was based on the design of McIntyre and co-workers (34Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 93-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), which allows a flow of leukocytes at 1 dyne/cm2 over the endothelial monolayer. Endothelial cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated 35-mm tissue culture dishes (Corning Glass) at 1 × 105cells/dish using HIMEC medium and grown to confluence over 48–72 h. Endothelial cells were analyzed directly or following stimulation with a combination of TNF-α (100 units/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml). After 24 h, monolayers were rinsed and assayed in a low shear stress flow chamber (34Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 93-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 35Lawrence M.B. McIntire L.V. Eskin S.G. Blood. 1987; 70: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). U937 cells (1 × 106 per ml of HIMEC medium) flowing at a rate of 1 dyne/cm2 were co-cultured over the endothelial monolayers and allowed to adhere at 37 °C, and adhesion was recorded using a CCD camera attached to an inverted tissue culture microscope for 5 min. Data were analyzed by counting the number of adherent leukocytes over 10 random high power fields using a grid and adhesion was expressed as number of adherent leukocytes/mm2. iNOS gene expression was assessed in unstimulated and activated confluent cultures of HIMEC, with or without CsA and other pharmacologic inhibitors. Endothelial cells were stimulated with a combination of 100 units/ml TNF−α (R&D Systems) and 1 μg/ml LPS (Sigma) for 6 h at 37 °C. Total RNA was extracted using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) and quantitated by optical density. 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. 1 μl of reverse transcription product (cDNA) was PCR amplified with Ampli-Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.5 μl each of 10 μmiNOS forward and reverse primers. In the iNOS reaction, β-actin primers were included in the reaction as an internal control for the efficiency of the reverse transcriptase and the amount of RNA used in the reverse transcriptase-PCR. Each PCR cycle consisted of a denaturation step (94 °C, 1 min), an annealing step (60 °C, 1 min), and an elongation step (72 °C, 1.5 min) with a total of 35 cycles, followed by an additional extension step (72 °C, 7 min). The amplification primers for human iNOS were synthesized based on published sequences (36Janssens S.P. Simouchi A. Quertermous T. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14519-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sherman P.A. Laubach V.E. Reep B.R. Wood E.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11600-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The primer sequences (F = forward,r = reverse primers) and PCR product sizes were as follows: iNOS: 5′-TCTTGGTCAAAGCTGTGCTC-3′ (F) and 5′-CATTGCCAAACCTACTGGTC-3′ (R), 237 bp. PCR products were run on 1% agarose gels and stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, visualized under UV light, and photographed. HIMEC (2 × 105) were cultured overnight in 60-mm fibronectin-coated tissue culture dishes (Corning Glass). After rinsing the monolayers, medium was replaced with 2 ml of MCDB 131 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and supernatants were collected after 48 h. Total NO 2−/NO 3−production was assessed by reduction to NO and measurement of chemiluminescence using a Sievers 280 NO analyzer (Sievers Inc., Boulder, CO). Medium, unstimulated cell-conditioned medium, and TNF-α (100 units/ml)/LPS (1 μg/ml) activated cell-conditioned medium were assessed, and results were recorded as micromolar concentration of NO production. Results were expressed as the amount of NO production per milligram of total endothelial cell protein (Bradford assay; Bio-Rad). Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species was measured using a previously described technique (38Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Crossref Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Monolayers of HIMEC were grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips, which had been precleaned in 70% ethanol and autoclaved. Endothelial cells were assessed unstimulated or following 24 h stimulation with TNF-α (100 units/ml)/LPS (1 μg/ml), in the presence or absence of CsA (1–10 μg) 30 min prior to visualization, cells were loaded with 5 mm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) (Acros Organics/Fisher), a nonpolar compound that freely diffuses into cells. It is deacetylated by cellular esterases to the membrane impermeable, nonfluorescent derivative 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein, which in the presence of intracellular reactive oxygen species and peroxidases, is oxidized rapidly to the highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein. Coverslips of viable HIMEC loaded with DCF-DA were rinsed with medium, inverted, and visualized on a fluorescence microscope (absorption 504 nm; emission 529 nm). Photographs of HIMEC DCF-DA fluorescence were taken using an Olympus camera with a fixed shutter speed of 16 s to allow for comparison between culture conditions. HIMEC were seeded at 2.5 × 104 cells per well and grown for 48–72 h in individual fibronectin-coated wells of a 48-well tissue culture cluster (Corning Glass) until confluence was reached. Endothelial monolayers were assessed unstimulated, or following 24 h activation. HIMEC were stimulated with TNF-α (100 units/ml)/LPS (1 μg/ml), either alone, or with CsA (1–10 μg/ml) as indicated under “Results.” Saturating amounts of mouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing human E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 (R&D Systems) were used to detect HIMEC surface expression of these cell adhesion molecules. Following a 60-min incubation with anti-cell adhesion molecule antibodies at 4 °C, monolayers were extensively rinsed and incubated with goat anti-mouse biotinylated Fab′ fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 60 min at 4 °C to detect bound primary antibody using whole cell radioimmunoassay. After extensive washing,125I-streptavidin (80 mCi/ml) was applied to wells to detect the secondary antibody (39Faruqi R. de la Motte C. DiCorleto P.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). HIMEC monolayers were lysed with 1.0% Triton X-100 in medium and quantified in a γ-counter. Data from triplicate wells were expressed as the mean of125I-streptavidin bound (cpm/well). Control experiments using a nonspecific monoclonal antibody (Mouse IgG1κ (MOPC-31c); Sigma) were performed in parallel at equal concentrations and incubation conditions. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). An equal volume of SDS treatment buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) was added to the cell lysate and samples were boiled. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (40Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked and incubated with specific antibodies (phosphorylated, nonphosphorylated MAPK (Cell Signaling, New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA), and iNOS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA)), as specified. Detection was by secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase and ECLTM (AmershamBiosciences). Cell homogenate was prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein A-agarose was used to immunoprecipitate the cell lysates. Briefly, 50 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz) was washed in 1 ml of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, and incubated with specific antibodies for 1–3 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Cell lysates (50–100 μg) were added to protein A-coupled antibody and the complex was incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After the immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation, the supernatants were discarded and the complexes were washed with PBS (3 times) before further analysis. Assays of kinase activity were carried out using nonradioactive kinase assay kits (New England Biolabs) according to the instruction manuals as follows: p42/44 MAP kinase activity assay: 200 μg of total cellular protein from HIMEC lysates were incubated with 15 μl of resuspended, immobilized phospho-p42/44 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After washing, the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of the supplied kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was then terminated by addition of SDS treatment buffer and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using phospho-Elk-1 antibody (Ser383). Western blots were visualized by ECL. 200 μg of total cellular protein from HIMEC lysates were incubated with 20 μl of resuspended, immobilized phospho-p38 MAP kinase monoclonal antibody (Thr180/Tyr182) overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After washing, the pellet was incubated with the supplied kinase buffer with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein as a substrate for 30 min at 30 °C. ATF-2 phosphorylation was then detected by Western blotting as described above using phospho-ATF-2 (Thr71) antibody. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (41Roebuck K.A. Rahman A. Lakshminarayanan V. Janakidevi K. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18966-18974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Briefly, HIMEC were lysed in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 ng/μl of each aprotinin and leupeptin). Cell homogenates were centrifuged (14,000 ×g, 1 min, 4 °C) and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), 90 μl of buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 ng/μl of each aprotinin and leupeptin) were added to the supernatant (cytosolic fraction). The pellet was suspended in 60 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 420 mmNaCl, 1.5 m"

The genes for SEMA6C and SEMA6D are mapped on chromosome 1q12-21.1 and 15q21.1, respectively. Among the adult tissues, SEMA6C is expressed only in skeletal muscle, whereas SEMA6D is expressed abundantly in kidney, brain, and placenta and moderately in the heart and skeletal muscles. During murine development, neither SEMA6C nor SEMA6D was expressed in embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) embryos, but both were highly expressed in the areas of the lateral ventricle, the striatum, the wall of the midbrain, the pons/midbrain junction, and the choroid plexus of E13 embryos. Were neurons, neither axons nor astrocytes, highly expressed both semaphorins. Three isoforms of SEMA6C and five isoforms of SEMA6D derived from alternative splicing were identified, and their expression was regulated in a tissue- and development-dependent manner. Deletion analysis indicated that a sema domain and a PSI domain are integrally necessary for correct post-translation modification and subcellular localization. The extracellular domain of SEMA6C inhibited axonal extension of nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells and induced the growth cone collapse of chicken dorsal root ganglion, rat hippocampal neurons, and rat cortical neurons in a dose-responsive manner. SEMA6D acted like SEMA6C except it had no significant effect on the growth cones of rat cortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1965353054,"HSP47 is a molecular chaperone that plays an unknown role during the assembly and transport of procollagen. Our previous studies showed that, unlike most chaperones, HSP47 interacts with a correctly folded substrate. We suggested that HSP47 either stabilizes the correctly folded collagen helix from heat denaturation or prevents lateral aggregation prior to its transport from the endoplasmic reticulum. In this study we have addressed the role of triple helix stability in the binding of HSP47 to procollagen by expressing procollagen molecules with differing thermal stabilities and analyzing their ability to interact with HSP47 within the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results show that HSP47 interacts with thermostable procollagen molecules, suggesting that helix stabilization is not the primary function of HSP47 and that the interaction of HSP47 with procollagen depends upon the presence of a minimum of one Gly-<i>X</i>-Arg triplet within the triple helical domain. Interestingly, procollagen chains containing high proportions of stabilizing triplets formed triple helices and interacted with HSP47 even in the absence of proline hydroxylation, demonstrating that recognition does not depend upon this modification. Our results support the view that HSP47 functions early in the secretory pathway by preventing the lateral aggregation of procollagen chains."
https://openalex.org/W2062943245,"Abstract The extracellular calcium (Ca2+ o)-sensing receptor (CaR) can be potentiated by allosteric activators including calcimimetics andl-amino acids. In this study, we found that many mutations had differential effects on the functional modulation of the CaR by these two allosteric activators, supporting the idea that these modulators act through distinct sites. 10 mm l-phenylalanine and 1 μm NPS R-467, submaximal doses of the two agents, each elicited similar modulation of R185Q. However, there are different relative potencies for these two modulators with some receptors being more responsive tol-phenylalanine and others being more responsive to NPS R-467. The responsiveness of the CaR to Ca2+ oappears to be essential to observe the potentiating action ofl-phenylalanine but not of NPS R-467 on the receptor. NPS R-467 reduces the Hill coefficients of the wild-type as well as mutant receptors, suggesting that engagement of all Ca2+ binding sites is not required when the receptor is activated by NPS R-467. In contrast, l-phenylalanine has little effect on the Hill coefficients of mutant receptors. The two-site model is further supported by the observation that these two classes of modulators exert a synergistic effect on CaRs with inactivating mutations that are responsive to both modulators."
https://openalex.org/W1575703022,"The nuclear receptor superfamily comprises a large number of ligand-activated transcription factors that are involved in numerous biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis. RORα (NR1F1) and Reverbα (NR1D1) are two members of this family whose biological functions are largely unknown. In addition, no ligand has been yet identified for these two receptors; therefore, they are referred as orphan receptors. Here, we show that RORα and Reverbα are expressed with a similar tissue distribution and are both induced during the differentiation of rat L6 myoblastic cells. Ectopic expression of RORα1 in L6 cells significantly induces Reverbα expression as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. Using reverse transcription-PCR to analyze Reverbα gene expression from staggerer mice, we found that there was a significant reduction of Reverbα mRNA in the skeletal muscle comparing it with the wild-type mice, which suggests that RORα is involved in the regulation of Reverbα gene expression. Transient transfection assays using the Reverbα promoter demonstrate that RORα regulates the Reverbα gene at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, mutagenesis experiments indicate that RORα regulates Reverbα transcription via a monomeric ROR response element located in the Reverbα gene promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that RORα binds strongly to this site in a specific-manner. Finally, overexpression of GRIP-1/TIF-2, but not SRC-1, potentiates RORα-stimulated Reverbα promoter activity in transient transfection experiments.

In addition to the well characterized members of the ligand-activated NRs, other members within this superfamily are structurally related proteins with yet unidentified cognate ligand, and therefore those members are referred as orphan nuclear receptors (2Giguère V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The retinoid-related orphan receptors (RORs) contain three members, RORα, RORβ, and RORγ. The tissue distribution of the RORβ isotype is restricted to the central nervous system (3André E. Conquet F. Steimayr M. Stratton S.C. Porciatti V. Becker-André M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3867-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), whereas RORα and RORγ are expressed in a number of tissues (4Medvedev A. Chistokhina A. Hirose T. Jetten A.M.

The analysis of the RORγ-deficient mouse reveals its role in lymph node organogenesis and apoptosis during thymopoiesis (6Sun Z. Unutmaz D. Zou Y.-R. Sunshine M.J. Pierani A. Brenner-Morton S.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The RORα gene generates four isoforms that share common DNA-binding and putative ligand-binding domains (LBD) but are distinguished by different N-terminal domains (9Carlberg C. Van Huijsduijnen R.H.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2517-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RORα binds as a monomer to a ROR response element (RORE) that is composed of a 6-base pair A/T-rich region immediately preceding a half-core AGGTCA motif (10Giguère V. McBroom L.D.B. Flock G. Mol.

However, RORα is also able to bind to DR-2 elements as a homodimer in vitro (12Moraitis A.N. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 431-439PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to RORγ, RORα has been reported to regulate negatively the inflammatory response (13Kopmels B. Wollman E.E. Guastavino J.M. Delhaye-Bouchaud N. Fradelizi D. Mariani J. J.

Moreover, analysis of RORα-deficient mice suggests an important function of RORα in the development of the central nervous system (15Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L.

It has also been shown that RORα regulates both apolipoprotein AI and CIII gene transcription. Therefore, RORα may play an important role in lipoprotein metabolism (18Raspé E. Madsen L. Lefebvre A.-M. Leitersdorf E. Gelman L. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.C. Berge R. Staels B. J.

Recently, RORα has been shown to be a negative regulator of ischemia-induced angiogenesis (21Besnard S. Silvestre J.-S. Duriez M. Bakouche J. Lemaigre-Dubreuil Y. Mariani J. Levy B.I. Tedgui A. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and a possible factor in bone metabolism (22Meyer T. Kneissel M. Mariani J. Fournier B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9197-9202Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Finally, RORα has been found to be highly expressed in skeletal muscle (5Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and to be involved in myogenesis (23Lau P. Bailey P. Dowhan D.H. Muscat G.E.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, another orphan receptor, Reverbα, has been shown to regulate muscle differentiation (24Downes M. Carozzi A.J. Muscat G.E.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1666-1678PubMed Google Scholar). Reverbα is encoded by the opposite strand of the thyroid hormone receptor α gene (25Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1128-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It binds either as a monomer to a RORE or as a homodimer to a DR-2 element (26Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4791-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which leads to a transcriptional cross-talk with members of the ROR family (5Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because Reverbα does not possess an AF-2 domain, it behaves as a powerful transcriptional repressor that interacts strongly with nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) (26Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4791-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 27Downes M. Burke L.J. Bailey P.J. Muscat G.E.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4379-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Reverbα mRNA is highly expressed in brain, liver, and skeletal muscle (25Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1128-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Interestingly, its expression is dramatically induced during adipogenesis (28Chawla A. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16265-16269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although its function in this process remains unknown. Finally, Reverbα has been shown to play a major role during cerebellar development (29Chomez P. Neveu I. Mansen A. Kiesler E. Larsson L. Vennstrom B. Arenas E. Development. 2000; 127: 1489-1498PubMed Google Scholar). Because RORα and Reverbα exhibit an overlapping tissue distribution and appear to be involved in skeletal muscle differentiation, we examined their expression during myogenesis and queried whether RORα could regulate the expression of Reverbα in muscle cells. Here, we show that both RORα and Reverbα are induced during the differentiation of a rat L6 myoblastic cells. Ectopic expression of RORα1 in rat L6 cells significantly induced Reverbα mRNA expression. In addition, this study demonstrated that RORα1 regulates Reverbα gene transcription through a novel RORE that is present in the promoter region of the Reverbα gene. Rat L6 myoblasts (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. When the cells reached confluence (day 0), they were differentiated in a medium containing 2% horse serum (Invitrogen) for an additional 4 days. The plasmids pCMX-RORα1, pCMX-RORα2, pCMX-RORα3, and pCMX–RORαΔLBD have been described previously (14Delerive P. Monte D. Dubois G. Trottein F. Fruchart-Najib J. Mariani J. Fruchart J.-C. Staels B. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The G5-Luc plasmid, containing five copies of the DNA-binding site of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor cloned in front of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter, and the SV40-luc plasmid were purchased from Promega. The plasmid encoding RORγ (pcDNA3-RORγ) was obtained from Research Genetics. TIF-2, SRC-1, and VP16-SRC-1 expression vectors have been described (30Delerive P., Wu, Y. Burris T.P. Chin W.W. Suen C.S.

The GAL4-RORα1 expression plasmid was obtained by cloning a full-length RORα1 cDNA into the pM vector (CLONTECH). The Reverbα promoter constructs (wild type and Rp site-mutated) were kindly provided by Dr. Gervois (Inserm U545, Lille, France) (32Gervois P. Chopin-Delannoy S. Fadel A. Dubois G. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 400-409PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation of the Rd site within Reverbα promoter was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GAGTAGAAGGGAAAGGGCCTCACATTC-3′ and 5′-GAAATGTGAGGCCCTTTCCCTTCTACTC-3′. All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Rat L6 cells, plated in 24-well plates at 50–60% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, were transiently transfected with reporter and receptor expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) as indicated in the figure legends. The phosphoglycerate kinase β-galactosidase expression plasmid was co-transfected to assess transfection efficiency. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were collected and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. All of the experiments were repeated at least three times. Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIZOL (Invitrogen). Northern blot experiments were performed essentially as described (33Delerive P., De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) using RORα, Reverbα, and cyclophilin cDNAs as probes. For reverse transcription-PCR analysis of RORα, Reverbα, and β-actin expression, total RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and subsequently amplified by PCR using the following primers: for RORα, 5′-GTCAGCAGCTTCTACCTGGAC-3′ and 5′-GTGTTGTTCTTGAGAGTGAAAGGCACG-3′; and for Reverbα, 5′-GGCATGTCCTATGAACATGTACC-3′ and 5′-AACATGGCACTGAGCAGGTCTCC-3′. β-Actin-specific primers were purchased from Stratagene. The recombinant adenovirus (Ad-GFP and RORα1) was obtained by homologous recombination inEscherichia coli (34Chartier C. Degryse E. Gantzer M. Dieterle A. Pavirani A. Mehtali M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4805-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after insertion of the cDNAs into pAdCMV2. Viral stocks were created as described previously (35Sardet C. Vidal M. Cobrinik D. Geng Y. Onufryk C. Chen A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Viral titers were determined by a plaque assay on 293 cells and expressed as plaque-forming units/ml. The cells were infected, in most of the experiments, at a multiplicity of infection of 12.5 viral particles/cell by adding virus stocks directly to the L6 tissue culture medium. Protein extracts were fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions (sample buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. RORα protein was visualized by probing the membrane with a goat polyclonal RORα antibody (SantaCruz, sc-6062). After incubation with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody, the signals were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). A double-stranded oligonucleotide (Rd site) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to standard procedures. In vitro translated proteins (2 μl) were incubated with 100,000 cpm of labeled probe for 20 min at room temperature in 20 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.3 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE buffer. The gel was then dried and exposed at −80 °C for autoradiography. An in vitro protein-protein interaction assay was performed as described previously (33Delerive P., De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Briefly, glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads containing a GST fusion protein (0.5 μg) were incubated with an in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled protein in a total volume of 500 μl of incubation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 2 h at room temperature. After centrifugation, the beads were washed five times with incubation buffer and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant was subjected to electrophoretic analysis on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). After drying, the gels were exposed for autoradiography. Because both RORα and Reverbα have been reported to be highly expressed in the skeletal muscle (5Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we investigated their relative gene expression during myogenesis using a rat L6 myoblastic cell line. After reaching confluence, L6 cells were allowed to differentiate in a medium containing 2% horse serum for up to 4 days. The differentiation of L6 cells was confirmed by the formation of myotubes (data not shown). Northern blot analysis showed that both RORα and Reverbα mRNA are induced after L6 differentiation, whereas the levels of cyclophilin mRNA, as an internal control, were not significantly affected (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, RORα and Reverbα display a similar tissue distribution with the highest expression in human skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and kidney (Fig. 1 B), in agreement with a previous report (5Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential involvement of RORα in the regulation of Reverbα gene expression, we generated, using homologous recombination, an adenovirus encoding the RORα1 isoform (Ad-RORα1), which is the predominant transcript among the four isoforms (5Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Control experiments indicate that the expression of RORα increased at both mRNA and protein levels after infection of the L6 cells with Ad-RORα1 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.2, A and B) without affecting cell viability (data not shown). As expected, infection of Ad-GFP, as a control, did not affect the expression levels of endogenous RORα. Ectopic expression of RORα1 in L6 cells led to a significant induction of Reverbα mRNA (almost 5-fold) without affecting the expression of cyclophilin mRNA (Fig. 2 C), indicating that Reverbα may be a RORα target gene in L6 cells. To provide genetic evidence for a potential role of RORα in the control of Reverbα gene expression, Reverbα mRNA levels were analyzed in muscle from wild-type and homozygous staggerer mice by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 2 D). Reverbα expression was significantly reduced in muscle from staggerer mice compared with the wild-type mice, which suggests involvement of RORα in Reverbα gene expression in vivo. To investigate further the molecular mechanism of RORα-mediated regulation of Reverbα gene expression, we next studied transcriptional regulation of Reverbα by RORα1 using a 1.7-kb fragment of Reverbα gene promoter. In a transient transfection assay RORα1 stimulated Reverbα promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (up to 8-fold) (Fig.3 A). Next, we evaluated the effect of a dominant-negative form of RORα (RORαΔLBD) on RORα1-mediated Reverbα promoter activation. Co-transfection of this dominant-negative construct (RORαΔLBD) significantly inhibited both basal and RORα1-stimulated Reverbα promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). The inhibition of the basal promoter activity may reflect a decrease of endogenous RORα activity present in L6 cells (Fig. 1 A). Because RORαΔLBD represses RORα transcriptional activity by competing for the same DNA-binding site (11McBroom L.D.B. Flock G. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 796-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our results suggest that the promoter of the Reverbα gene may contain a RORE. Because the RORα gene generates several isoforms (36Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and because RORγ is also highly expressed in the skeletal muscle (37Hirose T. Smith R.J. Jetten A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1976-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we next tested the influence of RORα2, RORα3, and RORγ on the Reverbα promoter activity. As expected, RORα1 strongly stimulated the reporter gene containing a 1.7-kb fragment of Reverbα gene promoter (Fig. 3 C). By contrast, RORα2, RORα3, and RORγ failed to stimulate this reporter gene (Fig. 3 C), which suggests that the transcriptional regulation of Reverbα promoter is RORα1-specific. Altogether, these data suggest that a putative RORE may present in the promoter of Reverbα gene. Adelmant et al. (38Adelmant G. Begue A. Stehelin D. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3553-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) identified two putative DNA-binding sites, Rp and Rd, for nuclear receptors within the Reverbα gene promoter. Each of these two sites contains a 5′-A/T-rich sequence preceding an half-core motif, AGGTCA, and may represent ROREs (Fig. 4 A) (10Giguère V. McBroom L.D.B. Flock G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2517-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11McBroom L.D.B. Flock G. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 796-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the Rp site, which is a DR-2 response element, has been found to mediate transcriptional repression by Reverbα itself (38Adelmant G. Begue A. Stehelin D. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3553-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPARα has been reported to regulate Reverbα transcription in the liver through the same response element (32Gervois P. Chopin-Delannoy S. Fadel A. Dubois G. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 400-409PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which region of the Reverbα gene promoter is responsible for RORα-mediated transcriptional activation, we next performed mutagenesis experiments on this promoter. In agreement with results shown in Fig. 3, RORα1 strongly activated the wild-type reporter gene activity. Mutation of the Rd site almost completely abolished RORα-stimulated Reverbα gene promoter activity. Interestingly, the basal level of the reporter gene activity was slightly decreased by a mutation of the Rd site, which suggests that endogenous RORα in L6 cells may contribute to the basal level activity of reporter gene (Fig.1 A). Surprisingly, mutation of the Rp site resulted in a sharp reduction of the Reverbα gene promoter activity (Fig.4 B). Because this site has been found to mediate Reverbα promoter regulation by PPARα (32Gervois P. Chopin-Delannoy S. Fadel A. Dubois G. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 400-409PubMed Google Scholar), our results may reflect the inability of endogenous PPARs to bind to the mutated Rp site (39Nagase I. Yoshida S. Canas X. Irie Y. Kimura K. Yoshida T. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Son C. Hosoda K. Matsuda J. Fujikura J. Yonemitsu S. Iwakura H. Masuzaki H. Ogawa Y. Hatashi T. Itoh H. Nishimura H. Inoue G. Yoshimasa Y. Yamori Y. Nakao K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4189-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, RORα-stimulated reporter gene activity remained unchanged (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that this site is not required for RORα-mediated Reverbα promoter activation. Finally, an unrelated promoter containing the minimal SV40 promoter was not significantly affected by co-transfection of RORα1. Taken together, these results suggest that RORα1 transcriptionally regulates Reverbα gene promoter via the Rd site. To confirm that RORα1 binds to the Rd site, we next performed EMSA using in vitro translated RORα1 protein. Incubation of a32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the Rd site with RORα1 protein resulted in a strong protein-DNA complex, and this specific complex was competed efficiently by the wild type but not by the mutated Rd oligonucleotides, which indicates that RORα1 binds strongly to the Rd site in the promoter of the Reverbα gene (Fig.5 A). In contrast, RORα2, RORα3, and RORγ failed to bind to the Rd site in EMSA (Fig.5 B), which is consistent with our previous transfection results (Fig. 3 C). Chen et al. (41Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E.O. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that the steroid receptor co-activator, GRIP-1, potentiates skeletal muscle differentiation by augmenting, at least in part, MEF-2C transcriptional activity. In addition, GRIP-1/TIF-2 has been shown to interact with RORα and to stimulate its transcriptional activity (42Atkins G.B., Hu, X. Guenther M.G. Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1550-1557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We asked whether GRIP-1/TIF-2 could enhance RORα-stimulated transcriptional activity on the Reverbα gene promoter. Co-transfection of GRIP-1/TIF-2 strongly potentiated RORα-mediated Reverbα gene promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6 A). Surprisingly, SRC-1, another closely related member of the p160 family, failed to potentiate Reverbα gene promoter activity (Fig. 6 A). Similar results were observed using a reporter gene containing three copies of the RORE consensus site, which was cloned in front of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter (data not shown). As a control, both SRC-1 and GRIP-1/TIF-2 were able to significantly increase NF-κB and glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activities in L6 cells (data not shown). To determine whether RORα and SRC-1 interact in vitro, we next performed a GST pull-down assay using radio-labeled full-length SRC-1 and a GST-RORα fusion protein (Fig. 6 B). In this assay, RORα interacted weakly with SRC-1. To study further whether SRC-1 interacts with RORα in cells, we employed a mammalian two-hybrid experiment using GAL4-RORα and VP16-SRC-1 constructs. Surprisingly, transcriptional activity of GAL4-RORα was strongly enhanced by co-transfection with VP16-SRC1 (Fig. 6 C), which suggests that there is a physical interaction between SRC-1 and RORα (both in vitro and in vivo). These data suggest that GRIP-1/TIF-2, but not SRC-1, despite its interaction with RORα, augments RORα-mediated activation of Reverbα gene promoter in L6 cells. The present study shows that both RORα and Reverbα mRNAs are induced during myogenesis and are highly expressed in adult skeletal muscle. Moreover, ectopic expression of RORα1 resulted in a significant induction of endogenous Reverbα mRNA in L6 cells. Finally, Reverbα mRNA levels were found to be lower in muscle from staggerer mice compared with wild-type mice. In mouse C2C12 myoblast cells, Lau et al. (23Lau P. Bailey P. Dowhan D.H. Muscat G.E.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) showed that the expression of a RORα dominant-negative construct results in a delay in myogenesis, at least in part, by down-regulating key regulators of differentiation such as MyoD, myogenin, and p21. We observed an increased expression of RORα mRNA during the differentiation of rat L6 myoblast cells, which suggests that RORα may play a role during myogenesis. Downes et al. (24Downes M. Carozzi A.J. Muscat G.E.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1666-1678PubMed Google Scholar) reported that Reverbα mRNA levels are decreased during myogenic differentiation in the mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line. Furthermore, they showed that constitutive expression of Reverbα inhibits muscle differentiation by abrogating MyoD expression (24Downes M. Carozzi A.J. Muscat G.E.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1666-1678PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, we found that Reverbα is increased during myogenesis using the rat L6 myoblast model (Fig.1 A). Apparently, this divergence may reflect differences between the two cell types. Much evidence showed that these two myoblasts are quite diverse in their reactions to environmental conditions during differentiation (43Lawson M.A. Purslow P.P. Cells Tissues Organs. 2000; 167: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). First, creatine phosphokinase activity increased in C2C12 cells but not L6 cells. Second, C2C12 cells produce sarcomeric actin in both serum-containing and serum-free media, whereas L6 cells produce little if any after 5 days of differentiation. Furthermore, C2C12 have been shown to contain a heterogeneous population of cells, and a significant proportion of cells escape from terminal differentiation (44Yoshida N. Yoshida S. Koishi K. Masuda K. Nabeshima Y. J Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Reverbα is highly expressed in human skeletal muscle (Fig. 1 B) (5Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, skeletal muscle apparently develops normally in Reverbα-deficient mice, and histological sections of various muscles show a normal organization of the aerobic and anaerobic fibers in these mice (29Chomez P. Neveu I. Mansen A. Kiesler E. Larsson L. Vennstrom B. Arenas E. Development. 2000; 127: 1489-1498PubMed Google Scholar). These observations raise doubt about a negative role of Reverbα in myogenesis. In addition to their similar spatial and temporal pattern of expression (Fig. 1 B) (5Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), both RORα and Reverbα mRNAs are induced during adipogenesis (28Chawla A. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16265-16269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Austin S. Medvedev A. Yan Z.-H. Adachi H. Hirose T. Jetten A.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 9: 267-276Google Scholar). These results indirectly support our findings. Nevertheless, additional studies will be necessary to determine a potential physiological role(s) of RORα and Reverbα during myogenesis. CBP/p300 and PCAF have been reported to be important modulators of muscle differentiation by potentiating the transcriptional activities of MyoD and MEF-2C (46Puri P.L. sartorelli V. Yang X.J.

Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GRIP-1/TIF-2 has been recently shown to be required for MEF-2C-dependent gene expression during the execution of the muscle differentiation program (41Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E.O. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of sense and antisense constructs of GRIP-1 demonstrated a crucial role for GRIP-1/TIF-2 in the regulation of myogenin, MyoD, and p21 and in the augmentation of transcriptional activity of the muscle-specific transcription factor, MEF-2C (41Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E.O. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, GRIP-1/TIF-2 protein levels are increased during myogenesis (41Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E.O. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,49Chen S.L. Wang S.-C.M. Hosking B. Muscat G.E.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 783-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas SRC-1 and SRC-3/ACTR proteins are barely detectable. Here, we found that GRIP-1/TIF-2, but not SRC-1, potentiates RORα-stimulated Reverbα gene promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 A). Moreover, Chenet al. (41Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E.O. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed a role for GRIP-1/TIF-2 in the regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a key player in myogenesis. Indeed, p21 appears to be a RORα target gene (50Schräder M. Danielsson C. Wiesenberg I. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19732-19736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It would be of interest to test whether GRIP-1/TIF-2-mediated induction of p21 is RORα-dependent. Overall, our results demonstrate a specific role for GRIP-1/TIF-2 in the regulation of Reverbα gene transcription in L6 cells, which is consistent with the demonstrated key role of GRIP-1/TIF-2 in myogenesis (41Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E.O. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many NR co-activators, including SRC-1 and GRIP-1/TIF-2, possess signature motifs, LXXLL, that are necessary and sufficient to permit their interactions with nuclear hormone receptors (51Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several studies showed that these motifs or NR boxes are not functionally equivalent (52Ding X.F. Anderson C.M., Ma, H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Chang C.-Y. Norris J.D. Gron H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P.T. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell.

Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6001-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Several NRs have displayed preferential interactions to these NR boxes within co-activators that may lead to different biological responses (53Chang C.-Y. Norris J.D. Gron H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P.T. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Bramlett K.S., Wu, Y. Burris T.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 909-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our results show that GRIP-1/TIF-2, but not SRC-1, augments transcriptional activity of RORα (Fig. 6 A), although SRC-1 is able to interact with RORα (Fig. 6, B and C). Similarly, Atkinset al. (42Atkins G.B., Hu, X. Guenther M.G. Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1550-1557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that GRIP-1/TIF-2, but not PPAR-binding protein (also known as DRIP205/TRAP220), augments RORα-stimulated gene transcription in both 293T and JEG-3 cells, although both proteins interact with RORα in yeast, in in vitro GST pull-down and in mammalian cells. Further study would be required to elucidate whether an interaction of SRC-1, but not GRIP-1/TIF-2, with RORα results in assembly of naı̈ve complex on the promoter of Reverbα gene, and this would provide a potential molecular basis of this apparent selectivity. In conclusion, this study shows that both RORα and Reverbα mRNAs are induced during the differentiation L6 myoblast cells and that RORα regulates Reverbα gene transcription through a novel RORE present in the promoter of the Reverbα gene. Further studies will be required to elucidate the biological functions of RORα and Reverbα in skeletal muscle and to determine their respective target genes. We thank Dr. P. Gervois for providing valuable reagents and Dr. D. Monté (UMR 8526, Lille, France) for technical advice during the generation of the adenovirus."

Hence, a wide range of techniques would benefit from a generally applicable approach to the immobilization of biological macromolecules. As a key requirement, any general strategy to immobilization will have to fully preserve the biological activity of molecules subjected to it; any adverse effects that immobilization might have on molecules in terms of their structure and function should be minimized. The sites relevant to their biological function like ligand-binding sites or active sites must remain accessible after transfer to a solid surface. This demands that the orientation of the molecule with respect to the supporting interface can be fully controlled. Formation of metal-chelate complexes is a strategy commonly used for the purification of proteins containing an engineered His tag,i.e. a stretch of consecutive histidines (1Hochuli E. Bannwarth W. Döbeli H. Gentz R. Stüber D. Biotechnology. 1988; 6: 1321-1325Crossref Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)1binds nickel ions coordinatively (2Hochuli E. Döbeli H. Schacher A. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 411: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), leaving two coordination sites available for interaction with a His tag. Binding of His-tagged proteins to a Ni-NTA presenting surface is specific (3Dietrich C. Schmitt L. Tampé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with a binding constant in the micromolar range (4Dorn I.T. Neumeier K.R. Tampé R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 2753-2763Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but easily reversible. Importantly, via judicious introduction of a His tag, the site through which molecules bind to a chelating support and, possibly, their orientation with respect to a chelating support, can be controlled. The 20 S proteasome is a large multisubunit protease, which plays a key role in the degradation of misfolded proteins and of short-lived regulatory proteins (5Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar, 6Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 7Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). Its 28 subunits are arranged in four heptameric rings, which collectively form a barrel-shaped complex 15 nm in length and 11 nm in diameter. There are two types of subunits, α and β; the α-type subunits form the two outer rings and the β-type subunits the two inner rings. In most prokaryotes, including the Archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum, the rings are homoheptameric; thus, the stoichiometry of these 20 S proteasomes is α7β7β7α7 (Fig.1 A). Proteasomes are members of the superfamily of Ntn (N-terminal nucleophile) hydrolases; a common feature of this group of enzymes is a single-residue active site, i.e. both the nucleophile and the primary proton acceptor are provided by the same N-terminal residue. In the proteasome this is the Thr1 of the β-subunits (8Löwe J. Stock D. Jap R. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 9Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). During assembly, 20 S proteasomes undergo a post-translational modification that removes a propeptide and exposes the α-amino group of Thr1 (10Seemüller E. Lupas A. Baumeister W. Nature. 1996; 382: 468-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In mature 20 S proteasomes Thr1 is accessible only from the central, ∼5 nm wide cavity, which is formed by the two rings of β-subunits (Fig.1 A). Substrates destined for degradation must therefore be translocated into the interior of the proteasome from either end through entrance channels situated at the center of the two α-rings (11Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Turn forming segments around Tyr126 of the seven α-subunits appear to define the properties of these 1.3-nm wide channels, although it should be noted that there are several disordered residues (8Löwe J. Stock D. Jap R. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar) that are likely to (partially) occlude the channels. In any case, access to the interior of the proteasome and thus to the active sites is restricted to completely unfolded polypeptide chains (11Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, to be functional in vivo, 20 S proteasomes must associate with regulatory complexes, invariably containing AAA-ATPases, which prepare substrates for degradation by unfolding them (12Lupas A. Baumeister W. Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 195-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Nat.

Moreover, regulatory complexes such as the 19 S caps of eukaryotic proteasomes have been implicated in gating the α-ring channels (15Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M., Fu, H.Y. Larsen C.N. Coux O. Wefes I.

To explore the use of a His tag as a handle that might allow one to immobilize functional molecules in a predictable orientation, we have generated recombinant 20 S proteasomes His-tagged in various positions. The option to immobilize proteasomes in a uniform and predetermined orientation allowing regulatory complexes unhindered binding holds prospect for structural studies addressing the interaction of the proteasome with cofactors and their role in substrate translocation. Immobilizing proteasomes while fully preserving their proteolytic activity will benefit investigations of proteasome-substrate interaction in real time for detailed kinetic analysis, possibly at the single molecule level. Following biochemical characterization of His-tagged proteasomes, their interaction with metal-chelating lipid interfaces has been assessed. PFU-TURBO polymerase from Stratagene (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in combination with dNTPs (polymerization mixture) from Amersham Biosciences were used in polymerase chain reactions. Sequencing was performed using the BIGDYE terminator cycle sequencing kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 20 S proteasomes were purified either on Ni-NTA resin (SUPERFLOW from Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) or hydroxyapatite (Bio-Gel HTP from Bio-Rad). Bicinchoninic acid solution was from Sigma. Protease activity was assayed using succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-LLVY-AMC) from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany) or14C-methylated β-casein from Sigma. Mica was glued to Teflon sheets with Bindulin two-component epoxy glue (Fürth, Germany). The chelating lipid NTA-DODA (N α,N α-bis(carboxymethyl)-N ε-[(dioctadecylamino)-succinyl]-l-lysine) was synthesized as described (17Schmitt L. Dietrich C. Tampé R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 8485-8491Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). SOPC (1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine) was from Avanti Polar Lipids, whereas DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine) was from Sigma. pRSET6a plasmids coding for both the α-subunit and β-subunit (either wild-type or His-tagged at the C terminus) of the 20 S proteasome from T. acidophilum (referred to simply as “proteasome” in the following) were provided by Dr. Erika Seemüller. His tags were introduced into the α-subunit starting from the plasmid coding for the wild-type proteasome using whole plasmid amplification via the polymerase chain reaction (Pfu-turbo polymerase) starting with primers including the desired changes. Sequencing was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences applied biosystems 373 DNA sequencer. The α- and β-subunits of the proteasome were coexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The assembled complex was purified either on Ni-NTA resin or on hydroxyapatite if the affinity for Ni-NTA resin was low. In the latter case, material bound to hydroxyapatite was eluted with a gradient from 10 to 600 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7; proteasomes eluted at around 500–550 mm potassium phosphate. Purity of fractions showing proteasomal activity against Suc-LLVY-AMC was tested by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay. To follow the degradation of fluorogenic substrates in solution, Suc-LLVY-AMC was dissolved at 10 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and added at a final concentration of 125 μm (1.25% Me2SO) in 800 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing 100 ng of proteasomes (corresponding to 0.18 nm) for continuous measurement at 60 °C. The released AMC was detected (λex/em 380 nm/440 nm) in an LS 50 B fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To follow the degradation of proteins in solution, 11 μg of14C-methylated β-casein (21,800 cpm/μg, final concentration 8.76 μm) was digested with 300–600 ng of proteasomes (8.6–17.2 nm) in 50 μl of buffer A for 40 min at 60 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of 12% trichloroacetic acid followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. Centrifugation for 20 min in the presence of 10 μl of bovine serum albumin (1%) at 13,000 × g separated acid-soluble degradation products that were quantified in a TRI CARB 1500 liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). For preparation of lipid vesicles, NTA-DODA and SOPC were mixed (1:9 mol/mol) in chloroform. NTA-DODA was loaded with nickel ions (Ni-NTA-DODA) in chloroform/methanol (3:1) by adding equimolar amounts of NiCl2·6H2O dissolved in methanol. After evaporation of the solvent under a stream of nitrogen, vesicles were obtained by swelling in buffer B (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) to a final lipid concentration of 2 mm and repeated extrusion (30 times) through 100-nm filters (LIPOSO FAST-BASIC, Avestin, Ottawa, Canada). Supported lipid bilayers were prepared on mica sheets glued to Teflon supports cut to either fit quartz cuvettes (3 mm × 9 mm) or the fluid cell of an atomic force microscope (6 mm diameter). Freshly cleaved mica was first incubated with buffer B containing 15 mm Mg2+ for 60 min, then with vesicle solution (Ni-NTA-DODA/SOPC, 1:9) at 50 °C to yield bilayers. Preincubation of mica with Mg2+ resulted in increased bilayer stability; presumably Mg2+ is required to compensate for the negative surface charge of both mica and chelating lipid film. After 3 h, the surfaces were thoroughly rinsed with buffer B. The activity of proteasomes was tested after immobilization on two kinds of bilayer specimens, that is on vesicle bilayers and on mica supported bilayers. For the first set of measurements, vesicles were prepared as described in the previous section. 11 nm proteasomes were incubated with these vesicles at a proteasome/chelator lipid ratio of 1:910 for 3 h at 4 °C. Degradation of 125 μm Suc-LLVY-AMC by the proteasomes immobilized on the vesicles was performed for 15 min at 60 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of a 9-fold excess of 100 mm chloroacetic acid, 100 mm acetic acid, pH 4.3, before quantifying fluorescence. The activity of unbound proteasomes was measured in the presence of 250 mmimidazole, which leads to desorption of the proteasomes from the Ni-chelator lipid. For the measurements with proteasomes bound to solid supported bilayers, first the activity of a known amount of proteasomes in solution was assayed. Quartz cuvettes holding 300 ng of proteasomes in 2970 μl of buffer C (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5) were equilibrated at 40 °C for 15 min. Following addition of 30 μl of Suc-LLVY-AMC (final concentration 100 μm Suc-LLVY-AMC, 1% Me2SO, 0.14 nm proteasome), cuvettes were kept at 40 °C for 30 min, then chilled on ice for 5 min. Released AMC was detected (λex/em 380 nm/440 nm) in a fluorescence spectrometer. An equal amount of His-tagged proteasomes (300 ng) was adsorbed onto a mica-supported nickel-chelating lipid bilayer (Ni-NTA-DODA/SOPC, 1:9) overnight to allow them to bind. Proteasomes that did not bind were transferred using a pipette into a cuvette holding 2970 μl of buffer C. The rate at which AMC was released by the unbound proteasomes was quantified as before. Subtracting this rate from the rate at which 300 ng of proteasomes in solution released AMC equals the rate at which those proteasomes bound to the bilayer would release AMC if their activity was not affected by immobilization at all (the “ideal rate”). The rate at which proteasomes immobilized on the supported bilayer overnight actually released AMC was measured as before after placing the mica-supported bilayer with bound proteasomes at the bottom of a cuvette holding 2970 μl of buffer C. Dividing this observed rate by the “ideal rate” indicates the extent to which the activity of His-tagged proteasomes bound to chelating lipid bilayers is preserved. The system mica-bilayer-proteasome was stable during incubation with Suc-LLVY-AMC: upon removal of the mica-supported lipid bilayer with bound proteasomes from the cuvette during hydrolysis, the fluorescence level ceased to rise. To investigate the interaction of proteasomes with lipid films, 1.5 μg of proteasomes in 15 μl of buffer B were placed in a Teflon well (4 mm diameter, 1 mm deep). The surface of the solution was coated with 1 μl of 1 mmlipid in chloroform/hexane (1:1, v/v). The lipid was, as indicated, SOPC, a mixture of NTA-DODA (no nickel) and SOPC (1:9), a mixture of Ni-NTA-DODA and SOPC (1:9), or a mixture of Ni-NTA-DODA and DSPC (1:9). Following incubation for either 1 h or overnight, the lipid-proteasome assembly was transferred onto a carbon-coated grid by placing the grid onto the droplet for 3 min. Such samples as well as proteasomes adsorbed directly onto carbon-coated grids were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 s and inspected in a transmission electron microscope (CM12, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at 120 kV. A Silicon Graphics work station with SEMPER software (18Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. Ultramicroscopy. 1979; 4: 343-354Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar) was used for averaging images using a correlation-based approach (19Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1982; 127: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). An area comprising three unit cells in diameter was chosen as a reference and cross-correlated with the image. To obtain AFM (atomic force microscope) topographs of the lipid-proteasome assembly, His-tagged proteasomes were immobilized on supported nickel-chelating lipid bilayers. Between 1 and 5 μg of His-tagged proteasomes in buffer B were adsorbed overnight on the mica-supported bilayer. Care was taken to always keep the solid supported membranes submerged in buffer. After rinsing with buffer B the samples were mounted in the fluid cell of a NANOSCOPE AFM (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) and imaged in buffer B either in tapping mode using a drive frequency around 9 kHz and 5–10 nm amplitude of the cantilever, or in contact mode. In either mode, forces exerted by the tip onto the sample were minimized by adjusting the set point manually while scanning. Silicon nitride cantilevers (OMCL-TR400PSA-2, Olympus, Japan) with nominal spring constants of 0.09 newton/m were used; their oxide sharpened tips were cleaned by UV irradiation for ∼30 min prior to use. The main goal of this study was to immobilize the cylindrical-shaped 20 S proteasome with predetermined orientation, end-on and side-on. To this end, recombinant T. acidophilum 20 S proteasomes (referred to simply as “proteasome” in the following) were engineered, carrying His tags at positions favoring one or the other orientation. Proteasomes His-tagged at the sides were obtained by fusing six histidines to the C termini of β-subunits, referred to as βC-His6proteasomes (Fig. 1 B). Proteasomes His-tagged at the ends were obtained by fusing six histidines to the N termini of α-subunits (αN-His6proteasomes) (Fig. 1 C), or alternatively, by integrating a stretch of histidines into a solvent-accessible turn of α-subunits connecting helix H0 and strand S1 between Lys33 and Gly34 (Fig. 1 D). Proteasomes with six or eight consecutive histidines within this turn are referred to as α turn-His6 or α turn-His8 proteasomes, respectively. Expression levels were similar for all four constructs. βC-His6, αN-His6, and α turn-His8 proteasomes had high affinity for nickel-chelating nitrilotriacetic acid facilitating their efficient purification in a single step on Ni-NTA resin. α turn-His6 proteasomes, however, could not be purified on Ni-NTA resin, which is indicative of a low affinity for the Ni-NTA group, but could be purified on hydroxyapatite (see “Experimental Procedures”). The activity of all constructs with high affinity for Ni-NTA was first assayed using Suc-LLVY-AMC, a standard fluorogenic substrate of the proteasome. Under the experimental conditions chosen (60 °C), hydrolysis of Suc-LLVY-AMC proceeded at rates of 9.5 μmol/h per mg of proteasome for βC-His6, αN-His6, and α turn-His8 proteasomes, close to the rates measured with wild-type proteasomes and in good agreement with previous data (20Zwickl P., Ng, D. Woo K.M. Klenk H.P. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26008-26014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Degradation of proteins proceeded at almost identical rates for βC-His6 and wild-type proteasomes, as judged from hydrolysis of 14C-methylated β-casein (TableI). However, αN-His6 and α turn-His8 proteasomes differed in their activities from wild-type proteasomes, indicating that the His tags might affect translocation of long polypeptide chains across the α-ring channel. Interestingly, αN-His6 proteasomes degraded radiolabeled β-casein at lower rates, whereas α turn-His8proteasomes degraded this substrate faster than wild-type proteasomes (Table I).Table IDegradation of casein by proteasomes with and without His-tag (nmol degraded per h and mg of proteasome)Proteasomenmol of casein degraded per h and mg of proteasomeWild-type170βC-His6177αN-His693α turn-His8450 Open table in a new tab To test whether site-specific binding between His-tagged proteasomes and nickel-chelating interfaces would permit one to control orientation, proteasomes were allowed to interact with nickel-chelating lipid layers. Proteasomes were adsorbed to lipid films containing 10% Ni-NTA-DODA and 90% SOPC or DSPC for either 1 h or overnight. The lipid films were then transferred onto carbon grids and examined by transmission electron microscopy. In standard transmission electron microscopy preparations where 20 S proteasomes from T. acidophilum are applied to carbon film, they show up in two characteristic orientations (21Dahlmann B. Kopp F. Kuehn L. Niedel B. Pfeifer G. Hegerl R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar): ring-shaped end-on views with a diameter of 11 nm and rectangular side-on views (15 nm × 11 nm) with a characteristic pattern of four striations, representing the four proteasomal rings; a typical example is seen in Fig. 2. Likewise, when adsorbed unspecifically to SOPC lipid films, proteasomes are seen randomly oriented, regardless of the presence of His tags. In contrast, the orientation of isolated, His-tagged proteasomes bound to metal-chelating lipid films was highly uniform and in line with expectations: βC-His6 proteasomes His-tagged at their sides displayed exclusively side-on views (Fig.3 A), whereas αN-His6 and α turn-His8 proteasomes His-tagged at their ends displayed exclusively end-on views (Fig.3 B). α turn-His6 proteasomes adsorbed randomly oriented, which is not surprising given their low affinity for Ni-NTA resin. All components of the His tag-nickel-NTA system are required to achieve uniform orientation. In fact, proteasomes were randomly oriented if (i) wild-type proteasomes lacking His tags were adsorbed on Ni-NTA-DODA/SOPC (1:9), (ii) His-tagged proteasomes were adsorbed (in the presence of nickel ions) on SOPC films lacking NTA-DODA, or (iii) His-tagged proteasomes were adsorbed on NTA-DODA/SOPC (1:9) in the absence of nickel ions (in the presence of EDTA). The strict dependence of orientation on all components of the His tag-nickel-NTA system confirms that binding of His-tagged proteasomes to metal-chelating lipid interfaces is specific. To demonstrate that immobilization of His-tagged proteins at metal-chelating lipid interfaces is biocompatible, the activity of immobilized proteasomes was compared with the activity of proteasomes in solution. One set of measurements was performed at 60 °C with the βC-His6 and the αN-His6 mutants bound directly on vesicles formed by nickel-chelating lipid bilayers (Ni-NTA-DODA/SOPC, 1:9). By this immobilization, activity of the proteasomes was reduced by about 8% for both mutants in comparison to their activity in solution. Additionally, proteasome activity was measured for βC-His6 proteasomes bound to a mica-supported bilayer. First the activity of a known amount of these proteasomes in solution was assayed. At the suboptimal temperature of 40 °C, which ensured stability of the complete mica-lipid bilayer-proteasome system, hydrolysis of Suc-LLVY-AMC by 300 ng of proteasomes proceeded at a rate of 0.89 nmol/h, which corresponds to 2.97 μmol/h/mg of proteasome. An equal amount of proteasomes was adsorbed onto a supported nickel-chelating lipid bilayer (Ni-NTA-DODA/SOPC, 1:9) overnight to allow them to bind. Beforehand, the presence of a continuous lipid bilayer was routinely confirmed by AFM. Proteasomes that did not bind to the bilayer released AMC at a rate of 0.2 nmol/h. Subtracting this rate from the rate at which 300 ng of proteasomes in solution released AMC equals the rate at which those proteasomes bound to the bilayer would release AMC if their activity was not affected by immobilization at all: 0.69 nmol/h (the ideal rate). The rate at which the proteasomes immobilized on the supported bilayer overnight actually released AMC was measured to be 0.35 nmol/h, which amounts to 51% of the ideal rate. Proteasomes bound to fluid nickel-chelating lipid films end-on (αN-His6 and α turn-His8) showed a high propensity to self-organize in two dimensions. Small close packed arrays of proteasomes were already observed after incubation for 1 h with Ni-NTA-DODA/SOPC (1:9) films. Much larger arrays were observed after overnight incubation (e.g. Fig. 3 C). Under the same conditions, βC-His6 proteasomes also formed densely packed protein layers, but only a few small ordered patches were observed. His-tagged proteasomes were also found to orient on nickel-chelating lipid films when SOPC was replaced by DSPC (Ni-NTA-DODA/DSPC, 1:9). However, no two-dimensional organization was observed on such lipid films. Possibly, DSPC restricts the lateral mobility of the lipid-bound proteasomes. Power spectra calculated from negatively stained two-dimensional arrays of αN-His6 proteasomes indicated that the organization of proteasomes within the two-dimensional arrays went beyond simple close packing and showed diffraction spots to 1/2.5 nm−1 (Fig.3 D). Correlation averaging revealed that the rotation of proteasomes about their 7-fold symmetry axis is limited to discrete angles (Fig. 4), giving rise to crystals of pg symmetry. Images of the two-dimensional crystals of αN-His6proteasomes on supported nickel-chelating lipid bilayers were also taken by AFM (Fig. 5). Crystals could be repeatedly scanned without apparent degradation. AFM topographs revealed that αN-His6 proteasomes alternated in height within the crystals; every second row of proteasomes stood out by about 2 nm, adding a doubled period to the close packing (Fig. 5). This pattern of alternating rows was continuous throughout scan areas as large as 2 × 2 μm. The diameter of αN-His6proteasomes in the two-dimensional crystals was 11 nm with their ends appearing dome-shaped in AFM topographs. Possibly, the central channel in α-rings was not visible because of the presence of seven His tags per α-ring. The appearance of different proteasomes was slightly heterogeneous, the arrangement of the seven His tags may vary for different proteasomes. However, the appearance of proteasomes did not change in time during repeated scanning. Recombinant DNA techniques allow one to introduce specific sites of attachment into proteins. Cysteines (22Persson M. Bulow L. Mosbach K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and, more commonly, amino acid sequences including His tags (1Hochuli E. Bannwarth W. Döbeli H. Gentz R. Stüber D. Biotechnology. 1988; 6: 1321-1325Crossref Scopus (962) Google Scholar) are used for site-specific immobilization. To demonstrate, however, that site-specific immobilization can lead to uniform orientation it is necessary to vary the location of an affinity site within otherwise identical molecules and to show that thereby their orientation can be changed. Previously, cysteine residues have been used to manipulate the orientation of proteins on solid supports. To this end, the location of an engineered cysteine has been varied in cytochromeb 5. Two mutants having either Thr8or Thr65 replaced by cysteine (T8C or T65C) have been shown to differ in their mean orientation with respect to their support upon site-specific immobilization (23Stayton P.S.

Linear dichroism measurements revealed that the heme group of cytochrome b 5(T8C) adopted an average angle of 78° with respect to the support, whereas the heme group of cytochrome b 5 (T65C) adopted an average angle of 45° with respect to the support (24Yeung C.

https://openalex.org/W2033861203,"Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) has long been linked to the pathology of a variety of inflammatory diseases and therefore is a potential target for therapeutic intervention. At least two other serine proteases, proteinase 3 (Pr3) and cathepsin G, are stored within the same neutrophil primary granules as HNE and are released from the cell at the same time at inflammatory sites. HNE and Pr3 are structurally and functionally very similar, and no substrate is currently available that is preferentially cleaved by Pr3 rather than HNE. Discrimination between these two proteases is the first step in elucidating their relative contributions to the development and spread of inflammatory diseases. Therefore, we have prepared new fluorescent peptidyl substrates derived from natural target proteins of the serpin family. This was done because serpins are rapidly cleaved within their reactive site loop whether they act as protease substrates or inhibitors. The hydrolysis of peptide substrates reflects the specificity of the parent serpin including those from α-1-protease inhibitor and monocyte neutrophil elastase inhibitor, two potent inhibitors of elastase and Pr3. More specific substrates for these proteases were derived from the reactive site loop of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, proteinase inhibitors 6 and 9, and from the related viral cytokine response modifier A (CrmA). This improved specificity was obtained by using a cysteinyl residue at P1 for Pr3 and an Ile residue for HNE and because of occupation of protease S′ subsites. These substrates enabled us to quantify nanomolar concentrations of HNE and Pr3 that were free in solution or bound at the neutrophil surface.

The activation and degranulation of PMNs at an inflammatory site result in these proteases being translocated to the surface of the plasma membrane and/or released from the PMN (2Owen C.A.

Thus, they are involved in the proteolytic events associated with inflammation such as the lysis of extracellular matrix components, the control of cytokine activity, availability (5Bank U. Ansorge S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 197-206PubMed Google Scholar), platelet activation, and blood coagulation (6Evangelista V. Rajtar G. de Gaetano G. White J.G. Cerletti C.

The contributions of HNE and Pr3 to the development of inflammatory diseases remain to be elucidated, mainly because they have very similar substrate specificities (1Campbell E.J. Campbell M.A. Owen C.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3366-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Indeed, all of the synthetic substrates for Pr3 assayed to date are hydrolyzed faster by HNE (8Kam C.M. Kerrigan J.E. Dolman K.M. Goldschmeding R. Von dem Borne A.E. Powers J.C.

However, Pr3 has some features that can help to distinguish it from HNE. It is not inhibited by secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, which strongly inhibits HNE and cathepsin G, mainly in the upper airways. Unlike HNE, Pr3 resists inhibition by DNA released from pathogens and dead neutrophils (10Duranton J. Belorgey D. Carrere J. Donato L. Moritz T. Bieth J.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Pr3 also activates the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β (11Robache-Gallea S. Morand V. Bruneau J.M. Schoot B.

Med. 1990; 171: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Because HNE and Pr3 have a site of interaction with their substrates that extends on both sides of the sensitive bond (14Fujinaga M. Chernaia M.M. Halenbeck R. Koths K. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), one way to develop specific substrates for these proteases is to investigate their P′specificity. This can be done using substrates with intramolecularly quenched fluorescence that are cleaved within their amino acid sequence (15Chagas J.R. Juliano L. Prado E.S. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that sensitive intramolecularly quenched fluorescent substrates of cathepsin G can be developed from the sequence of the reactive site loop (RSL) of serpin inhibitors (16Réhault S. Brillard-Bourdet M. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Moreau T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13810-13817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An initial substrate-like cleavage of the RSL occurs in serpins when they interact with their target protease. This results in the irreversible binding of the protease (inhibitory pathway) or in the inactivation of the serpin when the protease escapes from the complex (substrate pathway). In the latter case, the protease causes local depletion of the inhibitor and takes part in the protease-protease inhibitor imbalance, especially at inflammatory sites. However, the RSL is always cleaved, suggesting that RSL sequences can be used to develop substrates for proteases that are not necessarily inhibited by the corresponding serpin. We have prepared a series of synthetic fluorogenic peptides with intramolecularly quenched fluorescence based on the exposed RSL of lung serpins that are putative target for neutrophil neutral proteases, and we have used them as substrates for HNE and Pr3. This study was done to identify substrates for specifically measuring HNE and Pr3 activities at the surface of neutrophils where bound proteases resist inhibition by local inhibitors, thus favoring the development of inflammation. The nomenclature used for the individual amino acid residues (e.g. P1, P2, and so on) of a substrate and corresponding residues of the enzyme subsites (e.g. S1, S2, and so on) is that of Schechter and Berger (17Schechter I.

All of the resulting fractions with the exception of the neutrophil band at the bottom of the gradient were carefully removed. Any erythrocytes remaining in the neutrophil fraction were removed by hypotonic lysis. Purified PMNs were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min, and contaminating erythrocyte membranes were removed. The PMNs were suspended in PBS at ∼3.103 cells/μl and used immediately or kept at 4–6 °C under gentle stirring. Flow cytometry was performed on a Coulter Epics Elite ESP flow cytometer equipped with a 488-nm argon laser. The forward and side scatters of each sample were measured for at least 10,000 events. Samples contained >99% neutrophils, no monocytes, and <1% lymphocytes. CD63 surface expression was measured incubating 5 × 105 PMN with 20 μl of monoclonal IgG1-FITC or CD63-phycoerythrin antibodies for 20 min in the dark and at room temperature. The mixture was centrifuged at 500 × gfor 5 min, and the pellet washed twice in PBS and then resuspended in PBS for flow cytometry. All quenched fluorogenic substrates were prepared by solid-phase synthesis with the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) methodology using a multiple automated peptide synthesizer (PSSM-8, Shimadzu) (15Chagas J.R.

Nakaie C.R. Boschcov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M.A. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1994; 1: 299-308Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Substrate purity was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TofSpec-E, Micromass) and by reverse-phase chromatography on a C18 column eluted at 2 ml/min with a 10-min linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–60%) in 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid. Stock substrate solutions (2–5 mm) were prepared in 30% (v/v)N,N-dimethylformamide and diluted to 0.5 mm with 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. Experimental conditions were optimized for each enzyme, taking into account the great propensity of dilute solutions to stick to plastic and glass surfaces. Assays were carried out at 37 °C in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 0.75m NaCl, 0.05% Igepal CA-630 (v/v) for HNE and Pr3 and in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01% Igepal CA-630 (v/v) for cathepsin G. The hydrolysis of Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrates was followed by measuring the fluorescence at λex = 320 nm and λem = 420 nm in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer. The system was standardized using Abz-FR-OH prepared from the total tryptic hydrolysis of an Abz-FR-pNA solution; its concentration was determined from the absorbance at 410 nm assuming ε410 nm = 8,800m−1 cm−1 forp-nitroanilide. The concentrations of Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrate were determined by measuring the absorbance at 365 nm using ε365 nm = 17,300m−1 cm−1 for EDDnp. Specificity constants (k cat /K m) were determined under first-order conditions using a substrate concentration far below the K m (1–8 μm depending on the enzyme). Final enzyme concentrations were 10–50 nm for HNE and Pr3. Under these conditions, the Michaelis-Menten equation is reduced to v = k obs · S wherek obs =V m/K m. Integrating this equation over time gives ln[S] = −k obs ·t + ln[S]o with [S]o and [S] being the substrate concentrations at time 0 and time t, respectively. Because V m =k cat · [E]t where [E]t is the final enzyme concentration, dividing k obs by [E]t gave thek cat /K m ratio. Thek obs for the first-order substrate hydrolysis was calculated by fitting experimental data to the first-order law using Enzfitter software (Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam). HNE and Pr3 were titrated with α1-PI, the titer of which had been determined using bovine trypsin titrated withp-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate (20Serveau C. Moreau T. Zhou G.X., El- Moujahed A. Chao J. Gauthier F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cathepsin G was titrated with α1-antichymotrypsin (21Ermolieff J. Boudier C. Laine A. Meyer B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29502-29508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K m for the hydrolysis of Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrates by HNE and Pr3 was too high (>10 μm) to be determined by measuring the rates of hydrolysis at different substrate concentrations and fitting the to hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten rate equation. Therefore, we used two competing substrates whose hydrolysis products could be measured independently. Each substrate acts as a competitive inhibitor of the other under these mixed alternative substrates conditions. K m(obs) values of intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic substrates were obtained by measuring the dissociation constant (K i) toward a chromogenic paranitroanilide substrate. Assays were carried out by adding 10 nm HNE or Pr3 to a mixture of 0.1–1 mm MeO-Suc-AAPV-pNA whose K mare 0.085 (22Frommherz K.J. Faller B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15356-15362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.6 mm, 2J. Bieth, personal communication. respectively, and 0–100 μm fluorogenic Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp derivative. The hydrolysis of MeO-Suc-AAPV-pNA was monitored at 410 nm with <5% of substrate hydrolyzed. The velocity of the enzyme action is described by the following equation: vi/vo=(Km+S)/(Km(1+I/Ki)+S)Equation 1 with v i being the initial velocity at a given substrate concentration with Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp competitor,v o being the initial velocity at the same substrate concentration without competitor, K m being the Michaelis-Menten constant of the substrate, [S] being the chromogenic substrate concentration, and [I] being the Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrate concentration. The K i value corresponds to the observed Michaelis-Menten constant (K m(obs)) of Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrate as competitor. The methionyl residues in Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrates were selectively oxidized to methionyl sulfoxide with N-chlorosuccinimide (23Shechter Y. Burstein Y. Patchornik A. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4497-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The peptides (30 nmol) were incubated with a 5–10-fold molar excess of aqueousN-chlorosuccinimide in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, for 20 min at room temperature. UnreactedN-chlorosuccinimide was removed by HPLC on a C18 cartridge (2.1 × 30 mm, Brownlee, or 2 × 33 mm, Uptisphere) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min with a linear gradient (0–60%, v/v) of acetonitrile in 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid over 20 min. PMNs (5 × 103 to 5 × 104) were incubated in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Igepal CA-630 (v/v) with 5 μm Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrate in microplate wells at 37 °C. The fluorescence was recorded continuously using a microplate fluorescence reader (Spectra Max Gemini, Molecular Devices) under continuous stirring. The enzyme activity in supernatants obtained by washing PMNs in PBS was also assayed. The elastase inhibitor EPI-HNE4 developed by Debiopharm S.A. (Lausanne, Switzerland) was used at a final concentration of 0.1 μm and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with ∼104 cells before measuring residual elastase activity. Peptidyl-CMK inhibitors (2 mm stock solution in 30%N,N-dimethylformamide) were used at a final concentration of 10−4 to 5 × 10−4m and incubated for 60 or 120 min with ∼104m neutrophils or purified 10−9mHNE. Fluorogenic substrates (4–8 μm final) were incubated with HNE or Pr3 (10–100 nm) at 37 °C in reaction buffer. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 volumes of absolute ethanol and incubating for 15 min on ice. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the hydrolysis products was dried under vacuum and dissolved in 200 μl of 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Hydrolysis fragments were purified by reverse-phase chromatography on a C18 column (2.1 × 30 mm, Brownlee, or 2 × 33 mm, Uptisphere) using ThermoSeparation product P200 pump and a Spectrasystem UV3000 detector (ThermoSeparation product) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min with a linear gradient (0–60%, v/v) of acetonitrile in 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid over 20 min. Eluted peaks were monitored at three wavelengths (220, 320, and 360 nm) simultaneously, which allowed the direct identification of EDDnp-containing peptides prior to sequencing. Cleavage sites were identified by N-terminal sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 477A pulsed liquid sequencer with the chemicals and program recommended by the manufacturer. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were identified with an on-line model 120A analyzer. At least two serpin inhibitors, α1-PI (serpin A1) and MNEI (serpin B1), are potent inhibitors of HNE and Pr3. α1-PI is the main extracellular inhibitor of HNE in the lung (24McElvaney N.G. Hubbard R.C. Birrer P. Chernick M.S. Caplan D.B. Frank M.M. Crystal R.G. Lancet. 1991; 337: 392-394Abstract PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Its deficiency or inactivation by proteolytic cleavage or oxidation is clearly associated with the pathogenicity of several inflammatory lung diseases including emphysema (25Tetley T.D. Thorax. 1993; 48: 560-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Eriksson S. Chest. 1996; 110 (Suppl. 6): S237-S242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar). MNEI is an elastase inhibitor first found in the cytosol of human lung macrophages and blood monocytes (27Blondin J. Rosenberg R. Janoff A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1972; 106: 477-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It has since been identified as a serpin inhibitor of elastase-like and chymotrypsin-like proteases with two cleavage sites at Cys344 residue and at the adjacent Phe343 residue in its RSL (28Remold-O'Donnell E. Chin J. Alberts M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5635-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29Sugimori T. Cooley J. Hoidal J.R. Remold-O'Donnell E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15762-15770Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We first used fluorogenic peptides of different lengths derived from the RSL of these two inhibitors as substrates for HNE and Pr3 for measuring specificity constants (k cat/K m) (Fig.1). α1-PI-derived substrates were rapidly cleaved by HNE and Pr3 and to a lesser extent by cathepsin G (TableI). However, thek cat/K m for HNE was approximately one order of magnitude greater than that for Pr3, although the cleavage site was the same (Met-Ser bond) and identical to that in the RSL of the parent serpin. α1-PI-derived substrates that differ by the length of their peptide segments on the prime side had similar k cat/K m values regardless of the protease used with the exception of Pr3, which preferentially cleaved the shorter substrate (Table I). This observation suggests that residues beyond P3′ have little influence on the interaction between these proteases and their substrates.Table ISpecificity constants kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of fluorogenic substrates derived from the α1-PI and MNEI-reactive site loop by neutral serine proteases from PMN primary granulesSerpinSubstratek cat/K mProteinase 3ElastaseCathepsin Gmm−1 s−1α1-PIAbz-EAIPMSIPPEVKFNKQ-EDDnp63.8 ± 0.8aValues are the means ± S.D. of three experiments.893 ± 81aValues are the means ± S.D. of three experiments.13.1 ± 2.5bValues are the means ± S.D. of two experiments.Abz-EAIPMSIPQ-EDDnp120 ± 18bValues are the means ± S.D. of two experiments.936 ± 150aValues are the means ± S.D. of three experiments.9.2 ± 1.4bValues are the means ± S.D. of two experiments.Abz-EAIPM(o)SIPPEVKFNKQ-EDDnpn.s.h.n.s.h.n.d.Abz-EAIPM(o)SIPQ-EDDnpn.s.h.n.s.h.n.d.MNEIAbz-GIATFCMLMPEQ-EDDnp834 ± 109bValues are the means ± S.D. of two experiments.1520 ± 170bValues are the means ± S.D. of two experiments.263 ± 38bValues are the means ± S.D. of two experiments.Abz-TFCMLEQ-EDDnp295 ± 29aValues are the means ± S.D. of three experiments.209 ± 55aValues are the means ± S.D. of three experiments.3.2 ± 1.5bValues are the means ± S.D. of two experiments.Abz-GIATFCM(o)LM(o)PEQ-EDDnp11.4 ± 2.8bValues are the means ± S.D. of two experiments.9.2 ± 3.9bValues are the means ± S.D. of two experiments.22.1 ± 2.9bValues are the means ± S.D. of two experiments.Abz-TFCM(o)LEQ-EDDnp2.6 ± 1bValues are the means ± S.D. of two experiments.4.1 ± 0.2bValues are the means ± S.D. of two experiments.n.s.h.n.s.h., no significant hydrolysis; n.d., not determined.a Values are the means ± S.D. of three experiments.b Values are the means ± S.D. of two experiments. Open table in a new tab n.s.h., no significant hydrolysis; n.d., not determined. It was recently shown that MNEI uses either a Cys residue or a Phe residue at P1 in its reactive center loop (30Cooley J. Takayama T.K. Shapiro S.D. Schechter N.M. Remold-O'Donnell E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15762-15770Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We prepared two substrates from the RSL of MNEI, one being shortened on both sides of the peptidyl chain (Table I). HNE and Pr3 cleaved both substrates at the same C–M bond as in the parent molecule, although the shorter substrate, Abz-TFCMLQ-EDDnp, was hydrolyzed more slowly. However, Abz-TFCMLQ-EDDnp is the first sensitive substrate to be reported that is cleaved more efficiently by Pr3 than by HNE. Cathepsin G also cleaves MNEI-derived substrates but at the F–C bond in agreement with its substrate specificity. However, Abz-GIATFCMLMPEQ-EDDnp is cleaved more efficiently than Abz-TFCMLQ-EDDnp (Table I). It is possible that the sensitive bond within the shorter substrate is too close to the N terminus to allow efficient cleavage by cathepsin G (16Réhault S. Brillard-Bourdet M. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Moreau T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13810-13817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The oxidation of Met358 in the RSL of α1-PI reduced its capacity to inactivate HNE ∼2,000-fold (31Hubbard R. Crystal R. Crystal R. West J. The Lung. 2. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1991: 1775-1787Google Scholar). This phenomenon probably contributes to the protease-inhibitor imbalance at inflammatory sites where neutrophils release reactive forms of oxygen (3Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We looked at the effects of oxidizing the Met residues in α1-PI and MNEI-derived substrates, which have a Met residue at P1 and P1′, respectively, on the hydrolysis by HNE and Pr3. The hydrolysis of α1-PI-derived and MNEI-derived substrates was dramatically altered when they were oxidized with N-chlorosuccinimide. Thek cat/K m values were reduced by more than one order of magnitude (Table I). This finding suggests that the oxidative microenvironment at inflammatory sites also inactivates MNEI when this inhibitor is present locally. Adding native (unoxidized) substrate to the reaction mixture restored full activity, demonstrating that the trace amounts of N-chlorosuccinimide remaining in the oxidized substrate after HPLC did not interfere with the rate of hydrolysis. Several intracellular serpins in addition to MNEI have a Cys residue in their RSL, which makes them putative targets for HNE and Pr3. PI9 is found in the lung and other tissues and is reported to be a potent inhibitor of HNE that uses a cysteinyl residue at its reactive site (32Dahlen J.R. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PI9 also inhibits granzyme B (33Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B., De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and caspase1 (34Annand R.R. Dahlen J.R. Sprecher C.A., De Dreu P. Foster D.C. Mankovich J.A. Talanian R.V. Kisiel W. Giegel D.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) but uses a different site in its RSL for this purpose. The predicted reactive site in CrmA, a closely related viral homologue of PI9 that also inhibits caspase 1 and granzyme B, is an Asp or a Cys, even though the Asp residue is most certainly involved in the inhibition of these proteases (35Ray C.A.

Pickup D.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10377-10379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A Cys residue is also present in the RSL of the intracellular serpin inhibitor PI6, which is found in monocytes and granulocytes, and is a potent inhibitor of cathepsin G (37Scott F.L. Hirst C.E. Sun J. Bird C.H. Bottomley S.P. Bird P.I. Blood. 1999; 93: 2089-2097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of fluorogenic substrates covering the RSL of PI9 (Abz-VAECCQ-EDDnp), PI6 (Abz-MMRCAQ-EDDnp), and CrmA (Abz-VADCAQ-EDDnp) by HNE, Pr3 and cathepsin G were monitored. Cathepsin G did not cleave any of these substrates. The PI9-derived substrate was cleaved very efficiently by HNE and Pr3 (Table II) but HNE cleaved at the C–Q bond, whereas Pr3 cleaved at the C–C bond. Nevertheless, the specificity constants were similar (Table II). The PI6-derived substrate was preferentially cleaved by Pr3 with a single cleavage site at the C–A bond, but HNE also caused significant hydrolysis at the A–Q bond; the ratiok cat/K m(Pr3):k cat/K m(HNE) was ∼2.8 (Table II). The CrmA-derived substrate, Abz-VADCAQ-EDDnp, which also has the Cys-Ala pair in its reactive loop, was cleaved very efficiently by Pr3 but significantly more slowly by HNE (Table II). The ratiok cat/K m(Pr3)/k cat/K m(HNE) was ∼30. The difference depended mainly onk cat values, because the K mvalues are similar (Table III). The difference in kcat/Kmratio is high enough to selectively measure Pr3 activity in a biological sample containing similar concentrations of HNE and Pr3.Table IISpecificity constants kcat/Km for the hydr"
https://openalex.org/W2171560665,"Receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPvarsigma) is essential for neuronal development and function. Here we report that PTPvarsigma is a target of alpha-latrotoxin, a strong stimulator of neuronal exocytosis. alpha-Latrotoxin binds to the cell adhesion-like extracellular region of PTPvarsigma. This binding results in the stimulation of exocytosis. The toxin-binding site is located in the C-terminal part of the PTPvarsigma ectodomain and includes two fibronectin type III repeats. The intracellular catalytic domains of PTPvarsigma are not required for the alpha-latrotoxin binding and secretory response triggered by the toxin in chromaffin cells. These features of PTPvarsigma resemble two other previously described alpha-latrotoxin receptors, neurexin and CIRL. Thus, alpha-latrotoxin represents an unusual example of the neurotoxin that has three independent, equally potent, and yet structurally distinct targets. The known structural and functional characteristics of PTPvarsigma, neurexin, and CIRL suggest that they define a functional family of neuronal membrane receptors with complementary or converging roles in presynaptic function via a mechanism that involves cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2083956189,"Short and long myosin light chain kinases (MLCKs) are Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymes that phosphorylate the regulatory light chain of myosin II in thick filaments but bind with high affinity to actin thin filaments. Three repeats of a motif made up of the sequence DFRXXL at the N terminus of short MLCK are necessary for actin binding (Smith, L., Su, X., Lin, P., Zhi, G., and Stull, J. T. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 29433–29438). The long MLCK has two additional DFRXXL motifs and six Ig-like modules in an N-terminal extension, which may confer unique binding properties for cellular localization. Two peptides containing either five or three DFRXXL motifs bound to F-actin and smooth muscle myofilaments with maximal binding stoichiometries consistent with each motif binding to an actin monomer in the filaments. Both peptides cross-linked F-actin and bound to stress fibers in cells. Long MLCK with an internal deletion of the five DFRXXL motifs and the unique NH2-terminal fragment containing six Ig-like motifs showed weak binding. Cell fractionation and extractions with MgCl2 indicate that the long MLCK has a greater affinity for actin-containing filaments than short MLCK in vitro andin vivo. Whereas DFRXXL motifs are necessary and sufficient for short MLCK binding to actin-containing filaments, the DFRXXL motifs and the N-terminal extension of long MLCK confer high affinity binding to stress fibers in cells.

Both short and long MLCKs are expressed in embryonic and adult nonmuscle as well as smooth muscle cells; thus, terms such as embryonic and endothelial MLCKs are too restrictive. Identification by size is confusing because molecular mass can vary from 101,423 to 128,825 kDa for short MLCK from different animal species (9Jian X. Szaro B.G. Schmidt J.T. J.

For example, short MLCK from rabbit has a predicted mass of 125,719 but itsM r value is 150,000 kDa. MLCK isoforms are differentially expressed in smooth and striated muscles as well as nonmuscle cells (3Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. J. Muscle Res.

Physiol. 2000; 279: C1656-C1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, MLCK binds to actin thin filaments whereas its substrate, myosin, is in thick filaments (14Kanoh S. Ito M. Niwa E. Kawano Y. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8902-8907Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Dabrowska R. Hinkins S. Walsh M.P. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The actin-binding properties of the short MLCK are precisely identified with three repeated motifs of DFRXXL residues at the N terminus (1Smith L., Su, X. Lin P. Zhi G. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29433-29438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,16Hatch V. Zhi G. Smith L. Stull J.T. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Additional structural motifs in the short MLCK, including three immunoglobulin-like and one fibronectin module in addition to PEVK tandem repeats, do not appear to be involved in high-affinity binding to actin or myosin filaments (4Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The long MLCK is identical to the short MLCK except for an extended N terminus with two additional putative actin-binding motifs in tandem with the three demonstrated actin-binding motifs plus six additional immunoglobulin-like modules. Four of its five actin-binding motifs contain DFRXXL residues, whereas the most N-terminal motif contains a conservative substitution in one residue, DVRXXL. Because the short MLCK contains only DFRXXL and the conservative substitution of valine for phenylalanine occurs in only one of the five motifs, we will use a generic nomenclature of DFRXXL for all of these motifs. Although the actin-binding properties of short MLCK have been definedin vitro and in vivo (1Smith L., Su, X. Lin P. Zhi G. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29433-29438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Smith L. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Lin P.

Poperechnayaet al. (19Poperechnaya A. Varlamova O. Lin P.J. Stull J.T. Bresnick A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) found different distributions of the MLCKs in HeLa cells with short MLCK, primarily cytoplasmic, in contrast to long MLCK localized to stress fibers (19Poperechnaya A. Varlamova O. Lin P.J. Stull J.T. Bresnick A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, short MLCK was localized to stress fibers in fibroblasts and A7r5 cells (1Smith L., Su, X. Lin P. Zhi G. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29433-29438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5987-5994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additionally, specific localization of the long MLCK to the cleavage furrow in dividing cells required both the N-terminal extension with six Ig-like modules and five DFRXXL motifs. Many actin-binding proteins modulate the function of actin filaments (20Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, smooth muscle MLCK has been shown to cross-link actin filaments into bundles (22Kudryashov D.S. Chibalina M.V. Birukov K.G. Lukas T.J. Sellers J.R. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Shirinsky V.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Hayakawa K. Okagaki T.

Kohama K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the region of the kinase required for actin bundling has not been delineated. To address these issues, we expressed peptides containing either three or five actin-binding motifs and examined their biochemical propertiesin vitro and in vivo. In addition, we investigated binding properties of wild-type and mutated short and long MLCKs in vivo (Fig. 1). A short MLCK peptide containing residues 1–147 (3DFR-MLCK) was prepared using PCR and the expanded high fidelity system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A C-terminal His tag and a phosphorylation site corresponding to the recognition site for protein kinase A was included in the construct design as described (17Smith L. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The primers were designed based on the sequence of the cDNA of rabbit smooth muscleMLCK. PCR reactions were performed for 35 cycles of denaturing, annealing, and extension (95 °C, 45 s; 63 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 30 s). The final PCR product was digested with NheI and XhoI and subcloned into pET-24a expression vector (Novagen). An MLCK fragment containing the five actin-binding motifs of the long MLCK was used to prepare 5DFR-MLCK similar to 3DFR-MLCK. After the PCR reaction was performed as described above, the fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into pDsRed1-N1 (CLONTECH) to produce a red fluorescent protein fusion protein. Additionally the fragment was prepared containing a C-terminal His tag and a phosphorylation site corresponding to the recognition site for protein kinase A (17Smith L. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). pEGFP-MLCK210plasmid was originally constructed by Poperechnaya et al.(19Poperechnaya A. Varlamova O. Lin P.J. Stull J.T. Bresnick A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The full-length coding region for chicken smooth muscle longMLCK without a stop codon was inserted inpEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH Inc.) between the EGFP gene driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. Two extra guanine nucleotides were introduced immediately after 5718 nt of the long MLCK gene to maintain reading frames for the two genes. In cell studies, pEGFP-MLCK210 was used as wild-type control (long MLCK-GFP). The 5 DFRXXL region (2638 to 3033 nt) of long MLCK was deleted by PCR with the long MLCK-GFP plasmid as a template and using primer pairs 5′-GCAAAATGAAGATATCTTCACACTG-3′ and 5′-GCTAGCGGCGATCGCGAGTCTTCCTGCTCTTC-3′. In this fragment, an originalEcoRV site in the gene remained in the 5′ end and anNheI site was introduced in the 3′ end. After subcloning in TOPO vector (CLONTECH Inc.), a 0.28-kb fragment was produced by EcoRV and NheI digestion and ligated to long MLCK-GFP vector in which a region between 2638 and 3033 nt was removed by EcoRV and NheI digestion. The final construct ((-5DFR) long MLCK-GFP) was confirmed by sequencing. To delete the region that contains 5DFR and the full-length short form of MLCK (2638 to 5721 nt), a fragment corresponding to the region 2361 to 2637 nt was first amplified by PCR with primer pairs 5′-GCAAAATGAAGATATCTTCACACTG-3′ and 5′-GACGTCGACTAGGGATCCCCTTCCTGCTCTTCCTC-3′ and an EcoRV site and a BamHI site in the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively. This fragment was subcloned into TOPO vector and confirmed by sequencing. It was removed from TOPO vector by EcoRV andBamHI digestion and ligated with long MLCK-GFPvector that was previously digested with EcoRV andBamHI. The resultant fragment (N-term), longMLCK-GFP, contained the N-terminal six Ig-like motifs of long MLCK. Recombinant plasmids harboring3DFR-MLCK or 5DFR-MLCK were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside as described (17Smith L. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at 8,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 5 ml phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, and lysed by sonication at 4 °C. The lysed suspension was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was filtered with a 0.45-μm filter (Nalgene) and proteins were purified using histidine affinity column chromatography (Novagen). The purified proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and stored at −80 °C. GST fusion peptides containing one, two, or three DFRXXL motifs (GST-30, GST-55, and GST-75, respectively) were expressed and purified as described previously (1Smith L., Su, X. Lin P. Zhi G. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29433-29438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). DFR-MLCKs at 50 μm were phosphorylated at the C-terminal sequenceLRRASLG by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (5 μg/100-μl reaction) in the presence of 100 μm ATP (15 μCi) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Most of the unincorporated 32P was removed with spin columns containing buffer used in the binding assays as previously described (17Smith L. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Chicken gizzards were homogenized in 10 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.5 with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments). Homogenized tissue was centrifuged at 17,320 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were homogenized in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmMgCl2, and 3% Triton X-100 to dissociate endogenous MLCK. After washing in the detergent-containing buffer five times, the myofilaments were then washed three times in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol and stored in the same buffer on ice. A co-sedimentation assay was used to characterize MLCK binding to smooth muscle myofilaments. Phosphorylated DFR-MLCKs were mixed with 0.70 mg/ml myofilaments in a final volume of 150 μl. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reactions were centrifuged at 17,320 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of the supernatant fraction was spotted on cellulose filter paper. The filters were then washed in phosphoric acid to remove residual free ATP (17Smith L. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The total reaction mixture was treated similarly and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The decrease in radioactivity in the supernatant fractions compared with that in the total reaction mixtures was used to calculate the bound MLCK. There was no evidence of DFR-MLCK dephosphorylation upon incubation with myofilaments (17Smith L. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Values ofK D and B max were calculated for individual experiments subjected to Scatchard analysis. Binding to F-actin was performed as previously reported (17Smith L. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). F-actin from rabbit skeletal muscle was prepared (25Pollard T.D. Goldberg I. Schwarz W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20339-20345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of DFR-MLCK peptides (1–10 μm) were incubated with 6 μm F-actin at 25 °C, for 1 h in 10 mm MOPS, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet and supernatant fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an actin monoclonal antibody. The relative actin content in the pellet and supernatant fractions was quantified by densitometry. FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to transfect A7r5 or HeLa cells seeded in 60-mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 6 × 105 in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C and 12 μl of FuGENE 6 was mixed with 288 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The FuGENE/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium mixture was added to 3 μg of plasmid DNA. The mixture was then overlaid onto cells at 65–75% confluency. Cells were incubated 48–72 h at 37 °C. For transfection with LipofectAMINE Plus™ (Invitrogen), DNA was diluted into serum-free medium (4 μg of DNA was diluted into 750 μl of serum-free medium), and mixed with 20 μl of LipofectAMINE Plus reagent for 15 min. The pre-complexed DNA and the diluted LipofectAMINE reagent were mixed and incubated for 15 min and then incubated with A7r5 cells for 3 h, after which an additional 5 ml of complete medium was added to cells. Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2for 2 days before experiments. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For DNA transfection, NIH3T3 cells were seeded onto 40-mm round coverslips (40 circles-1D; Fisher) in 60-mm Petri dishes at 20–30% confluence 1 day before transfection. LipofectAMINE was used for DNA transfection as described above. COS-7 cells were transfected by similar procedures and harvested between 1 and 3 days. Fluorescence imaging was performed as described previously (26Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Twelve-bit images were obtained with a CCD camera (Quantix Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and Oncor-image software (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD). Narrow bandpass interference filters (Omega, Brattleboro, VT) were used to detect GFP (490 nm excitation and 520 nm emission) and rhodamine (550 nm excitation and 575 nm emission). During image collection, cells were kept at 37 °C in an open thermal-controlled chamber (Custom Scientific, Dallas, TX). Cells were subsequently treated with a buffer containing 0.02% saponin in 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 4 mm EGTA, 90 mmK+-gluconate, 5.3 mm Na2ATP, 5 mm MgS04, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mg/ml leupeptin for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed several times with the buffer in the absence of saponin and images were obtained. Medium was removed from tissue culture dishes and replaced with 10 μmlysophosphatidic acid or 1 μm latrunculin B in serum-free media for 1 h before microscopy. Populations of actin filaments in cells were separated by differential centrifugation (27Watts R.G. Howard T.H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 21: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1.0% Triton-X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0.2 mg/mltrans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(guanidino)butane). The lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 min. The pellet fraction contains Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton fibers (P1). The supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The second pellet fraction contains Triton-soluble filamentous actin (P2), whereas the supernatant fraction (S) contains soluble G-actin. The three fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Monoclonal antibodies against smooth muscle MLCK, GFP, or actin were used as primary antibodies and goat anti-mouse monoclonal secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase was used with the ECL system for visualization. Short and long MLCKs were dissociated from cellular actin filaments by MgCl2. In additional experiments short MLCK, long MLCK, 3DFR-MLCK, 5DFR-MLCK, (-5DFR) long MLCK, and (N-term) long MLCK as GFP fusion proteins were expressed in COS cells. A10 cells containing both short and long MLCKs or transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors, 0.5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate and 0.5 mm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(guanidino)butane. In additional experiments, rabbit lung tissue was homogenized in the same buffer (10 mg of tissue was homogenized in 600 μl of buffer). Appropriate aliquots from each sample were incubated in the lysis buffer with different concentrations of MgCl2 for 20 min on ice. The samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the supernatant fractions were diluted with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and further analyzed by Western blotting. We previously showed using a cosedimentation assay that the three DFRXXL motifs in the N terminus of short MLCK constitute high affinity binding of MLCK to actomyosin filaments from smooth muscle (1Smith L., Su, X. Lin P. Zhi G. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29433-29438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Smith L. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we focused on the properties of the two additional motifs found in long MLCK. Fig. 2 and TableI show that both MLCK peptides have similar K D values of about 0.25 μm. The stoichiometry of binding, on the other hand, was significantly different. The maximal amount of 5DFR-MLCK binding was 0.21 mol of peptide/mol of actin, whereas maximal binding for 3DFR-MLCK was 0.33 mol of peptide/mol of actin. Similar results were obtained with F-actin filaments (Table I). These results support a model in which each DFRXXL motif in both long and short MLCK binds per one actin monomer in actin filaments (16Hatch V. Zhi G. Smith L. Stull J.T. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Smith L. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The similarity in the apparentK D values for 3DFR-MLCK versus 5DFR-MLCK was surprising, so additional experiments were performed with expressed peptides as well as other MLCK fragments to measure binding to actin containing stress fibers (see below).Table IBinding properties of MLCK peptidesPeptideFilamentsK DB maxμmmol peptide/mol actin3DFR-MLCKMyofilaments0.30 ± 0.010.33 ± 0.01F-actin0.26 ± 0.010.30 ± 0.015DFR-MLCKMyofilaments0.25 ± 0.070.21 ± 0.01F-actin0.16 ± 0.010.18 ± 0.01The DFR-MLCK peptides were incubated with detergent-washed smooth muscle myofilaments or F-actin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After centrifugation the amount of bound peptide was measured for determination of K D andB max values as shown in Fig. 2.

Open table in a new tab The DFR-MLCK peptides were incubated with detergent-washed smooth muscle myofilaments or F-actin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After centrifugation the amount of bound peptide was measured for determination of K D andB max values as shown in Fig. 2. Numbers represent the mean ± S.E. for at least 5 measurements. To assess the ability of the DFRXXL motifs of MLCK to cross-link actin filaments without additional structural modules found in full-length kinases, we conducted a low speed centrifugation assay in which increasing concentrations of peptides were incubated with a fixed concentration of F-actin (6 μm). F-actin was not found in the pellet under these conditions but sediments when proteins cross-link filaments because of multiple actin-binding sites in a single polypeptide (20Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Bretscher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6849-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, the amount of actin obtained in the pellet fraction was similar for both 3DFR-MLCK and 5DFR-MLCK at similar concentrations of peptides. Fig. 3 B shows that a GST fusion protein containing one complete DFRXXL motif (GST30-MLCK) did not cross-link actin nor did GST itself. MLCK GST fusion peptide containing two DFRXXL motifs within residues 1–55 (GST55-MLCK) cross-linked 50% of the actin compared with ∼90% with GST75-MLCK that contains all three actin-binding motifs. The latter value was similar to maximal effects observed with 3DFR-MLCK and 5DFR-MLCK. These results indicate that the peptides containing multiple DFRXXL actin binding sequences and flanking residues are sufficient for cross-linking actin filaments. To analyze the localization of 3DFR-MLCK and 5DFR-MLCK in cultured cells, fluorescent proteins were fused to the C terminus of 3DFR-MLCK or 5DFR-MLCK, respectively. At similar levels of expression after transfection, the 3DFR-MLCK peptide localized to stress fibers in A7r5 cells, and 5DFR-MLCK displayed a similar pattern (Fig.4). However, 5DFR-MLCK appeared to have more prominent fluorescence staining on stress fibers in HeLa cells compared with 3DFR-MLCK. When cells were made permeable with saponin, the fluorescence remained associated with stress fibers for both peptides, indicating high affinity binding to actin-containing stress fibers. The fluorescence of GFP itself was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm, and treatment with saponin resulted in loss of fluorescence (data not shown) (1Smith L., Su, X. Lin P. Zhi G. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29433-29438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results show that peptides containing three or five DFRXXL motifs are sufficient for binding to actin filaments in both smooth and nonmuscle cells. To determine the unique motif or module responsible for long MLCK binding to actin filaments in vivo, expression vectors were constructed for expression of GFP fusion proteins. The full-length longMLCK-GFP showed binding to actin-containing stress fibers in cells (Fig. 5 A) confirming previous observations on localization (19Poperechnaya A. Varlamova O. Lin P.J. Stull J.T. Bresnick A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Internal deletion of the five DFRXXL motifs in the (-5 DFR) long MLCK-GFP construct resulted in fluorescence associated with stress fibers with similar result"
https://openalex.org/W1977356588,"SNAREs (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factorattachment protein receptors) are essential for vesicle docking and fusion. SNAP-25, syntaxin 1A, and synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) are SNARE proteins that mediate fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. It has been proposed that interactions of SNAP-25 with syntaxin 1A are required for initial membrane attachment of SNAP-25 (Vogel, K., Cabaniols, J.-P., and Roche, P. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 2959–2965). However, we have shown previously that residues 85–120 of the SNAP-25 interhelical domain, which do not interact with syntaxin, are necessary and sufficient for palmitoylation and plasma membrane localization of a green fluorescent protein reporter molecule (Gonzalo, S., Greentree, W. K., and Linder, M. E. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 21313–21318). To clarify the role of syntaxin in membrane targeting of SNAP-25, we studied a SNAP-25 point mutant (G43D) that does not interact with syntaxin. SNAP-25 G43D/green fluorescent protein was palmitoylated and localized at the plasma membrane. Newly synthesized SNAP-25 G43D had the same kinetics of membrane association as the wild-type protein. Furthermore, expression of a cytosolic mutant syntaxin 1A did not interfere with SNAP-25 membrane interactions or palmitoylation in the neuronal cell line NG108-15. Exogenously expressed SNAP-25 targets efficiently to the plasma membrane in cells of neuronal origin but only partially in HeLa cells, a neurosecretion-incompetent line. This phenotype was not rescued when syntaxin 1A was co-expressed with SNAP-25. Our data support a syntaxin-independent mechanism of membrane targeting for SNAP-25. SNAREs (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factorattachment protein receptors) are essential for vesicle docking and fusion. SNAP-25, syntaxin 1A, and synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) are SNARE proteins that mediate fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. It has been proposed that interactions of SNAP-25 with syntaxin 1A are required for initial membrane attachment of SNAP-25 (Vogel, K., Cabaniols, J.-P., and Roche, P. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 2959–2965). However, we have shown previously that residues 85–120 of the SNAP-25 interhelical domain, which do not interact with syntaxin, are necessary and sufficient for palmitoylation and plasma membrane localization of a green fluorescent protein reporter molecule (Gonzalo, S., Greentree, W. K., and Linder, M. E. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 21313–21318). To clarify the role of syntaxin in membrane targeting of SNAP-25, we studied a SNAP-25 point mutant (G43D) that does not interact with syntaxin. SNAP-25 G43D/green fluorescent protein was palmitoylated and localized at the plasma membrane. Newly synthesized SNAP-25 G43D had the same kinetics of membrane association as the wild-type protein. Furthermore, expression of a cytosolic mutant syntaxin 1A did not interfere with SNAP-25 membrane interactions or palmitoylation in the neuronal cell line NG108-15. Exogenously expressed SNAP-25 targets efficiently to the plasma membrane in cells of neuronal origin but only partially in HeLa cells, a neurosecretion-incompetent line. This phenotype was not rescued when syntaxin 1A was co-expressed with SNAP-25. Our data support a syntaxin-independent mechanism of membrane targeting for SNAP-25. Membrane trafficking is a fundamental cellular process that must operate with high fidelity to maintain organelle identity, cell function, and viability. Integral membrane proteins referred to as SNAREs 1Abbreviations: SNAREs, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MTD, membrane-targeting domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SNAP-25, synaptosomal protein of 25 kDa; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; TMD, transmembrane domain. (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factorattachment protein receptors) are important elements in this process, participating in the docking and fusion of vesicles with target membranes (1Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). The hallmark of SNARE proteins is the presence of one or more α-helices in the cytoplasmic domain, which have a propensity to form coiled-coils (reviewed in Refs. 2Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12227-12229Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and3Hay J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Pairing between cognate SNAREs on opposing membranes results in the formation of a parallel four-helix bundle that brings the membranes together to allow fusion (4Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 5Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). At the neuronal synapse, the SNARE complex is formed between SNAP-25 and syntaxin, localized on the presynaptic membrane, and synaptobrevin/VAMP, localized on the vesicle membrane (1Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). The central role that SNAP-25 plays in this complex is evident from the impairment of neuronal secretion by botulinum neurotoxin A/E, a toxin that proteolytically inactivates SNAP-25 (6Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Moreover, loss of SNAP-25 expression in mice results in embryonic lethality late in gestation with evoked neurotransmitter release absent at the neuromuscular junction and central synapses (7Washbourne P. Thompson P. Carta M. Costa E. Mathews J. Lopez-Bendito G. Molnar Z. Becher M. Valenzuela C. Partridge L. Wilson M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Each membrane compartment appears to be associated with a unique set of SNAREs, thereby contributing to the specificity of membrane fusion. The mechanisms by which SNAREs are targeted to their resident membranes are only beginning to be understood. Most syntaxin and synaptobrevin/VAMP family members are classified as tail-anchored proteins based on the presence of a transmembrane segment at the C terminus. Studies of synaptobrevin and other vesicle-associated SNAREs (vSNAREs) demonstrate that these proteins are initially targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and then sorted to their ultimate destinations (8Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 9Wattenberg B. Lithgow T. Traffic. 2001; 2: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The SNAP-25 family of SNAREs, SNAP-25a and b, SNAP-23, and SNAP-29, is structurally distinct from the tail-anchored SNAREs (3Hay J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and thus uses different mechanisms for membrane localization. The tail-anchored SNARES have a single cytoplasmic coiled-coil domain or SNARE motif, whereas SNAP-25 family members have two SNARE motifs that are connected by an interhelical domain (5Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 are palmitoylated at a cluster of cysteine residues in the interhelical domain (10Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Koticha D.K. Huddleston S.J. Witkin J.W. Baldini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9053-9060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Vogel K. Roche P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Many soluble proteins rely on fatty acylation for membrane association (13Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 14Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), and there is evidence to support a similar functional role for SNAP-25 palmitoylation. Our study of the native protein in PC12 cells revealed that palmitoylation of newly synthesized SNAP-25 coincides temporally with its membrane association (15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Moreover, palmitoylation and membrane association of the newly synthesized protein are sensitive to Brefeldin A, suggesting that these events are coupled and depend on an intact secretory pathway (15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation-defective mutants of SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 are found predominately in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (11Koticha D.K. Huddleston S.J. Witkin J.W. Baldini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9053-9060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, palmitoylation-defective forms of SNAP-25 can be targeted to membranes when syntaxin 1A is present (18Vogel K. Cabaniols J.-P. Roche P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Washbourne P. Cansino V. Mathews J. Graham M. Burgoyne R. Wilson M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). SNAP-29 is not a substrate for palmitoylation, yet it behaves as an integral membrane protein in transfected cells (20Advani R.J. Bae H. Bock J.B. Chao D.S. Doung Y. Prekeris R. Yoo J. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10317-10324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that SNAP-29 is recruited to membranes through interactions with tail-anchored SNAREs (20Advani R.J. Bae H. Bock J.B. Chao D.S. Doung Y. Prekeris R. Yoo J. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10317-10324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Proteins such as SNAP-25 that are synthesized on soluble ribosomes and are substrates for palmitoylation must interact with a membrane-bound protein palmitoyltransferase. We proposed that interactions with syntaxin initiate membrane interactions that facilitate palmitoylation (15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, our subsequent study argued against this hypothesis (17Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We found that the first 35 amino acids in the interhelical domain of SNAP-25 are both necessary and sufficient to target a heterologous soluble protein to the plasma membrane in NG108-15 cells (17Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The membrane-targeting domain (MTD) begins with the cysteine-rich domain at residue 85 and continues for 35 amino acids to residue 120. Notably, this region is devoid of the α-helical domains of SNAP-25 that interact with syntaxin and synaptobrevin. These and other experiments lead us to propose a model whereby palmitoylation and plasma membrane targeting of SNAP-25 require interaction with an unidentified binding partner that interacts with the interhelical domain. Two recent reports have argued strongly for a syntaxin-dependent mechanism for membrane targeting of SNAP-25. Vogel et al. (18Vogel K. Cabaniols J.-P. Roche P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrated that newly synthesized SNAP-25 and syntaxin bind to each other while still in the cytoplasm. Initial membrane association of SNAP-25 in the presence of syntaxin was independent of the cysteine residues, suggesting that palmitoylation occurs after syntaxin-mediated membrane association (18Vogel K. Cabaniols J.-P. Roche P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Washbourne et al. (19Washbourne P. Cansino V. Mathews J. Graham M. Burgoyne R. Wilson M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reported that the cysteine residues of SNAP-25 are not required for membrane targeting when syntaxin 1A is expressed. Although membrane interactions of the MTD of SNAP-25 are clearly independent of syntaxin interactions, these authors have suggested that the MTD utilizes an alternative trafficking pathway that is not physiologically relevant to intact SNAP-25. In this study, we sought to clarify the role of syntaxin 1A in SNAP-25 localization in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines. We have also analyzed the localization and trafficking of a point mutant of full-length SNAP-25 that is unable to bind to syntaxin 1A. These studies have allowed us to test our hypothesis that plasma membrane localization of SNAP-25 is independent of syntaxin interactions in the context of the full-length protein. l-[35S]methionine/l-[35S]cysteine was purchased from Amersham Biosciences; [3H]palmitate was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma and stored at −20 °C as a 2 mg/ml stock in distilled water. Immune complexes were precipitated using Protein G-Sepharose from Amersham Biosciences. NG108-15 cells were purchased from ATCC (HB-12317). Anti-SNAP-25 monoclonal antibody (SMI81) was obtained from Sternberger Monoclonals (Baltimore, MD). HPC-1 monoclonal antibody specific for syntaxin 1A was obtained from mouse ascites as described previously (21Barnstable C. Hofstein R. Akagawa K. Dev. Brain Res. 1985; 20: 286-290Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Bennett M. Calakos N. Scheller R. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Dr. Michael Wilson (University of New Mexico) kindly provided the SNAP-25b wild-type and palmitoylation-defective cDNAs. The cDNAs encoding syntaxin 1A and the mutant lacking the transmembrane domain (syntaxin 1A-ΔTMD) were generously provided by Dr. Paul Roche (National Institutes of Health) (18Vogel K. Cabaniols J.-P. Roche P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Standard molecular biological techniques were used to manipulate DNA. The integrity of all of the constructs derived from PCR was verified by DNA sequencing. The peGFP-N vector that fuses the GFP coding region to the 3′ end of the insert was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Full-length SNAP-25 was inserted into peGFP-N3 as anEcoRI/BamHI fragment (1–206/GFP). The G43D mutation was created using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Design of the original palmitoylation-defective SNAP-25 mutation (Cys-SNAP-25) has been described previously (17Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All four cysteine residues in the protein were changed to glycine (C85G, C88G, C90G, C92G). The palmitoylation-defective mutant and the G43D mutant were cloned into the peGFP-N vector by taking advantage of the uniqueHindIII site at residue 142 of SNAP-25. For subcloning, residues 1–142 of the mutant constructs were inserted asXhoI/HindIII fragments into the 1–206/GFP construct also digested with XhoI/HindIII. NG108-15 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 150 units/ml penicillin, 50 units/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm hypoxanthine, 400 nm aminopterin, and 0.016 mm thymidine. PC12 cells were obtained from Dr. Phyllis Hanson (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and cultured in high glucose-Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 2 mm glutamine, 150 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells were obtained from Dr. Helen Piwnica-Worms (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and cultured in high glucose-Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 150 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown in 35- or 60-mm tissue culture plates coated with poly-l-lysine until 50–80% confluent. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed 24–48 h later. For epifluorescence, cells were washed in warmed Ringer’s buffer (155 mm sodium chloride, 3 mmpotassium chloride, 2 mm calcium chloride, 1 mmmagnesium chloride, 3 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 5 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.2) at 24 h post-transfection and mounted onto a microscope slide in a well created with Dow Corning vacuum grease filled with Ringer’s buffer. Cells were immediately visualized using a Zeiss Axioplane microscope coupled to an MRC-1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) with a ×63 oil immersion objective. For immunofluorescence, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in a freshly prepared solution of 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and 5% (w/v) sucrose for 10 min at room temperature, at 48 h post-transfection. Cells were washed twice with PBS, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin w/v, 1% normal goat serum v/v (Invitrogen) in PBS) for 10 min and washed once in blocking buffer. Nonspecific staining was blocked by incubating cells for 45 min at room temperature in blocking buffer. All antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. Cells were incubated in the appropriate primary antibody for 1 h, washed three times in blocking buffer, and incubated for 1 h with Alexa594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After incubation in secondary antibody, cells were washed three times in PBS and mounted onto slides with a drop of Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cells were examined as above. Confocal images were assembled as montages using Adobe PhotoShop 5.0 and 6.0. Cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and [3H]palmitate as described previously (15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cells were solubilized in a solution of 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 2 mm EDTA for 30 min on ice. Nuclei and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor (30 min at 4 °C). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody conjugated to Protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To detect radiolabeled proteins by fluorography, the gels were washed for 30 min in a solution of 1 m sodium salicylate and 15% methanol, dried, and exposed to film. Cells grown in 60-mm dishes were transfected with the appropriate constructs. Cells were washed in PBS at 48 h post-transfection and scraped into ice-cold PBS. Cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in a hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2% sucrose) with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml lima bean protease inhibitor, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and 10 μmNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone). After a 15-min incubation in ice, cells were homogenized with 19 passes through a ball-bearing homogenizer. Unbroken cells, nuclei, and other debris were pelleted at 800 ×g, and the resulting pellet was designated as P1. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, yielding a P100 and S100 fraction. The S100 fraction was centrifuged again to remove any residual particulates and mixed with an equal volume of 2× immunoprecipitation buffer. The P100 fraction was washed once in hypotonic buffer and suspended in immunoprecipitation buffer. Equal fractions of the S100 and P100 were either analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by fluorography or analyzed by immunoblotting. Our previous studies of SNAP-25 localization were carried out in PC12 or NG108-15 cells, neuronal cell lines that express native SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1A (15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of full-length SNAP-25 and the membrane-targeting domain fused to GFP in NG108-15 cells resulted in efficient membrane association that was dependent upon the palmitoylated cysteines (17Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, Vogelet al. (18Vogel K. Cabaniols J.-P. Roche P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) observed that in HeLa cells, which do not express SNAP-25 or syntaxin 1A, initial membrane association of exogenously expressed SNAP-25 depends on the presence of syntaxin 1A and is independent of cysteine residues in SNAP-25. We decided to examine this difference between neuronal and non-neuronal cells more closely. Localization of SNAP-25 in NG108-15 and PC12 cells was evaluated by immunofluorescence of the native protein (Fig.1A, panels a andc) or by epifluorescence of transfected SNAP-25/GFP (panels b and d). In all cases, SNAP-25 was concentrated at the plasma membrane and to a lesser extent on intracellular membranes. SNAP-25 also localized to the plasma membrane in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B, panels b andc) but not as completely as in NG108-15 or PC12 cells. The subcellular distribution of full-length SNAP-25 in transfected HeLa cells showed a more diffuse cytoplasmic staining, as was seen with both untagged SNAP-25 (panel b) and SNAP-25/GFP (panel c). The presence of a significant pool of cytoplasmic SNAP-25 was confirmed in immunoblots of soluble and particulate fractions derived from HeLa cells after subcellular fractionation (data not shown). These results establish that membrane targeting of SNAP-25 in non-neuronal cell types is not as efficient as in neuronal cells and suggest that neuronal cells have a factor required for membrane targeting that may be limiting in non-neuronal cells. To determine whether syntaxin 1A is a candidate for that limiting factor, we asked whether expression of syntaxin 1A in HeLa cells would increase the fraction of SNAP-25 associated with the plasma membrane. We transiently expressed syntaxin 1A and wild-type SNAP-25/GFP in HeLa cells and examined the localization of both proteins. Syntaxin 1A associated predominately with intracellular membranes (Fig.1B, panel e). We still observed a significant pool of cytoplasmic SNAP-25 in the cells that expressed syntaxin 1A and did not see a change in the amount of SNAP-25 associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B, panel d, andoverlay, panel f). We conclude from these experiments that expression of heterologous syntaxin 1A in HeLa cells does not significantly impact the localization of wild-type SNAP-25 in HeLa cells. Mutation of the four cysteine residues (Cys−) within the interhelical domain of SNAP-25 results in a protein that cannot be palmitoylated and is cytoplasmic (16Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4, panel b). Two groups have observed that expression of syntaxin 1A with palmitoylation-defective SNAP-25 rescues membrane association (18Vogel K. Cabaniols J.-P. Roche P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Washbourne P. Cansino V. Mathews J. Graham M. Burgoyne R. Wilson M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We reproduced these findings in NG108-15 cells, observing a redistribution of Cys-SNAP-25/GFP from the soluble to the particulate fraction with exogenously expressed syntaxin 1A (Fig.2A). The ability of syntaxin 1A to drive membrane interactions of the Cys-SNAP-25 construct was intriguing, and we sought to determine whether this interaction resulted in plasma membrane localization of the palmitoylation-defective SNAP-25. Syntaxin 1A and Cys− SNAP-25/GFP were cotransfected in NG108-15 cells and localized by indirect immunofluorescence or direct epifluorescence, respectively. Cys-SNAP-25/GFP was found in the cytoplasm and concentrated on intracellular membranes when co-expressed with syntaxin 1A (Fig.2B, panel d). The plasma membrane distribution of wild-type SNAP-25/GFP was unchanged with heterologous expression of syntaxin 1A (Fig. 2B, panel a). Intriguingly, we observed that in cells in which Cys-SNAP-25/GFP and syntaxin 1A were co-expressed, syntaxin 1A is redistributed from the plasma membrane onto intracellular membranes (Fig. 2B, panel e). We conclude that syntaxin 1A interactions are able to rescue membrane interactions of palmitoylation-defective SNAP-25 but not localization at the plasma membrane.Figure 2Heterologous expression of syntaxin 1A in NG108-15 results in an increase of cys− SNAP-25 associated with intracellular membranes. In A, subcellular fractions were prepared from NG108-15 cells co-transfected with syntaxin 1A and either wild-type (WT) or Cys− SNAP-25. Particulate (P) and soluble (S) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. In B, cells were also visualized by confocal microscopy. Wild-type SNAP-25/GFP (a) or Cys− SNAP-25/GFP (d) were detected by epifluorescence. Syntaxin was detected by immunofluorescence using the monoclonal HPC-1 antibody (b and e,red). Images were merged (c and f) to show the overlap between SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of syntaxin 1A to target palmitoylation-defective SNAP-25 to an intracellular membrane compartment is consistent with the model proposed by Vogelet al. (18Vogel K. Cabaniols J.-P. Roche P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), that syntaxin interactions are required for initial membrane targeting of SNAP-25. If this model is correct, then the syntaxin-independent targeting of the SNAP-25 MTD (residues 85–120) to membranes must occur by a distinct mechanism. Because the MTD is a non-native truncated protein, we studied the syntaxin-independent pathway using a model that is more closely related to the native protein. Mutation of glycine 458 to aspartic acid in Sec9p, the SNAP-25 homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, abrogates its interactions with the syntaxin 1 homologue Sso1p in vivo and in vitro (23Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keranen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 24Rossi G. Salminen A. Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Brennwald P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16610-16617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The corresponding mutation in SNAP-25 at Gly-43 results in a protein that is unable to bind syntaxin 1A in vitro (25Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The glycine at residue 43 accommodates the bulky phenylalanine in syntaxin 1A at residue 216 in the hydrophobic core of the SNARE four-helix bundle. Mutation of Gly-43 to Asp disrupts packing through steric and electrostatic forces (26Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). To confirm that this mutation also inhibits SNAP-25/syntaxin interactions in cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 3A). Chimeric SNAP-25/GFP constructs were created with the GFP moiety at the C terminus of SNAP-25 and transfected into NG108-15 cells, which express syntaxin 1A. The resulting lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody and probed for native syntaxin 1A using the HPC-1 monoclonal antibody. Native syntaxin 1A readily co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type and Cys-SNAP-25 but was not detected in immunoprecipitates with SNAP-25 G43D (Fig.3A, upper panel). The same Western blots probed with anti-GFP antibody showed that all GFP-tagged proteins were present in similar amounts in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3A,lower panel). It has been reported that the interaction of SNAP-25 with syntaxin is important for palmitoylation of SNAP-25 in an in vitro assay (27Veit M. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine whether this is true in vivo, we examined whether palmitate incorporation into SNAP-25 G43D was reduced when compared with the wild-type protein. As shown in Fig. 3B(lower panel), SNAP-25 G43D was palmitoylated in vivo at levels similar to the wild-type protein. Thus, syntaxin interactions are not required for palmitoylation of SNAP-25. We have shown previously that palmitoylation of SNAP-25 is inhibited by Brefeldin A, indicating that modification of the protein is dependent on an intact secretory pathway (15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2025468006,"We showed previously that protein kinase C (PKC) is required for phagocytosis of apoptotic leukocytes by murine alveolar (AMø) and peritoneal macrophages (PMø) and that such phagocytosis is markedly lower in AMø compared with PMø. In this study, we examined the roles of individual PKC isoforms in phagocytosis of apoptotic thymocytes by these two Mø populations. By immunoblotting, AMø expressed equivalent PKC η but lower amounts of other isoforms (α, βI, βII, δ, ε, μ, and ζ), with the greatest difference in βII expression. A requirement for PKC βII for phagocytosis was demonstrated collectively by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced depletion of PKC βII, by dose-response to PKC inhibitor Ro-32-0432, and by use of PKC βII myristoylated peptide as a blocker. Exposure of PMø to phosphatidylserine (PS) liposomes specifically induced translocation of PKC βII and other isoforms to membranes and cytoskeleton. Both AMø and PMø expressed functional PS receptor, blockade of which inhibited PKC βII translocation. Our results indicate that murine tissue Mø require PKC βII for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, which differs from the PKC isoform requirement previously described in Mø phagocytosis of other particles, and imply that a crucial action of the PS receptor in this process is PKC βII activation."

It also elevates cAMP in murine peritoneal macrophages. We now report that a significant elevation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) occurs in α2M*-stimulated cells, and this effect is potentiated by isobutylmethylxanthine, dibutyryl-cAMP, or forskolin. An α2M* concentration-dependent rapid increase in phosphorylated CREB at Ser133 also occurred, a necessary event in its activation.

To elucidate the role of cAMP signaling in cellular physiology and homeostasis, several studies have used genetic manipulations in intact animals and cell systems.

The mediators of sequence-specific messenger RNA degradation are 21–23-nt small interfering RNA fragments generated by ribonuclease III cleavage from longer double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) (31Tuschl T.

To date, these techniques have not been employed with primary macrophages. α2M* binding to macrophages significantly raises cAMP levels (12Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); therefore, we examined the role of CREB in α2M*-induced macrophage proliferation. We studied phosphorylation of CREB and the protein kinases involved in its phosphorylation, and analyzed Ras family members in murine macrophages treated with either α2M* or cAMP-elevating agents. We report in the current study that treatment of macrophages with α2M* elevated the levels of CREB as well as phosphorylated CREB and caused a 1.5–2-fold increase in macrophage cell number at 24 h of incubation. These effects were potentiated by dibutyryl-cAMP, IBMX, or forskolin. The maximal phosphorylation of CREB in α2M*-treated cells occurred at ∼10–20 min of incubation. α2M* elevated phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and other MAPKs as well as Rap-1, Raf-1, Raf-B, and p70s6k protein levels. These effects were potentiated by dibutyryl-cAMP or forskolin treatment of cells. Pharmacological intervention with agents that affect various protein kinases affected phosphorylation of CREB, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and cellular growth. To elucidate further the role of CREB, the target of cAMP signaling, in the proliferation of α2M*-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, we have transfected macrophages with dsRNA homologous in sequence to the CREB gene and have measured various parameters of cell macrophage proliferation. To our knowledge, this is the first use of RNA interference in a primary cell line; we find that silencing of the CREB gene in these α2M*-stimulated cells drastically reduces cell proliferation. We thus show here that the mitogenic and cell proliferative responses of murine peritoneal macrophages treated with α2M* are primarily mediated by cAMP and cAMP-dependent signaling cascades.

CREB protein bands on the membrane were visualized by ECF (AmershamBiosciences) and quantified using a Storm® 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Experiments were performed to determine the effects of modulating of α2M*-induced CREB expression by actinomycin D (5 μg/ml, 10 min), a transcriptional inhibitor, or BAPTA/AM (10 μm/30 min), a chelator of intracellular Ca2+. For these studies, compounds were added to separate wells that were incubated for the specified time period at 37 °C before adding α2M* (100 pm). Other details of quantifying CREB were as described above. Phosphorylation of CREB protein at Ser-133 was measured using a specific antibody that detects CREB phosphorylated at this residue. Macrophages (2 × 106 cells/well) were incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA. The cells were washed twice with HHBSS, and a volume of medium was added, followed by the additions of α2M* (100 pm), dibutryrl-cAMP (1 mm), forskolin (20 μm), or IBMX (100 μm), either alone or in combination with α2M* in separate experiments. The cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with CO2 (5%). Other details of cell lysis, electrophoresis, and membrane transfer were as described above. The membrane was immunoblotted with antibody against phosphorylated CREB (1:3000 dilution), and phosphorylated CREB spots on the membranes were visualized by ECF and quantified by a PhosphorImager. In experiments where the effect of time of incubation of cells with α2M* on CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133 was examined, the cells (2 × 106 cells/well) were treated with α2M* (100 pm) and incubated as above. At the specified times, the reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium, and the cells were washed with cold HHBSS and treated with lysis buffer as described above. Other details of quantifying phosphorylated CREB are described above. CREB is the immediate downstream target protein of PKA, which phosphorylates it at Ser-133; however, CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133 is also brought about by other kinases as noted above (18Montminy M.

At the end of the incubation, α2M* (100 pm), dibutyryl-cAMP (1 mm), forskolin (20 μm), or IBMX (100 μm), either alone or in combination with α2M*, were added to separate wells, and the incubation continued for an additional 20 min as above. Other details of cell lysis, electrophoresis, and membrane transfer were as described above. The membrane was immunoblotted with antibody against phosphorylated CREB (1:3000 dilution), and phosphorylated CREB was visualized by ECF and quantified by a PhosphorImager. Murine peritoneal macrophages (4 × 105 cells/well) in 48-well plates, harvested as above, were allowed to adhere for 2 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. The monolayers were washed twice with HHBSS, and a volume of RPMI medium was added, followed by the addition of [3H]thymidine.

The cells were incubated overnight in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. The incubations were terminated by aspirating the medium and washing macrophages twice first with 5% trichloroacetic acid (15 min/40 °C) and then three times with HHBSS. The monolayers were lysed with 1n NaOH, and an aliquot was used for liquid scintillation counting and protein estimation (8Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

Since increased DNA synthesis is generally associated with an increase in total cellularity, the number of macrophages present 0, 24, and 48 h after exposure to α2M* (100 pm) or forskolin (20 μm) either alone or together was determined. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested and allowed to adhere in four-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 2 h as described above. The adhered cells were carefully scraped, centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min, and suspended in a volume of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA, and 1-ml aliquots (3 × 105 cells) were pipetted into 15-ml siliconized polypropylene tubes. To the respective tubes, α2M* (100 pm), forskolin (20 μm), or α2M* (100 pm) with forskolin (20 μm) was added, and the contents were gently mixed and incubated for 24 and 48 h as above. After the specified period of incubation, an aliquot was removed from each tube, trypan blue was added, and the contents were gently shaken during incubation for 2 min. A 10-μl aliquot was then employed for counting the number of cells in a hemocytometer. The cell numbers were corrected for dead cells. Ch"

E., Javaid, Z. Z., Lane, L. K., and Blostein, R. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 23086–23092). To delimit the region of the cytoplasmic N terminus involved in these interactions, the consequences of a series of N-terminal deletions of α1 beyond Δ32 were evaluated. Criteria to assess shifts in conformational equilibrium were based on effects of perturbation of the entire catalytic cycle ((i) sensitivity to vanadate inhibition, (ii) K+ sensitivity of Na-ATPase measured at micromolar ATP, (iii) changes in K′ATP, and (iv) catalytic turnover), as well as estimates of the rates of the conformational transitions of phospho- and dephosphoenzyme (E1P → E2P and E2(K+) → E1 + K+). The results show that, compared with α1M32, the deletion of up to 40 residues (α1M40) further shifts the poise toward E1. Remarkably, further deletions (mutants α1M46, α1M49, and α1M56) reverse the effect, such that these mutants increasingly resemble the wild type α1. These results suggest novel intramolecular interactions involving domains within the N terminus that impact the manner in which the N terminus/M2-M3 loop regulatory domain interacts with the M4-M5 catalytic loop to effect E1 ↔ E2 transitions.

The Na,K-ATPase or sodium pump is a ubiquitous integral membrane protein that catalyzes the glycoside sensitive, ATP-coupled exchange of three intracellular Na+ for two extracellular K+ ions across the plasma membrane of all animal cells. The sodium pump is essential to the maintenance of the electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+ across the cell membrane, providing the driving force for the transport of nutrients into the cell and maintaining the cellular resting membrane potential. It comprises two essential subunits: a large catalytic α subunit (∼100 kDa), containing the ligand binding and phosphorylation sites and a smaller, highly glycosylated β subunit (∼35–55 kDa), which acts as a chaperone for α (for review see Refs. 1Sweadner K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 185-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar and 2Lingrel J.B. Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A third subunit, γ (∼7 kDa), was found in the kidney where it functions as a regulator of the pump (see Refs. 3Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush B.3 rd. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar and 4Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sodium pump is a member of a family of transporters known as P-type ATPases that are directly phosphorylated and dephosphorylated on a conserved aspartate residue within their cytoplasmic domain during the course of the reaction cycle. Both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of the enzyme can exist in at least two states that undergo conformational transitions (E1P → E2P and E2 → E1) that are coupled to the ion-translocating steps. Definitive evidence for distinct E1 and E2 conformational states and a role of the N terminus in effecting E1 ↔ E2transitions was first obtained in 1975 by Jorgensen (5Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 401: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 6Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 466: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using tryptic cleavage of the renal enzyme in the presence of different ligands. Later confirmatory evidence was obtained using N-terminal deletion mutants expressed in cultured cells (7Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study showed that whereas deleting up to and including the lysine-rich cluster is without effect, removal of 32 residues (mutant α1M32) alters the enzyme kinetics by shifting the E1/E2conformational equilibrium toward E1 forms. Interestingly, a similar shift toward E1 is caused by Glu233→ Lys substitution in the first (M2-M3) cytoplasmic loop. Furthermore, the combined removal of the N-terminal 32 residues and replacement of Glu233 → Lys (mutant α1M32E233K) results in a remarkably synergistic shift in poise toward E1state(s) as evidenced in analyses of several characteristic properties including, for examples, extraordinary insensitivity to vanadate, high affinity for ATP (5 μm), and slow (≤500 min−1) catalytic turnover of α1M32E233K. These findings were interpreted to indicate that interactions between these two cytoplasmic regions and the M4-M5 catalytic loop are critical for conformational coupling (8Boxenbaum N. Daly S.E. Javaid Z.Z. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23086-23092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The present study was carried out to define more precisely the role of the N terminus in conformational transitions. Accordingly, we investigated the consequences of further deletions of the N terminus of the Na,K-ATPase beyond the first 32 residues to near the beginning of the first transmembrane segment, using several criteria to assess shifts in the steady-state E1 ↔ E2 poise. The results of this analysis reveal a progressively increased shift in the E1/E2 poise toward E1, followed by reversal toward the wild type α1 E1/E2 distribution. Combined with secondary structure predictions of the N terminus, this behavior identifies a self-regulatory domain within the N terminus of the Na,K-ATPase that modulates conformational transitions via novel intramolecular interactions. Predictions of the secondary structure of the N-terminal sequence were evaluated using the following algorithms: PREDATOR (9Frishman D. Argos P. Prot.

Putative helical regions were then ascribed to those sequences for which the above algorithms concur on helicity. The desired mutations were introduced into the 5′SacI230-SalI875restriction fragment cassette of the rat α1 cDNA as described previously (7Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant cassettes were then ligated into the rat α1 cDNA in the place of the wild typeSacI-SalI cassette. The full-length mutant cDNAs were released form the shuttle vector by digestion withHindIII, ligated into the expression plasmid pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and orientation of the cDNA was determined by restriction analysis. HeLa cells were transfected with the pCDNA-α1 mutant constructs using either the calcium phosphate method (18Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar) or the LipofectAMINE technique (Invitrogen), and cells expressing the relatively ouabain-resistant rat α1 enzymes and mutants thereof were selected as described previously (19Jewell E.A.

HeLa cells expressing the mutant α1 enzymes were amplified in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% newborn calf serum, 100 units/mg penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μm ouabain as described previously (7Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The above medium was initially supplemented with an additional 15 mm KCl (20 mm total; see Ref. 21Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol.

NaI-treated microsomal membranes were prepared from the mutant cells as described earlier (19Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase activity was measured as the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP as previously described (23Blostein R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly and unless indicated otherwise, the membranes were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with all reactants added except [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. Final concentrations for Na,K-ATPase activity measurements were 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 3 mmMgSO4, 20 mm histidine (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.4), and 5 μm ouabain (SIGMA). 5 mm ouabain was used to determine baseline hydrolysis activity. As in earlier studies and unless indicated otherwise, assays of Na,K-ATPase activity were carried out using 1 mm ATP to maintain close to saturating ATP concentration and also maximize sensitivity of assays of the relatively low activity cultured cells (see Refs. 20Lane L.K.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with varying amounts of added KCl and choline chloride to maintain constant chloride (40 mm) concentration, and baseline activity was determined with 40 mm KCl. For studies of vanadate sensitivity, inorganic orthovanadate (Fisher) solutions were prepared prior to the experiment and added with the [γ-32P]ATP solution to initiate the reaction. Na,K-ATPase activities obtained at various vanadate concentrations and expressed as percentage of that obtained in the absence of vanadate, were analyzed by fitting the data to a one-compartment model using a non-linear least-square analysis of a general logistic function, as described elsewhere (26DeLean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoenzyme levels were determined as described earlier (25Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (∼0.01 mg/assay) were preincubated with ouabain (20 μm ouabain, 0.4 mm MgSO4, and 10 mmglycylglycine-Tris (pH 7.4)) for 10 min at 37 °C to inhibit endogenous HeLa Na,K-ATPase. The suspension was then treated with either oligomycin (20 μg/ml) for 1 min at room temperature or with vehicle alone (ethanol) for baseline measurements (see below). Phosphorylation was then carried out for 10 s at 0 °C in a final volume of 150 μl in medium comprising (final concentrations) 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm glycylglycine-Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, and 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 10,000–20,000 cpm/pmol). Baseline EP levels were determined by replacing 100 mm NaCl with 50 mm KCl and 50 mm choline chloride, and phosphorylating the enzyme in the absence of oligomycin. The rate of K+deocclusion (E2(K+) → E1 + K+) was measured indirectly by determining the rate of E1 formation from E2(K+) as described elsewhere (25Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with the modifications described by Therien and Blostein (27Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C891-C898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following formation of E1P in the presence of high chloride concentration (28Klodos I. Post R.L. Forbush 3rd., B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1734-1743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rate of E1P → E2P was determined by measuring the rate of disappearance of total phosphoenzyme following rapid dilution of the salt (to allow normal relaxation of E1P → E2P) plus addition of KCl to catalyze rapid hydrolysis of E2P (28Klodos I.

Accordingly, the enzyme was first phosphorylated in medium containing 600 mm NaCl to stabilize E1P, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 30 s at 0 °C to obtain maximal phosphoenzyme. Dephosphorylation was then initiated by 6-fold dilution with a chase medium containing final concentrations of 20 mm KCl, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), which simultaneously lowered the NaCl concentration to 100 mm. Samples were taken for measurement of E32P for periods of up to 30 s. Background phosphoenzyme levels were obtained by allowing the chase to continue for 60 s. At least two different membrane preparations obtained from at least two different clones were assayed. The data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. Each value shown is the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. To determine more precisely the structural basis and mechanism underlying the role of the cytoplasmic N terminus of the α1 catalytic subunit of the Na,K-ATPase on the steady-state E1→ E2 conformational poise, we first considered the nature of the secondary structure of this 85-residue N-terminal domain. This region is a highly charged, flexible structure with a high degree of helicity. A comparison of the results of several computational analyses (see “Experimental Procedures”) reveals the presence of three putative α-helical domains encompassing residues 27–33, 42–50 and 61–68 (Fig. 1). To remove or disrupt these regions, wild type HeLa cells were transfected with N-terminal deletion mutants of the α1 subunit of the rat Na,K-ATPase corresponding to either disruption or loss of the first putative helix (α1M32 and α1M40, respectively) and disruption (α1M46 and α1M49) or loss (α1M56) of the second helix (Fig. 1). All five of the mutant constructs yielded functional enzyme capable of sustaining HeLa cell growth in 1 μm ouabain. Several criteria were used to analyze shifts in the E1/E2 distribution: some that reflect the operation of the overall catalytic cycle and others that reflect partial reactions relevant to the major E1 ↔ E2 and E1P ↔ E2P transitions. The former include: (i) sensitivity of Na,K-ATPase activity to inhibition by vanadate, (ii) response of Na-ATPase to varying K+concentrations relevant to the normally rate-limiting E2(K+) → → E1 + K+, (iii) catalytic turnover, and (iv) K′ATP relevant to low affinity ATP binding to E2(K+). The latter include: (v) rate of K+ deocclusion [E2(K+) → → E2 + K+] (see (ii) above), and (vi) rate of E1P → E2P as outlined in “Experimental Procedures.” Compared with the wild type α1 enzyme, the poise in E1 ↔ E2 of the α1M32 deletion mutant is notably shifted toward E1 forms of the enzyme (7Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the effects of further deletions on conformational equilibrium, we investigated the effect of vanadate on Na,K-ATPase activity. Inorganic orthovanadate is a transition state analog of inorganic phosphate that binds to P-type ATPases in the E2conformation (30Cantley Jr., L.C. Cantley L.G. Josephson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7361-7368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, sensitivity of an enzyme to inhibition by vanadate is a measure of the proportion of enzyme in the E2 conformation. As shown by the representative experiment in Fig. 2 and summarized in TableI, α1M32 and α1M40 are both less sensitive to vanadate inhibition than is α1, suggesting that the E1/E2 equilibrium of these enzymes progressively shifts toward E1 as up to 40 residues are deleted from the N terminus. However, this shift is reversed to a more wild type-like sensitivity by deleting ≥46 residues (mutants α1M46, α1M49, and α1M56).Table ISummary of kinetic behavior of Na,K-ATPase mutants during steady-state catalysisEnzymeI50vanadateaI50 values taken from the representative experiment shown in Fig. 2.Effect of 1 mm K+ on Na-ATPasebActivity with 1 mmK+ presented as percent of control activity without K+(data from representative experiment in Fig. 3).TurnoverV MAX/EPMAXcCatalytic turnover was determined as the ratio of maximal Na,K-ATPase activity measured at 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm ATP to maximal phosphoenzyme measured at 0 °C in the presence of 100 mm NaCl and oligomycin (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Open table in a new tab At micromolar ATP concentrations, sufficient to saturate only the high affinity phosphorylation site, the response of Na-ATPase to K+ is a sensitive means to characterize mutant-specific differences in the K+ deocclusion pathway of the reaction cycle (E2(K+) → → E1 + K+], which becomes rate-limiting under these conditions (7Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as shown previously and in Fig.3, K+ inhibits the Na-ATPase activity of α1 but stimulates that of α1M32. The deletion of 40 residues, α1M40, results in an even greater K+stimulation, up to ∼400%. Interestingly, further deletion,i.e. α1M46, α1M49, and α1M56, yields α1-like K+ inhibition. These results, summarized in Table I, suggest a progressive shift in the E1/E2conformational equilibrium toward E1 upon removal of up to 40 residues from the N terminus, which is reverted by deleting ≥46 residues. The catalytic turnover of the Na,K-ATPase is estimated as the ratio ofV MAX to EPMAX, the latter measured at 0 °C in the presence of ATP, Na+, and oligomycin to trap the enzyme in the (Na+)E1P state (see “Experimental Procedures”) (32Esmann M. Skou J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Table I shows the catalytic turnover of α1 and the mutant enzymes. As previously shown, α1M32 has ∼50% reduction in turnover, consistent with a shift in the E1 ↔ E2 poise toward E1. α1M40 has a significantly lower turnover, only 20% that of α1. In contrast, deletion of ≥46 residues restores the catalytic turnover to near that of α1. Differences in K+ sensitivity of Na-ATPase at low ATP con-centration (Fig. 3) suggest a change in the rate of a step in the K+ deocclusion phase of the Albers-Post reaction mechanism, which can be modeled by a branched pathway (see Scheme 1 in Ref. 33Sachs J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1193: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In one branch, pathway A, ATP first binds with low affinity denoted by K′ATP(L), to the K+ occluded enzyme, followed by rapid deocclusion (ATP·E2(K+) → ATP·E1·K → ATP·E1 + K+). In the other branch, pathway B, the slow release of K+ from E2(K+) via E2(K+) → E1·K+ → E1 + K+ is followed by high affinity ATP binding to E1. Accordingly, a mutation causing a change in K+ stimulation of Na-ATPase at micromolar ATP concentration may reflect a change in K′ATP(L) (pathway A) and/or a change in rate of the second pathway (pathway B). Fig. 4 shows that both α1M32 and α1M40 have significantly higher apparent affinities for low affinity ATP binding compared with α1 (see K′ATP(L) values in Table I). In contrast, α1M46 and α1M49 have K′ATP(L)values similar to that of the wild type α1 enzyme, consistent with the observed reversal of the K+ effect on Na-ATPase at 1 μm ATP. It was noted, however, that the K′ATP(L) of α1M56 is lower that that of α1 even though this enzyme is inhibited by K+ at low ATP. This characteristic of α1M56 is considered further in the “Discussion.” In another series of experiments we compared the slow release of K+ from E2(K+) via the branch E2(K+) → E1·K+ → E1 + K+ for each of the mutants. As in our earlier studies (25Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C891-C898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we used an indirect approach whereby the relatively slow rate of E1formation from E2(K+) is estimated at various periods following dilution of preformed E2(K+) in Na+ medium containing [γ-32P]ATP at 10 °C. Assuming that the ensuing phosphorylation of E1is rapid, the amount of phosphoenzyme (presumably Na·E1P since oligomycin is present to trap this intermediate) is thus a measure of E1 formed from E2(K+). As shown in Fig.5, the changes in E2(K+) deduced from the increases in E1P, fit well to single exponentials. The rate constants for α1M32 and α1M40 shown in Table IIare significantly higher than that of α1. (Rate constants are similar to our previously published values for α1 and α1M32, Ref. 25Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This result suggests that for both α1M32 and α1M40 the E2(K+) ↔ ↔ E1 + K+poise is shifted to the right. On the other hand, values for α1M46, α1M49, and α1M56 are similar to, or even lower than, those for α1M32 and α1M40, suggesting that deletion of ≥46 residues reverses the above right-shift to a more wild type-like E1/E2 distribution. It should be noted, however, that whereas the K+ sensitivity of Na-ATPase at 1 μm ATP reflects overall turnover via both branch pathways of K+ deocclusion, with the contribution of pathway A increasing as K′ATP(L) decreases, the time course of formation of E1 from E2(K+) reflects only deocclusion via pathway B. It is not known whether changes in each of the two pathways are quantitatively equivalent. They may not be equivalent. Thus, K+ stimulation of the Na-ATPase is notably greater for α1M40 compared with α1M32 despite their similar rates of E2(K+) → E1; K+ inhibition profiles of α1M46 and α1M49 are similar to that of α1, yet their rates of E2(K+) → E1 are slower than that of α1. Despite these issues and the fact that this reaction was analyzed at 10 °C, the generally consistent pattern of increasing followed by decreasing rates of E2(K+) → E1 associated with progressive deletions, is noteworthy.Table IISummary of conformational transition rates of Na,K-ATPase mutantsReaction measuredEnzymeE2(K+)→→E1E1P→E2Pk aRate constants shown are means ± S.D. of the number of experiments shown in brackets.T1/2bData taken from Fig. 6.[k] cRates were calculated from the T1/2 values shown.sec−1secsec−1α10.021 ± 0.007 (3)1.05 ± 0.270.66α1M320.075 ± 0.028dsignificantly different from α1,p < 0.005.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the contribution of the conformational transition of the phosphoenzyme to the E1 ↔ E2 shifts observed above, we examined the E1P → E2P transition at 0 °C as previously described (28Klodos I. Post R.L. Forbush 3rd., B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1734-1743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the enzyme is first phosphorylated by [γ-32P]ATP at high salt concentration (600 mm NaCl) to stabilize E1P. Dephosphorylation is then initiated by a downward jump in NaCl concentration to 100 mm with the simultaneous addition of 20 mm KCl and 10 μm unlabeled ATP. Since the rate of K+-activated dephosphorylation of E2P is much faster than that of the preceding formation of E2P from E1P, the time course of the E1P decay reflects primarily E1P → E2P. As shown in Fig. 6 and summarized in Table II, compared with the wild type α1 enzyme, the rate of this transition is ∼6-fold slower for α1M32 and α1M40. Mutants α1M46, α1M49, and α1M56 have similar or only slightly slower dephosphorylation rates relative to the wild type enzyme. Taken together, these partial reaction analyses of the mutants and wild type enzyme reflect the behavior seen in assays of the overall catalytic cycle summarized in Table I. The primary sequences of the N and C termini are the least conserved domains among the various P-type ATPases found in lower organisms and throughout the plant and animal kingdom. These extramembranous termini contain regions that inhibit pump activity, as well as binding motifs for regulatory proteins that may release"

These specific interaction pairs are well conserved across metazoan species, from worms to man. We have expressed and purified L27 domains from multiple species and find that certain domains from proteins such as Caenorhabditis elegans LIN-2 and LIN-7 can specifically heterodimerize. Biophysical analysis of interacting L27 domains demonstrates that the domains interact with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Circular dichroism studies reveal that the domains appear to function as an obligate heterodimer; individually the domains are largely unfolded, but when associated they show a significant increase in helicity, as well as a cooperative unfolding transition. These novel obligate interacting pairs are likely to play a key role in regulating the organization of signaling proteins at polarized cell structures.

These novel obligate interacting pairs are likely to play a key role in regulating the organization of signaling proteins at polarized cell structures. In multicellular organisms, many cells are highly polarized to allow for specific cell-cell communication. An essential feature of polarized cells is the organization of signaling proteins into distinct membrane domains (1Bredt D.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). For example, both neurons and epithelial cells actively maintain regions of the cell surface to which receptors, downstream signaling molecules, and structural proteins are selectively targeted. To accomplish this function, cells often use multivalent scaffolding proteins that bring together diverse signaling molecules into supramolecular complexes. These scaffolding proteins generally have multiple protein-protein recognition modules that play an important role in the assembly and dynamic regulation of signaling complexes (3Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Multivalent scaffolding molecules assemble such structures by participating in two general classes of binding interactions. First, they bind to non-scaffolding molecules, usually signaling proteins such as receptors or downstream effectors. These interactions are often mediated by well characterized modular recognition domains, including PSD-95·Dlg·ZO-1 homology (PDZ) 1The abbreviations used are: PDZ, PSD-95·Dlg·ZO-1 homology; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. domains (4Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which bind target proteins through short peptide motifs. Second, scaffold proteins can form higher order multiprotein networks through homo- or hetero-oligomerization with other scaffolding molecules (5Sheng M. Kim E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Far less is understood about the mechanism of such oligomerization interactions, although they are also essential for proper complex assembly. A notable example of a multiprotein scaffold network is the LIN-2/LIN-7/LIN-10 heterotrimeric complex (6Rongo C. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which is responsible for receptor targeting in polarized cells in a variety of metazoan organisms (7Craven S.E.

In this heterotrimeric complex, each scaffold protein has one or more PDZ domains that specifically interact with other partner/signaling proteins (Fig.1). In addition, the three proteins interact with one another independently of their PDZ domains. LIN-2 homologs are members of a larger family of scaffold proteins referred to as membrane-associated guanylatekinases (MAGUKs), which contain PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase-like domains (3Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 7Craven S.E. Bredt D.S.

The LIN-2·LIN-7·LIN-10 complex was first identified inCaenorhabditis elegans. Mutation of these proteins leads to aberrant localization of the epidermal growth factor receptor-like tyrosine kinase receptor LET-23 in vulval precursor epithelial cells; instead of being properly targeted to the basolateral surface where it is positioned to receive its extracellular signal, LET-23 is found at the apical membrane. Mislocalization of the receptor leads to a loss in LET-23-dependent signaling and defects in vulval induction (8Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Development. 1996; 122: 97-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K.

In addition, the PDZ domain from LIN-7 interacts with the C terminus of LET-23 (9Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although the LIN-2·LIN-7·LIN-10 complex is probably required simply for localization of LET-23 and therefore only indirectly involved in signaling, loss of any member of the complex has a similar phenotype with respect to vulval induction as loss of the receptor (10Simske J.S. Kaech S.M. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Cell. 1996; 85: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).

In mammalian dendrites, the PDZ domain from VELI/MALS binds the C-terminal tail of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit NR2B in a fashion analogous to the binding of the LIN-7 PDZ domain to the C-terminal tail of LET-23. In addition, the PDZ domain from MINT1/X11α binds to the kinesin superfamily motor protein KIF17. The CASK/PALS protein tethers the other two scaffold proteins together, just as LIN-2 tethers LIN-7 and LIN-10 (24Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the entire heterotrimeric complex is involved in transport of vesicles containing N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors to the postsynaptic density (24Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). More recent evidence indicates an important role for mammalian LIN-2·LIN-7·LIN-10 proteins in receptor localization and endosomal sorting in epithelial cells (25Straight S.W. Karnak D. Borg J.P.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Little is known about the interactions used to assemble the trimeric scaffold network. Recently, Doerks et al. (28Doerks T. Bork P. Kamberov E. Makarova O. Muecke S. Margolis B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 317-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) identified regions of significant sequence homology within many members of the LIN-2 and LIN-7 family, which they termed “L27” domains, forLIN-2/LIN-7 dimerization. These putative domains are all within regions of LIN-2 and LIN-7 (or homologs) that have previously been implicated in association of the two scaffold proteins (13Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, the L27 homology region appears to be the minimal region required for LIN-2/LIN-7 association. Therefore, the L27 domain is postulated to be a protein-protein interaction module critical for the assembly of this higher order scaffolding structure (29Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 30Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Here we report the expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of several L27 domains from both C. elegansand mammals. We observe a specific interaction between domains from the LIN-2/CASK family and domains from the LIN-7/VELI/MALS family. This interaction functions both within species and across species. We also observe that L27 domains assemble into a 1:1 heterodimer with binding affinities in the low micromolar range. Finally, we find that isolated L27 domains appear to be relatively unstructured but adopt a stable folded structure upon heterodimeric association. Thus, the domains act as obligate heterodimers. Using the L27 sequence profile of Doerks et al. (28Doerks T. Bork P. Kamberov E. Makarova O. Muecke S. Margolis B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 317-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we identified putative L27 domains in the following proteins; from C. elegans, LIN-2a and LIN-7 (8Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Development. 1996; 122: 97-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Simske J.S. Kaech S.M. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Cell. 1996; 85: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar); from Rattus norvegicus, the LIN-7 homolog LIN-7-BA (16Irie M. Hata Y. Deguchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2811-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); and from Homo sapiens, the LIN-2 homolog CASK (14Cohen A.R. Woods D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Wood D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Here we employ the following nomenclature to describe each L27 domain: the abbreviated name of the species of origin (C.e., R.n., or H.s.), followed by the name of the orthologous protein from C. elegans (LIN-7, LIN-2) and N or C denoting N- or C- terminal, for cases in which a protein has two domains. For example, the H. sapiens C-terminal CASK L27 domain is denoted by “H.s. LIN-2C.” DNA regions encoding the putative L27 domains were cloned by PCR from cDNA libraries and expressed as fusion proteins to both N-terminal hexahistidine (His6) and glutathioneS-transferase (GST) tags for purification and biochemical characterization. Regions cloned comprised the following amino acids:C. elegans LIN-7 115–180 (C.e. LIN-7), C. elegans LIN-2a 363–430 (C.e. LIN-2N) and 423–487 (C.e. LIN-2C),R. norvegicus LIN-7-BA 10–75 (R.n. LIN-7), and H. sapiens CASK 335–401 (H.s. LIN-2N) and 394–460 (H.s. LIN-2C). The cloned regions include five extra amino acids added to both the N and C termini of the putative homology regions as a safety margin to allow for expression of stable and soluble domains. PCR products were ligated into expression vectors pBH4 (31Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) for His6 fusions or pGEX4T1 for glutathione S-transferase fusions. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing on both strands. Protein constructs were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 pLYS-S (Invitrogen). Cultures were grown at 25 °C because of increased protein solubility at this temperature and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After induction for 6 h, cultures were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in ∼25 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl per original liter of culture, and subjected to freeze-thaw treatment. Cell suspensions were lysed by sonication and cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g. Three forms of recombinant proteins were used in this study. First, crude fractionated lysates containing His6 fusions for use as “prey” in GST-pulldown assays were prepared by expression as described above, followed by incubation with Ni2+-NTA Superflow™ resin (Qiagen) for ∼30 min. The resin was extensively washed with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and bound protein eluted with 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 to >50% purity. His6 fusion constructs purified in this manner were then dialyzed extensively against 20 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT and used immediately for pulldown assays. Second, GST fusions for use as “bait” in GST-pulldown assays were incubated with glutathione-agarose resin (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by extensive washing in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 2 mm DTT. Third, untagged proteins used in quantitative biochemical experiments were generated by thrombin cleavage of the GST fusion proteins. Cleavage was performed by adding thrombin (Hematologic Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of ∼6.5 μg/ml to a slurry of fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose. Cleavage reactions were rotated overnight at 4 °C, and cleaved protein was separated from the resin by filtration. Cleaved L27 domains were further purified by ion exchange chromatography in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm DTT, 0–500 mm NaCl, pH 7.0 on an HR10/10 Source Q Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) to >99% purity and stored in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 1 mmDTT. GST fusions of L27 domains for use as bait were expressed and purified as described above. 25 μl of GST-L27 domain slurry was incubated with ∼150 μl of eluted His6 L27 domain in a final buffer of 20 mmHEPES pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT for 30 min, followed by three washes with 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, then two washes in 1× PBS with no detergent. Bound proteins were eluted from the resin in 2× SDS sample buffer and subsequently visualized with SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-hexahistidine antibodies. Purified H.s. LIN-2C and C.e. LIN-2C domains were conjugated to a fluorescent dansyl moiety by covalent linkage to endogenous cysteines (corresponding to residues 464 and 473 in C. elegans LIN-2a and residue 412 inH. sapiens CASK). 100 μm protein was incubated with 2 mm dansyl iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes) in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.0 overnight at 4 °C. Labeled proteins were purified over a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and redialyzed into storage buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT). Fluorescence was assayed in a 1 × 1 cm stirred cell cuvette in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl at 20 °C using a Photon Technology Inc. Quantum Master fluorometer. Changes in fluorescence intensity were recorded, and data were fit to a bimolecular binding equation using Profit 5.1.0 (Quantum Soft). For conditions in which [L]≫[P], we fit the data as described previously (32Harris B.Z. Hillier B.J. Lim W.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5921-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For conditions in which [L] approached [P], we used the analysis described by Nguyenet al. (33Nguyen J.T. Turck C.W. Cohen F.E. Zuckermann R.N. Lim W.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). All binding experiments were repeated 3–4 times. Binding of dansylated 2C domains to C.e. LIN-7 was verified independently by GST pulldown assay and showed no detectable difference from unlabeled 2C domains. The R.n. LIN-7 L27 domain was too insoluble to purify in quantities sufficient to perform binding assays. To confirm that the dansyl modifications did not alter binding affinity, we also performed competition binding assays (32Harris B.Z. Hillier B.J. Lim W.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5921-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) in which the unlabeled proteins were used to compete off identical labeled proteins. Quantitative analysis of these data revealed no effect of the label (data not shown). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge with dual beam detection at 280 or 504 nm and with an An-60Ti rotor having sectored cells composed of sapphire- and carbon-impregnated Epon. Data were parsed with Win ReEdit version 0.999.0023 and analyzed with WinNonLin version 1.060 (David Yphantis, University of Connecticut) and Profit 5.1.0 (Quantum Soft). Single species experiments were fit to Equation 1. ATOT=A0eςr22−r022Equation 1 In Equation 1 A TOT is the total absorbance measured by the spectrophotometer, A 0is the absorbance constant, r is the radius, andr 0 is the minimum radius (i.e. radius of meniscus). ς denotes the following expression shown as Equation2. ς=Mω2(1−v̄ρ)RTEquation 2 In Equation 2 M is the molecular mass (g/mol), ω is the angular velocity of the rotor (rads/s), v̄ is the partial specific volume (cm3/g), ρ is the solvent density, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin. Two-species data were fit using Equation 3. ATOT=A1eς1r22−r022+A2eς2r22−r022Equation 3 In Equation 3 variables are defined as above, andA TOT is treated as the sum of two distributions;A 1 and ς1 correspond to monomer values, and A 2 and ς2 correspond to heterodimer values. Experiments with L27 monomers alone were checked using WinNonLin; data fit in all cases to a single-species model with monomeric molecular weight, and no higher aggregation states could be fit. Analysis of heterodimers with one labeled species was performed as described (34Mullins R.D. Kelleher J.F., Xu, J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 841-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 35Bubb M.R. Lewis M.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25587-25591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins used for analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were purified as described above or specifically labeled as follows: purified H.s. LIN-2C and C.e. LIN-2C domains were conjugated to a fluorescent BODIPY moiety by covalent linkage to endogenous cysteines (corresponding to residues 464 and 473 in C. elegans Lin-2a and residue 412 in H. sapiens CASK). Labeling was performed by incubating 100 μm protein with 2 mm BODIPY maleimide (Molecular Probes) in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.0 overnight at 4 °C. Labeled proteins were purified over a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and redialyzed into a storage buffer of 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0. Binding of BODIPY-labeled 2C domains to C.e. LIN-7 was verified independently by GST pulldown assay and showed no detectable difference from unlabeled 2C domains. We were not able to exceed a C.e. LIN-7:LIN-2C ratio of 25:1 as the C.e. LIN-7 monomer shows significant non-ideal behavior at concentrations ≥25 μm, which leads to a decrease in the apparent molecular weight of either heterodimer. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was performed using either an AVIV model 62DS or JASCO 715 spectrapolarimeter. All scans were performed with untagged, purified proteins in a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5; data for scans were collected at 1 nm intervals, with 1 s averaging time per data point and a total of 10 repeats per scan. Temperature denaturation studies were performed in 0.1-, 0.5-, or 1.0-cm path length quartz cuvettes with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl. Data for melts was collected at 1 °C intervals, with 60 s averaging time and 60 s of equilibration time per data point. Proteins subjected to temperature melts were scanned in every case (200–300 nm) before and after each melt to verify reversibility. To assess the binding capacity of putative L27 domains, we performed GST-pulldown assays, cross-testing all possible combinations of the six cloned domains (C.e. and R.n. LIN-7, C.e. and H.s. LIN-2N, C.e. and H.s. LIN-2C). In each case, a GST-tagged bait domain was used to pull down a His6-tagged “prey” domain. As shown in Fig. 2, we identified a specific interaction between LIN-2C and LIN-7 L27 domains. This interaction is conserved across species; both mammalian and C. elegans LIN-7 L27 domains are able to bind LIN-2C L27 domains from either species. These data are consistent with previous findings that mammalian LIN-2C domains bind mammalian LIN-7 domains (13Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Within this set, we did not identify any binding partners for the LIN-2N L27 domain, although recent studies suggest that this domain may be responsible for interaction with another multidomain scaffolding protein, SAP97 (29Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis (data not shown) indicates that the boundaries identified by sequence homology (28Doerks T. Bork P. Kamberov E. Makarova O. Muecke S. Margolis B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 317-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) correspond to those of the functional domain, deletion of 5–10 additional amino acids results in loss of binding, whereas the addition of 5–10 residues has no noticeable effect on binding. To quantitatively measure the binding affinity of LIN-2C and LIN-7 L27 domains, we took advantage of the fact that both the C.e. LIN-2C and H.s. LIN-2C domains have cysteine residues, to which we covalently attached a fluorescent dansyl group. Dansyl fluorescence is very sensitive to local environment and often changes significantly in response to protein binding. Binding was assayed by measuring the change in fluorescence with increasing amounts of the C.e. LIN-7 domain. Results of the fluorescence perturbation binding assay for the C.e. LIN-7:C.e. LIN-2C(dansyl) pair are shown in Fig.3 A (filled circles). The data could be fit well to a bimolecular binding reaction, with a K d = 14 ± 4 μm(Fig. 3 A). Scatchard analysis (Fig. 3 B) is consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. For all cases, we confirmed that the dansyl modification did not perturb the affinity by performing a competition binding assay in which the dansylated probe was competed off by addition of undansylated domain. Fits to these data (not shown) indicate no significant difference in affinity between the modified and unmodified domains. Addition of up to 50–100 μm of most other purified L27 domains (either 2C or 2N) resulted in no significant change in fluorescence (Fig. 3 A, open squares), confirming the previous GST-pulldown result (Fig. 2) that this hetero-oligomer interaction is highly specific. The only other L27 domain pair that showed significant binding was the homologous interspecies pair of the H.s. LIN-2C and C.e. LIN-7 domains. Interestingly, this interspecific pair was found to have aK d = 88 ± 6 nm (Fig.3 C) and is therefore ∼100-fold higher in affinity than the corresponding intraspecies pair. It is possible that the C.e. LIN-2C domain requires additional regions outside of the domain for high affinity interaction. However, given the high homology between the domains (28% identity, 46% similarity), this explanation seems unlikely. It is more likely that this result represents a real difference in affinity. This finding raises the interesting possibility that the biologically relevant intraspecies pair has evolved to have a suboptimal affinity, which may be more amenable to regulated multiprotein complex assembly. Although LIN-7 and LIN-2 homologs have been shown to bind one another in a wide variety of systems, the precise stoichiometry of the complex is not known. Therefore, the possibility exists that L27 domains form higher order oligomers rather than a simple heterodimer. To further characterize the stoichiometry of the complex and obtain a molecular weight for the interacting pair, we performed equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation on the tight binding H.s. LIN-2C:C.e. LIN7 L27 pair. H.s. LIN-2C monomer was selectively labeled with a BODIPY fluorophore exhibiting a peak absorbance at 504 nm (at this wavelength nonlabeled monomers have no detectable absorbance). Upon mixing 1 μm labeled H.s. LIN-2C monomer with an excess amount of unlabeled C.e. LIN-7, we were able to follow the equilibrium distribution of the labeled species in an analytical ultracentrifugation experiment. For the C.e. LIN-7:H.s. LIN-2C pair, the fraction bound at these concentrations is very high, and the data are in agreement with a 1:1 heterodimer and inconsistent with alternative higher order oligomers (Fig.4 A). Analytical ultracentrifugation of H.s. LIN-2C, C.e. LIN-2C, or C.e. LIN-7 monomers alone gave good fits to a monomer molecular weights over a range of concentrations of ∼50–200 μm with no evidence of homodimerization. Thus, we conclude that the LIN-7:LIN-2C L27 domain pair forms a simple heterodimer. We assessed the stability and secondary structure of L27 domains, both as individual proteins and in bound complexes, using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Spectra for L27 monomers show little ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig. 5 A), characteristic of proteins that have little helical structure. However, we observed a striking increase in ellipticity at 222 nm upon mixing of the monomers; the ellipticity observed is significantly greater than the arithmetic sum of the individual monomer spectra. Specifically, mixed 7 and 2C domains, not other domains alone or in combination, show CD spectra that are characteristic of highly α-helical folded proteins (Fig.5 A). We observed this for both interacting pairs (C.e. LIN-7:C.e. LIN-2C and C.e. LIN-7:H.s. LIN-2C). The difference spectra indicate the formation of a highly helical structure only upon interaction. However, we do not observe significant changes for non-binding L27 pairs (Fig. 5 B). To further characterize this conformational change upon L27 heterodimerization, we performed temperature-melting experiments on both monomers and heterodimers at 222 nm, a wavelength diagnostic of α-helical secondary structure. We performed these experiments with the high affinity C.e. LIN-7:H.s. LIN-2C pair. As shown in Fig.5 C, neither of the individual domains shows a cooperative transition with increasing temperature. The H.s. LIN-2C:C.e. LIN-7 heterodimer, however, displays a clear cooperative unfolding transition. This supports a model in which binding and folding events are linked for the LIN-2C:LIN-7 L27 pair; the individual monomers are largely unfolded but become a stable, helical, folded unit upon association. If binding and folding events for the LIN-2C:LIN-7 pair are linked, apparent stability of the heterodimer would show a dependence on concentration. To test this, we measured the melting temperature of varying equimolar mixtures of H.s. LIN-2C-C.e. LIN-7, from 1 to 10 μm each, by CD. As shown in Fig. 5 D, we observe a trend of increasing stability with increasing concentration, with an overall change in T m from ∼30 to ∼37 °C over the range we measured. In further support of this model, we find that a construct of artificially tethered L27 domains, in which the effective concentration of each L27 monomer for its intramolecular binding partner should be very high, also shows cooperative unfolding behavior with a higher T m of ∼65 °C (data not shown). Together these data indicate that individual L27 domains are largely unfolded but adopt a helical structure when they interact to form a 1:1 simple heterodimer. L27 domains are therefore very different from most other modular protein-protein recognition domains used in signal transduction, as most such domains are independently folding units that can be transferred both structurally and functionally by recombination. This unusual property of L27 domains makes them similar to coiled-coil domains, which can also serve as specific homo- or hetero-oligomerization modules. Coiled-coils are largely unstructured independently but form a helical bundle when associated (36Hurst H.C. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 101-168PubMed Google Scholar, 37Thompson K.S. Vinson C.R. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5491-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 38Alber T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Is it possible that L27 domains are related to the coiled-coil family? A region of certain LIN-7 homologs corresponding to the L27 domain has in fact been referred to as a potential coiled-coil domain (26Olsen O. Liu H. Wade J.B. Merot J. Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C183-C195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Straight S. Chen L. Karnak D. Margolis B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, we believe that it is unlikely that the L27 domain is a canonical coiled-coil. The region of LIN-7 that may be a putative coiled-coil is extremely short (15 amino acids), especially compared with the length of L27 domains (∼65 residues) required for association. Further, analysis of multiple aligned L27 domain sequences shows no consistent propensity to form coiled-coil domains (according to either the COILS program or MULTICOIL analysis) (39Schultz J.

Even within the LIN-7 family, the putative coiled-coil motif is not conserved (26Olsen O. Liu H. Wade J.B. Merot J. Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C183-C195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although it may be possible that some element of the L27 heterodimer adopts a coiled-coil-like structure, the L27 domain is unlikely to be a canonical coiled-coil. A definitive answer to this question awaits high resolution structural information for the complex. Nonetheless, it appears likely that these domains represent a novel class of obligate heterodimerization modules."

We have used synthetic lethal genetic screens inSchizosaccharomyces pombe to identify mutations in genes that are functionally linked to rae1 and mex67in mRNA export. From these screens, we have isolated mutations in a putative S. pombe homologue of theCandida albicans elf1 gene. The elf1 ofS. pombe is not an essential gene. When elf1mutations are combined with rae1-167 mutation, growth and mRNA export is inhibited in the double mutants. This inhibition can be suppressed by the multicopy expression of mex67suggesting that Mex67p can substitute for the loss of Elf1p function. Elf1p is a non-membrane member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) class of ATPase and the GFP-Elf1p fusion localizes to the cytoplasm. Elf1p, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, binds and hydrolyzes ATP. A mutant Elf1p that carries a glycine to aspartic acid (G731D) mutation within the Walker A domain of the second ATP site retains the ATP binding but loses its ATPase activity in vitro. This mutant protein no longer functions in mRNA export. Taken together, our results show that Elf1p functions as a mRNA export factor along with Rae1p and Mex67p in S. pombe.

Embedded within the NE are the nuclear pore complexes (NPC) through which nucleo-cytosolic exchanges take place. While small molecules of molecular mass 40 kDa and under can diffuse passively through the NPC, receptor proteins interact with the NPC to mediate the transport of macromolecules (1Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 2Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The mature mRNAs are exported out of the nucleus as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Concurrent with transcription and splicing, the coordinated assembly of export-competent RNP complexes takes place in the nucleus by association of proteins with the maturing transcripts (3Zenklusen D. Stutz F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 5Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, the RNP complexes are disassembled to release the mRNA and soluble export factors; the latter return to the nucleus for participating in the next round of mRNA export. The major components of the mRNA export machinery appear to be evolutionarily conserved. Genetic and biochemical approaches have led to the identification of several conserved export factors, Tap/Mex67p, Rae1p/Gle2p, Gle1, and Dbp5/RHA from yeasts to metazoans (6Segref A. Sharma K.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2651-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of Mex67p/Tap function in mRNA export is understood in some detail, but how Rae1p/Gle2p function is largely unknown (5Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 14Conti E. Izaurralde E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there is a close reciprocal relationship between Rae1p and Mex67p in the two yeast systems that may indicate their functional homology and mechanistic similarity. Mex67/Tap are non-β karyopherin receptors. They associate with nucleoporins, bind mRNA, and interact with the RNA-binding protein, Aly/Yra1p, to mediate mRNA export (3Zenklusen D. Stutz F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Rae1p, on the other hand, is an NPC-associated, conserved WD-domain protein that is also required for cell-cycle progression at the G2/M boundary (8Brown J.A. Bharathi A. Ghosh A. Whalen W. Fitzgerald E. Dhar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7411-7419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). While the hRae1p has been shown to bind mRNA and to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, these properties have not been demonstrated for its yeast homologues (10Kraemer D. Dresbach T. Drenckhahn D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, Rae1p, but not Mex67p, is essential for growth and mRNA export (16Yoon J.H. Love D.C. Guhathakurta A. Hanover J.A. Dhar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8767-8782Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A temperature sensitive (ts) rae1-167 mutant rapidly accumulates poly(A)+ RNA in the nucleus at restrictive temperatures above 30 °C (8Brown J.A. Bharathi A. Ghosh A. Whalen W. Fitzgerald E. Dhar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7411-7419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover,spmex67 expressed from a multicopy plasmid can partially suppress the mRNA export defect of rae1-167 mutation up to a restrictive temperature of 32 °C. However, in S. cerevisiae, Mex67p is essential for growth and mRNA export whereas Gle2p is not. These and other observations suggest that at least in S. pombe and likely in S. cerevisiae, the mRNA export machinery may operate more than one mRNA export pathway, consisting of Rae1p-specific, Mex67p-specific, and some shared export factors. Overall, the nuclear export of mRNA is expected to be an energy consuming process, but no specific step with a link to energy metabolism has been identified yet. Translocation of protein cargo by transportin, an importin β-type receptor, has been shown to occur in the absence of Ran or energy (17Ribbeck K. Kutay U. Paraskeva E. Gorlich D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 47-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, several mRNA export factors that possess ATP-hydrolyzing activity have been identified, and the role of energy in the mRNA export process cannot be ruled out. In the nucleus, the splicing factor Sub2/UAP56, a DECD box ATPase, associates with the spliceosome and is involved in recruiting the RNA-binding protein, Yra1/Aly (18Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 19Luo M.-J. Zhou Z. Magni K. Christofrides C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Reed R. Nature. 2001; 413: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 20Jensen T.H. Boulay J. Rosbash M. Libri D. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1711-1715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Both Sub2/UAP56 and Yra1/Aly are part of a conserved protein complex TREX, which is believed to couple transcription and mRNA export processes (21Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The essential, shuttling mRNA export factor, Dbp5p/RHA (RNA helicase A), a DEAD box ATP-dependent RNA helicase, may play a role in the release of mRNA and/or in the disassembly of the RNP in the cytoplasm (12Snay-Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Goldstein A.L. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2663-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, how ATP hydrolysis is involved in the functioning of Sub2/Uap56 or Dbp5/RHA is not known. Recently, through genetic interactions with mutations in SUB2, another ATP-dependent DNA, RNA helicase, Rad3p, was implicated in the nuclear export of mRNA (20Jensen T.H. Boulay J. Rosbash M. Libri D. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1711-1715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Rix7p, a member of theATPases associated with a variety of cellularactivities (AAA) family of ATPases in S. cerevisiae, has been shown to be an essential protein whose function is required for the assembly and nuclear export of 60 S ribosomal subunits (22Gadal O. Strauss D. Braspenning J. Hoepfner D. Petfalski E. Philippsen P. Tollervey D. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3695-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Since the export-competent RNP goes through several maturation steps, ATPases could function as conformational switches in unidirectional movement, assembly/disassembly of the RNA-protein complexes, and in the unwinding of double-stranded RNA. In this study, we have described the identification, genetic, and biochemical characterization of the putative S. pombehomologue of the Candida albicans Elf1p (23Sturtevant J. Cihlar R. Calderone R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2311-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, elf1 is not essential. The rae1-167mutation is linked to mutations in elf1 gene for growth and mRNA export suggesting that Elf1p functions as an mRNA export factor when the function of Rae1p is compromised. The growth and mRNA export-defect associated with elf1 andrae1-167 double mutants can be suppressed by multicopy expression of mex67, suggesting that Mex67p can compensate for the loss of Elf1p function in mRNA export. Elf1p is a member of the ABC class of ATPases. The ABC ATPases are distinguished from other ATPases because in addition to the ATP-binding Walker A and B domains, they also contain a characteristic dodecapeptide linker region between the Walker motifs known as the ABC signature or the C-domain (24Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).E. coli-purified Elf1p binds and hydrolyzes ATP in vitro, and this enzymatic activity is essential for its function in mRNA export. Basic cell culture techniques were as described (25Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar, 26Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. Mcleod M.

Whalen W.A. Bharathi A. Shen R. Dhar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7047-7060Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Δspmex67::kan/pREP81X-mex67+strain (1 × 108 cells) was mutagenized with 300 μg/ml of nitrosoguanidine (NG) for 1 h, with a 30% survival rate. After three washes with 0.9% solution of sodium chloride, cells were grown for 3 h in 1 ml of EMM medium without leucine. Then the cells were plated onto EMM agar plates without leucine and grown at 27 °C. Colonies were replica-plated onto EMM agar plates without leucine containing phloxin B in the presence (mex67repressed) and absence (mex67 expressed) of thiamine (10 μm) and grown at 27 °C. Synthetic lethal mutants were identified as those colonies that turned red in the presence of thiamine but remained pink in the absence of thiamine. The synthetic lethal strain SL21 containing a cognate sl21 mutation was isolated from the rae1-167 sl21/pREP81X-rae1strain and SL1 with its cognate sl1 mutation was isolated from the Δspmex67 sl1/pREP81X-mex67 strain. SL21 (rae1-167 sl21/pREP81X-rae1+) and SL1 (Δspmex67 sl1/pREP81X-mex67+) were transformed with a partial Sau3A genomic library of S. pombe cloned into the SalI site of pUR19 (30Berbet N. Muriel W.J. Carr A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 114: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Transformants that could grow at 27 °C in the presence of thiamine were isolated. Plasmids isolated from these transformants were enriched via E. coli transformation and retransformed into SL strains. Plasmids that rescued synthetic lethality of SL strains were sequenced. A 4.9-kb insert in a plasmid (26-3-1) contained the fullelf1 gene. Genomic DNA from SL21 and SL1 were isolated, and the full-length coding region of the elf1-21 andelf1-1 alleles were sequenced. The nonsense mutation CAA to TAA at amino acid 863 (Q863X) was the only change present in the elf1-21 allele, and the missense mutation GGT to GAT at amino acid 731 (G731D) was the only change present in theelf1-1 allele. The pREP81X-elf1 vector was constructed by generating a PCR product that inserted a SalI site upstream of the initiation codon and a BamHI site downstream of the termination codon, using the genomic library clone pUR19-elf1 (26-3-1) as a template. TheSalI-BamHI-digested PCR product was then cloned into pREP81X cut with XhoI and BamHI. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion vectors were constructed as follows. GFP was fused to Elf1p at the N terminus by first creating aBamHI site immediately downstream of the initiation codon ofelf1 on the pUR19-elf1 plasmid. ABamHI-GFP-BamHI fragment was inserted into theBamHI site. Proper orientation of GFP was checked by PCR and by restriction fragment analysis. The resulting p5′-GFP-elf1 plasmid was capable of complementing both the SL1 and SL21 synthetic lethality. In a similar way for tagging the GFP at the C terminus of Elf1p, aSalI site was created immediately upstream of the termination codon on the pUR19-elf1 plasmid. ASalI-GFP-SalI fragment was inserted into theSalI site. The plasmids p5′GFP-elf1-1 (G731D) and p5′GFP-elf1-21(Q863X) were created from the normal p5′-GFP-elf1 plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the instruction manual. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. For expression inE. coli, elf1 and elf1-1 were amplified by PCR as NdeI-XhoI fragments and cloned into the E. coli expression vector pET16b (Novagen) to express polyhistidine-tagged proteins under the control of the T7 promoter. Single transformants were first patched on EMM agar plates in the absence of thiamine (−B1) with appropriate auxotrophic selection and then grown in 10 ml in liquid until the stationary phase. 10-fold dilutions (1 × 107 cells/ml) were plated in the presence or absence of thiamine (final concentration of B1 was 10 μm) on EMM plates without leucine and/or uracil as appropriate. Transmission electron micrographs of sections of S. pombe cells were taken following procedures as described before (29Yoon J.H. Whalen W.A. Bharathi A. Shen R. Dhar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7047-7060Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization method was as described previously (31Amberg D.C. Goldstein A.L. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1173-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Oligo(dT)50 carrying an α-digoxygenin at the 3′-end was used as the hybridization probe and fluorescein isothiocyanate-antidigoxygenin or rhodamine-antidigoxygenin as appropriate was used for detecting the hybridization probe by fluorescence microscopy. DAPI was used for observing the DNA. For expression of His-Elf1p and His-Elf1-1p in E. coli, pET16b containing the respective inserts were transformed into BL21 (DE3). Cultures were grown in 150 ml of LB at 27 °C and induced by addition of 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 2.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The buffer also contained EDTA-free protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed by French Press, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a TALON column (CLONTECH) pre-equilibrated with the lysis buffer. Binding of the His-tagged protein was performed for 45 min at 4 °C on a turning wheel in the presence of 10 mmimidazole. Bound Elf1p was washed with lysis buffer containing 100 mm imidazole and eluted with the same buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was later dialyzed into a buffer without imidazole. Protein estimation was performed using the BioRad protein assay system. Purified Elf1p or Elf1-1p (1.5–3 μg) was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining on a 4–20% polyacrylamide gel. Purified Elf1p or Elf1-1p were added to ATP binding buffer (40 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium azide, 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mmMgCl2) containing 10 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the dark on ice and incubated for 10 min. The samples were then photocross-linked by UV illumination at 365 nm on ice as described (32Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Cold ATP (12.5 mm) was added to displace excess non-covalently bound radionucleotide. The samples were then run in denaturing 8% Tris-glycine gels, dried, and exposed to Bio-Max MR films at −70 °C for 12–24 h. As described before (33Li Y. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), ATPase activity of Elf1p was detected in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, and 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. The reaction volume was 20 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and hydrolysis stopped by addition of 1 μl of 0.4 m EDTA. The samples were then placed on ice. 3 μl of the reaction mixture were spotted on polyethyleneimine TLC plates and air-dried. The chromatograph was developed with 1 m LiCl and 1 m acetic acid solution. After drying, the TLC plate was exposed to Kodak X-OMAT AR film for 20 s to 30 min. We previously reported the use of a synthetic lethal screen to identify genes linked torae1 in the mRNA export process (29Yoon J.H. Whalen W.A. Bharathi A. Shen R. Dhar R. Mol. Cell.

The synthetic lethal mutants were isolated as those colonies that could grow in the presence of Rae1p expression (−B1) but were unable to grow when expression of Rae1p was repressed (+B1). Mutations defining three complementation groups, SL64, SL27, and SL21 were identified. The corresponding synthetic lethal genes for sl64 and sl27 were identified as npp106 (scNIC96) andnup184 (scNUP184), respectively (29Yoon J.H. Whalen W.A. Bharathi A. Shen R. Dhar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7047-7060Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 34Whalen W.A. Yoon J.H. Shen R. Dhar R. Genetics. 1999; 152: 827-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this study, we isolated a genomic clone corresponding to thesl21 that complemented the growth and mRNA export defect of SL21 (rae1-167 sl21/pREP81X-rae1+) cells under synthetic lethal conditions (see below). Sequence analysis of the genomic clone revealed an intronless 1057-amino acid ORF (SPAC3C7.08c in the S. pombe data base) with the predicted molecular mass of a 116.7-kDa protein. A purified DNA fragment within the open reading frame rescued the cognate sl21 mutation in SL21. Sequence analyses of two independent PCR-amplified ORF fragments using SL21 genomic DNA as template revealed a single mutation that introduced an ochre termination codon in place of a glutamine at position 863 (Q863X). A Blast search of the protein data base showed that the protein had significant homology with Elf1p, a protein from C. albicans (GenBankTMAF038153) and with a hypothetical ORF (GenBankTMZ73582) fromS. cerevisiae, both putative members of the ABC ATPase family (23Sturtevant J. Cihlar R. Calderone R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2311-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the S. pombe gene was namedelf1 (spelf1) and the mutant strain (sl21) was renamed elf1-21. A similar genetic screen was used to identify mutations in genes that are synthetically lethal with Δmex67 (16Yoon J.H. Love D.C. Guhathakurta A. Hanover J.A. Dhar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8767-8782Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One of the synthetic lethal gene mutations mapped within the elf1 gene was the mutant gene named elf1-1. Sequence analysis of theelf1-1 mutation showed that the glycine residue at position 731 of the wild type Elf1p was converted to an aspartic acid residue (G731D). An alignment of S. pombe Elf1p and its putative homologues from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans generated by the ClustalW algorithm is shown in Fig.1. These proteins share overall organizational features of the ABC ATPases. Their central and C-terminal regions are highly conserved with a less conserved N-terminal region. The central region contains two ATP binding domains, each consisting of a Walker A, Walker B, and a distinctive C-domain (Fig. 1, boxed and marked). A common feature of the ABC family of ATPases is that a single ATP binding domain is generally sufficient to bind ATP, but both are required for ATP hydrolysis (24Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the elf1-1 mutation (G731D) maps within the second conserved Walker A domain (GPNGAGKS to GPNGADKS). Additionally, ATP hydrolysis by the ATPases is Mg2+-dependent, and the aspartate residue in the Walker B domain is essential for Mg2+ binding. The Elf1-21p lacks the second Walker B and the linker region (C-domain) region due to a translational termination codon at position 863. Interestingly, protein database searches did not reveal any putative homologues in higher eukaryotic cells, suggesting that other proteins may substitute for Elf1p. Elf1p also showed a lower level of homology to a family of non-membrane ABC ATPases whose members include the translational elongation factors, Ef3p from S. pombe,S. cerevisiae, and the fungi. Like Ef3p of S. cerevisiae, Elf1p of S. pombe also does not contain the hydrophobic sequences known to be required for membrane anchoring (35Chakraburtty K. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, S. pombe elf3 expressed from a multicopy plasmid did not complement the growth and mRNA export defect of SL21 cells, suggesting that Ef3p is likely not a functional homologue of Elf1p (data not shown). RNA-dependent helicases (S. cerivisiae DBP5) also contain ATPase activity (13Tseng S.S. Weaver P.L. Liu Y. Hitomi M. Tartakoff A.M. Chang T.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2651-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), but Elf1p did not UV-cross-link with poly(A)+ RNA in vivo and S. pombe dbp5, expressed from a multicopy plasmid, did not functionally complement Elf1p function(s) (data not shown). Thus, Elf1p is not likely to function as an RNA helicase. To determine whether elf1 is an essential gene, most of its coding sequences (amino acids 1–1042) were replaced in the diploid strain by either the ura4+ or the kanamycin gene, respectively. Dissection of the tetrads showed that all four spores formed colonies, and the uracil prototrophy or the resistance to G418 segregated 2:2. The disruption of elf1 in the genome was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization of the genomic DNA digested with restriction enzymes (data not shown). The Δelf1 cells grew, albeit slightly slower than the wild type cells in a range of temperatures (21–36 °C, see below), suggesting that the null was not temperature sensitive for growth. Thus, the S. pombe elf1 gene is not essential for growth. Elf1p was tagged separately at the C and N terminus with GFP to determine its cellular localization. Both GFP fusions were functional and complemented the synthetic lethality of the Δelf1 rae1-167 mutation (data not shown), and both localized to the cytoplasm when expressed in the wild type or in the Δelf1 strain (Fig. 2, data not shown for the C-terminal GFP fusion). Similarly, the Elf1-1p (G731D) and Elf1-21p (Q863X) tagged with GFP at the N terminus also predominantly localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). However, about 5–10% of cells expressing GFP-Elf1-21p also showed diffuse staining in the nucleus. We do not know if the Elf1p fusion protein shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm; it did not accumulate in the nucleus following addition of leptomycin, an inhibitor of the Crm1p export receptor. The growth of elf1-21 cells was comparable to that of wild type, rae1-167, and Δmex67 cells, although Δelf1 and elf1-1 cells grew slightly slower (Fig 3A). None of the mutant strains showed any mRNA export defect when poly(A)+ RNA was detected in these cells by in situ hybridization (Fig. 3B)"

Hexose monophosphates may immediately enter the central energy-generating pathways, but prior to their dissimilation, accumulated disaccharide phosphates must first be hydrolyzed by sugar-specific disaccharide-phosphate hydrolases. Of the latter inducible enzymes, phospho-β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.85) and phospho-β-glucosidase (EC3.2.1.86) have received considerable attention (6Witt E. Frank R. Hengstenberg W. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Wiesmann C. Hengstenberg W. Schultz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). By sequence-based alignment these enzymes are assigned to Family 1 of the 87-member superfamily of glycosylhydrolases (8Henrissat B. Biochem.

Coutinho and B, Henrissat (1999) Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes, available at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼cazy/CAZY/index.html. Until recently, microbial phosphoglycosylhydrolases were found only in Family 1 of glycosylhydrolases. However, studies begun in our laboratory (9Thompson J. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Nguyen N.Y. Folk J.E. Robrish S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, subsequently, in other institutions, have identified a novel group of phosphoglucosylhydrolases in an increasing number of bacterial species, including Bacillus subtilis(10Varrot A.

Extremophiles. 2000; 4: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By their inherent instability, oligomeric structure, sequence homology, and conserved signature pattern, these enzymes are assigned to Family 4 of glycosylhydrolases.2 Remarkably, and in contrast to other glycosylhydrolases described thus far, members of Family 4 require both a dinucleotide (NAD+) and a divalent metal ion (Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, or Ni2+) for activity. The one or more functions of these unique cofactors are presently unknown, and the catalytic mechanism for cleavage of the O-glycosyl linkage in their substrates has yet to be established. Significantly, the crystal structure has not been solved for any member of Family 4. In large measure, these deficiencies are directly attributable to the lack of the appropriate P-enolpyruvate:PTS-derived substrates for the enzymes. In the absence of the natural disaccharide-6′-Ps, chromogenic analogs such asp-nitrophenyl-α- andp-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside 6-phosphates, respectively, have been used extensively for the assay and partial characterization of phosphoglycosylhydrolase activities. The former chromogenic substrates (and structurally similar alkyl and aryl glycoside phosphates) have usually been prepared by phosphorylation of the parent glycosides at the single primary -OH group with 2-cyanoethyl phosphate or phosphorous oxychloride (17Hengstenberg W. Morse M.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1968; 7: 180-183Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 18Hengstenberg W. Morse M.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1969; 10: 463-465Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Wilson G. Fox C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5586-5596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, these non-selective phosphorylating agents cannot be used for synthesis of the disaccharide-6′-P products of the P-enolpyruvate:PTS, because the presence of two primary -OH groups yields a tripartite mixture of the -6-P, -6′-P, and -6,6′-P2 derivatives. Regiospecific chemical syntheses of disaccharide 6′-phosphates would entail the addition and subsequent removal of protecting groups, together with potentially laborious methods for purification of the derivatives. It is perhaps in light of these difficulties that compounds such as cellobiose-6′-phosphate and maltose-6′-phosphate are not commercially available, and it was for these reasons that we sought enzymatic routes for the biosynthesis of the α- and β-conformers of disaccharide monophosphates. Fortuitously, during studies of PTS functions in permeabilized cells of K. pneumoniae, we discovered that, although low pH caused inactivation of intracellular phospho-α-glucosidase, the α-glucoside-specific PTS remained operative under the same conditions. This serendipitous finding permitted the synthesis and facile isolation of a wide variety of phospho-α-glucoside products of the PTS, including maltose-6′-P and the 6-phospho- derivatives of sucrose and its five linkage isomers (20Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Pikis A. Brust A. Lichtenthaler F.W. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 331: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As a potential route for the biosynthesis of phospho-β-glucosides, we turned our attention to the report some 30 years ago by Palmer and Anderson (21Palmer R.E. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3415-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of an ATP-dependent β-glucoside kinase present in K. pneumoniae. Although only partially purified, the enzyme preparation of Palmer and Anderson catalyzed the in vitro phosphorylation of several β-glucosides and, indeed, a small quantity of cellobiose-6′-phosphate was prepared by these investigators. In the present communication we describe the purification, substrate specificity, and kinetic parameters of β-glucoside kinase (BglK, EC2.7.1.85) from K. pneumoniae. The chromosomal genebglK has been cloned, and catalytically activeHis6BglK has been purified from a high expression system by Ni2+-NTA-agarose chromatography. The availability ofHis6BglK in quantity (and high purity) has allowed the first preparative synthesis of 10 phospho-β-glucosides. The biosynthesis, method of isolation, and some of the physicochemical properties of these novel phospho-β-glucosylhydrolase substrates are presented herein. By sequence-based alignment we show that BglK ofK. pneumoniae can be assigned to the ROK (Repressor, ORF, Kinase) family of proteins (22Titgemeyer F. Reizer J. Reizer A.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH, EC 1.1.1.49) and the mixture of pyruvate kinase (PK, EC 2.7.1.40)/l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) were obtained from Boehringer and Roche Diagnostics, respectively. Polyclonal (rabbit) antibody to BglK was prepared by Covance Research Products using purifiedHis6BglK as immunogen. K. pneumoniae ATCC 23357 was grown in the medium described by Sapico et al. (23Sapico V. Hanson T.E. Walter R.W. Anderson R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 51-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) of appropriate sugar. The medium (800 ml) was contained in 1-liter bottles, and cells were grown at 37 °C to the stationary phase. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (13,000 ×g for 10 min at 5 °C) and washed twice by resuspension and centrifugation from 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm MgCl2 (designated TM buffer). The yield of cells was approximately 2 g of wet weight/liter. Cells of E. coli TOP 10 (pTrcHisbglK) were grown with vigorous aeration at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (150 μg/ml). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to the culture at A600 nm ∼ 0.4, and 4 h later, the cells were harvested and washed with TM buffer. The yield was approximately 3.7 g of wet weight of cells/liter. The Novex X-Cell mini system (Invitrogen) was used for SDS-PAGE procedures. Denatured samples of cell extracts and Novex Mark 12 protein standards were electrophoresed in Novex NuPage (4–12%) BisTris gels with MES-SDS (pH 7.3) as the running buffer. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The pI of BglK was determined by analytical electrofocusing (at 10 °C) in anAmersham Biosciences Multiphor flat-bed electrophoresis unit, using precast Ampholine PAG layers (pH range, 3.5–9.5) and broad range pI standards. Cell extracts and SeeBlue (Invitrogen)-prestained markers were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in NuPage transfer buffer. Immunodetection of native and mutated forms of BglK was achieved by sequential incubation of the membranes with polyclonal antibody toHis6BglK and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, as described previously (9Thompson J. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Nguyen N.Y. Folk J.E. Robrish S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Negative-ion FAB spectra of the P-β-d-glucosides were obtained on a JEOL SX102 mass spectrometer. The compounds were desorbed from a glycerol matrix with 6 KeV xenon atoms, and mass measurements [M-H]−1 in FAB mode were performed at 10,000 times resolution using electric field scans and matrix ions as reference material. Low resolution analysis provided integer-mass information, and high resolving power was used for determination (and confirmation) of molecular formulae. Thin-layer chromatographic analyses were performed using 0.1-mm-thick layers of microcrystalline cellulose and a solvent containing n-butanol/acetic acid/water (5:2:3, v/v). The phosphate-containing derivatives were visualized by sequential dipping of the air-dried layers in solutions containing: (i) 50 mg of ferric chloride and 1 ml of 1 nHCl, dissolved in 100-ml of acetone, and (ii) 1.25 g of sulfosalicylic acid in 100 ml of acetone (24Wade H.E.

Open table in a new tab The procedure outlined for cellobiose-6′-P (with adjustment for the limited quantity of some substrates) was used for the preparation of other phosphorylated compounds. Cellobiose (2 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml of 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm MgSO4 and immediately added to 10 ml of water containing 1 mmol of ATP (adjusted to pH 7.5 with ∼0.6 ml of 3m NH4OH). His6BglK was added (∼40 units), and, throughout a 2-h incubation period at room temperature, the pH of the reaction mixture was maintained at 7.5 by addition of a 3m NH4OH solution. Thereafter, the pH was adjusted to 8.2 with NH4OH, and 4 ml of barium acetate solution (3 mmol) was added with stirring. The heavy white precipitate of the barium salts of ADP and residual ATP was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fluid was clarified by filtration through a Millex (0.22-μm pore size) membrane. The filtrate (approximately 22 ml) was chilled on ice, 4 volumes of absolute ethanol (0 °C) was added, and the mixture was transferred to a cold room overnight. The flocculent precipitate of the Ba2+ salt of cellobiose-6′-P (together with trace amounts of nucleotide salts) was collected by centrifugation. The white pellet was dried at 37 °C for about 30 min, and Ba2+ ions were exchanged for H+ by addition of 2–3 ml of an aqueous suspension of Bio-Rad AG 50Wx2 (H+ form) resin. Resin beads were removed by filtration, and the filtrate was adjusted to pH 7.2 by NH4OH addition. The solution was frozen and lyophilized, to yield 300–500 mg of the white, crystalline ammonium salt of cellobiose-6′-P. Except for thiocellobiose-6′-P, all P-β-glucosides were quantitatively determined by enzymatic assay of Glc6P released by acid hydrolysis (1 n HCl for 2 h at 100 °C). Prior to mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, trace contaminants of ADP and ATP were removed from ∼50 mg of each derivative by paper chromatography (20Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Pikis A. Brust A. Lichtenthaler F.W. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 331: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using sequence information from the unfinished genome project ofK. pneumoniae strain MGH 78578 (Washington University Genome sequencing Center, St. Louis, MO), two primers, KPC808 (5′-TTGCCCCTGCGGAAAAATAC-3′) and KPC2116 (5′-TACAGTCTGGTGCTTGCCCTCTACG-3′), were designed to amplify the DNA fragment encoding bglK and a portion of a putative phospho-β-glucosidase (pbgA) gene of K. pneumoniae ATCC 23357. PCR amplification was carried out in a thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Model 9600) in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 100 ng of K. pneumoniae ATCC 23357 chromosomal DNA, 10 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 20 mm each of the four DNTPs, 250 ng of each primer, 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and 1% (v/v) Me2SO. After an initial 2-min denaturation at 95 °C, the mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of amplification. Each cycle consisted of 1 min of denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min of annealing at 50 °C, and 2 min and 36 s of extension at 72 °C. These were followed by a 10-min runoff at 72 °C. The PCR product was purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit, Qiagen) and ligated into the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli TOP 10-competent cells, and colonies were selected on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Sequencing was accomplished by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method using the Sequenase 7-deaza-dGTP sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemicals) and [α-35S]dATP for labeling. Both strands of the DNA insert were sequenced. Sequences were assembled, edited, and analyzed with MacVector sequence analysis package (version 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). For the amplification of bglK, two primers were synthesized from the sequence data presented in Fig. 2. Forward primer F1, 5′-CCCCGGATCCCATGAAGATTGCGGCATTTGATATCGG-3′ (the bglK sequence is in boldface, and the BamHI site is underlined); reverse primer R1, 5′-GGGGGTAAGCTTCTACTAATGTCGATCGTCGTCTGGCG-3′ (the sequence complimentary to the downstream region of bglKis in boldface, and the HindIII site is underlined). After amplification with high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase, the DNA fragment was digested with restriction endonucleases (BamHI and HindIII), electrophoresed (1% agarose), and purified (QIAquick gel extraction kit). The purified 0.9-kb DNA fragment was ligated into the similarly digested and purified high expression vector pTrcHisB. The recombinant plasmid (pTrcHisBbglK) was transformed into competent cells ofE. coli TOP 10, and transformants were selected in LB agar plates containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin. A high level of expression of the histidine-tagged enzyme His6BglK was initiated by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to logarithmic phase cultures (A600 nm ∼ 0.3) ofE. coli TOP 10 (pTrcHisBbglK).

For amplification of lmo2764, the forward primer EGD-eF1 was 5′-CCCCGGATCCCATGAAAATTGCAGCTTTTGATATCGG-3′ (the lmo2764 sequence is in boldface, and theBamHI site is underlined) and reverse primer EGD-eR1 was 5′-GGGGGTAAGCTTCATCATTCATGTCTATTTTCCTCC-3′ (the sequence complimentary to the downstream region of lmo2764is in boldface, and the HindIII site is underlined). For amplification of lin2907, the forward primer CLIP-F1 was 5′-CCCCGGATCCCATGAAAATTGCAGCATTTGATATTGG-3′ (thelin2907 sequence is in boldface, and the BamHI site is underlined), and reverse primer CLIP-R1 was identical to EGD-eR1. After amplification, digestion, and purification, the two ∼0.9-kb DNA fragments were ligated (as described previously) into the high expression vector pTrcHis2B to yield plasmids pTrcHisBlmo2764 and pTrcHisBlin2907, respectively. The two plasmids were transformed into E. coliTOP 10-competent cells for expression of the Listeria gene products. (Note: incorporation of the two stop codons in our reverse primers prevents expression and incorporation of the C-terminal His6 fusion peptides normally generated by use of pTrcHis2 vectors.) The method required the use of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase, a temperature cycler, and reagents that were obtained as a kit (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). E. coli TOP 10-competent cells were transformed with plasmids of pTrcHisBbglK containing the desired mutation. Base changes effected by site-directed mutagenesis were confirmed by sequence analysis. Washed cells (∼16 g of wet wt) grown previously on cellobiose as the energy source were resuspended in 24 ml of TM buffer. Cells were disrupted at 0 °C, by 2× 1.5-min periods of sonic oscillation in a Branson (Model 350) instrument operated at ∼75% of maximum power. BglK was purified in four stages by low pressure chromatography. Column flow rates were maintained by a P-1 peristaltic pump interfaced with a Frac-100 collector. Proteins present in column eluents were monitored at 280 nm by a UV-1 optical control unit connected to a single-channel chart recorder. (All instruments were from Amersham Biosciences.) The sonicated extract was clarified by ultracentrifugation (180,000 × g for 2 h at 5 °C). The HSS was transferred to sacs and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of TM buffer (at 4 °C) The dialyzed HSS (∼35 ml) was transferred at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min to a column of DEAE-TrisAcryl M (2.6 × 10 cm) previously equilibrated with TM buffer. Non-adsorbed materials were removed by washing with TM buffer, and BglK was eluted with 400 ml of a linear, increasing concentration gradient of NaCl (0–300 mm) in TM buffer. Fractions of 6 ml were collected, and samples (30 μl) were assayed for enzymatic activity. Fractions (33Tarelli E. Wheeler S.F. Carbohydr.

Cooperative binding of ATP to a protein ring allows binding of GroES to that ring, and at the same time negative inter-ring cooperativity discharges the ligands from the opposite ring, thus driving the protein-folding cycle. Biochemical and electron microscopy analysis of wild type GroEL, a single-ring mutant (SR1), and two mutants with one inter-ring salt bridge of the chaperonin disrupted (E461K and E434K) indicate that these ion pairs form part of the interactions that allow the inter-ring allosteric signal to be transmitted. The wild type-like activities of the ion pair mutants at 25 °C are in contrast with their lack of inter-ring communication and folding activity at physiological temperatures. These salt bridges stabilize the inter-ring interface and maintain the inter-ring spacing so that functional communication between protein heptamers takes place. The characterization of GroEL hybrids containing different amounts of wild type and mutant subunits also indicates that as the number of inter-ring salt bridges increases the functional properties of the hybrids recover. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that inter-ring salt bridges form a stabilizing ring-shaped, ionic zipper that ensures inter-ring communication at the contact sites and therefore a functional protein-folding cycle.

Positive cooperative binding of ATP to one protein ring promotes the conformational change required for GroES binding to the same ring. Recent studies have revealed that the intra-ring allosteric transitions in GroEL are concerted (7Shiseki K. Murai N. Motojima F. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. Taguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11335-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Negative cooperativity in ATP binding results in an asymmetric oligomer where the two rings of the protein adopt different conformations. Conformational changes brought about by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis induce a spatial and temporal reorganization of the chaperonin structure, therefore controlling its functional cycle. In this context, inter-ring allosterism is critical for the continuous cycling of GroEL rings between protein accepting and releasing states, despite which it is less well understood than intra-ring cooperativity (8Sigler P.B., Xu, Z.

Among these interactions, the salt bridges E461-R452 at the so-called right site and E434-K105 at the left site might be important in maintaining a functional inter-ring interface. In this study we have characterized the role of the aforementioned ionic pairs in inter-ring communication. Our results show that mutants that have impaired any of these salt bridges are not functional as folding machines at physiological temperatures because of temperature-induced loosening of the communication between rings. This suggests that ionic pairs at the contact sites regulate the chaperonin thermostat, which is necessary to distinguish physiological (37 °C) from stress conditions (42 °C). GroEL mutants were produced by the homologous recombination technique (13Martin A. Toselli E. Rosier M. Auffray C. Devignes M.

Polymerase chain reaction was carried out using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) on the plasmid pARGRO (15Peárez-Peárez J. Gutierrez J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli GroEL and GroES were purified from a pAR3 plasmid harboring strain (15Peárez-Peárez J. Gutierrez J.

The single-ring (SR1) and the single-point double-ring (E461K and E434K) mutants were purified using the same procedure that was used with WT1 GroEL. ATPase activity was assayed using a spectrophotometric method that includes an ATP-regenerating system (17Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 15 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 30 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, pH 7.5. It was incubated at the desired temperature 10 min, and ATP (2 mm) was added and incubated for 2 more min. Finally, WT GroEL, E461K, E434K (50 nm, oligomer concentration), or SR1 (100 nm, oligomer concentration) were added, and the decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm was followed during 10 min in a thermostatted Uvikon 943 spectrophotometer. The rate of ATP hydrolysis (μmoles/min) was determined from the slope of the absorbance versus time plot, considering the extinction coefficient of NADH. The effect of GroES on the ATPase activity was measured in samples containing WT GroEL, E461K, E434K, or SR1 (2:1 and 1:1 oligomer ratio, respectively). Mitochondrial MDH (from porcine heart, Sigma) was denatured in 6 m urea at 37 °C for 30 min and diluted 50-fold in a medium containing the desired chaperonin specie at 25 °C, 37 °C, or 42 °C. The activity of MDH was assayed by measuring the decrease in absorption at 340 nm of NADH in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 with oxalacetate as substrate. Chaperonins (WT, E461K, and E434K GroEL) were incubated with GroES (1:2 molar ratio) at 25 °C, 37 °C, and 42 °C for 10 min. Afterward, ATP (2 mm) incubated at the same temperature was added to the mixture and incubated for 30 s. Samples were stained with 1% uranyl acetate and kept at the temperature of the assay. Grids were previously glow discharged and equilibrated at the corresponding temperature. Transmission electron microscopy was performed in a JEOL 1200EX-II electron microscope operated at 100 kV. 200 particles were analyzed visually for each sample and, according to their side views, classified as GroES-free, asymmetric and symmetric GroEL-GroES complexes (18Llorca O.

For image processing, micrographs of the specimens were digitized in an Eikonix scanner with a sampling window corresponding to 3.5 Å/pixel. Side views were selected, aligned using a free-pattern algorithm (20Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and subjected to classification using a self-organizing map algorithm (21Marabini R. Carazo J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1804-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to remove all the non-homogeneous particles. The resolution of the average images was estimated by the spectral signal to noise ratio (SSNR) method (22Unser M Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and average images were subsequently filtered to the resolution obtained. Preparation of hybrid chaperonins was performed as recently described (7Shiseki K. Murai N. Motojima F. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. Taguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11335-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, pure chaperonins or mixtures of WT and the aforementioned GroEL mutants at different molar ratios were denatured in 8 m urea (25 °C, 90 min). The unfolded proteins or protein mixtures were renatured by diluting them into buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 0.6 m ammonium sulfate (23Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. The reconstituted tetradecamers were purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm Na2SO4, pH 6.8. Fractions containing the renatured tetradecamer were concentrated with Ultrafree 10-kDa filters. Isoelectrofocussing was performed using PhastGels IEF 4–6.5 on a PhastSystem (Amersham Biosciences) that were silver stained. Measurements of initial rates of ATP hydrolysis at increasing concentrations of nucleotide have shown that GroEL undergoes two different allosteric transitions that can be explained assuming a nested allosteric model (5Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The first transition takes place at ATP concentrations lower than 100 μm (5Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and reflects positive cooperativity in ATP binding and hydrolysis within one ring. The second one, occurring at higher nucleotide concentrations, is caused by negative inter-ring cooperativity. As shown in Fig.1A, WT GroEL shows both allosteric transitions, as previously reported, at 25 °C. The one corresponding to negative inter-ring cooperativity becomes less pronounced at increasing temperatures (i.e. 37 °C and 42 °C), suggesting that at physiological and stress temperatures communication between rings is weakened (24Llorca O. Galán A. Carascosa J.L. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32587-32594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As expected from a single-ring particle, the transition corresponding to negative communication between rings is not observed for SR1 (Fig.1A). At 25 °C the decrease in ATPase activity for E461K (Fig. 1B) and E434K (Fig. 1C) associated with negative inter-ring cooperativity is less pronounced than that observed for WT GroEL (Fig. 1A), and is virtually abolished at 37 °C (Fig. 1, B and C). A comparison of the data depicted in Fig. 1 indicates that the behavior of both mutants at 25 °C is similar to that of WT GroEL at 37 °C, whereas at 37 °C they resemble WT GroEL at 42 °C. These results suggest that inter-ring communication is significantly weaker in both mutants, and that at physiological temperature it is not experimentally detected. To further analyze this interpretation, the extent of inhibition of the ATPase activity of GroEL by its cochaperonin GroES was studied at the aforementioned temperatures (Fig. 2). As previously reported (24Llorca O. Galán A. Carascosa J.L. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32587-32594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), GroES inhibits the ATPase activity of GroEL by about 50–55% at 25 °C and 37 °C, a value that decreases to 43% at stress temperatures (42 °C). Because of the single-ring structure of SR1, GroES inhibits 77% of the chaperonin ability to hydrolyze the nucleotide at 25 °C, a percentage that increases to 86% at 37 °C and is maintained at 42 °C. Interestingly, the inhibition at 25 °C is 72 and 59% for E461K and E434K, respectively, and at 37 °C and 42 °C the percentage increases to values similar to those described for SR1, i.e. 80–85%. These data reinforce the idea that a defective inter-ring communication might be responsible for the temperature-induced, single-ring-like behavior of both mutants at 37 °C. An estimation of the relative affinity of the different chaperonins used in this study for GroES was also made using electron microscopy (Table I). All three types of GroEL were independently incubated at the desired temperature in the presence of ATP, and the percentage of each oligomer (GroES-free, asymmetric and symmetric GroEL-GroES complexes) was estimated by analyzing side views of the particles. The percentage of symmetric and asymmetric complexes estimated for WT GroEL as a function of temperature suggests a slight decrease of the affinity of GroEL toward GroES at 42 °C. Interestingly, the values of symmetric complexes for both mutants is twice that found for GroEL (around 70%) at 25 °C and, in contrast to WT GroEL, this percentage increases up to 80–84% at 37 °C and remains stable at 42 °C. Therefore, electron microscopy data parallel the effect of temperature on the inhibition of the ATPase activity of these proteins by GroES. The effect of temperature on inter-ring communication was further characterized by analyzing the different proteins by electron microscopy and image processing (Fig.3). At physiological temperatures,i.e. 37 °C, the average side views of GroEL (Fig.3A) reveal the presence of two protein rings in close contact. In contrast, the inter-ring spacing of E434K (Fig.3B) and E461K (Fig. 3C) GroEL is enlarged as compared with WT GroEL incubated at the same temperature, suggesting a weaker inter-ring interaction. It is important to note that the inter-ring spacing observed for both mutants at 37 °C is similar to that previously described for GroEL at 45 °C (24Llorca O. Galán A. Carascosa J.L. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32587-32594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Table IGroES binding to the chaperoninsComplex (%)GroELE461KE434K25°C37°C42°C25°C37°C42°C25°C37°C42°CAsymmetric GroEL:GroES (1:1)656070271613302022Symmetric GroEL:GroES (1:2)354030738487708078Wt, E434K, and E461K GroEL were mixed with GroES (1:2 molar ratio) in the presence of 2 mm ATP at the indicated temperatures. Open table in a new tab Wt, E434K, and E461K GroEL were mixed with GroES (1:2 molar ratio) in the presence of 2 mm ATP at the indicated temperatures. The aforementioned interpretation implies that in the presence of GroES and nucleotides the efficiency of the mutants to fold stringent protein substrates, such as malate dehydrogenase, should be temperature-dependent. To prove it, the ability of the different GroEL oligomers to fold MDH was analyzed at several temperatures and compared with data obtained for WT GroEL and SR1 (Fig.4). As previously reported, WT GroEL refolds MDH at 25 °C and 37 °C (Fig. 4A). The extent of refolding at 25 °C (90%) is higher than at 37 °C (73%), although the folding reaction is faster at the latter temperature. At 42 °C the refolding yield is only 17%, suggesting that either the monomeric substrate protein that is released to the medium is not stable and able to form the active dimer, and is therefore bound by and released from the chaperonin continuously, or that the release mechanism is affected. A significant fraction of the protein substrate remains either stably or transiently bound to GroEL, as demonstrated by the recovery of active MDH (60%) when the temperature is lowered from 42 °C to 25 °C (not shown). The yield of MDH refolding observed for SR1 is smaller than the spontaneous one at 25 °C (Fig.4A) and negligible at 37° and 42 °C (not shown). It is important to mention that in the absence of the chaperonin there is no detectable refolding of MDH at 37 °C. The mutant E461K refolds MDH in a WT-like fashion at 25 °C since both the kinetics and the final extent of refolding are similar (Fig. 4B). However, E461K is unable to assist proper folding of the protein substrate at 37 °C, where only approximately 10% of the initially denatured MDH reaches its native, active conformation. These observations also apply to the E434K mutant (Fig. 4C). As mentioned for WT GroEL, at least part of the substrate protein remains bound to the chaperonins at either 37 °C or 42 °C, since partial MDH refolding is observed when the samples are cooled down from 42 °C to 25 °C (34% for E434K and 28% for E461K) and from 37 °C to 25 °C (50% for E434K and 44% for E461K). To better describe how inter-ring ionic pairs affect transmission of the allosteric inter-ring signal, we have also characterized the behavior of hybrids containing different amounts of WT and mutant subunits. As expected from the data presented previously for pure tetradecamers, at 25 °C the MDH folding ability of the E434K- and E461K-WT GroEL hybrids are similar to that of WT GroEL (data not shown). However, at 37 °C the extent of MDH refolding (see Fig.5 for E461K-WT GroEL hybrids) and ATPase inhibition by GroES (Fig. 6) depends, although not linearly, on the WT GroEL subunit content. As the mutant and WT tetradecamers can be distinguished by isoelectrofocussing, random incorporation of E461K (Fig. 6, inset) and E434K (data not shown) subunits into the hybrid complex was confirmed by this electrophoretic technique.Figure 6Functional properties of the hybrid WT :E461K.

Allosterism has been better discussed in relatively small proteins, such as hemoglobin (25Perutz M.F. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1989; 22: 139-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), and it has recently been modeled for large protein assemblies such as GroEL (1Horovitz A. Fridmann Y. Kafri G. Yifrach O. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). As compared with small proteins, GroEL displays unusual allosteric properties because of the complex interaction between its constituent subunits. Recent studies have suggested that positive intra-ring and negative inter-ring cooperativity might be connected (7Shiseki K. Murai N. Motojima F. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. Taguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11335-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Based on electron microscopy (EM) studies it has been proposed that the inter-ring contact located in the so-called left site Glu434-Lys105 is weakened upon ATP binding (26Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In the right contact site, the interaction Glu461-Arg452 has been shown to be part of the heptamer-heptamer contacting surface (9Braig K. Otwinoswki Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar, 10Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). A recent cryo-EM study has suggested that the effect of ATP on these contact sites is different since it shortens the distance at the right site and increases it at the left one. These data indicate that both contact sites are flexible and can rearrange in response to ligand binding (11Ranson N.A. Farr A.M. Roseman A.M. Gowen B. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Saibil H.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 869-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In this study we characterize whether these ion pairs, which are involved in inter-ring interaction, modulate GroEL function and the chaperonin's ability to differentiate physiological from stress temperatures (24Llorca O. Galán A. Carascosa J.L. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32587-32594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our data clearly indicate that when any of the two salt bridges stabilizing the inter-ring interface at the contact sites is disrupted, the negative inter-ring cooperativity is weakened. This results in mutant proteins that behave at physiological temperatures like WT GroEL under stress conditions, i.e. 45 °C. Previous findings on the temperature dependence of inter-ring signaling indicated that at physiological (37 °C) and stress (42–45 °C) temperatures, inter-ring communication is weaker than at 25 °C (24Llorca O. Galán A. Carascosa J.L. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32587-32594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the decreased negative cooperativity between the two GroEL rings with increasing temperatures, under stress conditions (i.e. 45 °C) the release of GroES from GroEL is slowed down, and therefore the chaperone system functions as a storing device that can be converted back into a folding device upon disappearance of the stress conditions (24Llorca O. Galán A. Carascosa J.L. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32587-32594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This functional switch avoids release of substrate proteins under conditions where aggregation rather than productive folding might take place. Therefore, GroEL has a thermostat that controls the transmission of the inter-ring allosteric signal that mediates GroES and protein substrate release. Our observations point toward the interactions that form part of the chaperonin’s thermostat and which allow the protein to sense the environment in order to distinguish physiological from stress conditions. As seen by electron microscopy, this mechanism seems to be related to the inter-ring spacing that increases at stress temperatures, resulting in weaker inter-ring communication (24Llorca O. Galán A. Carascosa J.L. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32587-32594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the absence of any of the aforementioned salt bridges at the inter-ring contacts, temperature destabilizes the inter-ring interface in such a way that there is no proper communication between rings at physiological temperature. Therefore, there is no proper folding activity. The temperature-induced stabilization of the GroEL-GroES symmetric complexes observed for both mutants, and demonstrated by both electron microscopy and GroES-induced ATPase inhibition, supports this interpretation. The formation of symmetric GroEL-GroES complexes would reduce the release of bound protein substrates from GroEL, which can be reversed once the temperature is lowered to a point where inter-ring communication is restored (i.e. 25 °C). It is important to note that at 25 °C a functional inter-ring communication is maintained in the mutants, their folding ability being comparable to that of wild type. Further support for this hypothesis comes from the finding that under experimental conditions where the mutant tetradecamers are not functional (i.e. 37 °C), the functional properties of the hybrid GroEL complexes depend on the WT GroEL subunit content. This might be explained by an inter-ring salt bridge-mediated stabilization of the heptamer-heptamer interface against the thermal challenge. The well known effect of salt bridges on the stabilization of proteins against thermal denaturation (28Jaenicke R. Bohm G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 738-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) might also be reflected at the inter-ring interface. As expected, it is experimentally found that at 37 °C an increase in the number of inter-ring ionic pairs progressively activates the GroEL hybrids, suggesting that they could exert an additive effect in maintaining the appropriate distance between contact sites for proper inter-ring communication. The importance of salt bridges in the conversion between the allosteric states of cooperative proteins has been noticed for systems such as aspartate transcarbamoylase (29Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 53-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and hemoglobin (30Ruso R. Benazzi L. Perrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13628-13634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that in the presence of ATP, switching of intersubunit salt bridges promotes propagation of positive cooperativity around a GroEL ring and mediates transmission of negative cooperativity across the inter-ring interface (11Ranson N.A. Farr A.M. Roseman A.M. Gowen B. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Saibil H.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 869-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 24Llorca O. Galán A. Carascosa J.L. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32587-32594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our results complement these observations because they demonstrate that in the ring-shaped molecule of GroEL, the crossed inter-subunit salt bridges at the inter-ring interface are necessary to modulate the fine tuning of GroEL's thermostat through stabilization of the interface by maintaining the inter-ring spacing. In summary, our data show that ionic interactions at the inter-ring interface allow GroEL to differentiate physiological from stress temperatures, a mandatory ability for a heat-shock protein.

In contrast to Erk1/2, little additional phosphorylation of Akt was observed after cytokine or serum stimulation. Replacement of the conditioned medium attenuated Akt phosphorylation such that 90 min after the addition of warmed serum-free media, Akt phosphorylation had fallen sufficiently to allow an epidermal growth factor-stimulated increase to be detected readily. Although the mechanism by which the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway is activated in serum-starved TEC is unknown, the mediator responsible is secreted from these cells. Thus, conditioned media removed from a dish of quiescent TECs stimulated Akt phosphorylation in washed TEC cultures within 10 min. Biochemical characterization of the bioactive agent identified a heat labile factor of small apparent molecular mass. The basal level of Akt phosphorylation observed in serum-starved cultures was inhibited by wortmannin at concentrations that demonstrated its dependence on 3-phosphoinositide synthesis (IC50 = 8 nm). Regular removal of conditioned media from TEC cultures and its replacement with serum free media resulted in a sustained attenuation of Akt phosphorylation. Interestingly, after 5 days of this treatment, washed TEC cultures contained a greater number of viable cells than cultures maintained in conditioned media throughout. This observation was not explained by a difference in the rate of DNA synthesis. Instead, the number of cells undergoing apoptosis increased markedly in the unwashed cultures. Consequently, we propose that in HKC-8 cells Akt phosphorylation is up-regulated in an effort to minimize cell death.

Ischemia and cytotoxic agents that permeate the glomerular filtration mechanism damage these cells directly. In many forms of chronic renal disease, perturbation of the glomerular architecture results in potentially toxic agents entering the interstitium and mediating the injury. In both forms of disease, a series of common pathogenic processes are initiated, resulting in epithelial cell death and the loss of renal function. Consequently, damage to the interstitium is widely regarded as the most accurate prognostic indicator of renal failure (1Risdon R.A. Sloper J.A.C. Wardener H.E. Lancet. 1968; ii: 363-366Abstract Google Scholar, 2Schainuck L.I. Striker G.E. Cutler R.E. Benditt E.P. Hum. Pathol. 1970; 1: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Serum deprivation and exposure to noxious agents such as oxidants, ionizing radiation, and alkylating agents have direct effects upon mammalian gene expression and cell proliferation (3Li N. Karin M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 319: 273-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant cellular response depends upon the duration and intensity of the exposure. Cells can enter a quiescent state to limit metabolic activity, mechanisms to initiate DNA repair and mitogenesis may be stimulated, or cells can undergo cell death by necrosis or apoptosis. Under such circumstances, decisions regarding cell cycle progression and initiation of transcriptional activity need to be made that require activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Until recently, the identity of these signaling events remained unclear. However, it is now accepted that exposure to cytotoxic agents evokes ligand-independent activation of many receptors including G-protein-coupled receptors for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (4Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and angiotensin II (5Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y.

Habermehl G.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and growth factors such as EGF and platelet-derived growth factor (8Suzuki K. Kodama S. Watanabe M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5396-5401PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). In this way, a spectrum of intracellular effectors are activated in a manner analogous to that observed after ligand addition. Of these signaling events, the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity has attracted particular attention. In mammals, PI3K is a large enzyme family containing eight human catalytic subunits (10Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). PI3K activity is increased after stimulation by a wide variety of chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors. Largely through the use of the pharmacological inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, PI3K has been shown to play a critical role in cell proliferation and survival (11Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). The major 3-phosphoinositide products are PtdIns 3-P, PtdIns (3,4)P2, and PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 (12Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Synthesis of PtdIns 3-P is constitutive, but PtdIns (3,4)P2 and PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 are dramatically elevated after ligand stimulation. This reflects their greater significance in receptor-mediated signal transduction. Identity of downstream targets for these 3-phosphoinositides remained unclear for many years until the identification of the serine threonine protein kinases Akt and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (13Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The protooncogene c-Akt (also termed protein kinase B) was originally implicated in the PI3K-signaling pathway downstream of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (14Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). After cell stimulation, the pleckstrin homology domain within Akt binds PtdIns (3,4,5)P3, allowing its translocation to the plasma membrane, where it becomes phosphorylated on residues Thr-308 and Ser-473. Phosphorylation of Thr-308 is mediated by the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK-1), but the identity of the kinase that phosphorylates residue Ser-473 remains controversial. Phosphorylation of Akt is now widely used to identify activation of the PI3K-signaling pathway. Akt promotes cell survival in part by phosphorylating and inhibiting several proteins involved in promoting apoptosis (15Kim A.H. Khursigara G. Sun X. Franke T.F. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Although the anti-apoptotic role of the PI3K/Akt pathway is widely acknowledged, few studies demonstrate increased levels of Akt phosphorylation under conditions where cell viability has been compromised. This is somewhat surprising given that activation of this signaling pathway might be expected in response to stress and cell damage. Indeed, inactivation and dephosphorylation of Akt has been described after hyperosmotic stress (16Meier R. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this study we investigate the significance of markedly elevated levels of Akt phosphorylation found in serum-starved cultures of the renal TEC line HKC-8. We investigate whether this increased Akt phosphorylation correlates with alterations in either cell viability or proliferation. Stock cultures of the TEC line HKC-8 cells were generous gifts from Dr. L. Racusen, Dept. of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. They were derived from human proximal tubule, and they have been extensively characterized (17Racusen L.C. Monteil C. Sgrignoli A. Lucskay M. Marouillat S. Rhim J.G. Morin J.P. J. Lab Clin. Med. 1997; 129: 318-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Cells were passaged every 3–4 days in 90-mm dishes (Nunc) using DMEM-F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite media supplement (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. For experimental use, cells were switched to serum-free DMEM-F-12. After 16 h, cultures were confluent and quiescent. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue staining and quantifying dye exclusion. Confluent HKC-8 cell cultures, treated in the absence or presence of various cytokines at 37 °C were lysed at 4 °C using 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 100 μmNa3VO4, 1% Triton-X100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml antipain (lysis buffer). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 20 min), and the supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube, extracted with 2× sample buffer (200 mm Tris/HCl, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol (pH 6.8)), and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Lysates were incubated with agarose-linked anti-Akt antibody (Akt1G1, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) for 4 h at 4 °C. The resultant immune complexes were isolated by centrifugation and washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer then kinase buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmMgCl2). The pellet was re-suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) fusion protein (GSK-3α/β cross-tide corresponding to residues surrounding GSK-3α/β (Ser-21/Ser-9) fused to paramyosin) (Cell Signaling Technology), and the sample was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated with 40 μl of 2× sample buffer and extracted by boiling for 5 min. Confluent cultures of HKC-8 cells were maintained for 2 days in DMEM-F-12. Conditioned media was removed, clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 ×g, and concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration using Centricon YM-3 cartridges (Millipore, UK) at 4 °C. An aliquot of the supernatant was applied to a Sephadex G-75 column maintained at 4 °C and eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl at 0.2 ml/min. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and tested for their ability to stimulate Akt phosphorylation in HKC-8 cultures previously washed with DMEM 2 h before challenge. After 10 min, lysates were prepared and extracted with 2× sample buffer. Proteins were electroporated onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes that were then blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 7.6) (TBST). These were incubated with antibody in TBST containing 3% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C. Phosphorylated Akt was detected with antibody directed against phospho-Ser-473 (Cell Signaling Technology). Phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β fusion protein was detected with anti-phospho glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β Ser-21/Ser-9 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Antibody against phosphorylated Erk1/2 was obtained from Promega, UK Ltd. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using anti-rabbit coupled HRP (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by ECL (AmershamBiosciences). Cultures were washed with warmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in 1.5 ml of PBS containing MTT (0.5 mg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. An equivalent volume of isopropanol was then added, and incubation was continued for a further 30 min at room temperature. Aliquots were removed, and their absorbance was read spectrophotometrically at 550 nm. Apoptosis was quantified using the TdT-FragEL DNA fragmentation detection kit (Oncogene). HKC-8 cells were plated on 13-mm glass coverslips, and at selected times they were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and permeabilized for 5 min at room temperature with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. After a 20-min equilibration in TdT buffer, samples were labeled with TdT reaction mix for 90 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Reactions were terminated with stop solution and rinsed in Tris-buffered saline. Once blocked, samples were incubated with detection reagent and visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride solution over 10–15 min. Preparations were then rinsed, counterstained with methyl green, and visualized using cooled CCD camera. Six fields were randomly chosen, and the number of TdT-positive cells present in each preparation was expressed as a percentage of the total number of nuclei. Cells plated on 13-mm glass coverslips were incubated with 100 μm BrdUrd for 4 h in humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After fixing with Carnoy’s solution (60% ethanol, 30% chloroform, 10% glacial acetic acid), cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.2% Triton X-100. They were rinsed and immersed in 1 m HCl (60 °C, 5 min). Normal sheep serum (20%) was used to block nonspecific binding sites over a 30-min incubation at room temperature. Anti-BrdUrd antibody (Dako, 1:50 dilution) was then added in 3% bovine serum albumin for a further 2 h followed by peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200) for 45 min at room temperature. Once rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, slides were developed in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, counterstained with eosin and dehydrated in graded alcohol and xylene. BrdUrd-labeled cells were counted in 6 representative fields, and the number is expressed as a percentage of the total cell number. Serum deprivation after attainment of confluence is a widely used treatment to obtain cultures in a quiescent state (18Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, cells exit the cell cycle and enter a state of Go. The addition of serum, cytokines, or growth factors allows synchronous entry into the cell cycle, and a unified response is obtained. In contrast to numerous cell types previously examined, quiescent HKC-8 cells demonstrated a high level of Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Consequently, after treatment with FBS or a variety of cytokines, no additional Akt phosphorylation was observed. This was not due to a failure of the treatment regimen because quiescent cultures had low levels of phosphorylated Erk1/2 (Fig. 1B), and phosphorylation of Erk1/2 increased dramatically after stimulation with serum, bradykinin, LPA, or EGF. In contrast, vasopressin and angiotensin II evoked a more modest stimulation. We also examined if elevated Akt phosphorylation in quiescent cultures of HKC-8 cells corresponded to constitutively increased Akt enzyme activity. Lysates were prepared from control and serum-stimulated cultures of murine Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and HKC-8 cells. Akt isolated from lysates of FBS-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells produced greater phosphorylation of the glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β cross-tide substrate than did the enzyme obtained from control lysates (Fig.1C). A phosphorylated doublet was produced due to the presence of partially degraded paramyosin that occurs during large scale bacterial expression of the fusion protein. 2A. McIlwrath (New England Biolabs), personal communication. Furthermore, Akt phosphorylated at Ser-473 was only evident in FBS-stimulated Swiss 3T3 lysates (Fig. 1D). In contrast, Akt isolated from lysates of HKC-8 cells incubated in the absence or presence of serum revealed equivalent protein kinase activity (Fig. 1C). Western blotting demonstrated that Akt isolated from control and serum stimulated lysates were phosphorylated on Ser-473 similarly (Fig.1D). Finally, Western blotting of total Akt confirmed an equivalent enzyme expression in stimulated and control lysates (Fig.1E). The HKC-8 cells used throughout this study were mycoplasma-negative (data not shown), thereby eliminating contamination with this bacterium as a possible explanation for our findings. To establish if HKC-8 cells were producing a factor to stimulate Akt phosphorylation in an autocrine manner, cells were washed, and the conditioned media was replaced with warmed, fresh serum-free media. After media replacement, Akt phosphorylation decreased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Within 3 h, Akt phosphorylation became markedly attenuated (<20% control). This effect was maintained over 12 h, after which time phosphorylation increased once again. Basal levels of Akt phosphorylation were eventually restored after 48 h. To exclude the possibility that media replacement blocks Akt phosphorylation in HKC-8 cells, quiescent cultures were washed with DMEM, and 90 min later, treated with EGF for various times. In contrast to quiescent cultures that were unwashed (control), Akt phosphorylation in washed cells increased dramatically after EGF addition (Fig.3, upper panels). This increase became maximal by 3 min and was maintained for more than 1 h. In contrast, the magnitude and kinetics of Erk1/2 phosphorylation were identical in washed and control cultures after EGF stimulation (Fig. 3, middle panels). Phosphorylation of Erk1/2 peaked after 3 min, returning to basal levels within 1 h. Cultures of washed HKC-8 cells were also incubated with either LPA (1 μg/ml), EGF (100 nm), or conditioned medium obtained from a parallel dish of quiescent cells for 10 min at 37 °C. Lysates were prepared, and proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE then Western-blotted with anti-phospho-Akt and anti-phospho-Erk1/2 antibody. LPA had little effect on Akt phosphorylation, although it markedly elevated Erk1/2 phosphorylation. EGF stimulated phosphorylation of both Akt and Erk1/2. In contrast, conditioned media only stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3, lower panels). Aliquots of HKC-8 cell-conditioned media were incubated at 60 °C for 15 min. Their ability to stimulate Akt phosphorylation was examined using confluent cultures of HKC-8 cells that were washed 2 h previously with warmed DMEM. Heating markedly attenuated the ability of conditioned media to stimulate Akt phosphorylation in these cultures (Fig. 4, upper panel). Fractionation of conditioned media by size exclusion chromatography revealed two peaks of activity able to induce Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4, lower panel). The first peak eluted in the void volume, and the second eluted with an apparent molecular mass smaller than the 25-kDa chymotrypsinogen A standard. It is currently unclear if the activity present in the void volume represents a high molecular mass protein or a complex containing the smaller molecular mass protein. Further purification was precluded due to loss of biological activity upon prolonged handling. Treatment of quiescent cultures with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of Akt phosphorylation with an IC50 of 8 nm and complete attenuation by 30 nm (Fig. 5). The role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in mediating the viability of HKC-8 cells was demonstrated by their treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (20 μm). Cell number was quantified by trypan blue exclusion, whereas cell viability was assessed by MTT assay (Fig.6). With both assays a significant difference was revealed after one day of LY294002 treatment, and this difference became greater with time. Inhibition of PI3K activity markedly attenuated the proliferation of HKC-8 cells, resulting in their death upon prolonged exposure (>3 days).Figure 6Inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002 induces cell death. Confluent cultures of HKC-8 cells were incubated in the absence (open symbols) or presence (closed symbols) of LY294002 (20 μm). At 24-h intervals, viable cells were visualized after Trypan blue exclusion and counted (upper panel). Cell viability was quantified using a MTT assay (lower panel). The metabolism of the MTT substrate was assessed spectrophotometrically measuring absorbance (Abs) at 550 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although we had shown that removal of conditioned media transiently decreased the level of Akt phosphorylation in HKC-8 cells, we wondered if a regimen of repeated media change would produce a sustained decrease in Akt phosphorylation. To this end, conditioned media was removed and replaced with warmed serum-free DMEM every 12 h. Conditioned media remained on control cultures throughout. Fig. 7 shows that regular media exchange produced a sustained attenuation of Akt phosphorylation that became maximal after 4 days of treatment compared with the control cultures. To exclude the possibility that this procedure reduced expression of the Akt enzyme, total Akt levels were determined by Western blotting. These were unaltered in washed and control cultures over the entire duration of the experiment. Having established that regular replacement of conditioned media suppressed the high basal level of Akt phosphorylation in quiescent cultures, we examined its implications for cell viability. Fig.8, upper panel, shows that initially no effect on cell number was observed. However, after day 4 the number of cells maintained in conditioned media reached a plateau and later decreased. In contrast, cells that were washed regularly continued to increase in number, reaching a higher plateau at day 6. The results of the MTT assay used to assess cell viability revealed a difference by day 3 (Fig. 8, lower panel). Cultures where media was replaced were more viable than those that remained in conditioned media. The decrease in cell viability exhibited by control cultures after day 3 correlated with the plateau in their cell number observed at day 4 (Fig. 8, upper panel). DNA synthesis was also quantified by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig.9). Although the proportion of BrdUrd-labeled cells decreased slightly over the study period, there was no significant difference between those cultures that were washed and those left in conditioned media. In an attempt to explain the difference in cell number between the two treatments, we assessed the degree of apoptotic cell death in each culture. Fig.10 shows that during the first 3 days, the number of terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells was low (<5%) in both washed cultures and those maintained in conditioned media. However, after day 4, the number of apoptotic cells in cultures maintained in conditioned media increased dramatically (46% at 8 days). In contrast, the number of apoptotic HKC-8 cells in washed cultures remained negligible during this time.Figure 10Conditioned media increases HKC-8 apoptotic cell death. HKC-8 cells were grown on 13-mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates. Once confluent and quiescent, cultures were washed with DMEM-F-12, and incubation was continued at 37 °C. Every 12 h, cultures were washed with fresh media (open symbols). Control cultures remained unwashed (closed symbols). Daily, representative cultures were fixed in paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and labeled with TdT. Cells were counterstained with methyl green and visualized. Fields were randomly chosen, and TdT-positive cells were counted and expressed as a percentage of the total cell number (n = 6). Representative fields obtained at the beginning and end of the experiment are illustrated. TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results of this study reveal an inverse correlation between the basal level of Akt phosphorylation and long term viability of HKC-8 cells under serum-free conditions. Originally, the degree of Akt phosphorylation observed in serum-starved cultures precluded further increase after serum or cytokine stimulation (19Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). This effect was clearly selective for Akt since phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was negligible in quiescent cultures and increased dramatically after ligand addition (Fig. 1). It soon became clear that the factor responsible for Akt phosphorylation was secreted into the conditioned media since its replacement with fresh media markedly attenuated this activity (Fig.2). Although the identity of this factor remains elusive, we have demonstrated that it is heat-labile, and it can be isolated by biochemical fractionation (Fig. 4). Chemokines and cytokines including heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, transforming growth factor-α, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor, endothelin-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor-BB have all been previously proposed to act as autocrine mediators of this cell type (20Homma T.

Transplant. 1999; 14: 2628-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Kanellis J. Fraser S. Katerelos M. Power D.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 278: 905-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional candidates included LPA and EGF since LPA is a major mitogenic component of serum, and EGF is very highly expressed by renal tubular cells (23Iglesias J. Abernethy V.E. Wang Z. Lieberthal W. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F711-F722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fisher D.A. Salido E.C. Barajas L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, neither is involved in this model since the ability of LPA and EGF to stimulate phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 both differ from that of the conditioned media (Fig. 3). Biochemical analysis revealed the factor to be heat-labile and have an apparent molecular mass less than 25 kDa (Fig. 4). In addition, the detection of activity eluting in the void volume implies that conditioned media either contains two factors able to stimulate the PI3K pathway or that the smaller molecule may aggregate or bind larger proteins. The sensitivity of Akt phosphorylation in HKC-8 cells to wortmannin treatment (IC50 = 8 nm) confirmed the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase enzyme activity and excluded the isozyme PI3K-C2α, the catalytic activity of which is more refractory to this inhibitor (25Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Pharmacological attenuation of 3-phosphoinositide synthesis markedly inhibited HKC-8 cell viability in culture (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the results of numerous studies documenting the anti-apoptotic effects of PI3K enzyme activity (26Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 27Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S., Fu, H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar). However, such data demonstrate a cellular dependence for 3-phosphoinositides and not necessarily their role as anti-apoptotic mediators. Regular removal of conditioned media was also able to maintain a markedly attenuated phosphorylation of the Akt enzyme (Fig. 7). However, in contrast to the use of LY294002, Akt phosphorylation was not completely abolished. Consequently, if the autocrine factor were mitogenic, then cells remaining in conditioned media would remain more viable than those cultures where the conditioned media was continuously replaced and Akt phosphorylation suppressed. However, if this factor were cytotoxic, phosphorylation of Akt might be an attempt to preserve cell viability. Data presented in Figs. 7 and 9 demonstrated markedly increased apoptotic cell death in those cultures that remained in conditioned media. We cannot exclude the possibility that HKC-8 cells also produce growth factors to support their viability during periods of serum depravation, although increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation was not observed (Figs. 1 and 3). We conclude that if the conditioned media remains on these cultures, an accumulation of cytotoxic factors or metabolites occurs, and the cells respond by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Consequently, the high level of Akt phosphorylation observed in serum-starved cultures of HKC-8 cells is indicative of cell stress and suggests that it is an attempt to minimize the cell damage and death that will later ensue. A role of Akt phosphorylation in cell proliferation cannot be supported in this model since the rate of DNA synthesis in both sets of cultures remained unaltered. Other examples of stress-mediated activation of the PI3K pathway include mechanical stress (28Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar, 29Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), UV irradiation (30Nomura M. Kaji A., Ma, W.Y. Zhong S. Liu G. Bowden G.T. Miyamoto K.I. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and treatment with cytotoxic agents such as H2O2 (31Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M., Xu, Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar, 32Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). It is becoming clear that under such conditions, proliferative signaling mechanisms become activated in an attempt to sustain cell number. H2O2 treatment leads to ligand-independent phosphorylation and activation of the ErbB receptor family, thereby activating the PI3K and Erk/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (33Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Induction of cell death by use of PI3K antagonists has demonstrated that 3-phosphoinositide synthesis must be maintained to ensure cell viability (Ref. 26Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar and Fig. 5). This is supported by the role of the PI3K pathway in regulating the activity of the Bcl-2 protein family. Akt phosphorylates BAD to relieve its inhibitory effect on Bcl-2 enzyme activity (27Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S., Fu, H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar). Akt also inhibits the stress-activated kinase SEK1 and its substrate, JNK1 (34Park H.S. Kim M.S. Huh S.H. Park J. Chung J. Kang S.S. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2573-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells in which constitutively active Akt is overexpressed and cells heterozygous for the 3-phosphatase PTEN show reduced levels of cell death (35Thakkar H. Chen X. Tyan F. Gim S. Robinson H. Lee C. Pandey S.K. Nwokorie C. Onwudiwe N. Srivastava R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38361-38369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 36Di Cristofano A. Kotsi P. Peng Y. Cordon-Cardo C. Elkon K. Pandolfi P. Science. 1999; 285: 2122-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Because epithelial cells line the renal tubules in situ they are continually exposed to shear stress and alterations in the ionic content of the extracellular medium at their apical surface. The marked up-regulation of Akt phosphorylation observed under conditions of low serum may reflect the mechanism of their sustained viability in such an environment. Examination of another human epithelial cell line, HK2, also revealed increased Akt phosphorylation in quiescent cultures. However, in contrast to HKC-8 cells, 10% FBS was able to increase Akt phosphorylation further (data not shown). Possibly HKC-8 cells demonstrate a greater sensitivity to noxious stimuli and respond by an accentuated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Marked Akt phosphorylation in quiescent cultures has also been shown with other cell lines, although the significance of this observation is rarely noted (37Okano J. Gaslightwala I. Birnbaum M.J. Rustgi A.K. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30934-30942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 38Gustin J.A. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27740-27744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition to cytokine receptor-driven anti-apoptotic mechanisms, the role of cell adhesion to extracellular matrix through integrin receptors should also be considered (39Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The focal adhesion kinase FAK has recently been shown to suppress chemically induced apoptosis of TEC (40van de W.B. Houtepen F. Huigsloot M. Tijdens I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36183-36193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-397 creates a consensus motif for binding of the SH2 domain of the class IA PI3K adaptor p85. This association plays a role in extracellular matrix-mediated cell survival that involves activation of Akt (41Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Although we have demonstrated that Akt phosphorylation is dependent upon 3-phosphoinositide synthesis, the enzyme responsible and the mechanism of its activation remains elusive. In contrast to the mitogen-activated protein kinase enzyme family, the identification of PI3K isozymes involved in stress-mediated responses has received little attention. The class IB phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ was shown to mediate shear stress-dependent activation of JNK in endothelial cells (42Go Y.M. Park H. Maland M.C. Darley-Usmar V.M. Stoyanov B. Wetzker R. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1898-H1904PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidative stress of murine fibroblasts causes accumulation of PtdIns (3,4)P2, whereas osmotic stress increased PtdIns (3,4)P2 and PtdIns (3,4,5)P3(43Van der Kaay J. Beck M. Gray A. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35963-35968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in that study the production of each 3-phosphoinositide correlated poorly with Akt and p70S6 kinase phosphorylation. In yeast, hyperosmotic stress stimulates the production of PtdIns (3,5)P2, although in mammalian cells, it is generated after hypo-osmotic shock (44Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Like PtdIns (3,4)P2 and PtdIns (3,4,5)P3, synthesis of PtdIns (3,5)P2 is wortmannin-sensitive (45Whiteford C.C. Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem.

Consequently, it is unlikely to play a major role in Akt activation. A more detailed examination of the mechanisms that underlie constitutive Akt phosphorylation in TEC is clearly warranted.

https://openalex.org/W2015919979,"The transcriptional activator protein Bas2 is required to express more than 20 genes in pathways for purine nucleotide and histidine biosynthesis, phosphate utilization, and the HO endonuclease by acting with co-regulator proteins Bas1, Pho4, and Swi5. The role that Bas2 plays in transcriptional activation may be to unmask latent activation domains in the co-regulator and to promote ternary complex formation between Bas2, the co-regulator, and DNA. We show that Bas2 also contributes to transcriptional activation by providing an activation domain. We localize this domain in Bas2 to the C-terminal 156 amino acids using deletion analysis and fusion to a heterologous DNA binding domain. Additionally, we show that Bas2 makes direct contacts with Bas1. This interaction is detected by co-immunoprecipitation and by two-hybrid analysis. We localize the interaction region to the central portion of Bas2, from amino acids 112 to 404.

Thus, Bas2 has been implicated in the regulation of more than 20 genes, the majority of these in conjunction with Bas1. The Bas2 co-regulators are thought to provide an activation domain that is able to interact with a component of the transcriptional machinery, Swi/Snf, and Mediator in the case of Swi5 and TFIIB for Pho4 (7Neely K.E.

The role of Bas2 in transcriptional activation may be to increase the accessibility of masked activation domains, as shown for Pho4 and Bas1 (11Shao D. Creasy C.L. Bergman L.W. Mol. Gen.

Alternatively, Bas2 may interact with a component of the transcriptional machinery different from its co-regulators, although Bas2 is not considered to have an activation domain (14Hirst K. Fisher F. McAndrew P.C. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5410-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Another role for Bas2 is to promote formation of the ternary complex between both activators and DNA. Cooperative binding between Bas2 and Pho4 occurs at PHO5 (15Barbaric S. Munsterkotter M. Svaren J. Horz W.

In contrast to a report which indicated that Bas2 lacks an activation region (14Hirst K. Fisher F. McAndrew P.C. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5410-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), our previous work suggested that Bas2 does provide activation function (12Zhang F. Kirouac M. Zhu N. Hinnebusch A.G. Rolfes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3272-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this report, we clearly show that Bas2 has an activation domain and localize this activity to the C-terminal 156 amino acids. Additionally, we demonstrate that Bas2 makes a direct contact with Bas1, and we map this region for interaction along the central portion of Bas2, from amino acids 112 to 404. For this work, we usedSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain RR88 (MATα his3 trp1 ura3–1 leu2::lexAop-LEU2 bas1–2 bas2–2), which has been previously described (12Zhang F. Kirouac M. Zhu N. Hinnebusch A.G.

A 5-ml overnight cell culture in SC medium containing 2% glucose was used to inoculate 50 ml of SC medium containing 1% raffinose and 2% galactose, and the cells were grown for 4–6 h until the A600 was between 0.5 and 1.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 5 ml of ice-cold BB50 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), and repelleted. The pellets were frozen overnight at −80 °C after removing the buffer. Cell extracts were prepared in 100 μl of BB50 buffer containing the protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by shaking with glass beads for six 1-min pulses in a Tomy shaker at 4 °C with 1-min cooling on ice between shaking. Crude extracts were transferred to a new tube, the glass beads were washed once with 100 μl of BB50 plus protease inhibitor, and the wash was combined with the supernatant. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube. Protein concentrations, generally between 15 and 20 mg/ml, were determined using the Bradford reagent and bovine serum albumin as the standard. Extracts were precleared by mixing 200 μl of protein-A-Sepharose beads (prepared in BB50) with 2 mg of yeast extract and rocking for 2 h at 4 °C. Antibodies were prebound to protein-A-Sepharose beads by mixing 4 μl of rabbit anti-LexA antiserum (a gift of Dr. Erica Golemis) with 100 μl of beads and rocking them at 4 °C for 2 h. At the end of the 2-h pretreatment, the beads were pelleted from the extract by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 30 s. The entire supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and the divided in half, by volume; half was added to the tube containing the beads prebound with antibody, and the other half was added to the tube with beads but lacking antiserum. Both tubes were rocked at 4 °C overnight. Samples were subjected to centrifugation at 8000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatants were transferred into clean tubes. The pellet fractions were washed 4 times using 500 μl of BB50 + protease inhibitor. The entire pellet fraction from the immunoprecipitation was mixed with 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and 20 μl of the supernatant (∼20%) was mixed with 5 μl of 6× sample buffer (25Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 10.7-10.10Google Scholar). Samples were loaded onto 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to electrophoresis at 100 V (25Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 10.7-10.10Google Scholar). Protein was electroblotted onto HYBOND membranes at 4 °C in transfer buffer (10% methanol in 1× SDS running buffer) for 1 h at 100 V. Filters were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS-milk-Tween (1× PBS,1 2% Carnation nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.02% NaN3). Filters were washed briefly with PBS-Tween and incubated at ambient temperature for 1 h in PBS-milk-Tween containing 12CA5 monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody at a 1/2000 dilution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Filters were washed four times for 5 min in 20 ml of PBS-Tween. Filters were incubated for 1 h in PBS-Tween containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig at 1/5000 dilution (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were washed 3 times for 5 min each in PBS-Tween. The ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. Strains to be assayed were grown at 30 °C for about 48 h to stationary phase in synthetic dextrose medium containing only the supplements (26Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) dictated by the auxotrophic requirements plus 0.15 mm adenine. For induction of the activation domain (AD)-domain fusion proteins, cells were grown in supplemented synthetic dextrose medium and transferred into synthetic medium with 2% galactose and 1% raffinose as the carbon sources. Cultures were diluted 1/25 into 50 ml of the same medium containing or lacking adenine (as indicated in the text) and grown to mid-log phase. Extracts were prepared, and β-galactosidase assays were performed as previously described (27Lucchini G. Hinnebusch A.G. Chen C. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1326-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our previous results suggest that Bas2 contains an activation domain (12Zhang F. Kirouac M. Zhu N. Hinnebusch A.G. Rolfes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3272-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and we wanted to characterize this domain in greater detail. We integrated thelexAop-lacZ reporter into the genome and expressed a LexA fusion protein that contained the full-length Bas2 protein, LexA-Bas2-(1–559). The LexA-Bas2-(1–559) fusion promoted expression of the reporter to 49 units (Fig.1, construct 1), 4-fold above the 12 units for the negative control LexA-bicoid. Because thelexAop-lacZ reporter was integrated, expression was detected at levels significantly lower than previously reported for episomal constructs (12Zhang F. Kirouac M. Zhu N. Hinnebusch A.G. Rolfes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3272-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To eliminate potential DNA binding by Bas2, we incorporated the double-point mutations (tryptophan 124 to alanine and asparagine 127 to alanine), which disrupt the secondary structure of the homeodomain and essentially eliminate DNA binding activity (28Justice M.C. Hogan B.P. Vershon A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4730-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This protein construct, LexA-Bas2-(4–559m) exhibited the same level of expression as LexA-Bas2-(1–559), indicating that activation function does not require a functional homeodomain (construct 2). These results confirm our earlier report (12Zhang F. Kirouac M. Zhu N. Hinnebusch A.G. Rolfes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3272-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and indicate that Bas2 carries an activation domain. To localize this activation domain, we generated fusion proteins containing the LexA DNA binding domain and various portions of Bas2. As shown in Fig. 1, we made nine new constructs containing N-terminal, central, and C-terminal portions of Bas2. LexA fusion proteins containing N-terminal (LexA-Bas2-(4–263m) and central portions (LexA-Bas2-(262–368) and LexA-Bas2-(112–404)) of Bas2 were unable to stimulate reporter expression (Fig. 1, constructs 3–5). We were able to detect expression of these proteins by Western analysis; however, the molecular weight of LexA-Bas2-(262–368) was the same as LexA alone, suggesting that this fusion protein was unstable and truncated to the more stable LexA domain (data not shown). LexA fusion proteins containing C-terminal portions of Bas2 exhibited very high reporter expression. Fusion proteins LexA-Bas2-(360–467) and LexA-Bas2-(460–559) led to β-galactosidase activities of 120 and 170 units, respectively. These values were 10- and 16-fold higher than the negative control (12 units from LexA-bicoid). A fusion protein containing the equivalent of both of these pieces together, LexA-Bas2-(360–559), strongly stimulated expression to 890 units (construct 6). However, the highest level of expression resided in LexA-Bas2-(404–559) (construct 9). This fusion protein led to 1400 units of β-galactosidase activity, a ∼120-fold increase. To more finely map this activation region, we generated two additional C-terminal deletion constructs based on this latter construct (Fig. 1, constructs 10 and 11). LexA-Bas2-(404–496) and LexA-Bas2-(404–467) both promote β-galactosidase expression to ∼290 units but are significantly decreased from the 1400 units in LexA-Bas2-(404–559). Additionally, they are detected at about 2-fold higher levels than LexA-Bas2-(404–559) in immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Taken together these results indicate that a minimally bipartite activation domain resides in the C-terminal portion of Bas2. Because constructs 10 and 11 activate expression to similar levels, the first domain resides between residues 404 and 467, and no activation function can be attributed to residues 468 to 496. Construct 8 (LexA-Bas2-(460–559)) reveals the position of the second domain between 460 to 559; however, because no activation function is present between 468–496, the second domain can be narrowed to 496–559. Importantly, the high level of activation observed with 404–559 indicates that the two independent domains cooperate synergistically to promote transcription. Furthermore, because expression from LexA-Bas2-(404–559) is ∼30-fold higher than LexA-Bas2-(1–559) (compare 1400 units to 49 units), it is likely that other portions of the protein normally mask exposure of this domain. The experiment described above using the LexA-Bas2 fusion proteins suggests that the C-terminal activation domain makes direct contact with one or more components of the transcriptional machinery. An alternative interpretation is that the region of Bas2 from amino acids 404 to 559 is making an indirect contact with the transcriptional machinery through one of its partners, Bas1, Pho4, or Swi5. Both Pho4 and Swi5 interact with Bas2, and they also make direct contacts with the transcriptional machinery; Pho4 contacts TFIIB (8Wu W.H. Hampsey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2764-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and Swi5 contacts the Swi/Snf and Mediator complexes (7Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Wallberg A.E. Steger D.J. Cairns B.R. Wright A.P.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2457-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the experiment above, we used a bas1Δ strain to eliminate effects from Bas1. To determine whether Pho4 or Swi5 or both are contributing to the expression detected in Fig. 1, strains were constructed that carried deletion alleles of PHO4 andSWI5 as single alleles or together as a double mutant in a strain that already carried a deletion of bas1. Plasmids encoding LexA-bicoid, LexA-Bas2-(1–559), and LexA-Bas2-(404–559) were transformed into these four strains, and extracts were assayed for expression of the lexAop-lacZreporter construct. As shown in Table II, both LexA-Bas2-(1–559) and LexA-Bas2-(404–559) express approximately the same level of β-galactosidase activity independent of the presence or absence of Swi5 or Pho4. These results indicate that the activation domain of Bas2 is not indirectly interacting with the transcriptional machinery via Swi5 or Pho4, although it remains possible that it does so through an uncharacterized activator. Instead, it appears that LexA-Bas2-(404–559) contacts the transcriptional machinery directly.Table IIβ-Galactosidase expressionStrain (relevant genotype)LexA fusionβ-galactosidaseunitsDY6977 (BAS2 bas1 SWI5 PHO4)LexA-bicoid8LexA-Bas2-(1–559)330LexA-Bas2-(404–559)2100DY6975 (BAS2 bas1 SWI5 pho4)LexA-bicoid9LexA-Bas2-(1–559)400LexA-Bas2-(404–559)2100DY6981 (BAS2 bas1 swi5 PHO4)LexA-bicoid7LexA-Bas2-(1–559)410LexA-Bas2-(404–559)1800DY6980 (BAS2 bas1 swi5 pho4)LexA-bicoid7LexA-Bas2-(1–559)295LexA-Bas2-(404–559)2200 Open table in a new tab We previously demonstrated that a LexA-Bas1 fusion protein promoted adenine-regulated, high level expression when cells expressed the native Bas2 protein or a derivative that carried mutations disrupting the homeodomain, but only basal levels of expression were observed in the absence of Bas2 (12Zhang F. Kirouac M. Zhu N. Hinnebusch A.G. Rolfes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3272-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We interpreted those data to indicate that LexA-Bas1 tethered Bas2 to DNA by direct protein interaction. To determine whether Bas1 and Bas2 directly associate with each other, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation using the two-hybrid reagents we developed. Yeast extracts were prepared from strains co-expressing either LexA-Bas1 or LexA-alone along with a Bas2 fusion protein composed of Bas2-(4–559), the B42 AD, the hemagglutinin epitope, and a nuclear localization signal. We performed immunoprecipitations using an antiserum generated against LexA, a control antiserum generated against eIF2α, or no antiserum. The pellet and supernatant fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were blotted to a membrane filter. An anti-HA antibody was used to detect the hemagglutinin epitope in the AD-Bas2 fusion protein. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig.2A. No AD-Bas2 protein was detected in the pellet fraction of cells that expressed LexA protein without Bas1 (lane 6). When the immunoprecipitation antibody was omitted (lanes 1 and 2) or when anti-eIF2α was used (lanes 7 and 8), AD-Bas2 protein was detected only in the supernatant fraction. AD-Bas2 protein was found in the pellet fraction only when anti-LexA antiserum was added to the immunoprecipitation of cell extracts expressing LexA-Bas1 (lane 4). Thus, we detect a direct interaction between Bas1 and Bas2 by co-immunoprecipitation. To characterize the interaction between Bas1 and Bas2, we used a two-hybrid approach. A plasmid was constructed to express nearly the entirety of Bas2 fused to the B42 AD. Transformed cells carrying plasmids that expressed both the LexA-Bas1 fusion and either the AD-Bas2 or AD-vector were grown in media lacking adenine (derepressing conditions) and containing adenine (repressing conditions). The LexA-Bas1 chimera with AD vector promoted expression of thelexAop-lacZ reporter to only the low level of ∼220 units under derepressing conditions and 170 units under repressing conditions, as shown in Fig. 3(AD vector, construct 1). The fusion protein containing Bas2 (AD-Bas2-(4–559), construct 2) stimulated expression from the reporter to 1300 units under derepressing conditions and 260 units under repressing conditions. If we subtract out the background of the AD vector construct and divide to obtain a repression ratio, the AD-Bas2-(4–559) protein exhibits a 12-fold adenine repression of thelexAop-lacZ reporter. Thus, these results demonstrate that adenine regulation occurs when Bas1 and Bas2 are in a two-hybrid context and that adenine limitation is required for the interaction between Bas1 and Bas2, consistent with our previous results (12Zhang F. Kirouac M. Zhu N. Hinnebusch A.G. Rolfes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3272-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because growth in the presence and absence of adenine led to regulated expression of the two-hybrid reporter and regulated interaction between LexA-Bas1 and AD-Bas2, we wanted to determine whether we could detect a difference in the ability to co-immunoprecipitate AD-Bas2 with LexA-Bas1 under these two growth conditions. Whole cell extracts were prepared from cells grown in media containing or lacking adenine. Anti-LexA antiserum was mixed with extracts, which were separated into pellet and supernatant fractions, as described above. We detected approximately the same amount of AD-Bas2 in the pellet fraction under both conditions (Fig.2B). Thus, when cells are grown in adenine, we can detect repression of reporter expression and regulated interaction in the two-hybrid assay but no diffe"
