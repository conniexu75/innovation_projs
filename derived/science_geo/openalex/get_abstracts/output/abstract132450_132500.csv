https://openalex.org/W1983052307,"The occurrence of DNA double strand breaks induces cell cycle arrest in mortal and immortal human cells. In normal, mortal fibroblasts this block to proliferation is permanent. It depends on the growth regulator p53 and a protein p53 induces, the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. We show here that following DNA damage in mortal fibroblasts, the induction of p21 and p53 is to a large degree shortlived. By 8 days after a brief exposure to DNA strand breaking agents, bleomycin or actinomycin D, p53 protein is at baseline levels, while the p53 transactivation level is only slightly above its baseline. By this time the concentration of p21 protein, which goes up as high as 100-fold shortly after treatment, is down to just 2–4-fold over baseline levels. Following the drop in p21 concentration a large increase in the expression level of the tumor suppressor gene p16INK4a is observed. This scenario, where a transient increase in p21 is followed by a delayed induction of p16INK4a, also happens with the permanent arrest that occurs with cellular senescence. In fact, these cells treated with agents that cause DNA double strand breaks share a number of additional markers with senescent cells. Our findings indicate that these cells are very similar to senescent cells and that they have additional factor(s) beside p21 and p53 that maintain cell cycle arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2049708133,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a prime regulator of normal and pathological angiogenesis. Three related endothelial cell growth factors, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D were recently cloned. We have here studied the regulation of VEGF-C, a lymphatic endothelial growth factor, by angiogenic proinflammatory cytokines. Interleukin (IL)-1β induced a concentration- and a time-dependent increase in VEGF-C, but not in VEGF-B, mRNA steady-state levels in human lung fibroblasts. The increase in VEGF-C mRNA levels was mainly due to increased transcription rather than elevated mRNA stability as detected by the nuclear run-on method and by following mRNA decay in the presence of an inhibitor of transcription, respectively. In contrast, angiopoietin-1 mRNA, encoding the ligand for the endothelial-specific Tek/Tie-2 receptor, was down-regulated by IL-1β. Tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1α also elevated VEGF-C mRNA steady-state levels, whereas the IL-1 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone inhibited the effect of IL-1β. Experiments with cycloheximide indicated that the effect of IL-1β was independent of protein synthesis. Hypoxia, which is an important inducer of VEGF expression, had no effect on VEGF-B or VEGF-C mRNA levels. IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α also stimulated the production of VEGF-C protein by the fibroblasts. Cytokines and growth factors have previously been shown to down-regulate VEGF receptors in vascular endothelial cells. We found that the mRNA for the VEGF- and VEGF-C-binding VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1) was stimulated by IL-1β in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, whereas the mRNA levels of VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4) were not altered. Our data suggest that in addition to VEGF, VEGF-C may also serve as an endothelial stimulus at sites of cytokine activation. In particular, these results raise the possibility that certain proinflammatory cytokines regulate the lymphatic vessels indirectly via VEGF-C.

In particular, these results raise the possibility that certain proinflammatory cytokines regulate the lymphatic vessels indirectly via VEGF-C. Angiogenesis, most commonly involving sprouting of capillaries from preexisting blood vessels, starts with proteolysis of the subendothelial extracellular matrix followed by migration and proliferation of endothelial cells (1Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5990) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the newly grown endothelium differentiates into tubelike structures, which are stabilized by mesenchymal components, preventing leakage and fused to allow blood circulation. The significance of angiogenesis is now widely accepted in many physiological and pathological conditions (2Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is needed for embryonic development, for several female reproductive functions, and for wound healing and other repair processes, including collateral blood vessel formation in ischemic limb and heart diseases (1Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5990) Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. N. Engl. J.

Angiogenesis also occurs in nonmalignant diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, atherosclerosis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and its importance in solid tumor growth has been demonstrated in multiple experimental models. Several growth factors and cytokines promote angiogenesis in animal models. Most of them, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; Ang-1, angiopoietin-1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; IL, interleukin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ra, receptor antagonist; r, recombinant; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, VEGF receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; Ang-1, angiopoietin-1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; IL, interleukin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ra, receptor antagonist; r, recombinant; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, VEGF receptor.-α and interleukin (IL)-1, do not stimulate endothelial cell growth in culture and are thus called indirect angiogenic factors (4Jackson, J. R., Seed, M. P., Kircher, C. H., Willoughby, D. A., and Winkler, J. D. FASEB J., 11,457–465.Google Scholar). Once tubes composed of endothelial cells are formed, angiogenesis is apparently completed by stabilization of these vessels through migration of pericytes and production of basement membrane components. Both of these processes have been suggested to be facilitated via endothelial cell specific Tek/Tie-2 receptor ligand angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) (5Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L.

In addition to angiogenic inducers, several endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis have been recently characterized (2Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar, 9O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J. Cell. 1997; 88: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4199) Google Scholar). The switch to an angiogenic phenotype in tumors may thus be triggered by overproduction of factors in favor of angiogenesis or reduction of inhibitor release, both of which can depend on the activation of oncogenes and inactivation of antioncogenes (1Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5990) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also known as vascular permeability factor or vasculotropin, is a glycoprotein with homology to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and it is translated into multiple protein forms due to alternative exon splicing (reviewed in Refs. 10Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar, 11Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4752) Google Scholar, 12Klagsbrun M.

VEGF is a prototype of directly acting angiogenic factors, because it is secreted in a biologically active form, its receptors are found at sites of angiogenesis, and it is the most specific endothelial cell growth factor known thus far. VEGF also induces vascular permeability, regulates production of proteases and their inhibitors, and promotes endothelial cell differentiation, movement, and survival, which are related to its angiogenic properties. Up-regulation of VEGF synthesis by hypoxia and by several indirectly acting angiogenic factors also supports its role in angiogenesis. VEGF transduces its signals through Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR/Flk-1 (VEGFR-2) tyrosine kinase receptors. However, mitogenesis of endothelial cells may be signaled exclusively via VEGFR-2. Genetic disruption of VEGF or its receptors has indicated that they are necessary for vasculogenesis (differentiation of endothelial cells from their precursors) and angiogenesis (15Fong G.H.

Further, injection of VEGF can induce blood vessel formation, whereas antibodies against VEGF, soluble extracellular domain of VEGFR-1 or overexpression of a dominant negative VEGFR-2 inhibit angiogenesis and subsequent tumor growth in animal models (13Thomas K.A.

Thus, this family is currently composed of five members, including also the placenta growth factor (33Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Delli-Bovi P. Persico M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9267-9271Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). VEGF-B is an endothelial cell mitogen, which is expressed in most tissues, but especially highly in the heart and skeletal muscle (23Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana A. Pettersson R.F. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). VEGF-C induces endothelial cell migration and vascular permeability (26Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), but, unlike VEGF, it is a relatively weak mitogen for blood vascular endothelial cells (28Lee J. Gray A. Yuan J. Luoh S.-M. Avraham H. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 30Hu J-S. Hastings G.A. Cherry S. Gentz R. Ruben S. Coleman T.A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). VEGF-C mRNA is expressed at low levels in many tissues, most prominently in the heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, ovary, and the small intestine, and it is also present in certain tumor cell lines (26Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 35Enholm B. Paavonen K. Ristimäki A.

VEGF-C is the ligand for VEGFR-2 and for the third member of the VEGF receptor family, VEGFR-3 (also known as Flt-4), which is espressed mainly on venous endothelium in early embryos and lymphatic endothelium in adult tissues (27Kukk E. Lymboussaki A. Taira S. Kaipainen A. Jeltsch M. Joukov V. Alitalo K. Development. 1996; 122: 3829-3837PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kaipainen A. Korhonen J. Pajusola K. Aprelikova O. Persico M.G.

Alitalo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3566-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Indeed, mice overexpressing VEGF-C in basal keratinocytes developed hyperplastic lymphatic vessels in the skin (38Jeltsch M. Kaipainen A. Joukov V. Meng X. Lakso M. Rauvala H. Swartz M. Fukumura D. Jain R.K. Alitalo K. Science. 1997; 276: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Although VEGF induces growth of vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells in vitro, it seems to be specific for blood vessel growth in vivo (39Oh S.-J. Jeltsch M.M. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. Weich H.A. Christ B. Alitalo K. Wilting J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The existence of a gene family consisting of several related growth factors suggests that these family members have overlapping but distinct functions and that they may be differentially regulated. The lymphatic endothelial growth factor VEGF-C (38Jeltsch M. Kaipainen A. Joukov V. Meng X. Lakso M. Rauvala H. Swartz M. Fukumura D. Jain R.K. Alitalo K.

We have therefore studied the regulation of the expression of VEGF-C in comparison with VEGF and VEGF-B by the angiogenic proinflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory agents. Diploid human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90, American Type Tissue Collection CCL-186) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), glutamine, and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). Prior to initiation of the experiments, the cells were maintained in 0.5% FCS for 48 h. Cells were then incubated with human rIL-1β (0.001–10 ng/ml), rIL-1α (10 ng/ml), or rTNF-α (50 ng/ml) in 0.5% FCS for the time periods indicated. All cytokines and growth factors were obtained from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Dexamethasone (1–10 μm), indomethacin (10 μm), cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (10 ng/ml) were from Sigma. Dexamethasone (10 μm) was either added simultaneously with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 6 h, or alternatively, 1 μm of dexamethasone was first added to the starvation medium for 12 h, and incubation was then continued with dexamethasone and with or without 1 ng/ml IL-1β for 6 h. Human rIL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra; 200 ng/ml) was used to inhibit the effect of IL-1β (0.2 ng/ml); in some experiments, human rPDGF-BB (100 ng/ml) served as a positive control. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated according to the standard protocol (40Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar), cultured on gelatin-coated dishes in medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FCS, endothelial cell growth supplement (50 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), heparin (5 units/ml, Sigma), antibiotics, and glutamine, and the experiments were performed at passage 4. Before initiation of the experiment, HUVECs were grown confluent, then starved in 5% FCS in medium 199 for 24 h, after which either IL-1β (10 ng/ml) or TNF-α (50 ng/ml) were added to the starvation media for 6 h. Confluent cultures of IMR-90 cells were grown on 10-cm diameter tissue culture plates containing 10 ml of DMEM and 0.5% FCS. These cultures were exposed to hypoxia by incubating the cells for 6 h in the Anaerocult A anaerobic culture jar supplied by Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) and quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm. The poly(A)+ mRNA fraction was isolated with the Poly(A)Ttrack mRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). For Northern blots, 20 μg of total RNA or 1 μg of poly(A)+mRNA were denatured in 1 m glyoxal, 50% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 10 mm phosphate buffer at 50 °C for 60 min, electrophoresed, and transferred to nylon membranes (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA), which were baked for 1 h at 80 °C and then UV-irradiated for 6 min (Reprostar II UV, Camag, Muttenz, Switzerland). Hybridization was performed with a mixture of [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products)-labeled fragments of human VEGF cDNA (a 583-base pair EcoRI fragment), VEGF-B167 cDNA (nucleotides 1–382, GenBankTM accession no. U48801) and VEGF-C cDNA (nucleotides 495–1661, GenBankTM accession no. X94216) with the Prime-a-gene kit (Promega). A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe served as a control for the equal gel loading and cyclooxygenase-2 as a positive control for a cytokine-induced gene (41Ristimäki A.

The receptor probes were the following: VEGFR-1 (nucleotides 706–2310; GenBankTM accession no. X51602), VEGFR-2 (nucleotides 6–715; GenBankTM accession no. X61656), VEGFR-3 (nucletotides 1–595; GenBankTM accession no. X68203), Tie-1 (nucleotides 1–2190; GenBankTM accession no.X60957), and Tek/Tie-2 (nucleotides 1550–2285; GenBankTMaccession no. L06139, a kind gift from Eola Kukk). Probes were purified by gel filtration through nick columns (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and used at 1 × 106 cpm/ml. Hybridizations were done at 42 °C for 16 h in solution containing 50% formamide, 6× SSC, 0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 100 mg/ml herring sperm DNA, 100 mg/ml yeast RNA, and 0.5% SDS. Membranes were washed three times at 50 °C for 15 min in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. The probed blots were exposed to Fuji medical x-ray film after quantitation of the signals with the Fujifilm IP reader Bio-Imaging analyzer BAS1500 (Tokyo, Japan) and the MacBas software supplied by the manufacturer and visualized by autoradiography. For nuclear run-on analysis IMR-90 cells were first starved for 48 h and then incubated for 3 h with or without IL-1β (10 ng/ml) in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FCS (10 15-cm dishes each). Total RNA was extracted from one control dish and one IL-1β-treated dish and used for Northern blotting. The nuclei were isolated from nine control and nine IL-1β-treated dishes as described by Greenberg and Ziff (42Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). Extraction of the RNA and nuclear transcription were performed as described by Celano et al. (43Celano P. Berchtold C.

[32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol)-labeled nuclear RNA samples (1 × 107cpm/sample) were then hybridized to linearized plasmid DNA (pcDNA I) containing inserts of VEGF-C and GAPDH, or no insert. The probed blots were quantitated with the Bio-Imaging Analyser using the MacBas software, after which background was subtracted from VEGF-C and GAPDH signals. Degradation of the mRNAs were studied in human IMR-90 lung fibroblasts. The cells were starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FCS for 48 h and shifted to medium containing 5% FCS for 4 h prior to mRNA stability measurements. After two washes with DMEM, medium containing 0.5% FCS and actinomycin D (10 μg/ml; Sigma) as an inhibitor of transcription, with or without IL-1β (10 ng/ml), was added for 1, 2, or 4 h. Confluent IMR-90 cell cultures were first starved for 48 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FCS and then preincubated with or without IL-1β (10 ng/ml) or TNF-α (50 ng/ml) for 4 h. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, metabolic labeling was carried out by addition of 100 μCi/ml of Pro-mix l-35S in vitro cell labeling mix (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) to methionine- and cysteine-free Eagle's minimal essential medium, with or without the cytokines. After 6 h the media were collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Aliquots of the culture media were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and measured for incorporated radioactivity. Equal counts/min of the media were immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGF antiserum as described earlier (34Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jeltsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized and quantitated by the Bio-Imaging analyzer system. Statistical significance was calculated by Student's t test. All results are shown as means ± S.E., and p < 0.05 was selected as the statistically significant value. To study the kinetics and concentration-dependence of VEGF-C mRNA regulation, IMR-90 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 2–48 h or with 0.001–10 ng/ml for 6 h. As shown in Fig.1 A, the induction was already evident at the earliest 2-h time point, maximum induction was reached by 4 h, and the mRNA levels began a steady decline after an incubation period of 6 h, reaching base line around the 12-h time point. Results with different concentrations of IL-1β are shown in Fig. 1 B, indicating that the maximal effect was obtained by 1 ng/ml. Expression of VEGF-C transcripts was studied in serum-starved human IMR-90 fibroblasts. The cells were exposed to IL-1β, IL-1α, or TNF-α for 6 h, after which total RNA was isolated, electrophoresed, and subjected to Northern blot hybridization using a mixture of the VEGF, VEGF-B, and VEGF-C probes. The filters were also hybridized separately with probes for cyclooxygenase-2, serving as a known cytokine-responsive gene (41Ristimäki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for GAPDH, which served as a loading control. As shown in Fig.2 A, IL-1β, IL-1α, and TNF-α elevated VEGF-C mRNA steady-state levels. Fig.2 B shows a densitometric evaluation of the VEGF-C mRNA levels induced by IL-1β from eight independent experiments (a 3.41 ± 0.35-fold increase). IL-1β also stimulated VEGF mRNA expression (a 2.55 ± 0.55-fold increase), but not that of VEGF-B. Interestingly, although the steady-state mRNA levels for Ang-1 were readily detectable under basal conditions, they were down-regulated by IL-1β (10 ng/ml for 6 h) by 50 ± 9% as calculated from seven separate experiments (the controls versusIL-1β-treated, p < 0.05). Fig. 3 shows the inhibitory effect of the anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (4Jackson, J. R., Seed, M. P., Kircher, C. H., Willoughby, D. A., and Winkler, J. D. FASEB J., 11,457–465.Google Scholar) on IL-1β-induced VEGF and VEGF-C mRNA expression. Furthermore, while dexamethasone completely blocked the effect of IL-1β on VEGF mRNA induction, it inhibited only partially the elevation of VEGF-C mRNA steady-stale levels. In contrast, indomethacin, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and an inhibitor of prostanoid production, did not inhibit the effects of IL-1β (not shown). To investigate whether ongoing protein synthesis is necessary for IL-1β-induced VEGF-C expression, cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, was administered to the cells. Fig. 3 shows that cycloheximide did not inhibit the effect of IL-1β, indicating a protein synthesis-independent mechanism of action. IL-1ra was used to investigate the specificity of IL-1β effects in IMR-90 cells. This protein binds to the signal transducing IL-1 receptor type I and blocks the effects of IL-1β and IL-1α (44Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows that IL-1ra inhibited IL-1β-induced VEGF-C and VEGF mRNA expression, confirming the receptor-dependent action of IL-1β. Hypoxia is an important stimulus for angiogenesis and an inducer of VEGF expression (10Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J.

In IMR-90 cells, hypoxia induced VEGF mRNA but not VEGF-B or VEGF-C mRNAs (Fig.5). Further, when hypoxia was combined with IL-1β treatment, no additional VEGF stimulation was found in comparison to that of hypoxia alone. This is in contrast with the stimulation obtained with PDGF, which was potentiated by hypoxia (45Stavri G.T. Hong Y. Zachary I.C. Breier G. Baskerville P.A. Yla H.S. Risau W. Martin J.F.

In some cell types, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) have been implicated in the pathways leading to stress-induced apoptosis. In this study, we begin to define two pathways leading to apoptosis in the neutrophil induced either by stress stimuli (UV, hyperosmolarity, sphingosine) or by anti-Fas antibody or overnight culture in vitro (spontaneous apoptosis). Apoptosis induced by stress stimuli activated p38 MAPK, and apoptosis was inhibited by the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, 6-(4-Fluorophenyl)-2.3-dihydro-5-(4-puridinyl)imidazo(2,1-β)thiazole dihydrochloride. Furthermore, differentiation of HL-60 cells toward the neutrophil phenotype resulted in a loss in c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation with concomitant acquisition of formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine-stimulatable and stress-inducible p38 MAPK activity as well as apoptosis blockade by the p38 MAPK inhibitor. In contrast, anti-Fas-induced or spontaneous apoptosis occurred independent of p38 MAPK activation and was not blocked by the inhibitor. Both pathways appear to utilize member(s) of the caspase family, since pretreatment with either Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone or Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone inhibited apoptosis induced by each of the stimuli. We propose the presence of at least two pathways leading to apoptosis in human neutrophils, a stress-activated pathway that is dependent on p38 MAPK activation and an anti-FAS/spontaneous pathway that is p38 MAPK-independent.

Human neutrophils have a life span of only hours following release from bone marrow into systemic circulation. At sites of inflammation, neutrophils are short lived and, under normal circumstances, undergo apoptosis with subsequent recognition and removal by phagocytic cells such as macrophages (1Newman S.L.

Cultured in vitro, neutrophils isolated from the blood undergo apoptosis spontaneously, with greater than 50% of the population becoming apoptotic within 16 h (1Newman S.L. Henson J.E. Henson P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 2Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.M. Haslett C. J. Clin.

It has been assumed that the neutrophil half-life in vitro is a reflection of their life span in vivo and that this cell possesses an “inbuilt” clock leading inexorably to apoptosis within a certain time range after maturation in, or release from, the bone marrow. In inflammatory lesions, the presence of neutrophil stimuli such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or lipopolysaccharide could extend this life span by inhibiting apoptosis (5Lee A. White M.K.B. Haslett C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 6Colotta F. Re F. Polentarutti N. Sozzani S. Mantovani A.

Gruss H-J. Herrmann F. Blood. 1992; 11: 2920-2924Crossref Google Scholar), while interleukin-10 might shorten it by enhancing the apoptotic process (9Cox G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L566-L571PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of apoptotic inflammatory cells by macrophages before they lyse and release their toxic contents may represent an important mechanism for limiting tissue injury and for resolution of inflammation (10Henson P.M. Johnston B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 11Cox G. Crossley J. Xing Z. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Thus, induction and control of neutrophil apoptosis appears to be central to resolution or persistence of an inflammatory state. Recently, a number of gene products have been identified as important regulators involved in the pathways leading to apoptosis. However, the relative involvement of any one gene product may vary depending on the cell type. Although apoptosis appears to be a universal phenomenon observed in virtually all cells, the specific signal transduction pathways mediating the death program can be biochemically and functionally distinct in response to different stimuli as well as vary between cell types. Neutrophil intracellular signal transduction in response to a wide variety of stimuli appears to utilize the MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; FasL, Fas ligand; ATF-2, activated transcription factor-2; MEK, MAP-ERK kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ICE, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; FBS, fetal bovine serum; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation; SK & F 86002, 6-(4-Fluorophenyl)-2.3-dihydro-5-(4-puridinyl)imidazo(2,1-β)thiazole dihydrochloride; VAD-fmk, Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone; DEVD-fmk, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone. 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; FasL, Fas ligand; ATF-2, activated transcription factor-2; MEK, MAP-ERK kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ICE, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; FBS, fetal bovine serum; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation; SK & F 86002, 6-(4-Fluorophenyl)-2.3-dihydro-5-(4-puridinyl)imidazo(2,1-β)thiazole dihydrochloride; VAD-fmk, Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone; DEVD-fmk, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone. kinase cascades. Each MAP kinase cascade involves phosphorylation and activation of a MAP ERK kinase kinase, which in turn activates members of the MAP ERK kinases (MEK). MEKs then activate a specific member of the MAPK family by dual phosphorylation of a threonine and tyrosine residue. This system of parallel intracellular signaling pathways activated in response to a specific external stimulus and leading to a unique set of functional responses is well defined in yeast and is now recognized to exist in most mammalian cells including the human neutrophil. Three distinct MAPKs have been identified to date in mammalian cells: p42/p44 ERKs are activated by growth factors (14Davis R.J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar); JNK/stress-activated protein kinase is potently activated by irradiation and other environmental stresses such as hyperosmolarity (15Derijard B.

Irradiation and other stress stimuli are known to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types (17Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 18Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Accordingly, JNK and/or p38 have been implicated by some investigators in the process leading to apoptosis in response to these stimuli (17Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 18Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells, JNK and p38 MAPK activation have been coupled to Fas-induced apoptosis, and it appears as though this coupling requires the activation of ICE-like proteases (caspases) (19Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H-P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Both Fas and the caspase superfamily have emerged as key players in the regulation of the apoptotic pathway. The Fas/FasL system has been extensively studied in T cells and has been shown to be intimately involved in the removal of autoreactive B cells (20Rathmell J.C. Cooke M.P. Ho W.Y. Grein J. Goodnow S.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) as well as in activation-induced T cell death (21Ju S.-T. Panka D.J. Cui H. Ettinger R. El-Khatib M. Sherr D.H.

Nature. 1995; 373: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that spontaneous apoptosis in neutrophils may be in part mediated by Fas/FasL (24Liles W.C. Kiener P.A. Ledbetter J.A. Aruffo A. Klebanoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 25Liles W.C. Klebanoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1995; : 3289-3291PubMed Google Scholar). However, the signal transduction pathway leading from Fas receptor cross-linking to apoptosis in the neutrophil is unknown. The caspase superfamily contain a highly homologous group of proteins that can be subdivided into three categories including ICE-like (caspase 1), CPP32-like (caspase 3), and ICH-1-like (caspase 2) proteases. The involvement of caspases in apoptosis has been demonstrated in a number of ways including the use of tri- and tetrapeptide inhibitors that take advantage of the different substrate specificity of the enzymes or by the cowpox viral protein, CrmA, which is a natural inhibitor of caspase 1 (26Ray C.A. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R. Salvesen G.S. Pickup D.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 27Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have suggested an involvement of caspase 1 and caspase 3 in Fas-mediated apoptosis. For instance, treatment with either YVAD-cmk, an inhibitor of caspase 1, or DEVD-fmk, an inhibitor of caspase 3, prevents apoptosis induced by Fas cross-linking in Jurkat and U937 cells (28Gamen S. Marzo I. Anel A. Pineiro A. Naval J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 233-237Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although there is detailed information regarding the involvement of caspases in apoptosis in other cell types, little is known about the role of these enzymes in neutrophil apoptosis. In this report, we examine signal transduction pathways leading to apoptosis in human neutrophils induced by in vitroculture (spontaneous apoptosis), Fas cross-linking, or stress stimuli. At least two pathways leading to apoptosis have been identified, both requiring caspase involvement, a stress-activated pathway that is p38 MAPK-dependent and a spontaneous/Fas-mediated pathway that appears to be p38 MAPK-independent. Endotoxin free reagents and plastics were used in all experiments. Neutrophils were resuspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, with 0.2% dextrose. fMLP, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, bovine serum albumin fraction V, propidium iodide, and tissue culture grade Me2SO were purchased from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Zymed(South San Francisco, CA). DEVD-fmk and VAD-fmk were purchased from Enzyme Systems (Dublin, CA). Anti-JNK1(C-17) rabbit and goat polyclonal antibody, anti-p38(C-20) polyclonal antibody, anti-ERK2(C-16) polyclonal antibody, c-JUN-(1–79), and ATF-2-(1–96) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p38 phosphospecific polyclonal, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem. A MAP kinase assay kit and anti-Fas IgM (CH-11) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). 6-(4-Fluorophenyl)-2.3-dihydro-5-(4-puridinyl)imidazo(2,1-β)thiazole dihydrochloride (SK & F 86002-A2, or SK & F 86002) was kindly provided by SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (King of Prussia, PA). Apoptosis was induced by exposure of neutrophils or HL-60 cells resuspended to either 5 × 106 cells/ml or 20 × 106 cells/ml in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer or RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS and plated in a 12-well tissue culture plate at 1 ml/well, to UV irradiation (254 nm) on a UV transilluminator for 10 min, sphingosine, 450 mosm(0.25 m sucrose in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer), anti-Fas IgM, or 18–24 h culture in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS (spontaneous apoptosis) followed by incubation at 37 °C for the times indicated. p38 MAP kinase activity measurements were performed essentially as described (29Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Knall C. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Either HL-60 cells cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS or neutrophils isolated by the plasma Percoll method (31Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnson R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar) were resuspended to 20 × 106/ml in RMPI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. 20 × 106 cells (1 ml) were plated in each well of a 12-well tissue culture plate. Cells were stimulated with UV irradiation, 1 μm sphingosine, 400 ng/ml anti-Fas IgM, 450 mosm, incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C, harvested, and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer. p38 MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg/ml anti-p38 rabbit polyclonal antibody. Protein A-Sepharose beads with bound antibody were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase reaction mix containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 200 μm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mmβ-glycerolphosphate (pH 7.2), and 500 ng recombinant fragment of activated transcription factor 2 (ATF-2-(1–96)). Reactions were terminated with 4× Laemmli buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose membrane. Activity was visualized as the phosphorylation of the ATF-2 fragment by autoradiography. JNK immunoprecipitation and kinase assay was carried out as described previously (29Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60 cells or neutrophils were resuspended and stimulated as described for p38 immunoprecipitation and kinase assay. Following stimulation, cells were harvested and lysed with anti-phosphotyrosine lysis buffer (29Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar). JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg/ml anti-JNK1 rabbit polyclonal antibody. Beads were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase reaction mixture (29Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar) containing 500 ng of recombinant fragment of c-Jun-(1–79). Activity was visualized following SDS-PAGE as the phosphorylation of the c-Jun fragment by autoradiography. Neutrophils were resuspended as described for p38 MAP kinase assay. Cells were pretreated with or without 100 nm fMLP for 10 min, or 30 μm PD98059 for 30 min either alone or prior to UV irradiation to induce apoptosis and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer. ERK2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK2 rabbit polyclonal antibody. ERK2 kinase activity was determined by using a MAP kinase assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blotting, neutrophils were resuspended to 10 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and 10 × 106 cells (1 ml) were plated into the appropriate number of wells in a 12-well tissue culture plate. Cells were stimulated for the times indicated, harvested by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 s, and resuspended in 500 μl of RIPA lysis buffer. ERK2 was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg/ml anti-ERK2 rabbit polyclonal antibody, as described above, washed three times with RIPA lysis buffer, and resuspended with 30 μl of RIPA lysis buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min with 4× Laemmli sample buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and blotted to nitrocellulose membrane. Following p38 MAPK, JNK, or ERK kinase assays, the membranes were blocked overnight in blocking buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 190 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 5% bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C with agitation and probed with anti-p38 rabbit polyclonal, anti-JNK1 goat polyclonal, or anti-ERK2 rabbit polyclonal antibody diluted 1:1000 in 1× wash buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 190 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature with rocking. The membranes were washed twice for 30 min each with 1× wash buffer and incubated with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (for p38 and ERK) or horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-goat antibody (for JNK) for 45 min at room temperature with rocking. The membranes were washed two times for 30 min each with 1× wash buffer, and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C; washed two times for 10 min each with 1× wash at room temperature with rocking; blocked overnight in blocking buffer at 4 °C; and reprobed with anti-p38-phosphospecific, anti-ERK-phosphospecific, or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. HL-60 cells were maintained at no greater than 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For differentiation, HL-60 cells were harvested and resuspended at 0.2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1.25% Me2SO and incubated at 37 °C for up to 5 days. Differentiation was determined by the ability of cells to reduce nitro blue tetrazolium (33Ferrero D. Pessano S. Pagliardi G.L. Rovera G. Blood. 1983; 61: 171-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils were resuspended to 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and plated into each well of a 12-well tissue culture plate (5 × 106 cells/well). Following stimulation, 1 × 106 cells were harvested and placed directly into 80% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed overnight at −20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. RNA was removed by treatment with 0.25 mg of RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. Propidium iodide (50 μg/ml stock in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to a final concentration of 500 ng/ml, and samples were stored at 4 °C in the dark until analysis. DNA fragmentation analysis was carried out on the Becton Dickinson FACScalibur. Apoptosis was scored by the appearance of a sub-G0 peak. Following stimulation, 5 × 105 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of cytospin buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 20 mm EDTA, 1% FBS). One hundred microliters of the cell suspension was cytocentrifuged onto a slide, fixed and stained with a modified Wright-Giemsa stain, and analyzed by light microscopy. Neutrophils counted in randomly selected fields were scored as apoptotic, normal, or necrotic based on their nuclear morphology. S.D. values were calculated from at least three independent experiments with duplicate readings within each experiment. While the susceptibility of neutrophils to spontaneous apoptosis (1Newman S.L.

Med. 1996; 184: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) is well described, the sensitivity of neutrophils to other apoptosis-inducing stimuli, such as UV irradiation or hyperosmolarity, is less well understood. Propidium iodide staining and flow cytometric analysis or stained cytospin preparations were used to determine DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation (respectively) characteristic of apoptosis in human neutrophils in response to a variety of stimuli (Fig.1). Neutrophils exposed to overnight culture in vitro (spontaneous apoptosis (Fig.1 b)), anti-Fas (Fig. 1 c), and UV irradiation (Fig. 1 d) all show reduced PI staining, evident by the appearance of a sub-G0 peak, characteristic of apoptosis. Likewise, these stimuli as well as treatment with sphingosine and culture in hyperosmolar conditions (Fig. 1 e) showed an increase in nuclear condensation over time to levels comparable with the amount of DNA fragmentation analyzed by PI staining and flow cytometry. Morphological features of apoptosis, including nuclear condensation and membrane blebbing, were seen in neutrophils treated with UV irradiation followed by incubation for 4 h at 37 °C (Fig. 1 f). Apoptosis was also confirmed by demonstrating DNA fragmentation with typical internucleosomal cleavage and laddering on agarose gels (data not shown). These data demonstrate that in addition to spontaneous and anti-Fas-induced apoptosis, neutrophils undergo apoptosis with stress stimuli in a rapid and relatively synchronous manner. Studies in other cell types demonstrate that multiple pathways may lead to apoptosis, and some of these pathways are beginning to be elucidated. In particular, some studies have suggested that JNK and p38 MAPK, members of the MAP kinase superfamily, participate in the process leading to apoptosis induced by stress stimuli (i.e. UV irradiation, hyperosmolarity) or by Fas ligation (19Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H-P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 35Wilson D.J. Fortner K.A. Lynch D.H.

Therefore, the activation of JNK, p38 MAPK, and p42/p44 ERKs by stimuli that also induce apoptosis was investigated. JNK, p38, and p42/p44 ERK MAP kinase activities were measured in neutrophils exposed to UV irradiation, hyperosmolarity, sphingosine, or anti-Fas antibody (Fig.2). Unlike other cell types (17Xia Z.

In contrast, Fas/receptor ligation failed to activate either p38 MAPK or JNK. Neither the stress stimuli nor anti-Fas activated the p42/p44 ERKs. These results suggest that p38 MAPK, and not JNK or p42/p44 ERK, might be involved in the pathway leading to stress-induced apoptosis in human neutrophils. Time courses of p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK activation using antibodies specific to their activated forms, revealed that p38 MAPK activation with UV began as early as 10 min and remained persistent 1.5–2 h following stimulation (Fig.3 a), unlike p38 MAPK activation with fMLP where peak activity was observed at 2 min and was down to background levels by 10 min (30Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Knall C. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). On the other hand, p38 MAPK activation with anti-Fas antibody was not evident at any time during the time course, consistent with data presented in Fig. 2. Also consistent with data presented in Fig. 2 was the lack of JNK and ERK activation following UV irradiation or treatment with anti-Fas (Fig. 3,b and c). Western blots of both JNK and ERK show that both proteins were present in the cell but were not activated with stimuli that induced apoptosis. These results support further the notion that p38 MAPK, but not JNK or ERK, are involved in stress-induced apoptosis. A time course of p38 MAPK with sphingosine and hyperosmolarity showed activation kinetics similar to that of UV (data not shown), suggesting that this response is similar for all stress stimuli. Likewise, time courses of JNK and ERK activation with sphingosine and hyperosmolarity were similar to that with UV irradiation (data not shown). To determine more directly whether p38 MAPK activation was necessary for apoptosis to occur, a specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SK & F 86002, was used (30Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Knall C.

Neutrophils pretreated with the inhibitor were allowed to undergo apoptosis either spontaneously in overnight culture or by stimulation with UV irradiation, hyperosmolarity, sphingosine, or anti-Fas, and the degree of apoptosis was determined (TableI). Consistent with the activation of p38 MAPK by the different stimuli, treatment with SK & F 86002 (10 μm) protected the cells from UV irradiation, hyperosmolarity, and sphingosine-induced apoptosis but had no effect on anti-Fas or spontaneous apoptosis, suggesting that p38 MAPK activation is required for signal transduction leading to stress-induced"
https://openalex.org/W2063627953,"Binding of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) to its receptor, uPAR, regulates cellular adhesion, migration, and tumor cell invasion. Some of these activities may reflect the ability of uPAR to initiate signal transduction even though this receptor is linked to the plasma membrane only by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. In this study, we demonstrated that single-chain uPA activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 was increased 1 min after adding uPA and returned to baseline levels by 5 min. The amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of uPA, which binds to uPAR but lacks proteinase activity, also activated ERK1 and ERK2. Responses to uPA and ATF were eliminated when the cells were pretreated with PD098059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. uPA and ATF promoted the migration of MCF-7 cells across serum-coated Transwell membranes in vitro. Migration was increased 2.1 +/- 0.4-fold when uPA was added to the top chamber, 4. 8 +/- 0.8-fold when uPA was added to the bottom chamber, and 7.7 +/- 1.0-fold when uPA was added to both chambers. MCF-7 cells that were pulse-exposed to uPA for 30 min, and then washed to remove unbound ligand, demonstrated increased motility even though migration was allowed to occur for 24 h. PD098059 completely neutralized the effects of uPA on MCF-7 cellular motility, irrespective of whether the uPA was present for the entire motility assay or administered by pulse-exposure. These results demonstrate a novel, receptor-dependent signaling activity which is required for uPA-stimulated breast cancer cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2034485619,"Breast cancer is a genetic disease arising from a series of germ-line and/or somatic DNA changes in a variety of genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2. DNA modifications have been shown to occur by a number of mechanisms that include DNA methylation. In some cases, the aberrant methylation of CpGs within 5′ regulatory regions has led to suppression of gene activity. In this report we describe a variation in the pattern of DNA methylation within the regulatory region of the BRCA1 gene. We found no evidence of methylation at CpGs within the BRCA1 promoter in a variety of normal human tissues. However, screening of a series of randomly sampled breast carcinomas revealed the presence of CpG methylation adjacent to the BRCA1 transcription start site. One such methylated CpG occurs at a putative CREB (cAMP-responsive element binding) transcription factor binding site in the BRCA1 promoter. Gelshift assays with methylated and unmethylated BRCA1/CREB binding site oligonucleotides demonstrate that this site is sensitive to site-specific CpG methylation. These data suggest that aberrant DNA methylation at regulatory sequences in the BRCA1 locus may play a role in the transcriptional inactivation of the BRCA1 gene within subclones of breast tumors. This study represents the first evidence suggesting a role for DNA methylation in the transcriptional inactivation of the BRCA1 in human breast cancer."

The down-regulation of SR-BI expression in liver by 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE) treatment was found by immunoblotting to be the consequence of down-regulation of SR-BI in parenchymal cells, while SR-BI expression in Kupffer cells was up-regulated. The selective uptake of HDL-CE in vivo by parenchymal and Kupffer cells was measured by labeling of HDL with [3H]CE and analysis of the cellular uptake at 10 min after injection. After EE treatment, uptake of [3H]CE-labeled HDL by parenchymal cells decreased by 85%, while Kupffer cells showed a 4-fold increase in selective uptake of [3H]CE-labeled HDL. In vitro studies with isolated parenchymal cells indicated that after EE treatment, the selective uptake of [3H]CE labeled HDL was 3–4-fold lower, indicating that the in vivo observations are also reflected in vitro. A 2-week high-cholesterol diet leads to lowering of SR-BI expression in parenchymal cells, while the expression in Kupffer cells is increased. Like EE treatment, the selective uptake of [3H]CE-labeled HDL by the two hepatic cell typesin vivo correlated with the changes in expression of SR-BI. Our results thus demonstrate that within the liver, the regulation of SR-BI expression by EE treatment or a high-cholesterol diet, correlates with changes in the selective uptake of HDL-CE, supporting a function of SR-BI to mediate the selective uptake of HDL-CE in the liver parenchymal cells.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), not only binds HDL but also can mediate selective uptake of HDL-CE.In vivo, SR-BI is expressed in the steroidogenic organs and liver of rodents (10Acton S.

In the steroidogenic tissues SR-BI expression is coordinately regulated with the steroidogenesis by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), human chorionic gonadotropin, and estrogen (12Landschulz K.T.

Furthermore, SR-BI expression in adrenals is up-regulated in apoA-I knock-out mice, hepatic lipase knock-out mice, and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase knockout mice (13Wang N. Weng W.

Unlike the steroidogenic tissues, SR-BI expression in the liver is down-regulated by estrogen treatment of rats (12Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). SR-BI was found to bind a broad spectrum of ligands, including modified lipoproteins, native lipoproteins, and also anionic phospholipids (16Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Recently, the HDL binding to SR-BI was shown to be mediated by the major apolipoproteins of HDL, e.g. apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoC-III (17Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We showed recently that the selective uptake of HDL-CE by isolated rat liver parenchymal cells can be inhibited completely by ligands specific for SR-BI (18Fluiter K. Van Berkel Th. J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), indicating that the expression of SR-BI can be solely responsible for the selective HDL-CE uptake in this cell type. Adenovirus-mediated hepatic overexpression, as recently published by Kozarsky et al. (19Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) resulted in the virtual disappearance of plasma HDL and a substantial increase in biliary cholesterol, demonstrating the importance of hepatic overexpression of SR-BI for HDL catabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. Furthermore, it was shown that in mice with a targeted null mutation in the SR-BI gene, plasma cholesterol concentration increased by 125% due to the formation of large apolipoprotein A-I particles and the adrenal cholesterol content was decreased, indicating that selective cholesterol uptake was inhibited in these animals (20Rigotti A.

SR-BI might also be involved in the efflux of cellular cholesterol to HDL, i.e. the first step in reverse cholesterol transport. In SR-BI transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, cholesterol efflux to HDL was correlated with the expression level of SR-BI (21Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), while also in cultured macrophages, cholesterol efflux appeared to be correlated with SR-BI expression (21Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). As the liver contains both tissue macrophages (Kupffer cells) and parenchymal cells, we investigated in the present study the in vivo regulation of SR-BI in these cell types, while simultaneously the selective uptake of HDL-CE was studied. Rats were either treated with 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE) or put on a high-cholesterol diet. It appears that the down-regulation of SR-BI expression in parenchymal cells correlated with changes in the selective HDL-CE uptake, providing further evidence that the regulation of SR-BI expression is responsible for the variation in selective HDL-CE uptake. Surprisingly, SR-BI expression and the selective HDL-CE uptake is up-regulated in Kupffer cells after EE treatment or a high-cholesterol diet, pointing to a different regulatory response in tissue macrophages (Kupffer cells) as compared with parenchymal cells, suggesting a difference in function of SR-BI in these cell types.

Ethylmercurithiosalicylate (thimerosal), bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V), and collagenase type I and type IV were obtained from Sigma, while Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Irvine, Scotland). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Throughout the study male Wistar WU rats were used (200–250 g), which had free access to food and water. EE-treated rats were injected subcutaneously for 5 consecutive days with 5 mg/kg body weight of 17α-ethinyl estradiol in propylene glycol. Control rats were injected with an equivalent volume of propylene glycol alone. The weight of the rats was checked (10% weight loss after treatment) as well as the serum cholesterol levels (95% decrease after treatment). For some studies, rats were maintained for 16 days on a cholesterol-rich die (Hope Farms, Woerden, The Netherlands) that included 2% (w/v) cholesterol, 5% (w/v) olive oil, and 0.5% (w/v) cholic acid. Human HDL and LDL were isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers by differential ultracentrifugation as described by Redgrave et al. (22Redgrave T.G. Roberts D.C.K. West C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 65: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). HDL and LDL were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA. HDL was labeled with [3H]CE by exchange from donor particles as reported previously (2Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A.L. Kostner G.M. van Berkel Th. J.C., Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HDL was iodinated by the ICl method of McFarlane (23McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar) as modified by Bilheimeret al. (24Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the [3H]CE-labeled HDL varied between 1,000 and 2,000 dpm/μg of HDL protein, and for [125I]HDL varied between 50,000 and 100,000 cpm/μg. The labeled HDL was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA and passed through a heparin-Sepharose affinity column to remove apoE-containing particles (25Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 316-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Routinely the HDL fraction was checked for the absence of apoE by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. After the labeling procedure the radiolabeled HDL was checked for hydrolysis of the cholesteryl ester labels by a Bligh and Dyer extraction (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biol. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41844) Google Scholar) followed by thin layer chromatography. Hydrolysis of the cholesteryl ester was always less than 5%. The effect of the labeling procedure on the composition of HDL was analyzed by measurement of phospholipid, cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and triglyceride content (with the phospholipid kit, cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase aminophenazone kit, and glycerolphosphate oxidase-peroxidase aminophenazone kit, respectively). The density, electrophoretic α-mobility, and particle size (photon correlation spectroscopy, System 4700 C, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) were also analyzed. Labeled HDL was only used when there was no change observed in the measured composition or physical characteristics as compared with the original unlabeled HDL. The hepatic cellular distribution of HDL was studied by using a low temperature cell isolation technique as described (27Van Berkel Th. J.C. Kruijt J.K. Kempen H.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12203-12207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rats were anesthetized and injected with radiolabeled HDL. Ten minutes after injection, the vena porta was cannulated and the liver was perfused with oxygenated Hanks' buffer, containing Hepes (1.6 g/liter), pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Total liver uptake was determined by taking of a liver lobule 8 min after the start of the perfusion. The perfusion was continued for 15 min with Hanks‘/Hepes buffer containing 0.05% (w/v) collagenase (type I, Sigma) and 1 mm CaCl2. Parenchymal cells were isolated after mincing the liver in Hanks’ buffer containing 0.3% BSA, filtering through nylon gauze, and centrifugation for three times 30 s at 50 × g. The pellets consisted of pure parenchymal cells as judged by light microscopy. The supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 400 × g to harvest the non-parenchymal cells. The remainder on the nylon gauze was incubated with Hanks'/Hepes/BSA buffer containing 0.25% Pronase for 15 min at 4 °C. This cell suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 400 ×g and all non-parenchymal cell pellets were combined. By means of centrifugal elutriation the Kupffer cells were separated from the non-parenchymal cells (28Nagelkerke J.F. Barto K.P. Van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12221-12227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of each cell fraction was checked by light microscopy after staining for peroxidase activity. Cellular cholesterol concentrations were measured with a commercial kit as mentioned above after a Bligh and Dyer extraction (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biol. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41844) Google Scholar) of the cellular lipids. Parenchymal liver cells were isolated by perfusion of the livers of male Wistar WU rats (200–250 g) with collagenase at 37 °C as described (28Nagelkerke J.F. Barto K.P. Van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12221-12227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The viability (>95%) of the obtained parenchymal cells was checked by trypan blue exclusion. The cells from the last centrifugation step were resuspended in oxygenated DMEM supplemented with 2% BSA, pH 7.4. For competition studies 1–2 mg of parenchymal cell protein was incubated with the indicated amount of radiolabeled HDL for 180 min in 1 ml of DMEM containing 2% BSA at 37 °C. Cell incubations were performed in a circulating lab shaker (Adolf Kühner AG, Basel, Switzerland) at 150 rpm. Every hour the incubations were briefly oxygenated. The viability of the parenchymal cells remained higher than 88% during these long-term incubations (28Nagelkerke J.F. Barto K.P. Van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12221-12227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation the cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 600 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge and washed 2 times in 50 mmTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cell pellet was washed in a similar medium without BSA. The cells were lysed in 0.1 n NaOH and the protein content and radioactivity were determined. After isolation of the different liver cell types as described (29Van Berkel Th. J.C. Nagelkerke J.F. Harkes L. Kruijt J.K. Biochem. J. 1982; 208: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), membranes were prepared and solubilized according to the method described by de Rijke and Van Berkel (30de Rijke Y.B. Van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 824-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilized membrane proteins were subjected to electrophoresis in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS. Electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) under nonreducing conditions. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by using a Bio-Rad transblot unit (1 h, 130 V, 4 °C). After transfer the blots were blocked by 5% skim milk and 1% BSA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 90 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.25% (v/v) Tween 20. Subsequently the blots were incubated with anti-SR-BI rabbit antiserum (1:1000). The rabbit antiserum was raised against a region of the extracellular domain of murine SR-BI (amino acids 230–380). After repeated washing the blots were incubated with donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (1:15000) (Amersham, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Amersham, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Quantification of the intensity of the protein bands were performed with Image-Quant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Plasma corticosterone was measured by an radioimmunoassay using an antiserum raised against corticosterone-21-hemisuccinate bovine serum albumin as described previously (32Veldhuis H.D. Van Koppen C. Van Ittersum M. De Kloet E.R. Endocrinology. 1982; 110: 2044-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Protein was determined according to Lowry et al. (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with BSA as standard. Treatment of rats with EE for 5 consecutive days was reported to lower expression of SR-BI in the liver (12Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To test whether this change correlates with a change in the selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl esters, the liver uptake of [3H]CE-labeled HDL was determined, as well as the association of iodinated HDL to analyze total particle association. To identify the changes in the cellular uptake sites for [3H]CE HDL, parenchymal cells and the liver tissue macrophages (Kupffer cells) were isolated (Fig.1). For total liver, the association of [3H]CE-HDL was 12-fold higher as compared with125I-HDL in the control situation, in accordance with earlier data (2Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A.L. Kostner G.M. van Berkel Th. J.C., Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), clearly demonstrating selective uptake of HDL-CE. Treatment of rats with EE for 5 days resulted in a 85% decrease in [3H]CE-HDL uptake by the liver, while uptake of125I-labeled HDL was not significantly changed. Thus the selective uptake of HDL-CE was greatly inhibited by treatment of rats with EE, in accordance with the supposed role of SR-BI as the mediator of selective HDL-CE uptake. This decrease in selective uptake of HDL-CE by the liver can be explained by a 93% decrease in [3H]CE-HDL uptake by the parenchymal cells, while no decrease in 125I-HDL association was observed after EE treatment, and actually an increase was observed. In contrast, the Kupffer cells showed a significant 4-fold increase (p< 0.05) in uptake of [3H]CE-HDL, while cell association of 125I-HDL was slightly lowered. Rats were also fed a high-cholesterol containing diet for 2 weeks. The diet increased the plasma cholesterol levels 20-fold as compared with the control animals, while total cholesterol concentration in the liver increased more than 10-fold. The total cellular cholesterol concentration in parenchymal cells increased from the control value of 11 ± 0.9 μg/mg of cell protein up to 136 ± 18 μg/mg of cell protein (n = 3, ± S.E.), while the cholesterol content in the Kupffer cells increased from 6.8 ± 0.2 μg/mg of cell protein in the control animals up to 155 ± 66 μg/mg of cell protein after the 2-week diet (n = 3, ± S.E.). This diet resulted in a decrease in selective uptake of [3H]CE-HDL by the liver similarly as was observed after the EE treatment (Fig. 1). The 2-week high-cholesterol diet inhibited only the parenchymal cell uptake of [3H]CE-HDL (80%), while Kupffer cell uptake of [3H]was 4-fold increased, like after the EE treatment. 125I-HDL uptake by parenchymal cells was decreased for 50%, while Kupffer cells also showed a significant 35% decrease in 125I-HDL uptake (p < 0.05). Cell membranes from parenchymal and Kupffer cells were isolated from control rats, rats treated with EE, or from rats that had been fed a high-cholesterol diet for 2 weeks. These membranes were used for Western blotting. SR-BI was detected by immunolabeling, using rabbit antiserum directed against SR-BI. The changes in intensity of the SR-BI bands after EE treatment or the cholesterol diet were quantitated and compared with the intensity of the control. A very significant 80% decrease (p < 0.005) in SR-BI expression was observed in parenchymal cell membranes from EE-treated rats and rats fed with a high-cholesterol diet as compared with control rats (Fig.2). In contrast, SR-BI expression was increased 3–4-fold in Kupffer cells after a high-cholesterol diet or EE treatment, respectively (Fig. 2). Since SR-BI is known to be regulated by stress hormones (12Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) we measured the effect of both the EE treatment and the cholesterol diet on corticosterone plasma levels. However, either treatment did not change the plasma corticosterone levels significantly. The control sham injected animals had a corticosterone level of 12.4 ± 3.6 μg/dl (n = 3, ± S.E.), while the EE-treated animals and animals on a cholesterol diet had corticosterone levels of 10.2 ± 2.8 μg/dl (n = 3, ± S.E.) and 13.4 ± 3.3 μg/dl (n = 3, ± S.E.), respectively. Therefore, the observed changes in SR-BI expression in the parenchymal and Kupffer cells cannot be explained by induction of stress by the EE treatment or the high-cholesterol diet. The effects of EE treatment or a high-cholesterol diet on the selective uptake of HDL-CE was also studied in vitro. Hepatic parenchymal cells were isolated from both EE-treated rats and rats that had been fed a high-cholesterol diet for 2 weeks. The concentration dependence of the cell association of [3H]CE-HDL or 125I-HDL was studied (Fig.3). Data are expressed in terms of apparent particle uptake as originally devised by Pittman (5Pittman R.C.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor Jr., C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both parenchymal cells isolated from EE-treated rats or from rats fed on a high-cholesterol diet showed a 3-fold decrease in [3H]CE-HDL association in vitro (Fig. 3). The marked decrease of [3H]CE-HDL association was not accompanied by an effect on the 125I-HDL association (Fig.3). These in vitro data thus illustrate that the changes in in vivo uptake are also reflected in vitro with the isolated parenchymal cells. The observed in vivo increase in [3H]CE-HDL association by Kupffer cells after the high-cholesterol diet could also be demonstrated in vitro. Kupffer cells isolated from rats on a cholesterol diet showed a significant almost 2-fold increase (p < 0.05, two-way anova) in the uptake of [3H]CE-HDL (Fig. 4). The role of SR-BI as a functional HDL receptor is supported by three phenomena. First, SR-BI can bind HDL, and this binding is mediated through interaction with apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoC-III (16Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Second, SR-BI is most highly expressed in tissues that have previously been shown to be the principle sites of selective HDL-CE uptakein vivo in rodents (12Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 13Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Third, SR-BI was shown to mediate selective uptake of HDL-CE (10Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that the human CD36 and LIMPII analogous-1 (CLA-1) receptor, which is the human form of SR-BI, can also mediate selective uptake of HDL-CE in vitro and is strongly expressed in human liver and adrenal glands (34Murao K. Terpstra V. Green S.R. Kondratenko N. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17551-17557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In the present study we focused on the role of SR-BI in the liver and studied its potential role in the selective uptake of HDL-CE. In control rats it was observed that SR-BI is expressed mainly in parenchymal cells, the cell type which is also responsible for the selective uptake of HDL-CE within the liver (1Pieters M.N. Schouten D. Van Berkel Th. J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1225: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 2Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A.L. Kostner G.M. van Berkel Th. J.C., Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, a low level of SR-BI expression can also be found in Kupffer cells, which in the control situation do not show selective uptake of HDL-CE in vivo (4Pieters M.N. Schouten D. Bakkeren H.F. Esbach B. Brouwer A. Knook D.L. Van Berkel Th. J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It might be that SR-BI in Kupffer cells is acting as part of the innate immune system, as CD36, SR-BI, and also CLA-1 have been reported to bind apoptotic cells (34Murao K. Terpstra V. Green S.R. Kondratenko N. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17551-17557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 35Fukasawa M. Adachi H. Hirota K. Tsusimoto M. Akai H. Inoue K. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 222: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that SR-BI in macrophages can mediate the efflux of cholesterol to HDL (21Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). For reasons that Kupffer cells do readily internalize oxidized LDL, it might be that the presence of SR-BI is related to cholesterol efflux rather than uptake. SR-BI is regulated differently in steroidogenic tissues as compared with the liver. In steroidogenic tissues SR-BI expression is up-regulated in response to treatment of rats with EE, while in liver SR-BI is down-regulated (12Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We now show that this previously reported down-regulation of SR-BI expression (12Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) does only occur in the parenchymal cells. Furthermore, we found that this is accompanied by an almost complete inhibition of selective uptake of HDL-CE by parenchymal cells in vivo. In contrast, the expression of SR-BI is increased in Kupffer cells. The increase in SR-BI expression in Kupffer cells is coupled to a 4-fold increase in the uptake of HDL-CE. However, since the parenchymal cells make up for more than 90% of the total amount of liver protein, total liver uptake of HDL-CE is still decreased by 85%. The down-regulation in selective CE uptake by parenchymal cells is accompanied by an increase in 125I-HDL association. However, it must be realized that EE treatment leads to a 17-fold increase in the expression of the LDL receptor, specifically in parenchymal cells (36Harkes L. van Berkel Th. J.C FEBS Lett. 1983; 154: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although our HDL preparation was made free from human apoE, it cannot be excluded that circulating apoE associates to a limited extent with the HDL preparation and may mediate LDL receptor mediated uptake (37Mackinnon A.M. Drevon A.C. Sand T.M. Davis R.A. J. Lipid. Res. 1987; 28: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A high-cholesterol diet for 2 weeks induced a similar change in expression pattern of SR-BI in the liver cell types as compared with a 5-day treatment with EE, with a decreased expression in parenchymal cells and a 4-fold increased expression in Kupffer cells. Parenchymal cells showed in vivo a 93% inhibition of HDL-CE selective uptake, while Kupffer cells showed an increased uptake of HDL-CE. It thus appears that the changes in selective uptake of HDL-CE by parenchymal and Kupffer cells do correlate with the expression of SR-BI. It has been suggested that SR-BI expression is under feedback regulation in response to changes of cellular cholesterol stores (13Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Parenchymal cells indeed lower the expression of SR-BI as a result of cholesterol loading. The capacity to relieve the parenchymal cells of excess cholesterol by bile acid secretion may be rate-limiting as might also be the case after EE treatment (4Pieters M.N. Schouten D. Bakkeren H.F. Esbach B. Brouwer A. Knook D.L. Van Berkel Th. J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of SR-BI may thus prevent overloading of the cells with HDL-CE under these conditions. Anyway, the concomitant regulation of SR-BI expression and selective uptake of HDL-CE by estradiol treatment and cholesterol diet does support the unique role of SR-BI in HDL-CE uptake in parenchymal liver cells. Furthermore, it appears that SR-BI and the selective uptake of HDL-CE is differentially regulated in parenchymal and Kupffer cells upon EE treatment or a high-cholesterol diet, suggesting that SR-BI might have a different function in the tissue macrophages (Kupffer cells). Recently, it was suggested that SR-BI may promote HDL-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux in different cell types, including macrophages. In 6 different cell types cholesterol efflux rates correlated well with the expression levels of SR-BI (21Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Upon a high-cholesterol diet Kupffer cells accumulate a high amount of cholesteryl esters and the increased expression of SR-BI in these tissue macrophages may be related to the suggested function in HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux.

In mammalian cell expression systems, compared with FV, the FVIII primary translation product is inefficiently transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we show that FVIII is degraded within the cell by a lactacystin-inhibitable pathway, implicating the cytosolic 20 S proteasome machinery. Protein chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) preferentially interact with glycoproteins containing monoglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides and are proposed to traffic proteins through degradative and/or secretory pathways. Utilizing co-immunoprecipitation assays, intracellular FVIII was detected in association with CNX maximally within 30 min to 1 h following synthesis, whereas FV could not be detected in association with CNX. In contrast, both FVIII and FV displayed interaction with CRT during transit through the secretory pathway. B-domain deleted FVIII significantly reduced the CNX and CRT interaction, indicating the B-domain may represent a primary CNX and CRT interaction site. In the presence of inhibitors of glucose trimming, the interactions of FVIII with CNX, and of FVIII and FV with CRT, were significantly reduced whereas the secretion of FVIII, and not FV, was inhibited. In addition, transfection in a glucosidase I-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line (Lec23) demonstrated that both degradation and secretion of FVIII were inhibited, with little effect on the secretion of FV. These results support that CNX and CRT binding, mediated at least in part by the B-domain of FVIII, is required for efficient FVIII degradation and secretion. In contrast, FV does not require CNX interaction for efficient secretion. The results suggest a unique requirement for carbohydrate processing and molecular chaperone interactions that may limit the productive secretion of FVIII.

The A-domains of factors V and VIII share approximately 35% identity to each other and to the A-domains of ceruloplasmin, a copper-binding plasma protein, suggesting a role in metal-ion binding. The C-domains share approximately 35% identity to each other and to phospholipid-binding proteins, such as milk fat globule protein, suggesting a role in phospholipid interaction (5Stubbs J.D.

In contrast, there is negligible amino acid homology between the FV and FVIII B-domains (1Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, both B-domains contain a large number of asparagine (Asn)-linked oligosaccharides, where FV has 25 and FVIII has 19 potentialN-linked glycosylation sites. Within the genome, the FVIII and FV B-domains reside on unusually large single exons (6Gitschier J. Wood W.I. Goralka T.M. Wion K.L. Chen E.Y. Eaton D.H. Vehar G.A. Capon D.J. Lawn R.M.

Deletion of the B-domain in either FVIII or FV results in molecules that are secreted in a functional form (8Toole J.J. Pittman D.D. Orr E.C. Murtha P. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although most evidence supports that FVIII is expressed at least in hepatocytes (12Bontempo F.A. Lewis J.H. Gorenc T.J. Spero J.A. Ragni M.V. Scott J.P. Starzl T.E.

Nature. 1985; 317: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), the major physiological source for the in vivo expression of FVIII is unknown. Whereas HepG2 cells express FV (10Wilson D.B. Salem H.H. Mruk J.S. Maruyama I. Majerus P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 654-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), there are no known established or primary cell lines that express FVIII. Thus, our knowledge of FVIII biosynthesis is derived from interpretation of results from expression of the FVIII cDNA using expression vectors in transfected mammalian cells. Expression of FVIII in these transfection systems is 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than that observed with other genes using similar vectors and approaches. Studies have identified at least three reasons for the low level of expression: 1) the FVIII mRNA is inefficiently expressed (16Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Davies M.V. Wise R.J. Israel D.I. Dorner A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Lynch C.M. Israel D.I. Kaufman R.J. Miller A.D. Hum.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4264-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); 2) high levels of von Willebrand factor, a protein that binds and stabilizes FVIII in plasma, are required in the conditioned medium to promote stable accumulation of FVIII (16Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Davies M.V. Wise R.J. Israel D.I. Dorner A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6352-6362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) the primary translation product is inefficiently transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus (21Dorner A.J. Bole D.G. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast to FVIII, FV is efficiently transported from the ER and secreted into the medium (22Pittman D.D. Tomkinson K.N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the differences in the relative efficiency of secretion of these homologous proteins may be related to their relative efficiency of folding and their differential interaction with ER chaperones. In support of this hypothesis, FVIII displays extensive interaction with the protein chaperone immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), where FV does not detectably bind BiP (21Dorner A.J. Bole D.G. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 22Pittman D.D. Tomkinson K.N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The ER is a major site for the folding and assembly of secretory and integral membrane proteins. Proteins destined for the cell surface are co-translationally translocated into the lumen of the ER. Newly synthesized proteins fold and assemble into tertiary structures within the ER and these reactions are facilitated by enzymes and molecular chaperones. Many protein chaperones interact with folding intermediates of polypeptides that are eventually destined for the cell surface. The mechanism that ensures only transport of completely folded proteins has been termed “quality control.” Two homologous protein chaperones that prevent transport of unfolded glycoproteins are calnexin (CNX), a highly conserved integral ER membrane protein (23Bergeron J.J. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), and calreticulin (CRT), an ER lumenal protein (24Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), that share 42–78% identity. The sequence similarity between CNX and CRT suggests that these distinct ER proteins may have common functions. CNX and CRT associate transiently and selectively with newly synthesized glycoprotein folding intermediates, thereby preventing their transit through the secretory compartment (25Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 26Arunachalam B. Cresswell P. J. Biol.

Prolonged association with CNX or CRT is observed when proteins are misfolded or unable to oligomerize (30Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B.

The CNX and CRT recognition motifs within newly synthesized proteins is at least partly determined by the structures of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Upon translocation into the lumen of the ER, a core unit of 14 saccharides (GlcNAc2Man9Glc3) is added to selective asparagine residues. Immediately after, trimming of the three terminal glucose residues occurs by sequential action of glucosidase I that cleaves the terminal α(1,2)-glucose and glucosidase II that cleaves the two internal α(1,3)-glucose residues present on the core oligosaccharide structure. Binding to either CNX or CRT requires monoglucosylated asparagine-linked oligosaccharides and likely does not monitor the folding status of the glycoprotein (35Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A.

Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Release from CNX and/or CRT correlates with removal of the last glucose residue, mediated by glucosidase II. A UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase can re-glucosylate high-mannose containing side chains (39Trombetta S.E. Ganan S.A. Parodi A.J. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 40Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9236-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the activity of the glucosyltransferase is stimulated by unfolded protein (41Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 42Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It is proposed CNX and CRT specificity for binding and retention of unfolded proteins is due to the selective re-glucosylation of unfolded protein by the UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (42Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These monoglucosylated products then bind CNX and/or CRT and are retained in the ER. In this way, a cycle of de- and re-glucosylation acts to regulate the association of glycoproteins with CNX and CRT (43Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 44Helenius A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). After proper folding, terminal glucose residues are removed and the protein is released from CNX and/or CRT to transit to the Golgi apparatus.We have studied the intracellular trafficking and interaction of FVIII and FV with CNX and CRT in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Whereas intracellular FVIII is degraded by a lactacystin-inhibitable process, FV is efficiently secreted. The results demonstrate that FVIII interacts with CNX but FV does not, whereas both FVIII and FV interact with CRT. Interaction of FVIII with CNX and CRT is mediated in part by the B-domain. Analysis of the secretion of FVIII and FV in the absence of glucose trimming demonstrated that FVIII secretion displays a unique requirement for glucose trimming, whereas secretion of FV does not. Comparison of FV and FVIII intracellular trafficking provides a unique system to study the role for CNX and CRT in protein folding and may provide insight into novel ways to improve the efficiency of FVIII expression.DISCUSSIONCo-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking experiments demonstrating associations between various ER chaperones have suggested that the ER functions as an “affinity chromatography matrix” transiently adsorbing incompletely folded and assembled proteins, preventing aggregation, while glucose trimming and re-glucosylation of oligosaccharide glycans drives an on-off cycle of chaperone-glycoprotein substrate interactions (54Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). CNX and CRT represent members of a family of endogenous lectin molecules within the ER matrix that display substrate specificity for glycoproteins containing partially glucosylated N-linked core oligosaccharides (35Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 55Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V. Soling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Glucosidases I and II are responsible for trimming the glucose residues from the core oligosaccharides to a monoglucosylated form, an important process for CRT and CNX association with glycoproteins (56Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 57Otteken A. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 97-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of CNX and CRT in the secretion of newly synthesized proteins in the ER remains unclear. Most early hypotheses speculated that they share redundant functions by interacting with individual newly synthesized proteins and facilitating folding within the ER before transport to the Golgi compartment. Recent dissection of the ER secretory and quality control machinery both in vitro and within different protein expression systems has highlighted both the similarities and differences between these chaperones. Particular insight can be gained by comparing different glycoproteins within the same system. For that reason, we have compared CRT and CNX interaction with the homologous cofactors V and VIII. Since monoglucosylated glycans can be generated in the ER via the glucose trimming pathway (glucosidases I and II) as well as the re-glucosylation pathway (UDG-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase), CRT and CNX may differentially associate with monoglucosylated glycoproteins derived by either of these two pathways (58Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25345-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In support of this, blockade of glucosidase activity by castanospermine treatment stabilized CRT/T-cell receptor-α protein interactions, but not CNX·T-cell receptor-α protein complexes. This suggests that removal of glucose residues from nascent glycan chains is an important step in the disassembly of T-cell receptor-α proteins from CRT, but not from CNX. This difference may be attributed to differential access of the N-glycans to glucosidase II. Since CNX is a transmembrane protein and CRT is a lumenal protein, it was proposed that CNX holds the newly translated protein in the ER, whereas CRT associates and dissociates frequently from the protein (57Otteken A. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 97-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Alternatively, CNX may interact with domains on nascent proteins associated with the ER membrane, while the soluble CRT may interact domains not associated with the ER membrane. The finding that FVIII and FV, both similar proteins that do not interact with the ER membrane display different interactions with CNX does not support the generality of this latter hypothesis. Ternary complexes have also been observed in molecular chaperone interactions with nascent glycoproteins (54Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), giving rise to the possibility that some of the CRT or CNX interactions detected may be indirect. The finding that BiP was only present in complexes of FVIII with CRT and not in complexes of FV with CRT, support that the ternary complexes we have detected are specific to FVIII.Previous work with FVIII and FV interaction with ER chaperones has been confined to the immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), also known as the glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa (59Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) within the lumen of the ER (21Dorner A.J. Bole D.G. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 60Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). BiP is a member of the 70-kDa heat-shock protein (hsp70) family that exhibits a peptide-dependent ATPase activity (61Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and for which expression is induced by the presence of unfolded protein or unassembled protein subunits within the ER (62Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 63Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). In previous work, inefficient secretion of FVIII compared with FV correlated with FVIII interaction with BiP. FVIII release from BiP and transport out of the ER required high levels of intracellular ATP (64Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7429-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, FV did not detectably associate with BiP and did not require high levels of ATP for secretion (22Pittman D.D. Tomkinson K.N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of a 110-amino acid segment in the FVIII A1-domain for homologous FV sequences improved secretion by 10-fold and likely reduced BiP interaction (65Marquette K.A. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10297-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). More recent studies suggest that a primary BiP-binding site likely resides in the FVIII A1-domain and demonstrated the ability to modify an ER chaperone interaction to improve the efficiency of FVIII expression (66Swaroop M. Moussalli M. Pipe S.W. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24121-24124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).This study builds upon these findings by detecting CNX interaction with FVIII but not FV and CRT interaction with both FVIII and FV. Whereas only a fraction of FVIII was in a complex with CNX, the majority of intracellular FVIII was in a complex with CRT. In these studies, very little FVIII was detected in association with CNX after a 15-min pulse label whereas after a 30-min chase period, FVIII association with CNX was maximal. In contrast, FVIII binding to BiP in previous studies was maximal immediately after translation (21Dorner A.J. Bole D.G. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), similar to the kinetics for FVIII interaction with CRT. 2S. W. Pipe, J. A. Morris, J. Shah, and R. J. Kaufman, unpublished results. These results suggest that FVIII first binds BiP and CRT, and then is transferred to CNX, similar to observations with vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (67Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and thyroglobulin (31Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The CNX and CRT interactions with FVIII and FV were largely dependent on glucosidase activity. Treatment with glucosidase inhibitors, CST and DNJ, significantly blocked CNX interaction with FVIII. This complements reports that show that CNX association is specific for monoglucosylated core glycans (35Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 36Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 56Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). CRT association in the presence of these inhibitors was reduced but not as significantly as CNX association. This is consistent with the observations with T-cell receptor-α protein (58Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25345-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and suggests that FVIII may also require glucose trimming to dissociate from CRT. Alternatively, there may be peptide interactions or ternary complexes that maintain a detectable association in the absence of glucose trimming. In support of the latter hypothesis, we observed that the CRT associated with FVIII was also in a complex with BiP, whereas, CNX was not detected in this complex.The difference in CNX association between FVIII and FV and the unique requirement for glucose trimming for secretion of FVIII, and not of FV, suggests possible unique binding regions in FVIII that may be functionally important for chaperone interaction and secretion. Results from these studies suggest that FVIII interacts with CNX, likely through oligosaccharide structures within the heavily glycosylated B-domain, and this interaction is required for FVIII secretion. In contrast, secretion of FV, a molecule that also contains a heavily glycosylated B-domain but did not interact with CNX, was unaffected by inhibition of glucosidase activity. Deletion of the B-domain in FVIII reduced its CNX interaction and also reduced its dependence on glucose trimming for secretion. It should be noted that B-domain-deleted FVIII is expressed at a greater level than wild-type FVIII in a number of different cell culture systems studied (8Toole J.J. Pittman D.D. Orr E.C. Murtha P.

DNA. 1987; 6: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and this is one reason that most gene therapy studies for hemophilia A have utilized the B-domain deletion molecule. B-domain-deleted FVIII is expressed at a greater level because of a large increase in its mRNA level and consequently, protein translation (9Pittman D.D. Marquette K.A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 4214-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is a much larger percentage of newly synthesized, B-domain-deleted FVIII left in the cell extract after 4 h compared to either FVIII or FV. This leads to two conclusions regarding the trafficking of B-domain deleted FVIII: first, the B-domain-deleted FVIII is inefficiently transported through the secretory pathway despite a significantly higher rate of synthesis, and second, the B-domain-deleted FVIII primary translation product is not degraded by the proteasome as rapidly as wild-type FVIII. This resistance to degradation observed for the B-domain-deleted FVIII suggests that"
https://openalex.org/W2016258598,"Type A Pasteurella multocida, a prevalent animal pathogen, employs a hyaluronan [HA] polysaccharide capsule to avoid host defenses. We utilized transposon insertional mutagenesis to identify the P. multocida HA synthase, the enzyme that polymerizes HA. A DNA fragment from a wild-type genomic library could direct HA production in vivo in Escherichia coli, a bacterium that normally does not produce HA. Analysis of truncated plasmids derived from the original clone indicated that an open reading frame encoding a 972-residue protein was responsible for HA polymerization. This identification was confirmed by expression cloning in E. coli; we observed HA capsule formation in vivo and detected activity in membrane preparations in vitro. The polypeptide size was verified by photoaffinity labeling of the native P. multocida HA synthase with azido-UDP sugar analogs. Overall, the P. multocida sequence is not very similar to the other known HA synthases from streptococci, PBCV-1 virus, or vertebrates. Instead, a portion of the central region of the new enzyme is more homologous to the amino termini of other bacterial glycosyltransferases that produce different capsular polysaccharides or lipopolysaccharides. In summary, we have discovered a unique HA synthase that differs in sequence and predicted topology from the other known enzymes. Type A Pasteurella multocida, a prevalent animal pathogen, employs a hyaluronan [HA] polysaccharide capsule to avoid host defenses. We utilized transposon insertional mutagenesis to identify the P. multocida HA synthase, the enzyme that polymerizes HA. A DNA fragment from a wild-type genomic library could direct HA production in vivo in Escherichia coli, a bacterium that normally does not produce HA. Analysis of truncated plasmids derived from the original clone indicated that an open reading frame encoding a 972-residue protein was responsible for HA polymerization. This identification was confirmed by expression cloning in E. coli; we observed HA capsule formation in vivo and detected activity in membrane preparations in vitro. The polypeptide size was verified by photoaffinity labeling of the native P. multocida HA synthase with azido-UDP sugar analogs. Overall, the P. multocida sequence is not very similar to the other known HA synthases from streptococci, PBCV-1 virus, or vertebrates.

In summary, we have discovered a unique HA synthase that differs in sequence and predicted topology from the other known enzymes. Certain bacterial pathogens, namely Gram-negative Carter type APasteurella multocida and Gram-positive Groups A and C streptococci, produce extracellular capsules composed of HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan, hyaluronate or hyaluronic acid; HAS, HA synthase; Tn, transposon; GlcA, glucuronic acid; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; Glc, glucose; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; ORF, open reading frame; kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

HA, a linear polysaccharide consisting of alternating β1,4-GlcA and β1,3-GlcNAc, is also a component of many vertebrate tissues (3Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). The HA capsules of these bacteria are virulence factors that allow the microbes to be more successful pathogens by rendering host defenses, including complement-mediated killing and phagocytosis, less effective (4Harmon B.G. Glisson J.R. Latimer K.S. Steffens W.L. Nunnally J.C. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1991; 52: 1507-1511PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wessels M.R. Moses A.E. Goldberg J.B. DiCesare T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8317-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HA is not immunogenic because the polymer is a normal component of the host body (6Quinn A.W. Sing K.P. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1957; 95: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The capsules of other bacteria that are composed of different polysaccharides, however, are usually major targets of the immune response. The antibodies generated against capsular polymers are often responsible for clearance of microorganisms and long term immunity. Therefore, the HA capsule serves P. multocida and Groups A and C streptococci as molecular camouflage. Various HAS enzymes have been described in the last 5 years (reviewed in Ref. 7Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). HasA from Streptococcus pyogenes was the first HAS to be definitively identified (8DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This integral membrane protein utilizes intracellular UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc as substrates. The nascent HA chain is extruded through the membrane to form the extracellular capsule. DG42, a Xenopus protein with a previously unknown function that had similarity to HasA (9DeAngelis P.L. Yang N. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was shown to be a HA synthase (10Meyer M.F. Kreil G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4543-4547Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Several groups identified human and murine homologs of DG42, named HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3, that directed HA synthesis (7Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar); these mammalian enzymes are similar at the amino acid level, but they reside on different chromosomes. Recently a viral HAS, an ORF called A98R, with 28–30% identity to the streptococcal and vertebrate enzymes was discovered (12DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Graves M.V. Burbank D.E. van Etten J.L. Science. 1997; 278: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). PBCV-1 (P aramecium bursariaChlorella virus) produces authentic HA polysaccharide shortly after infection of its Chlorella-like green algae host (12DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Graves M.V. Burbank D.E. van Etten J.L. Science. 1997; 278: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A98R is the first virally encoded enzyme reported to produce a carbohydrate polymer. This finding is also the initial discovery of HA outside of animals and their bacterial pathogens. Carter type A P. multocida, the causative agent of fowl cholera, is responsible for great economic losses in the U. S. poultry industry. A capsule mutant did not thrive in the bloodstream of turkeys after intravenous injection in comparison with the encapsulated parental strain (13Snipes K.P. Ghazikhanian G.Y. Hirsh D.C. Avian Dis. 1986; 31: 254-259Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This spontaneously arising mutant strain was also 105-fold less virulent than wild type, but the nature of the genetic defect was not known (13Snipes K.P. Ghazikhanian G.Y. Hirsh D.C. Avian Dis. 1986; 31: 254-259Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Wild-type cells treated with hyaluronidase became complement-sensitive (14Hansen L.M. Hirsh D.C. Vet. Microbiol. 1989; 21: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and were more readily phagocytosed (4Harmon B.G. Glisson J.R. Latimer K.S. Steffens W.L. Nunnally J.C. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1991; 52: 1507-1511PubMed Google Scholar) in comparison with untreated microbes. Here we report the identification of a unique HAS from P. multocida with a primary structure that does not strongly resemble the enzymes fromStreptococcus, PBCV-1 virus, or higher animals. Tn916 was used to disrupt and to tag the HA biosynthesis locus. The Tn element on a nonreplicating plasmid, pAM150 (provided by D. B. Clewell), was introduced into the wild-type encapsulated P. multocida strain P-1059 (ATCC number 15742) by electroporation (15DeAngelis P.L. Microb. Pathog. 1998; 24 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Altered colony morphology was initially screened by visual examination with oblique lighting. Wild-type P-1059 forms large mucoid (“wet” appearance) colonies that appear iridescent (red and green coloration). Smaller, “drier” colonies lacking iridescence were chosen and streaked out. India ink staining and light microscopy were used as a secondary screen to assess the state of encapsulation. The position of the Tn elements in the mutant chromosome was mapped by Southern analysis (15DeAngelis P.L. Microb. Pathog. 1998; 24 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd. Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). The DNA sequences at the Tn-disrupted sites from several independently selected mutants were obtained by direct dideoxy sequence analysis of tagged chromosomal DNA (15DeAngelis P.L. Microb. Pathog. 1998; 24 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, a chimeric DNA fragment consisting of a 12-kb portion of the Tn916 element and a short region of the P. multocida DNA generated by HhaI digestion of mutant chromosomal DNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis (all of the wild-type P-1059HhaI genomic fragments are ≤ 7 kb). The chimeric fragment served as the template in cycle sequencing reactions using33P terminators (Thermosequenase® system, Amersham) and a Tn916 right arm terminus primer (5′-GACCTTGATAAAGTGTGATAAGTCC-3′). The sequence data were used to design PCR primers. Gel-purified PCR products were labeled with digoxigenin utilizing the High Prime system (Boehringer Mannheim). A λ library of Sau3A partially digested P-1059 DNA was made usingBamHI-cleaved λZap Express™ vector system (Stratagene). The plaque lifts were screened by hybridization (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd. Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) with digoxigenin-labeled PCR product. Escherichia coli XLI-Blue MRF′ was co-infected with individual purified positive λ clones and ExAssist helper phage to yield phagemids. The resulting phagemids were transfected into E. coli XLOLR cells to recover the plasmids. The plasmids were transformed into a host more suitable for HA polysaccharide production, E. coli K5 (strain Bi8337–41; provided by I. Orskov and F. Orskov). This strain produces UDP-GlcA, a required substrate for HA biosynthesis that is not found at significant levels in most laboratory strains. Additionally, K5 possesses many other genes essential for capsular polysaccharide transport in E. coli (17Roberts I.S. Mountford R. Hodge R. Jann K.B. Boulnois G. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another host employed for expression studies was E. coli EV5 (provided by R. P. Silver; Ref. 18Vimr E.R. Aaronson W. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1106-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an acapsular derivative of a K1 strain (which produces a polysialic acid capsule) that possesses all the same general capsular polysaccharide transport machinery as K5 but not high levels of UDP-Glc dehydrogenase. Cultures of the E. coli transformants with the candidate plasmids grown in completely defined medium were tested for HA polysaccharide production as described previously (19DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Diagn. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1994; 20: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) except that the cell pellets were extracted with 8 m urea, 0.01% SDS at 95 °C for 2 min. The HA test assay (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) employs a specific HA-binding protein to detect HA at concentrations of ≥0.1 μg/ml (20Tengblad A. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Multiple determinations of HA levels were averaged. The HA concentration in bacterial cultures was normalized for differences in cell number by measuring the A600 value and presenting the data as μg HA/ml /A600 of bacteria. One plasmid, pPm7A, with a 5.8-kb insert conferred E. coli K5 with the ability to produce HA; no HA was produced by cells with vector plasmid alone. A truncated derivative of pPm7A containing a ∼3.3-kb insert, called pPmΔ6e, could direct the biosynthesis of HA when transformed into E. coli K5. Therefore, the sequence of both strands of the pPm7A plasmid corresponding to the pPmΔ6e DNA insert was determined. A single complete 972-residue ORF, which we called PmHAS, was found. The PmHAS ORF in the pPm7A insert was amplified by 13 cycles of PCR (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd. Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) with Taq polymerase (Fisher) and primers corresponding to the sequence near the deduced amino and carboxyl termini (codons in capital letters: sense, 5′-gcgaattcaaaggacagaaaATGAAcACATTATCACAAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-gggaattctgcag ttaTAGAGTTATACTATTAATAATGAAC-3′; start and stop codons, respectively, in bold). Codon 2 (T → C) was altered (italic lowercase letter) to increase protein production in E. coli. The primers also contained EcoRI and PstI restriction sites (underlined letters) to facilitate cloning into the expression plasmid pKK223-3 (tac promoter; Pharmacia). The resulting recombinant construct, pPmHAS, was transformed into E. coli SURE cells (Stratagene), and this strain was used as the source of membrane preparations for in vitro HAS assays (21DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochem. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Log phase cultures (LB broth, 30 °C) were induced with 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for 3 h before harvest. The plasmid was also transformed into E. coli K5; the resulting strain was examined for the presence of capsule by light microscopy and buoyant density centrifugation (19DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Diagn. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1994; 20: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The K5 bacterial cultures were not induced routinely because isopropylthiogalactopyranoside addition did not increase HA levels in LB or defined medium significantly. The radiolabeled UDP sugar analogs, [32P]azido-UDP-GlcA (3 mCi/μMol) and [32P]azido-UDP-GlcNAc (2.5 mCi/μMol), were prepared and purified as described (Refs. 22Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and 23Sunthankar P. Pastuszak I. Rooke A. Elbein A.D. van de Rijn I. Canfield W.M. Drake R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, respectively). Membrane preparations from P. multocidaP-1059 (24DeAngelis P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9768-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris, 20 mmMgCl2, pH 7, were incubated with either probe (final concentration, 20 μm) for 30 s on ice before irradiation with ultraviolet light (254 nm, 90 s). The proteins were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd. Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar, 22Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). No radiolabel was incorporated if the irradiation step was omitted. As a specificity control, 10-fold molar excess of the normal UDP sugar was co-incubated with the probe and membranes. [32P]Azido-UDP-Glc (3 mCi/μMol; Ref. 22Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was also used as another control. About 8 × 104 Tn-containing transformants produced by several rounds of mutagenesis were screened for differences in colony morphology. By light microscopy with India Ink, the cells from small noniridescent colonies (n = 4) possessed no detectable capsule (acapsular), whereas the cells from medium-sized iridescent colonies (n = 8) appeared to have a capsule of about 10–25% of the diameter of the wild type (microcapsular). Interestingly, two of the acapsular mutants, named H and L, which had Tn elements that mapped to the same HindIII orBstXI genomic fragments (data not shown), reverted to wild-type colony morphology at rates of ∼10−3. The Tn element in each revertant had excised from the original position and reinserted at different, new locations as judged by Southern analysis; on the other hand, all acapsular subclones retained the Tn element at the original location (data not shown). No significant HAS activity was detected in membrane preparations from mutant H cells, whereas substantial HAS activity was obtained from wild-type P-1059 cells (≤0.7 versus 120 pmol transfer GlcA/mg protein/h, respectively). These findings suggested that the Tn elements in mutants H and L were indeed responsible for disrupting the HA biosynthesis locus. To bridge the gap between the Tn insertion sites of two acapsular mutants, PCR using the mutant L chromosomal DNA template was performed with a primer derived from sequence at the mutant H disruption site, PmHF (5′-CTCCAGCTGTAAATTAGAGATAAAG-3′), and a primer corresponding to the left terminus of Tn916, TnL2 (5′-GCACATAGAATAAGGCTTTACGAGC-3′). A specific ∼1-kb PCR product was obtained; on the other hand, no product was formed if PmHR (inverse complement of PmHF) or the Tn916 right arm primer were substituted. The PCR product was used as a hybridization probe to obtain a functional copy of the P. multocida HAS. Six positively hybridizing plaques were found after screening ∼104 plaques, and these phage were converted into plasmids. One plasmid, pPm7A, was found that could direct E. coli K5 to produce HA in vivo (20 μg HA/ml/A600 of bacteria). E. coli K5 with control plasmids did not produce HA (≤0.05 μg HA/ml/A600). E. coli XLOLR orE. coli EV5 cells (which lack UDP-Glc dehydrogenase activity) do not produce HA even if they contain the pPm7A plasmid (≤0.05 μg HA/ml/A600). This genetic evidence implied that the insert of pPm7A does not encode a functional UDP-Glc dehydrogenase enzyme. A truncated derivative of the pPm7A plasmid with the smallest insert capable of directing HA biosynthesis (85 μg HA/ml/A600 of K5 bacteria), pPmΔ6e, contained a single complete ORF encoding a 972 residue protein (Fig.1). Smaller plasmids with partial deletions of this ORF lost the ability to direct HA polymer production in E. coli K5. We hypothesized that this protein was the HA synthase and called it PmHAS. The predicted Mris 111,923, and the calculated isoelectric point is 6.84. We used PmHAS as the query in BLASTP (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70747) Google Scholar) searches of the protein sequence data base. The central portion of PmHAS (residues 436–536) is most homologous to bacterial glycosyltransferases from a wide variety of genera, including Streptococcus, Vibrio,Neisseria, and Staphylococcus, that form exopolysaccharides or the carbohydrate portions of lipopolysaccharides (smallest sum probabilities, 10−22–10−10; Fig. 2 A). The most notable sequence similarities are the DGSTD and DXDD motifs. Unexpectedly, there was no significant overall similarity of PmHAS to the streptococcal, viral, or vertebrate HASs (HasA smallest sum probability 0.33). Only one short region of streptococcal HasA aligns with PmHAS in a convincing fashion (Fig. 2 A). A few segments of the first half of PmHAS are also similar to portions of the mammalian UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide GalNAc-transferase, an enzyme that initiates O-glycosylation of mucin-type proteins (smallest sum probability, ∼10−3; Fig. 2 B). The partial ORF (27 residues) downstream of PmHAS is very similar to the amino terminus of several UDP-Glc dehydrogenases from bacteria including E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (67–74% identity). The severe truncation in the original pPm7A clone would be expected to result in complete loss of activity. The other ORF (623 residues) upstream of PmHAS is very homologous to the E. coli K5 KfaA protein (smallest sum probability, 10−52), a protein putatively involved in the transport of capsular polysaccharide out of the cell. The predicted size of 972 residues (112 kDa) for PmHAS was confirmed by photoaffinity labeling of membrane preparations from P. multocida P-1059. Both [32P]azido-UDP-GlcA and [32P]azido-UDP-GlcNAc probes photoincorporated into a ∼110-kDa protein in an UV-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). Competition with the corresponding unlabeled natural UDP sugar precursors lowered the extent of probe photoincorporation. In parallel experiments, [32P]azido-UDP-Glc, an analog of the normal HA precursors, did not label this 110-kDa protein (data not shown). Furthermore, membranes derived from Tn mutants had either no or very low amounts of azido-UDP-GlcA photoincorporation into this protein (Fig. 3 B). Membranes derived from E. coli SURE cells containing the pPmHAS plasmid, butnot samples from cells with the vector pKK223-3 alone, synthesized HA in vitro when supplied with both UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc (25 versus ≤1.5 pMol GlcA transfer/mg protein/h, respectively). No incorporation of [14C]GlcA was observed if UDP-GlcNAc was omitted or if divalent metal ions were chelated with EDTA. The HAS activity derived from recombinant HAS was similar to the enzyme obtained from wild-type P. multocida membranes because Mn2+ stimulated at least 10-fold more activity than Mg2+ (24DeAngelis P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9768-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cultures of recombinant E. coli were also tested for the presence of HA polysaccharide with a radiometric assay utilizing labeled HA-binding protein. E. coli K5 with pPmHAS produced 460 μg HA/ml/A600. K5 cells with pKK223-3 vector alone did not produce HA (≤0.01 μg HA/ml/A600). For comparison, wild-type P. multocida P-1059 grown in the same media produced 1,100 μg HA/ml/A600. E. coli K5 with pPmHAS produced such high levels of HA that the cells became encapsulated (Fig. 4 A). The radius of the capsule of the recombinant strain was ∼0.2–0.5 μm (assuming a bacterial cell width of 0.5 μm). This capsule could be removed by treatment with either ovine testicular hyaluronidase orStreptomyces HA lyase (Fig. 4 B). Neither the native K5 host strain nor transformants containing pKK223-3 vector possessed a readily observable capsule as determined by light microscopy. K5 cells with pPmHAS were also deemed encapsulated by buoyant density centrifugation. The recombinant cells floated on top of the 58% Percoll cushion, whereas the vector control cells or hyaluronidase-treated recombinant cells pelleted through the Percoll cushion (not shown). We found that the PmHAS protein polymerizes authentic HA polysaccharide. The carbohydrate from recombinant E. coliwas recognized by the cartilage HA-binding protein and was sensitive to HA lyase digestion; these reagents are regarded as specific for HA polysaccharide (20Tengblad A. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Ohya T. Kaneko Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Both UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc were required for HA synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, azido-UDP-GlcA and azido-UDP-GlcNAc but not azido-UDP-Glc specifically photoincorporated into PmHAS. As in the case of streptococcal HasA (21DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochem. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and Xenopus DG42 (11DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it appears that one polypeptide species, PmHAS, transfers two distinct sugar groups to the nascent HA chain. Many encapsulated Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli,Neisseria meningitidis, and Hemophilus influenzae, possess clusters of genes responsible for capsule biosynthesis organized in operons (17Roberts I.S. Mountford R. Hodge R. Jann K.B. Boulnois G. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Vimr E.R. Aaronson W. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1106-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kroll J.S. Loynds B. Brophy L.N. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These operons often contain genes encoding (i) enzymes required for sugar nucleotide precursor synthesis, (ii) glycosyltransferases for polymerizing the exopolysaccharide, and (iii) proteins implicated in polysaccharide export. Thus far we have found that the Type A P. multocidaHA capsule operon contains: a KfaA analog, a HA synthase, and a putative UDP-Glc dehydrogenase. The Tn916 elements in the P. multocida acapsular mutants H and L were not integrated directly in the HAS gene but rather were located in the KfaAhomolog gene. The resulting disruption probably caused a polar mutation resulting in no expression of the downstream genes encoding the HAS or the UDP-Glc dehydrogenase. Potential ribosome-binding sites preceded these latter two ORFs, but there were no obvious promoter elements. the S. pyogenes HAS gene, hasA, is followed by an UDP-Glc dehydrogenase, hasB, and an UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, hasC; in this case, however, the promoter element is at the 5′ end of hasA (28Crater D.L. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). At the amino acid level, PmHAS is not as similar to the other cloned HASs as one would initially expect. Two potential short motifs, DGS(S/T) at residues 477–480 and DSD at residues 527–529 of PmHAS, are present in HasA. Another similar DGS-containing motif is found repeated at residues 196–198 of PmHAS. The DG of the first motif and the DSD are conserved in all HASs. On the other hand, several absolutely conserved motifs ((S/G)GPLXXY, GDDRXLTN, and LXQQXRWXKS(Y/F/W)(F/C)RE) found in all previously cloned HASs are absent from PmHAS (7Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 12DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Graves M.V. Burbank D.E. van Etten J.L. Science. 1997; 278: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Instead, a variety of bacterial glycosyltransferases align more closely with the sequence in the central portion of the P. multocida HAS protein. These enzymes, which have been either shown or predicted to transfer GlcNAc, galactose, or GalNAc groups, are roughly one-third the size of the P. multocida enzyme; it is interesting to note that their amino termini sequences align together with the middle of the PmHAS polypeptide (residues 430–540). Sections of the first 420 residues of PmHAS show some similarity to portions of the mammalian UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide GalNAc-transferase. These observations may be a reflection of a possible domain structure within PmHAS. The last ∼340 residues of this new HAS are not very similar to other entries in the sequence data bases. Therefore, the P. multocida HAS may be unique or may be the prototype of a new class of HAS. PmHAS is roughly twice the size of the streptococcal, viral, or vertebrate HASs (972 versus 417–588 residues, respectively; Ref. 7Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the hydropathy plots of PmHAS and the other known HASs are dissimilar. Using the TMPRED program (29Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347 (abstr.): 166Google Scholar), PmHAS is predicted to have only two candidate transmembrane helices (centered on residues 170 and 510), and both termini of the protein may be located in the cytoplasm. Topologically, this speculation implies that perhaps one-third of the P. multocida polypeptide (∼340 residues) is located outside of the cytoplasm. On the other hand, a different topology is predicted for the other class of HASs (7Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 9DeAngelis P.L. Yang N. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Reporter enzyme fusion analysis of streptococcal HasA concurs with these predictions; the topological arrangement appears to consist of (i) two transmembrane helices near the amino terminus, (ii) a putative cytoplasmic domain, followed by (iii) three membrane-associated regions at the carboxyl half of the protein (30Heldermon C.D. DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1032Google Scholar). The connecting loops between membrane-associated regions are rather short (4–10 residues); therefore, the vast majority of the polypeptide chain is probablynot extracellularly exposed. In the future, it will be interesting to elucidate if these two distinct structural classes of HASs utilize the same or different mechanisms to polymerize a product with the identical composition and glycosidic linkages.

We reported that MCM protein complexes consisting of MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 bind strongly to a histone-Sepharose column (Ishimi, Y., Ichinose, S., Omori, A., Sato, K., and Kimura, H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 24115–24122). Here, we have analyzed this interaction at the molecular level. We found that among six mouse MCM proteins, only MCM2 binds to histone; amino acid residues 63–153 are responsible for this binding. The region required for nuclear localization of MCM2 was mapped near this histone-binding domain. Far-Western blotting analysis of truncated forms of H3 histone indicated that amino acid residues 26–67 of H3 histone are required for binding to MCM2. We have also shown that mouse MCM2 can inhibit the DNA helicase activity of the human MCM4, -6, and -7 protein complex. These results suggest that MCM2 plays a different role in the initiation of DNA replication than the other MCM proteins.

Six MCM proteins (MCM2–7) have been identified from yeast to mammals, and each of them plays a distinct role in DNA replication (reviewed in Refs. 1Tye B.-K.

Consistent with this idea, MCM proteins associate with the chromatin before the onset of DNA replication and detach from the chromatin during DNA replication (7Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J.

Based on the molecular mass of each MCM protein, this complex is probably a hexamer containing a single molecule of the six MCM proteins. However, sub-complexes containing MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 or MCM3 and -5 have also been isolated from human cell extracts (13Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J.

Our group recently found that the DNA helicase activity was associated with the human MCM4, -6, and -7 protein complex (20Ishimi Y. J. Biol.

The 600-kDa complex containing the six MCM proteins is detected in soluble cell extracts; however, the structures of the chromatin-bound MCM protein heterocomplexes (21Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) remain to be elucidated. Origin recognition complex (ORC) and CDC6 protein are both required for the initiation of DNA replication and are necessary for the binding of MCM proteins to chromatin in Xenopus egg extracts (22Rowles A.

Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) has also been observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The genetic interaction between MCM proteins and ORC in S. cerevisiae supports these findings (28Loo S. Fox C.A. Rine J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Bell S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 29Li J.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). These results suggest that MCM proteins form a complex with ORC and CDC6 at the replication origin. In S. cerevisiae the number of MCM molecules recovered is much greater than the number of ORC molecules; however, over half of these MCM molecules are not bound to chromatin (24Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.C. Diffley J.F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5611-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 30Yong M.R. Tye B.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1587-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition ORC6 and CDC6 can be released from the chromatin under conditions where almost all of MCM5 remains associated with the chromatin (24Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.C. Diffley J.F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5611-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Therefore, the molecular basis of the interaction between MCM proteins and the chromatin remains to be determined. Here, we report that an amino-terminal portion of MCM2 has an affinity for histone and that MCM2 can inhibit the DNA helicase activity of the human MCM4, -6, and -7 protein complex. Six mouseMcm genes, Mcm2 (accession no. D86725) (11Kimura H. Ohtomo T. Yamaguchi M. Ishi A. Sugimoto K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 977-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), -3 (8Kimura H.

Gene (Amst .). 1995; 167: 343-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), had been cloned in pBluescript II plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at the EcoRI site, as reported. Truncated forms of the Mcm2 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers from each site. Forward primers starting from nucleotide (nt) 153 (for deleting (Δ) amino acid residues 1–34), 236 (Δ1–62), 279 (Δ1–76), 327 (Δ1–92), 399 (Δ1–116), and 536 (Δ1–166) and a reverse primer ending at nt 3323 were used as PCR primers to truncate an amino-terminal region. A forward primer starting from nt 51 and reverse primers ending at nt 326 (for amino acid residues 1–92), nt 398 (residues 1–116), nt 452 (residues 1–134), nt 509 (residues 1–153), nt 731 (residues 1–227), and nt 896 (residues 1–282) were used to truncate a carboxyl-terminal region of the Mcm2 gene. To construct Mcm2 genes that were deleted from amino acid residues 1–34 or 1–92, an ATG sequence was added to the 5′-ends of the forward primers to create a methionine at the amino terminus of the MCM2 proteins, and stop codons were added to the 3′-end of the reverse primers to produce MCM2 truncated at the carboxyl-terminal region. A forward primer starting from nt 236 and a reverse primer ending at nt 509 were used to construct anMcm2 gene that encodes amino acid residues 63–153. The resulting DNAs were cloned into pBluescript II SK− at the EcoRI site (Δ1–34, Δ1–62, Δ1–76, Δ1–116, Δ1–166, 1–116, and 1–282), between the SalI and EcoRI sites (Δ1–92), or between the EcoRI and BamHI sites (1–92, 1–134, 1–153, 1–227, and 63–153) and purified by anion exchange (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). MCM proteins were synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine in a reticulocyte lysate system, as suggested by the manufacturer (TNT®-coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega, Madison, WI). The reaction mixture was diluted with 400 μl of 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 40 mmdithiothreitol and then concentrated to about 50 μl using a Microcon-10 column (Amicon, Bevely, MA) to remove free [35S]methionine. An aliquot of the sample was diluted to 10 μl with 0.3 m NaCl in buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and then incubated with 10 μl of the histone-Sepharose beads in the same buffer for 1 h at 4 °C with vibration. The supernatant was saved after centrifugation, and the beads were washed three times with the above buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted twice with 20 μl of 2m NaCl in buffer A plus Nonidet P-40. The bound and unbound proteins were electrophoresed in a 10, 15, or 20% polyacrylamide gel (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity on the gel was analyzed with a Bio-Image Analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Truncated forms of the mouse Mcm2 gene were constructed by PCR using forward primers starting from nt 327 (for deleting (Δ) amino acid residues 1–92) and 509 (Δ1–153) and the reverse primer ending at nt 2762. In the cases of Δ1–92 and Δ1–153, ATG sequences were added to the 5′-ends of the forward primers. The native form as well as the truncated forms of the mouseMcm2 gene were cloned into pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) at the HindIII site (native, Δ1–34) or between the HindIII and EcoRI (Δ1–153) sites, to synthesize MCM2-GFP fusion proteins where the carboxyl-terminal ends of the MCM2 proteins were fused to the amino-terminal end of GFP. The cloned DNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using Tfx 20 (Promega). The cells of 105 were grown on coverslips in a 35-mm dish with 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) for 1 day. The cloned DNA (1.4 μg) was added to 1 ml of DMEM without FCS and antibiotics, and the solution was mixed well. Tfx 20 (4.2 μl) was then added to this DNA solution (final ratio of Tfx 20: DNA = 2:1). The solution was mixed well and left for 15 min at room temperature. The culture medium was removed from the dish, and the DNA/lipid solution was added. The dish was incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 1 h. Two ml of DMEM with 10% FCS and antibiotics was added, and the dish was returned to the incubator. The next day, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM with 5% FCS plus antibiotics after washing three times with the medium. After 8 h (24 h after transfection), the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing three times with PBS, cells were stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Photographs were taken to Kodak TMY400 film using Zeiss Axioplan with 63 × objective. The histone H3 gene of HeLa cells was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR (RNA LA PCR Kit, Takara, Tokyo). The H3 histone gene was cloned into pTrxFus vector (Invitrogen, NV Leek, Netherlands), and the DNA sequence was determined using a DNA sequencing kit (Dye Termination Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction, Perkin-Elmer). The amino acid sequence of H3 histone, deduced from the nucleotide sequence, was the same as the published sequence (accession no. X0090) (33Zhong R. Roeder R.G. Heintz N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7409-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Truncated forms of the histone H3 gene, constructed by PCR, were cloned between the KpnI and BamHI sites of the TrxFus vector. Thioredoxin-H3 fusion proteins were overexpressed in transformedEscherichia coli. The fusion proteins were electrophoresed on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a membrane (Immobilon-PSQ, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The proteins on the membrane were visualized by staining with 0.1% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid for 10 min. After destaining with water, the membrane was incubated in 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS for 2 h and then incubated in PBS containing 5% calf serum and 0.3% bovine serum albumin (34Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The membrane was incubated with the [35S]methionine-labeled amino-terminal fragment (amino acid residues 1–282) of the mouse MCM2 protein in the same solution for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the radioactivity on the membrane was measured using the Bio-Image Analyzer. The full size mouse Mcm2 gene was cloned into an HLTA vector between the EcoRI and NotI sites (PharMingen, San Diego), and recombinant baculovirus encoding histidine-tagged Mcm2 gene was prepared as the manufacturer suggested. Soluble His-MCM2 protein was recovered after lysis of the virus-infected Sf9 cells. The extracts were mixed with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads, and the beads were washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol in the presence of 20 mm imidazole. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 0.3 m imidazole in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.3 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The partially purified His-MCM2 protein was then loaded onto a histone-Sepharose column in 0.3m NaCl, and the fusion protein was eluted by 2m NaCl (16Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Purified His-MCM2 protein was diluted to 0.2m NaCl and then concentrated with a Centricon-30 column (Amicon). The MCM protein fraction that contains mainly MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins was purified from HeLa cells by histone H3/H4-Sepharose column chromatography and then by glycerol gradient centrifugation (20Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). DNA helicase activity was measured by displacement of 17-mer oligonucleotides annealed to M13mp18 DNA. Proteins were electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, or 4 or 5% polyacrylamide gels in 50 mmTris-HCl and 50 mm glycine, pH 8.8 (35Dean F.B. Borowiec J.A. Eki T. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14129-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then stained with silver. A plasmid (pSV78-T-lacZ) encoding the SV40 T antigen nuclear localization signal (PPKKKRKV) was kindly provided by M. Tanaka (Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Sciences). AnHindIII site was created at the carboxyl end of a fragment containing the signal by PCR, and the resultant HindIII fragment (5′-AGCTTACC/ATG/GCC/AAG/ATC/CCT/CCT/AAG/AAG/AAG/CGC/AAA/GTC/ GAG/A-3′) containing the signal was inserted into a construct producing the truncated form (Δ1–153) of mouse MCM2 protein that had been fused with GFP. Slashes indicate frames of translated amino acids. As the result, a peptide (MAKIPPKKKRKVE) was added to the amino terminus of the fusion protein. Among the six MCM proteins that were detected in 0.2 m NaCl-soluble HeLa whole cell extracts, MCM protein complexes containing MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 proteins bound strongly to a histone-Sepharose column (16Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These four MCM proteins from mouse FM3A cells also bound to the histone-Sepharose column (data not shown). Each of the six mouse MCM proteins was synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using a reticulocyte lysate system (Fig.1 A). The most slowly migrating bands of each MCM protein synthesized corresponded to full-size products, since the electrophoretic mobilities of these bands were coincident with those of native MCM proteins. The ability of the MCM proteins to bind histone was examined (Fig. 1 B). Each of the labeled MCM proteins was incubated with histone-Sepharose beads at 0.3m NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted from the Sepharose by increasing the NaCl concentration to 2 m. Approximately 90% of the recovered MCM2 was detected in the bound fraction, but the other five MCMs did not bind to the histone-Sepharose under these conditions (less than 10% was recovered in the bound fraction). These results suggest that MCM2 is mainly responsible for the strong binding of MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 complexes to the histone-Sepharose. This conclusion was supported by the finding that the elution of MCM2 from the histone H3/H4-Sepharose column was slightly retarded compared with that of the MCM4, -6, and -7 (16Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine the region of MCM2 responsible for binding to histone, the histone binding activity of the truncated forms of MCM2 was examined. First, MCM2 proteins that were deleted externally from the amino terminus were synthesized, and histone binding was examined (Fig.2). A large portion (76%) of the recovered native MCM2 was detected in the bound fraction. Deleting the amino-terminal region (amino acid residues 1–62) did not affect the binding with histone. Smaller proteins were also synthesized using this MCM2 construct (Δ1–62), which may result from the initiation of protein synthesis from methionines at a downstream region in this system. These smaller proteins did not bind the histone-Sepharose. Deleting amino acid residues 1–76 decreased the binding, since almost equal amounts of MCM2 were recovered in the unbound and bound fractions. Almost no binding was detected in MCM2 deleted amino acid residues 1–92, 1–116, and 1–166. Next, the MCM2 proteins, deleted externally from the carboxyl terminus, were synthesized, and histone binding was examined (Fig.3). A large portion (approximately 75%) of the MCM2 proteins recovered from the bound fractions contained the amino-terminal region amino acid residues 1–153, 1–227, and 1–282. However, the MCM2 protein containing amino acid residues 1–134 showed a decrease in binding activity (55% was recovered in the bound fraction), and the MCM2 protein containing amino acid residues 1–92 and 1–116 lost the binding activity. These results suggest that the region of amino acid residues 63–153, which contains a high concentration of charged amino acids, is required for binding to histone (Fig. 4). Consistently, the MCM2 fragment from amino acid residues 63 to 153 bound to histone (Fig. 3). MCM2 is the only one MCM protein containing such a highly charged region, and this feature is conserved from S. cerevisiae to mammals.Figure 4The region of MCM2 required for binding to histone. The results in Figs. 2 and 3 are summarized. The structures of truncated MCM2 proteins are shown; the DNA-dependent ATPase domain and two candidates of nuclear localization signals (NLS) are indicated. The histone binding activity of the MCM2 protein is indicated at the right by +/−, and binding of intermediate strength is indicated by (+). The region required for binding to histone is enlarged at the bottom, where basic amino acid residues areunderlined and acidic residues areoverlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our group reported that MCM protein complexes containing MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 specifically bind to a histone H3-Sepharose column (16Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To identify the region(s) of H3 histone responsible for the binding to MCM2, various deletion mutants of H3 histone were produced as fusion proteins, and the binding of these H3 histones to MCM2 was examined by far-Western blotting analysis (Fig.5). An H3 histone fragment of amino acid residues 1–67 (lane 3) was bound with MCM2 with efficiency relatively similar to that of the fusion protein containing full-size H3 histone (lane 5). Several smaller proteins were also detected in all fusion proteins, which are probably nonspecifically recognized in this analysis. The fusion proteins containing H3 fragments amino acid residues 1–45 (lane 1) and 1–55 (lane 2) lost the binding activity. A fragment of amino acid residues 26–90 (lane 8) retained the binding activity, but a fragment from 36 to 90 (lane 9) lost almost all of the binding ability. Two fragments that contained the carboxyl-terminal region but lacked the amino-terminal end (lanes 6 and 7) did not bind to MCM2. These results suggest that the region of amino acid residues 26–67 is required for binding to MCM2. Consistent with these results, a fragment from 26 to 67 was capable of binding to MCM2 (lane 10). Mouse MCM2 proteins are localized in nuclei when they are expressed in COS cells (11Kimura H. Ohtomo T. Yamaguchi M. Ishi A. Sugimoto K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 977-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting that MCM2 contains a nuclear localization signal. Two regions that may be required for the nuclear localization of MCM2 were found in the amino-terminal region; one region is amino acid residues 18–34 where a bipartite-type nuclear localization signal (36Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar) is present, and another region is amino acid residues 118–152 where positively charged amino acid residues are highly concentrated (Fig. 4). To determine the region required for nuclear localization of MCM2, two DNA constructs producing deletion mutants of MCM2 proteins as GFP fusion proteins were prepared and transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 6). Full size MCM2 (Fig. 6 A) as well as the MCM2 that was deleted from the amino terminus to amino acid residue 92 (Fig.6 C) were localized to the nucleus. However, the mutant MCM2 deleted from the amino terminus to amino acid residue 153 was not concentrated in the nucleus; they were localized uniformly throughout the cells (Fig. 6 E). A nuclear localization signal from SV40 T antigen was ligated to the mutant MCM2-GFP fusion protein (Δ1–153). This fusion protein was localized to the nucleus (Fig.6 G). These results suggest that the second region from amino acid residues 118 to 152 is capable of localizing MCM2 to nucleus. We reported the results suggesting that the human MCM protein complex containing MCM4, -6, and -7 has both DNA helicase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities (20Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). When MCM protein complexes were fractionated by glycerol gradient centrifugation, these activities were detected in the 350-kDa fraction, where MCM2 protein was almost absent, but a main peak of the four MCM proteins was detected at a position of 230 kDa (Fig.7, A and C) (20Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). When MCM proteins in the gradient fraction were electrophoresed in native agarose gel, two major complexes of approximately 450 and 600 kDa were detected (Fig. 7 B). The amounts of the 600-kDa complex in the gradient fractions were almost proportional to the DNA helicase activity (Fig. 7, B and C). These results suggest that MCM4, -6, and -7 form a hexamer and function as a DNA helicase, as previously suggested (20Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Two complexes of similar sizes were also detected on SDS-polyacrylamide gel after protein cross-linking (20Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Correlation between the amounts of the 600-kDa complex and DNA helicase activity was more clearly observed when the complex was detected on SDS-polyacrylamide gel after protein cross-linking, which is probably due to the fact that composition of MCM complexes is slightly changed during native gel electrophoresis. The results in Fig. 7 also indicated that DNA helicase activity was mainly detected in the fractions lacking MCM2. Therefore, it was possible that MCM2 protein can inhibit the DNA helicase activity by the MCM4, -6, and -7 protein complex. Histidine-tagged mouse MCM2, purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, was added to a DNA helicase reaction containing purified MCM4, -6, and -7 complex (fractions near 350 kDa were pooled). By adding an almost stoichiometrical amount of MCM2, the DNA helicase activity was severely inhibited (only 12% of the activity was detected) (Fig. 8 A). In contrast, His-MCM2 had no inhibitory effect on the DNA helicase activity of SV40 T antigen and mouse DNA helicase B (37Seki M. Enomoto T. Yanagisawa J. Hanaoka F. Ui M. Biochemistry. 1988; 34: 1766-1771Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (data not shown). His-MCM2 itself did not exhibit DNA helicase activity. As shown in Fig. 8 B, a 600-kDa complex was mainly detected in the purified MCM4, -6, and -7 complex, although complexes of smaller molecular mass were also detected, which is probably due to the presence of a small amount of human MCM2 in this fraction. The addition of His-MCM2 prevented the formation of the 600-kDa complex and increased the number of smaller molecular mass complexes. A weak band of about 400 kDa was detected in the presence of His-MCM2 only (data not shown). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of MCM2 on the DNA helicase activity was correlated with the ability of MCM2 to disassemble the 600-kDa complex. To examine this correlation further, the fraction that mainly contains the MCM4, -6, and -7 complex was incubated with or without MCM2 and then the mixture was separated by glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig.9). Without adding MCM2, the DNA helicase activity was detected in the fractions 3–5 (near 350 kDa) (Fig.9 C, left) where MCM4, -6, and -7 co-sedimented (Fig.9 A, left), and a 600-kDa complex was mainly detected in native gel (Fig. 9 B, left). After incubation with MCM2, however, MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 were mainly detected at the position of 230 kDa (Fig. 9 A, right) where a 450-kDa complex was mainly detected in native gel (Fig. 9 B, right). The DNA helicase activity was not detected in these fractions (Fig. 9 C, right). When MCM2 was incubated in the absence of the MCM4, -6, and -7 complex and then centrifuged, it was detected in a broad region of the gradient fractions, but the peak was detected at fractions 2–4 (data not shown). These results suggest that MCM2 specifically inhibits the DNA helicase activity of MCM4, -6, and -7 by preventing the formation of the hexamer.Figure 9Disassembly of MCM4, -6, and -7 hexamers with MCM2. A, MCM4, -6, and -7 complex (fractions 3–5in Fig. 7) containing approximately 7 μg of total proteins was incubated with or without His-MCM2 (4.2 μg) in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 0.01% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 37 °C, and then the mixture was separated by glycerol gradient centrifugation. Proteins in fractions 2–8 were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and were stained with silver. Ferritin and catalase sedimented at fractions 2 and 5, respectively. Presence or absence of MCM2 during incubation is indicated by +/− at the top. B, fractions were concentrated to approximately 10-fold. Protein complexes of the concentrated sample were analyzed by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions. As markers, thyroglobulin and ferritin were electrophoresed, and proteins were stained with silver. C, DNA helicase activity of the concentrated sample was examined. In the left-end lane, DNA helicase activity in the absence of the sample was measured. Presence or absence of MCM2 is indicated at the bottom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results indicate that a highly charged region near the amino terminus of MCM2, which is unique among the six MCM proteins, has an affinity for histone, and this region interacts with an amino-terminal half region of H3 histone in vitro. This highly charged region of MCM2 is present from yeast to mammals. We showed that MCM2 can inhibit the DNA helicase activity of the human MCM4, -6, and -7 complex. Thus, MCM2 may play a different role from that of the other MCMs in the initiation of DNA replication. A region required for the nuclear localization of MCM2 was mapped near the histone-binding domain. These findings seem to be correlated with the finding that the DNA-binding domains of transcription factors are located near their nuclear localization signal (38LaCasse E.C. Lefebvre Y.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). MCM4, -6, and -7 do not have a typical nuclear localization signal. Consistently, Kimuraet al. (11Kimura H. Ohtomo T. Yamaguchi M. Ishi A. Sugimoto K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 977-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown that mouse MCM2 proteins, which are expressed in COS cells, are localized to nucleus, but MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins are not. In the same experiments, it has also been shown that co-expressing MCM6 with MCM2 localizes MCM6 to the nucleus. MCM2 can be isolated from cell extracts in a complex with MCM4, -6, and -7 (13Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Schulte D. Richter A. Burkhart R. Musahl C. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Holthoff H.P. Hameister H. Knippers R. Genomics. 1996; 37: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, MCM2 may carry MCM4, -6, and -7 to nucleus in vivo. MCM protein complexes containing MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 have been purified by histone-Sepharose column chromatography (16Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The results of this study suggest that the MCM protein complexes containing these four MCM proteins bind to histone-Sepharose through the interaction of MCM2 protein with histone H3. A major peak of MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 was detected at the position of 230 kDa in glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig. 7 A and Ref. 20Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), suggesting that they form dimers. However, a 450-kDa complex was mainly detected in the same position, which was analyzed by native agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.7 B) and also in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after cross-linking (20Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). When the MCM proteins in the position of 230 kDa were chemically cross-linked and then separated by glycerol gradient centrifugation, the resultant 450-kDa complex, which was detected on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, sedimented at the position of 230 kDa (data not shown). Therefore, it is probable that MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 detected at the position of 230 kDa form a heterotetramer. A portion of MCM4, -6, and -7 may be separated from MCM2 during elution from the histone-Sepharose column, and the separated MCM4, -6, and -7 mainly form a hexamer of 600 kDa, which sedimented at the position of 350 kDa in glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig. 7 B and Ref. 20Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). It is possible that two of the separated MCM4, -6, and -7 trimers are assembled into a hexamer during these processes. We previously suggested that the hexamer of MCM4, -6, and -7 exhibits both DNA helicase and ATPase activities (20Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Here, we show that MCM2 inhibits both the DNA helicase activity and the formation of MCM4, -6, and -7 hexamers (Figs. 8 and 9). These results support the notion that the MCM4, -6, and -7 hexamer of 600 kDa exhibits DNA helicase activity and also suggest a possibility that MCM2 protein plays a regulatory role in the DNA helicase activity of the MCM4, -6, and -7 complex. By adding MCM2, the 600-kDa hexamer of MCM4, -6, and -7 was converted to the 450-kDa complex containing MCM2, and DNA helicase activity was not detected in this complex (Fig. 9). These results are consistent with the notion that the 450-kDa complex is a heterotetramer consisting of MCM2, -4, -6, and -7. Other smaller complexes of approximately 400 kDa slightly increased in the presence of MCM2 (Fig. 8 B), and one of these complexes may be a trimer of MCM4, -6, and -7, which was separated from the hexamer. The system where MCM2 regulates DNA helicase activity of the MCM4, -6, and -7 complex seems to be similar to the λ replication system (39Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7047-7050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, λP proteins bring dnaB helicase to the λ replication origin which is occupied by λO. Since λP proteins inhibit the dnaB helicase activity, they must be removed from the origin with the assistance of the heat-shock proteins DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE. MCM2 may be released from the MCM4, -6, and -7 complex to activate its DNA helicase activity at the onset of DNA replication. Cdk2/cyclin and/or Cdc7/Dbf4 protein kinases, both of which are required for the initiation of DNA replication (reviewed in Ref. 40Jallepalli P. Kelly T.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) may phosphorylate MCM2 to remove it from the MCM4, -6, and -7 protein complex. The finding that a mutant of MCM5 (bob-1) bypasses the requirement for Cdc7 kinase in S. cerevisiae (41Hardy C.F.J. Oryga O. Seematter S. Pahl P.M.B. Sclafani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3151-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) seems to be consistent with this notion. The region containing the bob-1 mutation is evolutionarily conserved in MCM2 and MCM4 as well as MCM5. Recently, Lei et al. (42Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.-K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) have reported that MCM2 in addition to MCM3, -4, and -6 can be phosphorylated by Cdc7/Dbf4 in vitro. Since the affinity of MCM2 for histone H3 is high, a structural change of the nucleosome may cause MCM2 to bind H3 histone in the chromatin, which may concomitantly result in the release of the MCM4, -6, and -7 protein complex. A third possibility is that newly synthesized H3 histone may remove MCM2 from the chromatin. This correlates with the findings that histone synthesis precedes DNA synthesis during the cell cycle (43Hereford L.M. Osley M.A. Ludwig J.R. McLaughlin C.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 367-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The region of H3 histone necessary for binding to MCM2 is amino acid residues 26–67 near the amino terminus. This region, which forms an α-helical structure (44Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.-C. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and is involved in histone-DNA binding in the nucleosome (45Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar), is required for cell growth in S. cerevisiae (46Mann R.K. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the regions of amino acid residues 1–30 and 50–70 of H3 histone are exposed at the surface of the nucleosome in solution, which was determined by binding of site-specific antibodies of H3 histone to the nucleosome and the chromatin (47Stemmer C. Briand J.-P. Muller S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The interaction between MCM2 protein and histone H3 is strong and specific, but the physiological significance of the interaction remains to be clarified. This interaction may be involved in the chromatin binding of MCM protein complexes before the initiation of DNA replication or in a structural change of the nucleosome at the initiation of DNA replication; alternatively, it may be required for the chromatin assembly process during DNA replication.

https://openalex.org/W2050043857,"A facilitated diffusion for glycerol is present in human erythrocytes. Glycerol transporters identified to date belong to the Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP) family of integral membrane proteins, and one of them, aquaporin-3 (AQP3), has been characterized in mammals. Using an antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to the rat AQP3 carboxyl terminus, we examined the presence of AQP3 in normal and Colton-null (aquaporin-1 (AQP1)-deficient) human erythrocytes. Three immunoreactive bands were detected on immunoblots of both normal and Colton-null red cells, very similar to the bands revealed in rat kidney, a material in which AQP3 has been extensively studied. By immunofluorescence, anti-AQP3 antibodies stained the plasma membranes of both normal and Colton-null erythrocytes. Glycerol transport was measured on intact erythrocytes by stopped-flow light scattering and on one-step pink ghosts by a rapid filtration technique. Glycerol permeability values, similar in both cell types, suggest that AQP1 does not represent the major path for glycerol movement across red blood cell membranes. Furthermore, pharmacological studies showed that Colton-null red cells remain sensitive to water and glycerol flux inhibitors, supporting the idea that another proteinaceous path, probably AQP3, mediates most of the glycerol movements across red cell membranes and represents part of the residual water transport activity found in AQP1-deficient red cells.

Human erythrocytes are highly permeable to water, urea, and glycerol (1Macey R.I. Farmer R.E.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 2Levitt D.G.

The existence of membrane proteins that facilitate water and solute movements in these cells has been postulated, but most of these proteins remain to be characterized. In 1992, Agre and co-workers identified a very abundant protein of the human red blood cell as the first water-selective channel that was named aquaporin-1 (AQP1) 1The abbreviations used are: AQP1, aquaporin-1; AQP3, aquaporin-3; MIP, Major IntrinsicProtein; Pf, osmotic water permeability coefficient; Pgly, glycerol permeability; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Co(a-b-), Colton-null; BSA, bovine serum albumin.

However, these cells are found to be residually permeable to water, suggesting the presence of additional, non-AQP1, water channels. The existence of a protein-mediated glycerol transport in erythrocytes has relied mostly on pharmacological evidence. In particular, inhibition of glycerol transport by sulfhydryl reagents, phloretin, and copper ions has been reported (1Macey R.I. Farmer R.E.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Due to the high permeability of AQP3 to glycerol, we hypothesized that AQP3, if expressed in human erythrocytes, could account for their facilitated glycerol permeability. Since AQP1 itself was previously suggested to transport glycerol (17Abrami L. Tacnet F. Ripoche P. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in our study we used red cells from an individual who does not express AQP1, associated to the Colton group antigens (18Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Zeidel M.L. Moulds J.J. Agre P. Science. 1994; 265: 1585-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We found no difference in glycerol transport between the normal and Colton-null (Co(a-b-)) red cells, suggesting that AQP1 does not constitute a major pathway for glycerol. By contrast, our immunological data demonstrate that AQP3 is expressed in both normal and Colton-null red cells. Pharmacological evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that AQP3 could account for the high glycerol permeability of these cells and that, in Colton-null erythrocytes, AQP3 could constitute a residual, mercury-sensitive pathway for water. Control and Co(a-b-) red cells (18Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Zeidel M.L. Moulds J.J. Agre P. Science. 1994; 265: 1585-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Institut National de Transfusion Sanguine (Paris, France). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against purified human AQP1 were raised as described previously (19Laizé V. Rousselet G. Verbavatz J.M. Berthonaud V. Gobin R. Roudier N. Abrami L. Ripoche P. Tacnet F.

The cells were then resuspended in the Carlsen buffer at a hematocrit of 1.5%, corresponding to ∼107cells/ml and directly used for stopped-flow experiments. Kinetics of red cell volume changes were followed at 26 °C, by 90° light scattering (λexc = 600 nm) using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (SFM3, Biologic, Claix, France). An emission wavelength > 500 nm was obtained by using a cut-on filter (Specivex, J526a). Cell osmotic water permeability was measured by mixing 100 μl of cells with an equal volume of a hyperosmotic solution of sucrose to produce a 100 mosm/kg H2O inwardly-directed osmotic gradient. Data from at least 10 time-courses were averaged and fitted to single exponential functions (k is the rate constant, in s−1) by using the Simplex procedure of the BIOKINE software (Biologic, France). The osmotic water permeability coefficient,Pf, in cm/s, was determined using the following equation (5Mathai J.C. Mori S. Smith B.L. Preston G.M. Mohandas N. Collins M. van Zijl P.C.M. Zeidel M.L. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1309-1313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), dV(t)/dt=(Pf)×(SAV)×(MVW)×[(Cin/V(t))−Cout]Equation 1 where V(t) is the relative red cell volume as a function of time, [SAV] is the red cell surface area to initial volume ratio, MVW is the molar volume of water (18 cm3/mol) and Cin and Cout (mol/cm3) are the initial concentrations of intracellular and extracellular solute. SAV was taken equal to 13,500 cm−1 (20Jay A.W. Biophys. J. 1975; 15: 205-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Theoretical kinetics were simulated for various arbitrary values of Pf and fitted by the BIOKINE software as single exponentials. The obtained calibration curve (Pf versus k) was used to determine Pf from the experimental kvalues. Time-courses of glycerol influx were performed by mixing the red cells with an equal volume of a hyperosmotic solution of glycerol to give an inwardly directed gradient of 100 mm. Glycerol uptake rates were estimated by single exponential fits as reported by Dix et al. (21Dix J. Ausiello D. Jung C. Verkman A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 821: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) for urea transport in red cells. To determine pharmacological features of glycerol transport in red blood cells, glycerol effluxes were performed in isoosmotic conditions, to avoid any initial water movement. A red cell suspension, equilibrated in Carlsen buffer complemented with 200 mmglycerol, was mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus to an equal volume of 200 mm sucrose in Carlsen buffer. After mixing, an outwardly-directed glycerol gradient of 100 mm was generated and glycerol efflux rates were estimated by single exponential fits. In inhibition studies, red cells were preincubated 10 min at room temperature in the presence of 0.1 mm CuSO4, 0.1 or 0.5 mm phloretin, or 0.2 mm DIDS, or 5 min with 0.5 mm HgCl2. The inhibitor was present in both the red cell suspension and the sucrose solution. Osmolalities were controlled using a Roebling osmometer. Results are means ± S.E. Statistics are calculated by Student's ttest. The hemoglobin-free erythrocyte ghosts were prepared by the method described by Ojcius (22Ojcius D.M. Toon M.R. Solomon A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 944: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed normal and Colton-null red cells were lysed in a hypotonic medium, 5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, containing 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membranes were resuspended in 5 mmNa2HPO4, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 mm glycerol, pH 8.0, at 108 ghosts/ml, and sealed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Glycerol effluxes were measured at 20 °C by a rapid filtration method (23Martial S. Ripoche P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Samples of 6 × 107 ghosts were loaded for 1 h with14C-glycerol (5 μCi/ml) and 3H-mannitol (5 μCi/ml). Mannitol was used as an impermeant intracellular marker, to quantify the ghosts retained on glass-fiber filters (Whatman GF/A). The filters were rinsed over a preset period of 500 ms to 10 s at a flow rate of 1 ml/s. The cold washout solution contained 100 mm raffinose instead of glycerol. The retained radioactivity (14C/3H) was quantified by liquid scintillation. Glycerol permeability coefficient (Pgly, in cm/s) was calculated from the rate constant of the exponential time course of glycerol efflux and from ghost surface area to initial volume ratio. Human and rat hemoglobin-free ghosts were prepared as described above. Purified human AQP1 was obtained as described previously (17Abrami L. Tacnet F. Ripoche P. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Bloodless rat kidney outer medulla was prepared according to Ecelbarger et al.(15Ecelbarger C.A. Terris J. Frindt G. Echevarria M. Marples D. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F663-F672PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration of the membrane fractions was measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay reagent kit. Five μg of membrane proteins and 0.6 μg of pure AQP1 were denatured at 65 °C for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and separated by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (NEN Life Science Products) and probed with the affinity-purified anti-AQP3 at approximately 0.25 μg/ml or the anti-AQP1 whole serum diluted 1:500. Controls were carried out by using the affinity-purified anti-AQP3 preabsorbed for 10 min with 0.2 mg/ml of immunizing peptide. Immunoreactive proteins were revealed by the ECL Western blotting technique (Enhanced ChemiLuminescence, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Erythrocytes washed in PBS were fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by PBS washes. After a 3-min centrifugation at 2000 × g, the cell pellet was infiltrated in PBS containing 2.3 msucrose. The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and 0.75 μm sections were cut on an ultracryomicrotome at −70 °C (Reichert Ultracut, Leica, Wien, Austria) and collected on Superfrost Plus glass slides. Adult Sprague-Dawley male rats were anesthetized (pentobarbital, 5 mg/100 g of body weight, intraperitoneally) and perfused with a fixative containing 7.1 mmNa2HPO4, 30.4 mmNaH2PO4, 75 mm lysine, 10 mm sodium periodate, and 2% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4). Kidneys were removed, sliced, and kept in fixative overnight at 4 °C, followed by extensive PBS washes. Tissue slices were infiltrated overnight in PBS containing 30% sucrose and frozen in liquid N2. Cryosections of 5 μm were cut on a cryostat (Leica) and collected on Superfrost Plus glass slides. The slides were incubated for 5 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA), followed by 1-h incubation in primary antibody (1:300 dilution of anti-AQP3 antiserum with or without preincubation of the serum with the peptide used for immunization, or 1:100 dilution of anti-AQP1 anti-serum) in PBS/BSA. The sections were then washed 3 × 10 min in PBS, followed by a 45-min incubation in CY3-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit antibodies (6 μg/ml) in PBS/BSA. The sections were washed 2 × 10 min in PBS and mounted for observation under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Vanox-T). Fig. 1 A shows results from immunoblots probed with affinity-purified antibodies raised against a rat AQP3 carboxyl-terminus peptide. In rat renal outer medulla (Fig. 1 A, lane 4), a characteristic profile of three stained bands was observed: one band at ∼25 kDa and two broader bands at 33–40 and >67 kDa. None of these bands was detected when the anti-AQP3 antibody was preabsorbed with the immunizing peptide (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). A similar profile with three stained bands was also observed in rat red cell membranes probed with the anti-AQP3 antibody (Fig. 1 A,lane 5), suggesting that, in addition to kidney, AQP3 was also expressed in rat erythrocytes. Again, no signal was detected when the anti-AQP3 was preincubated with the immunizing peptide (Fig.1 A, lane 2). Although the 26 amino acids of human AQP3 carboxyl terminus differ from those of rat by three residues, the anti-AQP3 antibody also recognized three bands in human normal ghosts (Fig. 1 A, lane 7): a faint 25-kDa band and two broad 37–48-kDa and >70-kDa bands. An identical signal was observed in Co(a-b-) ghosts (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). Similar to controls with rat membrane samples, no signal was detected in human red cells when the anti-AQP3 was first blocked by the immunizing peptide (Fig.1 A, lane 3). The anti-AQP3 antibody failed to recognize human AQP1 purified from red blood cells (Fig. 1 A,lane 8), thus confirming the specificity of anti-AQP3 antibodies. Most importantly, our results indicate that AQP3 is present in normal and Colton-null human red cells. Immunoblots were also carried out with an anti-human AQP1 whole serum (Fig. 1 B). A typical AQP1 profile was observed with purified AQP1 (lane 1) and normal human ghosts (lane 3). The lower band in the human AQP1 lane may correspond to a degraded form due to successive freezing/thawing of the sample. No signal was detected in Colton-null ghosts (lane 2), confirming the absence of AQP1 in these cells. These results indicate that the anti-AQP1 and anti-AQP3 antibodies do not cross-react in the various tissues tested. In experiments on human red blood cells, the anti-AQP3 serum strongly stained the plasma membranes of both normal (Fig. 2 a) and Colton-null cells (Figs. 2, c and d). No staining was observed when the antiserum was preincubated with the peptide used for immunization (Fig. 2 b, normal cells). In contrast, the polyclonal antiserum against purified AQP1 stained the plasma membranes of normal human red blood cells (Fig. 2 e) but not those of Colton-null cells (Fig. 2 f). In rat kidney, the anti-AQP3 antibodies recognized the basolateral plasma membranes of collecting duct principal cells (Fig. 2 g) but not those of adjacent intercalated cells (Fig. 2 g, arrowheads). Although no staining was observed in other cell types of the rat kidney nephron, as previously reported (16Frigeri A. Gropper M.A. Turck C.W. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4328-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), we also found staining of rat red blood cells (Fig. 2 h). Altogether, these results confirm the presence of AQP3 in both human (normal and Colton-null) and rat red blood cell membranes. Fig. 3 A shows a typical time course of osmotic shrinkage induced by a 100 mosm/kg H2O sucrose gradient, carried out with thawed normal and Colton-null red cells at 26 °C. Averaged Pf was (1.32 ± 0.09) × 10−2 cm/s and (2.16 ± 0.16) × 10−3 cm/s (n = 6) for normal and Co(a-b-), respectively. As previously reported (5Mathai J.C. Mori S. Smith B.L. Preston G.M. Mohandas N. Collins M. van Zijl P.C.M. Zeidel M.L. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1309-1313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the Pf values in Co(a-b-) cells were significantly lower than in normal cells. The stopped-flow technique also allows studying solute transport (21Dix J. Ausiello D. Jung C. Verkman A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 821: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Normal and Colton-null erythrocytes were submitted to an inward 100 mm glycerol gradient. In these conditions, the time course of red cell volume change was biphasic (Fig. 3 B). After the initial cell shrinkage due to water efflux, cells progressively recovered their initial volume as glycerol entered. Apparent rate constants of glycerol influxes at 26 °C were 0.12 ± 0.02 s−1 and 0.11 ± 0.01 s−1(n = 7) for normal and Colton-null, respectively. Thus, no significant difference in glycerol uptake rates was observed between the two cell types. However, this approach relies on concomitant glycerol and water flow, with the latter being possibly limiting in Colton-null cells. This prompted us to measure directly the red cell glycerol permeability (Pgly) using a tracer technique. Fig. 4 illustrates14C-glycerol effluxes from normal and Colton-null hemoglobin-free ghosts at 20 °C. CalculatedPgly was 1.4 × 10−6 cm/s for control and 1.6 × 10−6 cm/s for Co(a-b-) ghosts. These values are consistent with data in the literature (3Carlsen A. Wieth J.O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1976; 97: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Du J. Kleinhans F.W. Mazur P. Critser J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). They further indicate that the permeability to glycerol is not altered in Colton-null cells. Taken together, these results show that both normal and Colton-null red cells exhibit a glycerol transport capacity, which obviously, does not follow from AQP1 activity. The effects of transport inhibitors were tested on normal and Colton-null red cells using the stopped-flow technique. Glycerol effluxes were followed in isoosmotic conditions, to avoid initial water movements. Fig. 5shows the effects of 0.2 mm DIDS, 0.1 or 0.5 mmphloretin, 0.1 mm CuSO4, or 0.5 mmHgCl2 on glycerol (Fig. 5 A, normal; Fig.5 B, Co(a-b-)) and water (Fig. 5 C, normal; Fig.5 D, Co(a-b-)) efflux rates. DIDS inhibited the glycerol outflow from normal and Co(a-b-) cells by approximately 45%. It also reduced the rate of water efflux of both cell types, with a greater efficiency in Co(a-b-) erythrocytes. A large inhibition of glycerol transport in normal and Co(a-b-) red cells was observed in the presence of 0.1 mm (80 and 67% inhibition, respectively) and 0.5 mm phloretin (93 and 73% inhibition, respectively). In addition, phloretin markedly inhibited water transport in Colton-null erythrocytes, at the 2 concentrations tested (∼53% inhibition). CuSO4 significantly reduced the glycerol permeability of normal (69% inhibition) and Co(a-b-) (33% inhibition) red cells, and also strongly reduced the water permeability of Colton-null erythrocytes (60% inhibition). HgCl2 dramatically inhibited both glycerol and water transport in normal and Co(a-b-) erythrocytes. Percentages of inhibition of glycerol efflux were 75 and 72% for normal and Colton-null cells, respectively, and the water efflux was inhibited by 90% in normal and by 50% in Colton-null erythrocytes. This indicates the presence, in the latter, of a residual mercury-sensitive path for water. In conclusion, all the reagents inhibited glycerol transport in human normal and Colton-null red blood cells in a similar manner. In contrast, these molecules had differential effects on water transport in both cell genotypes. These data support the idea that the major path for water transport was disrupted in Colton-null cells while that for glycerol was not. AQP1 is the major water channel of human red blood cells. However, as we showed here and as previously reported (5Mathai J.C. Mori S. Smith B.L. Preston G.M. Mohandas N. Collins M. van Zijl P.C.M. Zeidel M.L. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1309-1313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), a significant mercury-sensitive part of osmotic water permeability remains in AQP1-knocked out (Colton-null) red cells. The existence of additional, non-AQP1, protein pathways for water transport has been discussed by Toon and Solomon (26Toon M.R. Solomon A.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Red blood cells also exhibit a high glycerol transport capacity, whose molecular bases have remained unknown. AQP3 is a mammalian aquaporin which, in addition to being moderately permeable to water, is highly permeable to glycerol and, to a lesser extent, to urea (11Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 12Ma T. Frigeri A. Hasegawa H. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21845-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Echevarria M. Windhager E.E. Frindt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25079-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the present work, we provide evidence that AQP3 is expressed in normal and Colton-null red cells and likely mediates not only the residual water transport, but also most of glycerol transport in human erythrocytes. Human AQP3 was detected by Western blotting in both normal and Colton-null red cells and exhibited a migration profile very similar to that of rat AQP3 in renal outer medulla and erythrocytes. The broad high molecular weight bands revealed in human tissues appeared slightly larger than those of rat tissues and may correspond to different glycosylation patterns. Indirect immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of AQP3 in the plasma membranes of normal and Colton-null cells. Interestingly, the presence in red blood cells of AQP1 and AQP3 constitutes a new example of aquaporin colocalization on the same plasma membrane. AQP3 and AQP4 were colocalized on the basolateral membrane of kidney collecting duct principal cells (16Frigeri A. Gropper M.A. Turck C.W. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4328-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). AQP1 and AQP7, another aquaporin permeable to glycerol (13Ishibashi K. Kuwahara M. Gu Y. Kageyama Y. Tohsaka A. Suzuki F. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), are colocalized in the kidney proximal tubule brush-border membrane (27Ishibashi K. Kuriyama R. Gu Y. Kuwahara M. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8 (abstr.): 18Google Scholar). AQP7 (13Ishibashi K. Kuwahara M. Gu Y. Kageyama Y. Tohsaka A. Suzuki F. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and AQP8 (28Ishibashi K. Kuwahara M. Kageyama Y. Tohsaka A. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) were both detected in rat testis. To investigate the relevance of AQP3-mediated transport in erythrocytes, we characterized glycerol transport in both normal and Colton-null red cells. For this purpose, two distinct methods were used. The rates of red cell volume changes were estimated by light-scattering stopped-flow experiments on intact cells submitted to an osmotic glycerol gradient. This technique, which requires small amounts of material, was particularly useful for the study of Colton-null cells, which are not easily available. However, stopped-flow light scattering measurements do not allow accurate calculations of solute permeability coefficients, because of uncertainties in red cell surface area changes and refractive index effects (2Levitt D.G. Mlekoday H.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Meyer M.M. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C549-C557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, we considered in these experiments only the shrinking or swelling rate constants related to glycerol movements. In a second type of experiment, the glycerol permeability was directly measured by a rapid filtration method using one-step pink ghosts equilibrated in 14C-glycerol. In this case, the Pgly can be calculated from the rate of radioactive glycerol efflux and was 1.4 and 1.6 × 10−6 cm/s in normal and Colton-null ghosts, respectively,i.e. in the range of already published values for human red blood cells (3Carlsen A. Wieth J.O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1976; 97: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Du J. Kleinhans F.W. Mazur P. Critser J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These values are higher than the Pgly of bovine red cells, lacking the facilitated diffusion mechanism for glycerol transport (30Mazur P. Leibo S.P. Miller R.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1974; 15: 107-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These values remain also 2 orders of magnitude lower than the Pf of Colton-null cells, indicating that, even in these cells, the rate of water flow was not limiting (29Meyer M.M. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C549-C557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both stopped-flow and tracer methods indicate a similar glycerol transport capacity in normal and AQP1-deficient red blood cells. This means that, in its native environment, AQP1 does not constitute a major pathway for glycerol. We previously reported that AQP1 itself had a small glycerol permeability (17Abrami L. Tacnet F. Ripoche P. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the glycerol transport capacity of AQP1, estimated after expression in Xenopus oocytes, is much lower than that of AQP3, 2N. Roudier, unpublished data. and may therefore not be detectable in the intact red cell membrane. The unitary Pgly of the bacterial GlpF is 2 × 105 molecules/s (31Heller K. Lin E. Wilson T. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 274-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If we assume that the unitaryPgly of AQP3 is in the same range, the number of AQP3 copies that account for Pgly in erythrocytes would be around 15,000, i.e. at least ten times lower than the number of AQP1 in these cells (32Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhadja F.P. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15634-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, AQP1 appears to have a higher unitary Pf than AQP3. This, with its higher abundance, explains why AQP1 dominates water transport in the red blood cell membrane. A pharmacological characterization of glycerol and water transport was performed in normal and Colton-null red cells. All the reagents tested exerted similar inhibitory effects on glycerol transport in normal and Colton-null red cells, confirming the idea that a protein, distinct of AQP1, mediates most of glycerol transport in the red cell membrane. Some of the inhibitors tested can have unspecific membrane effects (33Jennings M. Solomon A.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and indeed, their use may be controversial. In particular, Maet al. (12Ma T. Frigeri A. Hasegawa H. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21845-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not observe any inhibitory effect of 0.2 mm DIDS on glycerol transport in human erythrocytes. In contrast, an inhibition of water transport by DIDS has been reported by Toon and Solomon (34Toon M.R. Solomon A.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 99: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in human red blood cells. In our experiments, DIDS was inhibitory both on glycerol and water effluxes. Copper was found to affect the glycerol transport, as already described (3Carlsen A. Wieth J.O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1976; 97: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and also the water transport in an unexplained fashion. Both mercury and phloretin have been shown to alter water transport in AQP3-injected oocytes (11Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 14Echevarria M. Windhager E.E. Frindt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25079-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). HgCl2 had the strongest inhibitory effects, suggesting that this reagent blocked the protein-mediated pathways for both water and glycerol transport. Phloretin markedly inhibited the residual water transport of the Colton-null cells, further supporting the hypothesis that AQP3 could be the phloretin-sensitive water channel of these AQP1-deficient cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate the presence of functional AQP3 in the human red cell membrane, which can account for the glycerol permeability of these cells and the residual water permeability of AQP1-deficient erythrocytes. Our findings may help explain the lack of clinical defects in Colton-null patients (18Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Zeidel M.L. Moulds J.J. Agre P. Science. 1994; 265: 1585-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). While AQP1 transports mostly water, the significance of AQP3 expression in red blood cells may reside in its ability to transport solutes. However, the role devoted to a glycerol transporter in erythrocytes is not elucidated. In contrast to testis or liver, where an important metabolism of glycerol has been described (13Ishibashi K. Kuwahara M. Gu Y. Kageyama Y. Tohsaka A. Suzuki F. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 35vom Dahl S. Haussinger D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G563-G574PubMed Google Scholar), glycerol appears not to be metabolized by erythrocytes. The presence of a glycerol facilitator in red cells could make them less susceptible to osmotic stress upon local exposure to high glycerol concentrations. A similar hypothesis has been advanced by Macey (36Macey R. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C195-C203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who suggested that the high urea permeability of human red blood cells could protect these cells when they reach the deeper regions of the renal medulla. AQP3 can also transport urea to some extent and yet to be discovered solutes that can be important for the red cell osmoregulation. Also, the possibility that a glycerol facilitator serves physiologically for another purpose should not be dismissed. We are very grateful to Dr. Pascal Bailly (Institut National de Transfusion Sanguine, Paris) for generously providing us with the Colton-null phenotype human red blood cells and for helpful discussions. We also thank Dr. Jean Labarre (Service de Biochimie et Génétique Moléculaire, CEA/Saclay) for providing radiolabeled 14C-glycerol.

We also thank our colleague Dr. Germain Rousselet for helpful discussions and suggestions and Dr. Florent Guillain for advice in stopped-flow experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1974985398,"Gel mobility shift analysis was utilized to investigate the molecular function of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) ligands in the binding of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) to mouse osteopontin and rat osteocalcin vitamin D-response elements (VDREs). At physiological ionic strength and reduced concentrations of expressed proteins, efficient binding to either VDRE occurs as a VDR·RXR heterodimer, not as a VDR homodimer. 1,25-(OH)2D3 dramatically enhances heterodimer-VDRE interaction, whereas somewhat higher concentrations of 9-cis-RA inhibit this association, perhaps related to the role of this retinoid in facilitating RXR homodimer formation. Interestingly, if VDR is occupied by 1,25-(OH)2D3 prior to complexing with RXR, the resulting heterodimer is relatively resistant to dissociation and diversion to other pathways by 9-cis-RA. Therefore, a proposed molecular action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 is to generate an allosteric switch in VDR to a form that not only binds to the VDRE with high affinity and specificity as a heterodimer with RXR, but also interacts with the RXR partner to conformationally restrict the action of its cognate ligand. Gel mobility shift analysis was utilized to investigate the molecular function of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) ligands in the binding of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) to mouse osteopontin and rat osteocalcin vitamin D-response elements (VDREs).

The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3), 1The abbreviations used are: 1,25-(OH)2D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; VDR, vitamin D receptor; VDRE, vitamin D response element; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; m, mouse; h, human; 9-cis-RA, 9-cis-retinoic acid; BEVS, baculovirus expression vector system; CRBP II, cellular retinol-binding protein II; RXRE, retinoid X receptor response element; ROC, rat osteocalcin; MOP, mouse osteopontin. exerts its hormonal effects predominantly on intestine, bone, and kidney, where it plays a crucial role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis, bone mineralization, and the prevention of rickets (1Haussler M.R.

Rev. 1992; 13: 719-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such as those of the bone marrow/immune system, where it has been reported to be involved in a wide variety of differentiation processes (3Reichel H.

The cellular responses to 1,25-(OH)2D3 are mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (1Haussler M.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Komm B.S. Terpening C.M. Yamaoka K. Allegretto E.A. Baker A.R. Shine J.

Transcriptional control of specific 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive genes is achieved by binding of the receptor, via its DNA binding domain, to a specific vitamin D-response element (VDRE) located in the 5′ promoter region of the regulated gene. VDREs have been identified in positively controlled genes such as human and rat osteocalcin (6Ozono K. Liao J. Kerner S.A. Scott R.A. Pike J.W. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2410-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and comparison of these sequences indicates that they generally consist of a hexanucleotide direct repeat with a spacer of three nucleotides (DR+3). In many studies with natural DR+3 VDREs, VDR has been reported to bind as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (reviewed in Ref.13Haussler M.R. Haussler C.A. Jurutka P.W. Thompson P.D. Hsieh J.-C. Remus L.S. Selznick S.H. Whitfield G.K. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 154: S57-S73Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) also form RXR-containing heterodimers on positively controlled DR+4 and DR+5 response elements, respectively (14Zechel C. Shen X.-Q. Chen J.-Y. Chen Z.-P. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Evidence has been provided, however, implying that VDR may also bind as a homodimer to certain DR+3 elements, primarily those containing the osteopontin-like half-site, AGTTCA (15Freedman L.P. Arce V. Fernandez R.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Nishikawa J. Kitaura M. Matsumoto M. Imagawa M. Nishihara T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2902-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition to this issue of VDR homodimeric binding to VDREs, controversy exists as to the precise molecular role (if any) of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in VDR·RXR heterodimer (or homodimer) formation and DNA binding. 1,25-(OH)2D3 has been proposed to elicit high affinity association of the VDR with its heterodimeric partner (17Sone T. Kerner S. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23296-23305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Kimmel-Jehan C. Jehan F. DeLuca H.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as well as induce a conformational change in VDR·RXR inferred from an increase in the mobility of the VDR·RXR·VDRE complex (8MacDonald P.N. Haussler C.A. Terpening C.M. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18808-18813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies indicated that the presence of both RXR and 1,25-(OH)2D3 is required for optimal binding of VDR to a DR+3 from the osteocalcin VDRE (19MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Haussler C.A. Ozato K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5907-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and to a 24-OHase VDRE (20Ohyama Y. Ozono K. Uchida M. Shinki T. Kato S. Suda T. Yamamoto O. Noshiro M. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10545-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been proposed that initial VDR·RXR DNA interaction occurs in a ligand-independent fashion (21Ross T.K. Darwish H.M. Moss V.E. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9257-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Still another variation was postulated by Freedman and co-workers (22Cheskis B. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), in which the role of 1,25-(OH)2D3 was hypothesized to be the dissociation of the DNA-bound homodimer by decreasing the rate of conversion of DNA-bound monomer to homodimer, and ultimately promoting the formation of a DNA-bound VDR·RXR heterodimer. There are also conflicting experimental data on the role played by 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), the cognate ligand for RXR, in the binding and transcriptional regulation of 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive genes by the VDR·RXR heterodimer. 9-cis-RA has been observed to repress the 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent accumulation of osteocalcin mRNA in osteoblast-like ROS 17/2.8 cells (19MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Haussler C.A. Ozato K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5907-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Further analysis of VDRE binding in mobility shift assays (19MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Haussler C.A. Ozato K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5907-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) demonstrated that heterodimeric interactions between VDR and RXR were enhanced by 1,25-(OH)2D3, and were inhibited by high concentrations of 9-cis-RA, consistent with the observation that RXR-specific ligands can induce RXR homodimer formation in solution (23Zhang X. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment of a variety of transfected cell types with both 1,25-(OH)2D3and 9-cis-RA was reported to enhance the expression of an osteopontin VDRE-linked reporter gene over levels observed with 1,25-(OH)2D3 alone (24Carlberg C.

J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 12: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). An apparent synergistic co-stimulation by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 9-cis-RA in transfection systems employing AGGTCA synthetic DR+3 constructs has also been reported (26Sasaki H. Harada H. Honda Y. Morino H. Suzawa M. Shimpo E. Katsumata T. Masuhiro Y. Matsuda K. Ebihara K. Ono T. Masushige S. Kato S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Kato S. Sasaki H. Suzawa M. Masushige S. Tora L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5858-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and in at least one instance, 9-cis-RA was observed to have no effect on 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated transcription (28Ferrara J. McCuaig K. Hendy G.N. Uskokovic M. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2971-2981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the wide range of cell types (insect to mammalian) utilized in these transfection studies plus the untold effects of variable receptor/coreceptor expression, as well as different levels of reporter plasmid, it is difficult to interpret the general significance of these findings. Therefore, to define at the biochemical level how 1,25-(OH)2D3, VDR, RXR and DNA interact ultimately to stimulate the transcription of hormone-responsive genes, the following three areas of conflicting experimental data were addressed: (i) the relative importance of VDR homodimerversus VDR·RXR heterodimer binding to DR+3 VDREs, including elements consisting of osteopontin half-sites; (ii) the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on VDR binding to RXR or VDR·RXR binding to DNA; and (iii) the role, if any, of 9-cis-RA on VDR·RXR DNA binding. To resolve these issues, we have utilized an electrophoretic mobility shift assay system that includes physiological salt and limited receptor concentrations to investigate the effects of cognate ligands on possible VDR homodimer and VDR·RXR heterodimer binding to their target response elements. The human RXRα (hRXRα), murine RXRβ (mRXRβ), and hVDR cDNAs were incorporated into a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) as described previously (8MacDonald P.N. Haussler C.A. Terpening C.M.

All recombinant baculoviruses were isolated and plaque-purified using standard procedures (29Summers M. Smith G.E. A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vector and Insect Cell Culture Procedures. Texas Agriculture Experimental Station, Texas A & M University, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar), then used to infect Sf9 cultures (Spodoptera frugiperda ovary cells). After 48 h, whole cell extracts were prepared by sonication in KETZD-0.3 (0.3m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.3 mm zinc acetate, 5 mmdithiothreitol), followed by centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 30 min. Supernatants containing hVDR, hRXRα, or mRXRβ were enriched to at least 70% purity by blue dextran Sepharose chromatography as described in detail for VDR (8MacDonald P.N. Haussler C.A.

Human RXRα was also expressed in Escherichia coli and enriched to approximately 70% purity as described previously (30Hsieh J.-C. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Jurutka P.W. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K.

Klenow enzyme was purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Poly(dI-dC) was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the respective hormone response elements were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Double-stranded versions of each of the tested response elements (direct repeat hexanucleotides are underlined) with HindIII overhangs (lowercase) were created by annealing the following single-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides together with their complements (not shown). For the mouse osteopontin VDRE (9Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prahl J. DeLuca H.F. Denhardt D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The double-stranded oligomers were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of ≥108cpm/μg as described by Nakajima et al. (35Nakajima S. Hsieh J.-C. MacDonald P.N. Galligan M.A. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Previous VDR·RXR gel shift protocols were altered to reduce concentrations of receptors to approximate physiologic levels. Accordingly, hVDR (10–100 ng = 5–50 nm) was added to a mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, 1 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI·dC), followed immediately by an amount of RXRα or RXRβ equivalent to that of hVDR. Prior to the addition of receptor(s), 1,25-(OH)2D3 was added to the reaction mixture in ethanol vehicle to give a final ligand concentration of 10−10 to 10−5m. In experiments that involved the additional inclusion of 9-cis-RA (10−10 to 10−5m), ethanol vehicle controls were included and the binding portion of the reaction (45 min at 22 °C) was shielded from light. One μl of radioactively labeled DNA probe (containing 0.5 ng DNA, or approximately 0.8 nm, and 50,000–100,000 cpm) was added to give a final volume of 40 μl, then incubated for an additional 30 min. Thereafter, the entire reaction was subjected to nondenaturing electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. The dried gels were used to expose Kodak X-Omat film at −70 °C. The results of a number of assays were quantitated by densitometric analysis using an Apple OneScanner with Ofoto™ scanning software developed by Light Source, Inc. A protocol identical to that described immediately above was utilized for the homodimeric association of RXRβ with the CRBP II RXRE, except that 9-cis-RA was substituted for 1,25-(OH)2D3 and no VDR was included. Finally, a separate set of experiments was carried out in which the order of addition of each of the receptors and their respective ligands to the reaction mixture was varied, with the total time of each reaction, including preincubation of receptor(s) with ligand, heterodimer formation, and DNA binding, not exceeding 110 min. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% newborn calf serum. Log phase cultures were harvested by trypsinization and collected by centrifugation at room temperature for 10 min at 1000 × g, followed by washing in five volumes of phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The nuclear extract was then prepared as described previously (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar), with all steps performed at 4 °C. Fig.1 A depicts a gel mobility shift experiment using the mouse osteopontin (MOP) VDRE and baculovirus-expressed VDR in the presence and absence of hRXRα or mRXRβ (20 ng of each receptor). At limiting concentrations, neither the VDR alone (lanes 1 and 2) nor RXR alone (data not shown) (35Nakajima S. Hsieh J.-C. MacDonald P.N. Galligan M.A. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) produce an observable DNA binding complex either in the absence or presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3. The only major DNA binding complex observed in this experiment is that produced by incubation of VDR plus either RXRα or RXRβ, and, by densitometric analysis, this complex is enhanced 23-fold in the presence of hormone (compare lane 3 to lane 4, and lane 7 to lane 8). The average degree of binding enhancement elicited by 1,25-(OH)2D3observed from more than 30 such experiments carried out at limiting receptor concentrations was 20-fold, although effects of ligand apparently as low as 2.5-fold have been recorded (see Fig. 4). The hormone effect is selective for 1,25-(OH)2D3, since the relatively inactive natural vitamin D metabolite 24(R)-25-(OH)2D3, its epimer, 24(S)-25-(OH)2D3, as well as the 25-(OH)D3, 1α-(OH)D3, and vitamin D3 hormone precursors, do not enhance DNA-binding complexes at 10−8m (data not shown). The hormone-stimulated, heterodimeric bands seen in lanes 4 and 8, are eliminated (lanes 5 and 9) by inclusion of the VDR-specific monoclonal antibody 9A7, which recognizes an epitope within the DNA binding domain. Moreover, the addition of an RXRα-specific polyclonal antibody (lane 6) caused a majority of the complex to supershift, confirming the presence of RXRα in the complex. Interestingly, the RXRβ-specific monoclonal antibody MOK 13.17 (lane 10) showed little interaction with the VDR·RXRβ DNA binding complex. As discussed below, the MOK 13.17 antibody may not be able to access its epitope when RXRβ is heterodimerized with VDR.Figure 4Limiting concentrations of VDR bind to VDREs as a heterodimer rather than as a homodimer. Standard gel mobility shift assays were carried out on two different VDREs (0.5 ng) using the indicated amounts of receptors. Each receptor combination was tested in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Note that, as observed in Fig.1 B and 3 A, and discussed under “Results,” a second, faster migrating DNA complex appears with mRXRβ, which likely represents a species composed of VDR and truncated mRXRβ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 1 B depicts complexes formed on the rat osteocalcin (ROC) VDRE by hVDR in combination with baculovirus-expressed mRXRβ. These heterodimeric DNA binding species are consistently less intense than complexes formed on the MOP VDRE, but an enhancing effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 is still apparent (12-fold by densitometry of lane 2 versus lane 1). It should be noted that two heterodimeric complexes are observed (Fig. 1 B) with some preparations of mRXRβ, presumably because of a second methionine translational start site present in the mRXRβ cDNA that leads to the production of two alternative forms of RXRβ protein. The occurrence of RXRβ in these complexes is confirmed by the appearance of a strong supershifted band in the presence of RXRβ-specific polyclonal antibody (lane 3), although non-shifted complexes appear to be stabilized by the inclusion of the proteinaceous antibody preparation. Fig. 1 C shows one of three replicate experiments examining the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the binding to the MOP VDRE of endogenous VDR and its presumed RXR partner in a rat osteoblast-like (ROS 17/2.8) cell nuclear extract. Using 3.0 μg of protein extract per reaction, the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 consistently and repeatedly facilitates a 2–3-fold increase in the binding of the endogenous VDR and RXR to the MOP VDRE. Specific inhibition of this complex by VDR antibody (lane 3) confirms the occurrence of VDR in this complex. Hence, in a natural situation (Fig. 1 C), efficient association of endogenous VDR with DNA displays a requirement for the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3, although the magnitude of ligand-enhanced complex formation does not attain that seen with enriched receptors (Fig. 1 A). Fig.2 depicts one of three replicate experiments testing the influence of different concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on VDR·RXR binding to the MOP (Fig. 2 A) or ROC (Fig. 2 B) VDRE. Binding to the MOP VDRE (Fig. 2 A) exhibits a maximum at 10−5m 1,25-(OH)2D3, diminishing to a minimal but significant enhancement at 10−10m1,25-(OH)2D3. The ROC VDRE (Fig. 2 B) displays a slightly different pattern with an optimum at 10−6m hormone, followed by a more gradual decrease in binding as the ligand concentration is lowered. Densitometric scanning of these two gels, however, revealed that the ED50 of 1,25-(OH)2D3 for both VDREs was approximately 10−9m, representing a 13-fold increase in receptor heterodimer binding to the ROC VDRE and a 15-fold increase on the MOP element. Accordingly, the concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 chosen for most subsequent experiments were either 10−9 or 10−8m. Labeled MOP VDRE was incubated with VDR and RXRβ in the absence and presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3, followed by inclusion of a 100-fold excess of competing unlabeled MOP VDRE at time zero. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the presence of ligand not only greatly potentiates initial (time 0) DNA binding, as seen previously, but also results in an apparent slower rate of dissociation of the heterodimeric receptor complex from the labeled response element. Densitometric analysis of this experiment (Fig.3 B) indicates that the liganded VDR·RXR complex exhibits a half-life of ≥11 min (by extrapolation), whereas the unliganded VDR·RXR heterodimer dissociates with an estimated half-life of only 3.0 min. The experiment depicted in Fig.4 was performed using both 20 ng and 100 ng of VDR, to determine if homodimeric binding, which was not observable using limiting receptor concentrations (Fig. 1 A), could be elicited at receptor concentrations significantly in excess of physiologic levels. On the weaker ROC response element (Fig. 4,left panel), neither 20 ng (lanes 1 and 2) nor 100 ng (lanes 3 and 4) of VDR exhibited any observable monomeric or homodimeric DNA binding species, even in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3. We have previously observed VDR homodimer binding to the ROC VDRE at very high VDR amounts of 260 ng (35Nakajima S. Hsieh J.-C. MacDonald P.N. Galligan M.A. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but the stability of such VDRE complexes is quite minimal, with an apparent half-life of less than 0.5 min when assayed in a mobility shift dissociation assay similar to that shown in Fig. 3. 2P. N. MacDonald and M. R. Haussler, unpublished observation. On the stronger MOP response element (Fig. 4, right panel), 100 ng of VDR produced a faint DNA binding complex, apparently corresponding to a homodimeric species (lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, by densitometric analysis, the putative homodimeric binding seen in lane 3 (right panel) displayed virtually no enhancement (1.3-fold) in the presence of hormone (lane 4 versus lane 3). As a positive control in these experiments, 20 ng of VDR in combination with 20 ng of RXRβ produced DNA binding heterodimeric species on the ROC and MOP VDREs which were enhanced by ligand 10-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 4, lane 6 versus lane 5 in each panel). At higher, nonphysiological amounts (100 ng of each receptor), however, the binding of this heterodimeric species was not significantly enhanced (1.3-fold for both ROC and MOP) by the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Fig. 4, lane 8 versus lane 7 in each panel). 9-cis-RA reportedly can augment the DR+1 binding efficiency of RXRα produced by in vitro transcription/translation, although no RXR ligand effect was observed with receptor produced in E. coli, Sf9, or COS-1 cells (37Chen Z.P. Shemshedini L. Durand B. Noy N. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we probed the possible influence of 9-cis-RA on the binding of RXR homodimers to a natural RXRE, a DR+1 element from the rat CRBP II gene (34Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Using our conditions of reduced amounts of receptor and physiological salt concentrations, binding of BEVS mRXRβ (40 ng) as a homodimer to the CRBP II RXRE was enhanced 16-fold by the presence of 10−6m9-cis-RA (Fig. 5 A,lane 2 versus lane 1). Although it was noted in Fig.1 A that the MOK 13.17 RXRβ antibody had relatively little effect on VDR·RXRβ binding to a VDRE, an apparent stabilization as well as robust supershift of the DNA-bound, unliganded, and ligand-enhanced RXR homodimeric species by this antibody was observed (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, RXRβ appears to be more accessible to the MOK 13.17 antibody when configured in its homodimeric form than when it exists in a heterodimer with VDR. As expected, the ligand-dependent RXR homodimer complex with the RXRE was neither inhibited nor supershifted in the presence of a VDR antibody (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5 and 6). Fig. 5 B depicts the RXRE binding displayed by E. coli-expressed hRXRα in the presence of varying concentrations of 9-cis-RA. At concentrations of 10−5, 10−6, and 10−7m, the presence of 9-cis-RA enhances homodimeric binding to the RXRE 5.1-, 4.0-, and 1.4-fold, respectively, as determined by densitometric scanning. Having demonstrated that, under our conditions, 9-cis-RA can facilitate RXR homodimerization, we next addressed the question of its influence on RXR·VDR heterodimers. As expected, 10−9m 1,25-(OH)2D3 effectively promotes VDR·RXR binding to the MOP response element (Fig.6 A, lane 2 versus lane 1). Although 9-cis-RA alone does not have a significant effect on VDR·RXR binding to DNA (data not shown), this retinoid, at concentrations of 10−5 and 10−6m, suppresses 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated DNA binding by the VDR·RXR heterodimer by 97% and 53%, respectively. Concentrations of 10−7 and 10−8m each attenuate heterodimeric binding to the VDRE by 40%, whereas concentrat"
https://openalex.org/W2074570559,"Anthracycline drugs are widely used for the treatment of solid tumors and leukemia, but the molecular basis of their biological effect is still poorly understood. In the HCT 116 colon carcinoma cell line, which retains a wild-type inducible p53 gene, we show that the anthracycline daunomycin is a potent inducer of p53 and NF-κB transcription factors. Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein occurred because of increased protein stability and enhanced gene expression. In addition, daunomycin induced the p53 promoter through the binding of p50/p65 NF-κB heterodimers to the κB site in the p53 promoter. Under our conditions, the free radical scavengers NAC and PDTC were not able to block NF-κB activation or p53 induction, indicating that reactive oxygen intermediates were not involved in the cellular response to daunomycin stimulation. Overexpression of a stable unresponsive IκBα mutant in HCT116 cells resulted in a complete inhibition of the NF-κB activation but only a partial impairment of the p53 protein accumulation induced by daunomycin. We conclude that the p53-activating signal generated by daunomycin is partially regulated by NF-κB."

Chem. 271, 14383–14389). In this pathway a fatty acid in the sn-2 position of phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine is transferred to the 1-hydroxyl position of ceramide. An enzyme that catalyzes the esterification of N-acetylsphingosine was purified from the postmitochondrial supernatant of calf brain through consecutive steps, including ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Sephacel, phenyl-Sepharose, S-Sepharose, Sephadex G-75, concanavalin A-agarose, and heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined to be 40 kDa by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. The enzyme bound to concanavalin A-agarose column was eluted with the buffer containing 500 mm α-methyl-d-mannopyranoside. Further purification by heparin-Sepharose chromatography resulted in separation of two peaks of enzyme activity. Coincidence between the transacylase activity and a stained protein of a molecular mass of 40 kDa was observed, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and recovery after separation over an acidic native gel. The second peak of activity from the heparin-Sepharose chromatography represented a purification of 193,000-fold. These results are consistent with the enzyme being a glycoprotein of a molecular mass of about 40 kDa with a single polypeptide chain. The purified enzyme had a pH optimum at pH 4.5. The divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+enhanced but were not essential for the transacylase activity. Neither activation nor inactivation of the enzyme activity was observed in the presence of 2 mm ATP or 2 mm dithiothreitol. Preincubation of the enzyme with 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, or 3.1 μm bromoenol lactone, a potent inhibitor of cytosolic Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2, had no significant effect on the enzyme activity. The enzyme activity was completely abolished in the presence of greater than 773 μm Triton X-100. Partial inhibition of the enzyme activity was observed in the presence of 10–100 μg/ml heparin. In the absence of N-acetylsphingosine, the enzyme acted as a phospholipase A2. These results strongly suggest that 1-O-acylceramide synthase is both a transacylase and a novel phospholipase A2.

Recently ceramide has been identified as a candidate lipid mediator regulating cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, development, and apoptosis (1Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). In many studies, proof of concept for a biological role of ceramide has relied on the use of N-acetylsphingosine (NAS), 1The abbreviations used are: NAS,N-acetylsphingosine; AACOCF3, nonadecyltetraenyl trifluoromethyl ketone; BEL, (E)-6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one; PLA2, phospholipase A2; cPLA2 and iPLA2, cytosolic and calcium-independent PLA2, respectively; DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; DTT,dl-dithiothreitol; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; Con A, concanavalin A; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: NAS,N-acetylsphingosine; AACOCF3, nonadecyltetraenyl trifluoromethyl ketone; BEL, (E)-6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one; PLA2, phospholipase A2; cPLA2 and iPLA2, cytosolic and calcium-independent PLA2, respectively; DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; DTT,dl-dithiothreitol; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; Con A, concanavalin A; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin. a truncated and membrane-permeable homologue of endogenous ceramides. Reliance on NAS is problematic since this compound is subject to metabolism when exogenously applied to cultured cells. We observed that MDCK cells and NIH 3T3 cells actively metabolized and converted NAS to other sphingolipids and resulted in a considerable increase in levels of sphingosine, natural (long chain) ceramide, and glucosylceramide (3Sheela Rani C.S.

Shayman J.A. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14383-14389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An enzyme activity that catalyzed esterification of a hydroxyl group at C1 position of NAS was described. The enzyme displayed an acidic pH optimum and was mainly recovered in a soluble fraction after centrifugation at 100,000 × g. In the presence of NAS and using liposomes consisting of phosphatidylcholine, [2-14C]arachidonylphosphatidylethanolamine and sulfatide, the enzyme catalyzed both the transacylation of NAS and the release of arachidonic acid from phosphatidylethanolamine. In the absence of NAS, the release of arachidonic acid was still observed. The enzyme predominantly catalyzes the deacylation or transacylation of both phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. Additionally, Ca2+ was not required for the enzyme activity. This enzyme appeared to be a novel Ca2+-independent PLA2. In the present paper, we report the purification and characterization of this novel acid phospholipase A2 with transacylase activity from calf brain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe reagents and their sources werel-α-1-acyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoylphosphatidylethanolamine (53 mCi/mmol) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; [3H]acetic anhydride (50–100 mCi/mmol) from American Radiolabeled Chemicals; Ecolume scintillation fluid from ICN; N-ethylmaleimide, Triton X-100, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from bovine brain, dicetylphosphate, d-erythro-sphingosine, heparin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), α-methyl-d-mannopyranoside, and S-Sepharose from Sigma; dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) from Avanti;dl-dithiothreitol (DTT) and nonadecyltetraenyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) from Calbiochem; (E)-6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-(2H)-pyran-2-one (BEL) from Cayman Chemical.N-[3H]Acetylsphingosine ([3H]NAS) was prepared by the method of Gaver and Sweeley (6Gaver R.C. Sweeley C.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 3643-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). High performance thin layer chromatography silica gel plates, 10 × 20 cm, were purchased from Merck. DEAE-Sephacel, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, Sephadex G-75, and heparin-Sepharose were from Amersham. Concanavalin A (Con A)-agarose was from Seikagaku Inc., Japan. Protein molecular mass standards used for Sephadex G-75 gel filtration and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis included the following: bovine serum albumin, 68 kDa (Amersham); ovalbumin, 43 kDa (Sigma); carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa (Amersham); and cytochrome c, 12.5 kDa (Amersham).Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of SDS was performed by the modified method of Reisfeld et al. (7Reisfeld R.A. Lewis U.J. Williams D.E. Nature. 1962; 195: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (2276) Google Scholar) on 10% acrylamide gels at pH 4.3. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS was performed by the method of Laemmli and Favre (8Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar) on 12% acrylamide gel. The protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or using a silver staining kit (Bio-Rad). The protein content was determined by the bicinchroninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The solution with a low concentration of protein was concentrated by the deoxychorate-trichloroacetic acid precipitation method (9Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) and then assayed.When the transacylase activity was extracted from a polyacrylamide gel, two gels were loaded with the partially purified enzyme (Step 7, see below) in 0.02% methyl green plus 10% glycerol. Electrophoresis was performed in a cold room. One gel was sliced into 2-mm segments. Each gel was minced by a glass homogenizer with 650 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.5) and vortexed overnight at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 ×g to remove the gel particles. The transacylase activity was measured for each sample using 400 μl of supernatant. The other gel was equilibrated for 2 h against 2.3% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and then electrophoresed to a slab polyacrylamide gel (12% separating gel) in the presence of SDS.Enzyme AssayThe assay conditions are described in the figure and table legends. In general, liposomes consisting of DOPC (70 mol%), PE (30 mol%), and dicetylphosphate (10 mol%) were used as acyl group donors. Constituent lipids in chloroform were mixed and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Fifty mm sodium citrate (pH 4.5) was added to the dried lipids at a volume 1 ml/1.28 μmol of lipid phosphorus. The lipids were dispersed into the buffer for 8 min in an ice water bath using a probe sonicator. The donor liposomes (64 nmol of phospholipid) were incubated with 5 nmol of [3H]NAS (10,000 cpm), 5 μg of bovine serum albumin and the transacylase activity at 37 °C in a total volume of 500 μl of 38–40 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.5). The reaction was terminated by adding 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2/1). The activity was determined as described in the previous paper (5Abe A. Shayman J.A. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14383-14389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the assay using nonradioactive NAS, the lipids were extracted and chromatographied as in the use of radioactive NAS. The activity was determined by image scan analysis of O-acyl-NAS band obtained by charring.Purification of Transacylase from Calf BrainPostmitochondrial Supernatant (Step 1)Fresh calf brains were stored at −80 °C as thin blocks after removal of pia mater. Frozen brains (600 g) were partly allowed to thaw in the cold room overnight and then cut in small pieces, after which all manipulations were performed at 4 °C. A 30% homogenate in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4 at room temperature), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF (buffer A) was prepared by a Polytron for 1 min at 20,000 rpm. The mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × gfor 30 min. The pellet was reextracted as described above.Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation (Step 2)Ammonium sulfate was added to the postmitochondrial supernatant to 20% saturation (10.6 g/100 ml). After stirring for 1 h, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 70% saturation with ammonium sulfate (31.2 g/100 ml) to precipitate the enzyme. After standing overnight, the clear supernatant above the precipitate was siphoned off. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 min, dissolved in 60 ml of buffer A, and dialyzed for 2 days against 5 times 4 liters of 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4, at room temperature), 1 mm EDTA (buffer B). The protein was adjusted to less than 20 mg/ml with buffer B and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h.DEAE-Sephacel Chromatography (Step 3)The supernatant was applied to a column (5 × 22 cm) of DEAE-Sephacel preequilibrated with buffer B at a flow rate of 100 ml/h. Unbound protein was eluted with 2 liters of buffer B. The enzyme activity was recovered in the unbound fraction.Phenyl-Sepharose Chromatography (Step 4)The unbound fraction was adjusted to 3 m NaCl and then applied to a column (2.5 × 20 cm) of phenyl-Sepharose preequilibrated with buffer B containing 3 m NaCl (buffer C) at a flow rate of 80 ml/h. Unbound material was eluted with 1000 ml of buffer C. Additionally the column was rinsed by 450 ml of buffer B containing 1.5m NaCl (buffer C′) and then by 400 ml of buffer B containing 0.15 m NaCl (buffer D). A small portion of the enzyme activity was released from the column during rinsing by buffer D. Most enzyme activity was eluted by 400 ml of buffer D containing 50% (w/v) ethylene glycol (buffer E) and kept at −80 °C.The same procedure, steps 1–4, was separately carried out 4 times. Then each fraction kept at −80 °C after the phenyl-Sepharose chromatography step was combined and dialyzed against 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 1 mm EDTA (buffer F).S-Sepharose Chromatography (Step 5)The dialysate was applied to a column (1.4 × 20 cm) of S-Sepharose preequilibrated with buffer F at a flow rate of 40 ml/h. Unbound protein was eluted by buffer F. The bound protein was eluted by a 480-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 0–0.3 m NaCl in buffer F. The enzyme activity was found in fractions between 60 and 130 mm NaCl as two peaks. Each peak was separately collected and named “S-Sepharose fast” and “S-Sepharose slow” by following the order of elution.Sephadex G-75 Chromatography (Step 6)Both fractions, S-Sepharose fast and S-Sepharose slow, were concentrated by Centriprep-10 (Amicon) and then applied separately to a column (2.6 × 90 cm) of Sephadex G-75 preequilibrated with 0.15m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA (buffer D) at a flow rate of 40 ml/h. Protein was eluted with buffer D. For S-Sepharose slow, a peak of the enzyme activity appeared at Ve/Vo = 1.41. For S-Sepharose fast, two small peaks of the enzyme activity were observed at Ve/Vo = 1.12 and 1.41. The active fractions obtained from S-Sepharose slow were collected and used for further purification.Concanavalin A-Agarose Chromatography (Step 7)The fraction obtained in Step 6 was adjusted to 1 mm CaCl2and 1 mm MnCl2 and applied to a column (0.85 × 1.8 cm) of Con A-agarose preequilibrated in 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMnCl2 (buffer G) at a flow rate 1.5 ml/h. Unbound protein was eluted by 10 ml of buffer G. The column was rinsed by buffer G including 10 mm α-methyl-d-mannopyranoside. During the rinse, a small portion of the enzyme activity was released from the column. Most enzyme activity was eluted by 10 ml of buffer G including 500 mm α-methyl-d-mannopyranoside (buffer H) and possessed a very high specific activity in the transacylase assay. The active fraction eluted with buffer H was collected, adjusted to 77.3 μm of Triton X-100, and then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 77.3 μm (w/v) Triton X-100 (buffer I).Heparin-Sepharose Chromatography (Step 8)The dialysate was applied to a column of heparin-Sepharose (HiTrap heparin, 1 ml; Amersham) preequilibrated in buffer I at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. Unbound protein was eluted by 15 ml of buffer I. Then the column was rinsed by 15 ml of buffer B containing 77.3 μm Triton X-100 (buffer B′). The bound protein was eluted by a 60-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.15 m in buffer B′.RESULTSPurification of Transacylase from Calf BrainTable I summarizes the various steps of the protocol developed for transacylase purification.

The post-mitochondrial supernatant was precipitated by 20–70% ammonium sulfate. After dialyzing the suspension of the precipitates, the 100,000 × g supernatant of the dialysate was applied to the DEAE-Sephacel column, and most of the enzyme activity was recovered in the unbound fraction. The recovery rebounded after the DEAE-Sephacel elution. This step gave rise to about 19-fold purification. The unbound fraction was adjusted to 3 m NaCl and applied to the phenyl-Sepharose column. The enzyme activity was recovered by the buffer containing 50% ethylene glycol (Fig.1). This step gave rise to an additional 7.6-fold purification.In the next S-Sepharose chromatography, the enzyme activity was eluted in fractions between 60 and 130 mm NaCl as two peaks (Fig.2). There was no enrichment in the purification of the S-Sepharose fast fraction. On the other hand the S-Sepharose slow fraction was purified 4.1-fold.Figure 2S-Sepharose column chromatography.

Only a small increase in purity was produced by gel filtration. For S-Sepharose slow, a peak of the enzyme activity appeared at Ve/Vo = 1.41 (Fig.3 B). On the other hand, for S-Sepharose fast two small peaks of the enzyme activity were observed at Ve/Vo = 1.12 and 1.41 (Fig.3 A). The values of Ve/Vo, 1.12 and 1.41, corresponded to molecular masses of 77.5 kDa and 38.6 kDa, respectively. The active fractions shown in the Fig. 3 B were collected and used for further purification.Figure 3Sephadex G-75 column chromatography. Two active fractions obtained from the S-Sepharose column, fractions 17–27 (S-Sepharose fast) and fractions 28–37 (S-Sepharose slow), were concentrated by Centriprep-10 and then separately applied to the Sephadex G-75 column. Protein was eluted with 0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA. Six-ml fractions were collected. Thirty-μl aliquots were assayed for the transacylase activity (▪).

Buffer containing 500 mmα-methyl-d-mannopyranoside was required to elute the enzyme (Fig. 4). This step gave rise to an additional 55-fold purification. Further recovery of the enzyme was accomplished by maintaining the column in buffer H overnight without elution and then rinsing with the same buffer. Because the protein concentration in the active fraction was extremely low, the protein solution was stabilized with 77.3 μm Triton X-100. At this stage, the purified transacylase was separated by acidic native gel electrophoresis. The extraction of gel slices and assay of transacylase activity corresponded to a protein of a molecular mass 40 kDa (Fig.5).Figure 4Concanavalin A-agarose column chromatography. The active fractions 38–43 shown in the Fig.5 B were pooled, adjusted to 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MnCl2, and applied to a concanavalin A column. The column was eluted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrows A and Bindicate the point at which elution buffers were changed to 10 mm α-methyl-d-mannopyranoside (MeMan, buffer G) and 500 mmα-methyl-d-mannopyranoside (buffer H), respectively. 4-ml fractions were collected except fractions 21–42, where 1-ml fractions were collected. 10-μl aliquots were assayed for the transacylase activity (▪).

Gel electrophoresis and the transacylase enzyme assay were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The upper panel displays the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis pattern of the active fraction obtained from the concanavalin A-agarose column. The lower panel displays the enzyme activity profile by thin layer chromatography and charring observed in a parallel gel after separation in the first dimension. The location of the transacylase activity (Rf 0.19–0.35) in the native gel corresponded to the protein band with a molecular mass of 40 kDa as seen by separation in the second dimension. The first two lanes represent separated extracts from an assay performed in the presence of liposomes only and from a sample before native gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The active fraction obtained from the Con A column was applied to the heparin-Sepharose column and eluted by a linear gradient of 0–150 mm NaCl. No Con A and Con A fragments were contaminated in the sample after heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The enzyme activity appeared as two peaks between 20 and 50 mm NaCl (Fig.6). In this single experiment the elution profile of the enzyme activity corresponded to that of protein of a molecular mass 40 kDa, estimated by SDS-PAGE. The lack of a protein band in lane 30 was due to the accidental loss of deoxycholate-trichloroacetic acid precipitate during aspiration. The highly purified enzyme found in the second peak was purified 193,000-fold. The protein appeared as a single band by SDS-PAGE and was used for further characterization of the enzyme. The yield from 10 calf brains (2,400 × g) was 4.5 μg with a specific activity of 25 μmol/min/mg of protein. The overall recovery of the activity was 1.6%. Transacylase activity was always accompanied with phospholipase A activity throughout the purification steps as determined by thin layer chromatography and charring (for example, Fig.5).Figure 6Heparin-Sepharose column chromatography.The active fractions obtained from the concanavalin A column (fractions 32–42) were pooled, adjusted to 77.3 μm Triton X-100, and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 77.3 μm Triton X-100 (buffer I). The column was eluted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 3.42-ml fractions and 0.57-ml fractions were collected in tubes 1–10 and 11–70, respectively. Ten-μl aliquots were assayed for the transacylase activity (○). (- - -) denotes the NaCl concentration. The upper panel shows SDS-PAGE of the heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Each sample (50 μl) was precipitated by the method of Bensadoun and Weinstein (9Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). The resultant precipitate was dissolved with 20 μl of 400 mm Tris, 1.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue and applied to lanes numbered 2–32. The bands were visualized by silver stain. The indistinct bands, which are not proteins, at the area around molecular mass 43–68 kDa are an artifact produced by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to the samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Characterization of TransacylasepH OptimumThe purified transacylase was optimally active at pH 4.5 (Fig. 7).

https://openalex.org/W2049589697,"SCG10 is a neuron-specific, membrane-associated protein that is highly concentrated in growth cones of developing neurons. Previous studies have suggested that it is a regulator of microtubule dynamics and that it may influence microtubule polymerization in growth cones. Here, we demonstrate that in vivo, SCG10 exists in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms. By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, two phosphoisoforms were detected in neonatal rat brain. Using in vitrophosphorylated recombinant protein, four phosphorylation sites were identified in the SCG10 sequence. Ser-50 and Ser-97 were the target sites for protein kinase A, Ser-62 and Ser-73 for mitogen-activated protein kinase and Ser-73 for cyclin-dependent kinase. We also show that overexpression of SCG10 induces a disruption of the microtubule network in COS-7 cells. By expressing different phosphorylation site mutants, we have dissected the roles of the individual phosphorylation sites in regulating its microtubule-destabilizing activity. We show that nonphosphorylatable mutants have increased activity, whereas mutants in which phosphorylation is mimicked by serine-to-aspartate substitutions have decreased activity. These data suggest that the microtubule-destabilizing activity of SCG10 is regulated by phosphorylation, and that SCG10 may link signal transduction of growth or guidance cues involving serine/threonine protein kinases to alterations of microtubule dynamics in the growth cone.

SCG10 is a growth-associated protein abundant in the growth cones of developing neurons (1Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J.

Unlike stathmin, which is a cytosolic protein and expressed in most tissues (8Sobel A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 301-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), SCG10 is a membrane-associated and neuron-specific protein (1Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The expression of SCG10 is developmentally regulated, with high levels in embryonic and postnatal nervous system (1Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J.

In the adult, its expression persists in several brain regions that are associated with synaptic plasticity (10Himi T. Okazaki T. Wang H. McNeill T.H. Mori N. Neuroscience. 1994; 60: 907-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and up-regulation of SCG10 has been found following lesion experiments (11Mc Neill T.H. Cheng H.W. Rafols J.A. Mori N. Hefti F. Weiner W.J. Progress in Parkinson Research II. Plenum Press, New York1992: 299-323Google Scholar). Overexpression of SCG10 in a neuronal cell line was found to enhance neurite outgrowth (7Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B. Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Moreover, SCG10 is highly concentrated in the central domain of growth cones (3Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Osen-Sand A. Sobel A. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) where the distal ends of MTs are in a dynamic state of growth and shrinkage (12Letourneau P.C. Ressler A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Lim S.S. Sammak P.J. Borisy G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Okabe S.

While the role of MTs in growth cone motility and neurite elongation is well established (15Tanaka E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 115: 381-395Google Scholar, 16Tanaka E. Ho T. Kirschner M.W. J.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3085-3095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about their regulation in response to the environment and the signaling pathways involved. An understanding of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events regulating the activity of SCG10 may lead to important insights into the intracellular mechanisms that modulate growth cone motility. We have previously shown that recombinant SCG10 is an in vitro target for the serine/threonine protein kinases PKA, MAP kinase, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) p34cdc2 (19Antonsson B. Lutjens R. Di Paolo G. Kassel D. Allet B. Bernard A. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both MAP kinase and PKA are present in growth cones and associated with microtubules (20Morishima-Kawashima M. Kosik K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The CDK p34cdc2 is not expressed in neurons, but another member of the CDK family, CDK5/p25, which is highly homologous to p34cdc2, has been identified in neurons (21Lew J. Wang J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 33-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 22Tang D. Lee K.Y. Qi Z. Matsuura I. Wang J.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and is localized in growth cones (23Pigino G. Paglini G. Ulloa L. Avila J. Caceres A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 257-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that SCG10 is phosphorylated in vivo and we have identified four phosphorylation sites in the recombinant protein using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. To further elucidate the molecular mechanism of SCG10 function, we have analyzed the effect of phosphorylation on the activity of the protein in intact cells. Our findings suggest that SCG10 is a phosphoprotein in developing brain and that its MT-destabilizing activity is regulated by phosphorylation. A rabbit antibody directed against SCG10 (anti-SCG10-BR) was generated by injecting 80 μg of recombinant, NH2-terminal truncated SCG10 that had been phosphorylated with PKA, MAP kinase, and p34cdc2 (19Antonsson B. Lutjens R. Di Paolo G. Kassel D. Allet B. Bernard A. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in complete Freund's adjuvant. One month after the first injection, the animal was boosted every 2 weeks with 40 μg of antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Five days after the third boost, the animal was deeply anesthetized with Nembutal and bled by cardiac puncture. The anti-SCG10 serum was tested for specificity in Western blots. For immunofluorescence experiments, the previously described rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against SCG10 (9Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.-H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and a mouse monoclonal antibody for α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2, Sigma) were used. Wistar rats of different ages (birth, postnatal days (P) 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20) and adult rats (3 months) were prepared for biochemistry as described earlier (24Riederer B.M. Guadano-Ferraz A. Innocenti G.M. Dev. Brain Res. 1990; 56: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Animals were deeply anesthetized (40 mg of sodium pentobarbital per kg body weight) and decapitated. The brains were removed, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C until use. Proteins (50 μg/slot) were separated on 5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. Western blots were incubated with anti-SCG10-BR antiserum (1:3000) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol (24Riederer B.M. Guadano-Ferraz A. Innocenti G.M. Dev. Brain Res. 1990; 56: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For dephosphorylation, the brain of a P5 animal was homogenized in dephosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.2, 135 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 30 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin, and 15 μg/ml E64), and incubated with and without 0.2 IU alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim, molecular grade)/μg of protein overnight at 37 °C (25Riederer B.M. Innocenti G.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1991; 3: 1134-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Riederer B.M. Binder L.I. Brain Res. Bull. 1994; 33: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling. Control homogenates were incubated with 1 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate and 50 mm sodium fluoride to inhibit phosphatase activity. Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and immunostained. Because SCG10 could not be resolved by regular isoelectrofocusing, brain homogenates and phosphorylated forms of the recombinant NH2-terminal truncated SCG10 were separated in the first dimension by a nonequilibrium pH gradient (NEPHGE) (27O'Farrell P. Goodman H.M. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Protein samples were dissolved in sample buffer (9.5 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 1% DTT, 0.8% ampholine, pH 3–10, 1.2% ampholine, pH 7–9, and 0.4% ampholine, pH 9–11) at 10 μg of protein/μl. Each gel was loaded with 50 μg of brain homogenate, or 1 and 0.3 μg of recombinant SCG10 for Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot, respectively. The upper buffer chamber contained 0.1 mH3PO4, the lower 0.02 m NaOH. The polarity was the reverse of that used for isoelectrofocusing gels, with the cathode (+) at the top and the anode (−) at the bottom. After application of the sample, the proteins were separated for 2 h at 800 V, 4 °C. The gels were incubated for 30 min with equilibration buffer (3% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), and separated on a 5–20% acrylamide gradient (or 15% SDS-PAGE). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining or after transfer to nitrocellulose by immunostaining. Recombinant SCG10 was purified as described earlier and stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm DTT, pH 7,5 at −80 °C (19Antonsson B. Lutjens R. Di Paolo G. Kassel D. Allet B. Bernard A. Catsicas S.

Purif. 1997; 9: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The purified protein was over 98% pure on reverse phase-HPLC and showed apparent homogeneity on SDS-PAGE. For the mass spectrometry studies, full-length SCG10 (19Antonsson B. Lutjens R. Di Paolo G. Kassel D. Allet B. Bernard A. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used, whereas for the two-dimensional gel analysis, NH2-terminal truncated SCG10 (28Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Grenningloh G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was used. For each phosphorylation assay, 250 pmol (5 μg) of the protein were used in a total reaction volume of 50 μl in the buffers described below. MAP kinase (p44mpk, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY): 15 ng MAP kinase in 15 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm DTT. cAMP-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (PKA, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany): 5 milliunits of PKA in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT. p34cdc2 kinase (Promega, Madison, WI): 10 units pp34cdc2 in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, and 0.5 mm DTT. All reaction mixtures contained 0.2 mm ATP. The samples were incubated at 35 °C for 60 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 20 mm EDTA and the samples were stored at −80 °C until analyzed. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (MS) was performed using an API-III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an HP1090 microbore HPLC ternary pump system (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Separations were carried out using a PorosTM R2/H 300 mm × 10-cm capillary perfusion column (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA). Buffer A was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. Buffer B was 0.035% trifluoroacetic acid in 90/10 acetonitrile/H2O. The column flow rate was 50 μl/min and was achieved using a pre-column flow split. An aliquot of purified SCG10, corresponding to 50–100 pmol, was loaded onto the capillary perfusion column and eluted using a gradient of 15% buffer B to 65% buffer B in 5 min. The mass spectrometer was scanned from m/z 825 and m/z 1125 Da every 3 s during the gradient HPLC separation. The resolution of the mass spectrometer unit was up to m/z 2200 (20% valley definition) as determined from the infusion of a (poly)propylene glycol standard calibrant solution (supplied by PE-Sciex). Mass spectra were acquired using a 0.2-Da step size (permitting 5 data points/Da) and a 2.0-ms dwell time per step. Aliquots of protein samples, corresponding to 5–25 pmol, were injected onto an immobilized trypsin perfusion column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) and digested on-column (total on-column digestion time of 2 min). Peptide fragments were trapped onto a reversed phase C18 column and eluted into the ion source of the mass spectrometer as described previously (29Lombardo C.R. Consler T.G. Kassel D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16456-16466Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were separated on a 15 cm × 300-μm capillary C18 column (LC Packings) operated at 5 μl/min using a linear gradient of 1 to 21% buffer B in 5 min and 21 to 41% buffer B in 15 min. Electrospray mass spectra were acquired by scanning the mass spectrometer from 300–1800 Da in 3 s using a 0.5-Da step and a 1.0-ms dwell time. Alternatively, an aliquot of SCG10 corresponding to 25 pmol, was purified by reversed phase perfusion column HPLC and subjected to digestion with endoprotease Glu-C (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) in NH4HCO3 at pH 8.0 for 12 h and at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 to confirm the sites of phosphorylation identified from the tryptic digestions. Phosphopeptides were identified from the tryptic and Glu-C digests using the stepped orifice voltage technique, previously reported by Huddleston et al.(30Huddleston M.J. Annan R. Bean M. Carr S.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 4: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and Ding et al. (31Ding J.M. Burkhart W. Kassel D.B. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 8: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). An aliquot of protein digest (5–25 pmol) was separated on the capillary C18 column and analyzed by electrospray ionization-MS. Peptides were ionized in the negative ion mode, and phosphopeptides were identified based on their ability to form a prominent PO3− ion, indicative of phosphorylation, at m/z 79. Tryptic phosphopeptides identified by negative ion stepped orifice potential experiments were subjected to on-line LC/MS/MS. These peptides were separated using the same column and gradient as described above. LC/MS/MS spectra of phosphopeptides were acquired by scanning the mass spectrometer from 50 Da to the mass of the precursor (M + H)+ ion in 3 s. The collision gas was set to 3 × 1014 collision gas thickness units. The mass spectrometer resolution was set to 1000 (full-width, half-maximum). The size of some of the tryptic fragments precluded their ability to be characterized fully by LC/MS/MS. Consequently, some of these larger tryptic fragments were subjected to digestion with Glu-C. These peptides were characterized by LC/MS/MS in a manner identical to the tryptic peptides, described above. The rat SCG10 cDNA was a generous gift of Dr. N. Mori (Kyoto, Japan). To replace serine with alanine or aspartate at positions 50, 62, 73, and 97 in the SCG10 sequence, site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to polymerase chain reaction procedures as described previously (32Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). All mutants were subcloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) and constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS-7 cells were cultured and electroporated as described previously (9Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.-H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and plated in 100-mm Petri dishes containing 15-mm coverslips. After 48 h, cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed 3 times with PBS. Cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a rabbit antiserum to SCG10 (9Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.-H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and mouse monoclonal antibodies to α-tubulin (clone B5-1-2, Sigma) in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (Sigma), 0.3% Triton X-100, and 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Following three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Cells were washed three times with PBS, and coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector). Using a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axioscop), cells expressing high levels of SCG10, i.e. where SCG10 staining was not restricted to the Golgi area, were assessed for their microtubule content. Cells were considered as cells containing polymerized MT if they contained more than 50 intact MTs. In three independent experiments, 50 cells were scored, and the percentage of cells containing polymerized MTs was calculated. As controls, we analyzed untransfected cells and cells that were transfected with an inactive SCG10 construct where the first 99 amino acids were deleted. In both cases 100% of the interphase cells showed a dense MT network. To compare the activity of SCG10 in transfected cells with that of a soluble form of SCG10 missing the membrane-binding domain (9Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.-H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), 100 transfected cells from three independent experiments were counted regardless of their level of expression, and the percentage of cells containing polymerized MTs was determined as described above. An anti-SCG10 serum, raised against in vitro phosphorylated recombinant SCG10 recognized two major bands in Western blots of postnatal brain extracts, one at 22 kDa and one at 25 kDa (Fig.1 A). As expected, due to the developmental change of SCG10 protein in rat brain (2Sugiura Y. Mori N. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 90: 73-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the levels of expression decreased after postnatal day 5 and became undetectable in the adult (Fig. 1 A). Following alkaline phosphatase treatment of P5 brain extract, the band at 25 kDa was no longer detectable, indicating that it corresponds to one or several phosphorylated forms of SCG10 (Fig. 1 B). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed three isoforms of SCG10 in postnatal brain extract (Fig. 1 C). The electrophoretic mobility of these isoforms was compared with that of in vitro phosphorylated, NH2-terminal truncated SCG10 (28Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Grenningloh G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 1, D–F). A mixture of nonphosphorylated SCG10 and SCG10 that was phosphorylated by CDK or by a combination of CDK, MAP kinase, and PKA generated a SCG10 pattern similar to that found in brain extracts (Fig. 1 G). These results indicate that postnatal rat brain contains unphosphorylated as well as two different phosphoisoforms of SCG10. For determination of the phosphorylation sites, recombinant SCG10 was in vitrophosphorylated by PKA, MAP kinase, and CDK as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phosphorylated samples were first analyzed by ion-spray mass spectrometry to determine the number of phosphorylation sites. Ion-spray mass spectrometry gave a mass of 20,624 ± 1.4 for unphosphorylated SCG10, which is in agreement with the calculated molecular mass (20,624 Da). After phosphorylation with PKA, the main molecular mass was found to be 20,803, which corresponds to diphosphorylated SCG10. MAP kinase phosphorylation gave both mono- and diphosphorylated SCG10 with molecular masses of 20,715 and 20,803, respectively. However, after 120 min of incubation with the kinase, the protein was entirely diphosphorylated (Fig.2 A). Samples phosphorylated with CDK showed mainly monophosphorylated protein with a molecular mass of 20,715. To map the sites of phosphorylation, the samples were digested with either trypsin or Glu-C, and the peptides were separated on reverse phase-HPLC and sequenced with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). After trypsin digestion of the sample phophorylated by PKA, three peptides were identified by the stepped orifice voltage technique and with a shift in the molecular masses on LC/MS. One peptide gave a (M + 3H)3+ signal at m/z 815.5 which corresponds to Mr 2,447 (Fig.3 A). The calculatedMr for the monophosphorylated peptide 48–69 is 2,445. When the peptide was sequenced, serine 50 was identified as the site of phosphorylation. The second peak corresponded to the peptide 49–69 and confirmed the phosphorylation site as serine 50. The third shifted peak was at a (M + 2H)2+ signal of m/z632.8 corresponding to a molecular mass of 1,266 (Fig. 3 B). The monophosphorylated peptide 95–104 has a calculatedMr = 1,266. MS/MS sequencing of the peptide revealed that the phosphorylation site was serine 97. The phosphorylation sites were confirmed by sequencing of two phosphorylated peptides from a Glu-C digestion (amino acid 42–55 and 93–99). In the samples phosphorylated with MAP kinase and digested with trypsin two phosphorylated peptides were identified and found to be shifted in the LC/MS spectrum (Table I). When the first peptide showing a (M + H)+ ion at m/z 696 was sequenced by MS/MS, the phosphorylation site was identified as serine 73. The second peptide gave a (M + 2H)2+ signalm/z 1145, which corresponds to a molecular mass of 2,290. In the SCG10 sequence this corresponds to a monophosphorylated peptide generated through cleavage at amino acid 49 and 69 (Mr 2,289). Sequencing of the peptide revealed that serine 62 was the site of phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). Digestion with Glu-C also generated two phosphorylated peptides (amino acid 67–83 and 56–66). Sequencing of the peptides confirmed the phosphorylation sites.Table ISummary of data obtained for in vitro phosphorylated SCG10MassMass of shifted peptidesAmino acidsPeptide sequenceP-Ser residueDaDaSCG1020624SCG10 + PKA20803244748–69RApSGQAFELILKPPSPISEAPR50126695–104RKpSQEAQVLK97SCG10 + MAP kinase2071569670–75TLApSPK7320803229049–69ASGQAFELILKPPpSPISEAPR62SCG10 + CDK2071569670–75TLApSPK73 Open table in a new tab Phosphorylation with CDK resulted in one phosphorylated peptide with a (M + H)+ signal at m/z 695.5. MS/MS sequencing showed that the peptide corresponded to amino acid 70–75 with serine 73 phosphorylated (calculated Mr 696). The results are summarized in Table I and Fig.4, A and B, and compared with the phosphorylation sites of stathmin. SCG10 inhibits the assembly of microtubules and induces their disassembly in vitro (7Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B. Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To study the effect of SCG10 on microtubules in intact cells and to identify the role of phosphorylation in its activity, we have transiently transfected COS-7 cells, which do not express endogenous SCG10. We assessed the effects of expression of wild-type SCG10 on the MT array by immunofluorescence staining using an anti-α-tubulin antibody. Then, we tested mutants in which the serines, individually or in combination, were mutated to alanine or aspartate to prevent or mimic phosphorylation, respectively (Fig. 4 C). In cells expressing low levels of wild-type SCG10 in which SCG10 staining was observed in the area of the Golgi apparatus, as previously shown (9Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.-H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), no obvious abnormalities could be observed. These cells were similar to the controls where 100% of the interphase cells showed a dense MT network. However, cells expressing high levels of SCG10, where the protein was also abundant in the cytoplasm (Fig.5 B), showed a dramatic, sometimes complete, disappearance of the microtubule network (Fig. 5,A and B). When we compared the activity of wild-type SCG10 with that of a construct that is missing the NH2-terminal membrane-binding domain and thus expressed as a cytosolic protein (9Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.-H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we found that SCG10 is less active in the membrane-bound form. While 43.7 ± 1.2% of cells transfected with full-length SCG10, only 20.3 ± 0.9% of cells transfected with soluble SCG10 contained polymerized MTs (p < 0.001). We compared the effects of high level expression of wild-type SCG10 with the effects of SCG10 in which serine-to-alanine substitutions were made at each individual site (S50A, S62A, S73A, and S97A) or at dual sites (S50A,S97A, S62A,S73A). Analysis showed no statistically significant difference in depolymerizing activity between these proteins (Fig. 6). However, the nonphosphorylatable mutant (S50A,S62A,S73A,S97A) was significantly more active in depolymerizing the microtubule network than the wild-type protein (Figs. 5, C and D, and 6). The percentage of cells containing polymerized microtubules decreased from 13.3 ± 0.9% for wild-type to 3.0 ± 1.5% for the nonphosphorylatable mutant (p < 0.001) (Fig. 6). To further test the role of phosphorylation in regulating the MT destabilizing activity of SCG10, mutants in which serine residues were substituted with aspartate residues at one, two, or all four sites were analyzed (Fig. 4 C). While introducing acidic charges to mimic phosphorylation at either Ser-50 or Ser-62 had no significant effect on the activity of SCG10, single mutations at Ser-73 (S73D) and Ser-97 (S97D) significantly decreased SCG10 activity (Fig. 6). The percentage of cells containing polymerized microtubules increased from 13.3 ± 0.9% for wild-type to 24.0 ± 0.6% and 27.0 ± 1.5%, respectively, for these mutants (p < 0.001). Double phosphorylation at Ser-50 and Ser-97 (S50D,S97D) and at Ser-62 and Ser-73 (S62D,S73D) showed a further increase in cells containing microtubules to 31.7 ± 2.8% and 28.7 ± 1.3, respectively (p < 0.001). The greatest reduction in SCG10 activity was observed when all four phosphorylation sites were substituted by aspartate (S50D, S62D, S73D, and S97D) resulting in an increase of cells containing MTs to 46.7 ± 0.9% (p < 0.001) (Fig. 6). To assess whether endogenous phosphorylation of SCG10 in COS-7 cells contributes to reducing its activity, the double aspartate mutant S62D,S73D was further mutated on Ser-50 and Ser-97 with alanine substitutions to prevent phosphorylation on these two residues (S50A,S97A,S62D,S73D). The percentage of cells transfected with S50A,S97A,S62D,S73D which contained polymerized MTs (25.3 ± 1.8%) was similar to that of cells transfected with S62D,S73D (28.7 ± 1.3%), indicating that the endogenous phosphorylation on Ser-50 and Ser-97 in this mutant does not contribute significantly to decreasing SCG10 activity (Fig. 6). Altogether, our results suggest that phosphorylation negatively regulates the microtubule-depolymerizing activity of SCG10 and that all four sites participate in this regulation, although the relative importance of each site varies. SCG10, a growth cone-enriched MT-destabilizing protein, has been recently characterized as an in vitro substrate for various serine/threonine kinases including PKA, MAP kinase, and CDK (19Antonsson B. Lutjens R. Di Paolo G. Kassel D. Allet B. Bernard A. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have found that SCG10 is phosphorylated in vivo in developing rat brain. The in vivo isoforms correspond to unphosphorylated, monophosphorylated, and multiphosphorylated forms. More detailed studies will be required to reveal the specific phosphorylation states of this protein in cells and tissues under a variety of physiological conditions. In this work, the sites of SCG10 phosphorylated by PKA, MAP kinase, and CDK have been identified. Our results, based upon tryptic peptide mapping followed by LC/MS and MS/MS sequencing, are summarized in Fig.4 A, where they are compared with the sites that have been reported for the related protein stathmin (33Beretta L. Dobransky T. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20076-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Leighton I.A. Curmi P. Cambell D.G. Cohen P. Sobel A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Marklund U. Brattsand G. Shingler V. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15039-15047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PKA phosphorylation sites present in SCG10 are conserved to the in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation sites known for stathmin. The sites for MAP kinase phosphorylation were identified as Ser-62 and Ser-73 of SCG10. Both sites contain a proline residue C-terminal to the serine consistent with the serine (threonine)-proline specificity of this kinase (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to stathmin, where the major site for MAP kinase was Ser-25, no preferred phosphorylation site was found for SCG10. Two sites (Ser-25 and Ser-38) are phosphorylated by CDK in stathmin, whereas we found only one major site in SCG10 that was phosphorylated by this kinase (Ser-73). Since the kinase used for these experiments is not expressed in neurons, the neuronal cdc2-like kinase CDK5/p25, which was also found to efficiently phosphorylate SCG10 (data not shown), may be the physiologically relevant kinase. Our results suggest that the function of SCG10 is regulated by multiple protein kinases and that the kinases PKA, MAP kinase, and CDK5/p25, all three of which are present in growth cones (20Morishima-Kawashima M. Kosik K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Pigino G. Paglini G. Ulloa L. Avila J. Caceres A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 257-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are good candidates to phosphorylate SCG10 in vivo. To reveal physiological functions of SCG10 phosphorylation, we assessed whether phosphorylation at the identified sites had an effect on the MT-destabilizing activity of the protein. We found that overexpression of wild-type SCG10 in COS-7 cells caused disruption of the MT network consistent with its microtubule-depolymerizing effect in vitro (7Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B. Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A similar activity was recently reported for the cytosolic protein stathmin upon transfection (6Marklund U. Larsson N. Melander Gradin H. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) or microinjection of recombinant protein (36Horwitz S.B. Shen H.-J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J. Schubart U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8129-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) into cells. However, SCG10 was significantly less active than a truncated cytosolic form of the protein, and its effect was observed mainly in highly overexpressing cells, where SCG10 localization was not restricted to the area of the Golgi complex (9Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.-H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) but also found in the cytoplasm. This may indicate that Golgi-associated SCG10 is either not very active or, more likely, not in a subcellular compartment where it can induce depolymerization of interphase microtubules. It is not known yet whether SCG10 functions while it is bound to organelles in neuronal growth cones (3Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Osen-Sand A. Sobel A. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or whether it has to be released from membranes. By expressing a series of phosphorylation site mutants, we showed that the MT-destabilizing effect of SCG10 could be modulated. While the nonphosphorylatable mutant showed higher activity than the wild-type protein, the activity of the mutant in which phosphorylation on all four sites was mimicked by an aspartate residue was greatly reduced. These data suggest that the nonphosphorylated state of SCG10 represents the most active form of the protein. Observations of stathmin in transfected or microinjected cells (6Marklund U. Larsson N. Melander Gradin H. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 36Horwitz S.B. Shen H.-J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J. Schubart U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8129-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) as well as in an in vitro assay of MT assembly (37Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 38Di Paolo G. Antonsson B. Kassel D. Riederer B.M. Grenningloh G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) suggest a similar mechanism of regulation of the activity of the two proteins. However, for stathmin it has been reported that alanine substitution on only two of the four serines (Ser-25 and Ser-38) increased its MT-destabilizing activity to nearly the same extend as mutating all four sites. This was not the case for SCG10, where the S50A,S62A,S73A,S97A mutant was significantly more active than any single or double alanine substitutions. Interestingly, these two serine residues in stathmin (Ser-25 and Ser-38) are not precisely conserved in the SCG10 sequence (Fig.4 B) and exhibit differences between stathmin and SCG10 in their phosphorylation by MAP kinase and CDK (Fig. 4 A). We also tested the effect of mutation of phosphorylation sites in SCG10 by introducing aspartate residues to replace each of the four phosphorylatable serines, both individually and in various combinations. Of the single mutants, only S73D and S97D were statistically different from wild-type, but not from each other. Also the double mutants were not statistically different from each other, though they were different from the S50D,S62D,S73D,S97D mutant. Whether the decreased activity of aspartate mutants is caused by a reduced binding to tubulin as is the case for in vitrophosphorylated stathmin (37Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 38Di Paolo G. Antonsson B. Kassel D. Riederer B.M. Grenningloh G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) needs to be determined. In summary, our results strongly suggest that the activity of SCG10 is controlled by phosphorylation and that its activity can be down-regulated to different extents by multiple phosphorylations. Therefore, SCG10 may be a key factor that links growth or guidance cues to the local control of MT assembly in growth cones. Fine tuning of its activity, possibly by several signal transduction pathways that act in concert, may be involved in regulation of the dynamics of MTs required for growth cone advance and turning.

https://openalex.org/W2007140214,"Hepatic cytochrome P450s play a critical role in the metabolism of hydrophobic xenobiotics. One of the major unsolved problems in xenobiotic metabolism is the molecular mechanism whereby phenobarbital induces hepatic enzymes, particularly CYP2B1 and CYP2B2 in rat liver. By using primary rat hepatocytes for transfection analyses, we previously identified in the CYP2B2 5′-flank a 163-base pair Sau3AI fragment that confers phenobarbital inducibility on a cat reporter gene and that has the properties of a transcriptional enhancer. Transfection experiments with sub-regions of the Sau3AI fragment now indicate that a central core together with an upstream or downstream accessory element within the fragment can confer phenobarbital responsiveness. One such accessory element, AF1, was identified and localized. DNase I footprinting analysis revealed the presence of a footprint overlapping this AF1 element. It also identified three other major protected regions, two of which are putative recognition sites for known transcription factors. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that a putative glucocorticoid response element as well as a nuclear factor 1 site and an associated nuclear receptor hexamer half-site are essential for conferring maximal phenobarbital inducibility. Taken together, the results indicate that phenobarbital induction of CYP2B2requires interactions among multiple regulatory proteins and cis-acting elements constituting a phenobarbital response unit."
https://openalex.org/W2046386432,"Soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogenous group of neoplasms with various histological subtypes. Up to now, no individual causal molecular markers for prognosis and therapeutic success have been identified. A tumorigenic connection between the oncogene product Mdm2 and tumor suppressor p53 is generally accepted, but their possible clinical relevance has not yet been investigated sufficiently in soft tissue sarcoma. In 86 primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities (RO-resected, T1/2 N0 M0), Mdm2 and p53 overexpression were investigated by immunohistochemistry. The results were adjusted to clinico-pathological characteristics and evaluated for their prognostic relevance by multivariate analysis. In Cox's multivariate analysis with stratification of Mdm2 to p53 results, we determined four groups which had different prognostic values for relapse-free and overall survival (Mdm2−/p53−<Mdm2−/p53+ <Mdm2+/p53−<Mdm2+/p53+). The most striking finding was a relative risk (rr) for overall survival of 18.77 (P=0.006) for patients with Mdm2/p53 co-overexpression (n=40). It is noticeably higher than the additive risk from both factors. Coincident Mdm2/p53 overexpression is an independent molecular marker with the highest prognostic relevance described for soft tissue sarcoma. Thus, a high risk sarcoma group has been defined which we believe requires alternative therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2043898015,"We recently demonstrated that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) stimulates phosphorylation of the type I inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (Sharma, K., Wang, L., Zhu, Y., Bokkala, S., and Joseph, S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 14617–14623), possibly via protein kinase A (PKA) activation in murine mesangial cells. In the present study, we evaluated whether TGF-β stimulates PKA activation. Utilizing a specific PKA kinase assay, we found that TGF-β increases PKA activity by 3-fold within 15 min of TGF-β1 treatment, and the enhanced kinase activity was completely reversed by the inhibitory peptide for PKA (PKI; 1 μm). In mesangial cells transfected with a PKI expression vector, enhanced PKA activity could not be demonstrated with TGF-β1 treatment. TGF-β1 was also found to stimulate translocation of the α-catalytic subunit of PKA to the nucleus by Western analysis of nuclear protein as well as by confocal microscopy. TGF-β1-mediated phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein was completely reversed by H-89 (3 μm), a specific inhibitor of PKA. Stimulation of fibronectin mRNA by TGF-β1 was also attenuated in cells overexpressing PKI. We thus conclude that TGF-β stimulates the PKA signaling pathway in mesangial cells and that PKA activation contributes to TGF-β stimulation of cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation and fibronectin expression. We recently demonstrated that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) stimulates phosphorylation of the type I inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (Sharma, K., Wang, L., Zhu, Y., Bokkala, S., and Joseph, S.

We thus conclude that TGF-β stimulates the PKA signaling pathway in mesangial cells and that PKA activation contributes to TGF-β stimulation of cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation and fibronectin expression.

In a variety of kidney diseases characterized by excess glomerular matrix deposition, TGF-β has been found to be up-regulated (1Sharma K. Ziyadeh F.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F829-F842PubMed Google Scholar). Diabetic kidney disease is characterized by accumulation of a variety of matrix molecules, including fibronectin (2Ziyadeh F.N. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1993; 22: 736-744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that TGF-β1 is stimulated in the diabetic kidney and that neutralization with anti-TGF-β antibodies significantly inhibits diabetes-induced fibronectin gene expression (3Sharma K. Guo J. Jin Y. Ziyadeh F.N. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Although stimulation of fibronectin by TGF-β is well recognized (4Dean D.C. Newby R.F. Bourgeois S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2159-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 5Ignotz R.A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4337-4345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the signaling pathways by which TGF-β regulates fibronectin gene expression are poorly understood.Recent studies have demonstrated that TGF-β initially binds to its type II receptor and then forms a heteromeric complex with the type I receptor (reviewed in Ref. 6Massague J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Cross-phosphorylation of the type I receptor by the type II receptor is critical for subsequent phosphorylation of various members of the recently described Smad family of proteins. Phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 has been demonstrated to play an important role in mediating the effects of TGF-β on cell proliferation (7Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 8Nakao N. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J.-i. Heldin C.-H. Miyazano K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar); however, their role in stimulation of matrix molecules such as fibronectin is unclear. The protein kinase A (PKA) pathway induces many effects on cells similar to TGF-β, and in particular, activation of both TGF-β and PKA stimulates fibronectin production, at least in part, by stimulating gene transcription (4Dean D.C. Newby R.F. Bourgeois S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2159-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A critical step involved in the transcriptional gene regulation by the PKA pathway is the phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Interestingly, CREB phosphorylation by TGF-β has been demonstrated in several cell types (9Kramer I.M. Koornneef I. deLaat S.W. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Kreisberg J.I. Radnik R. Kreisberg S.H.

Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the consensus cAMP response element (CRE, TGAGTCA) has been implicated in mediating the effects of TGF-β on the fibronectin promoter in rat mesangial cells (12Kreisberg J.I. Garoni J.A. Radnik R. Ayo S.H. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 1019-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and on the cyclin A promoter in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (13Barlat I. Henglein B. Plet A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. McKenzie F. Pouyssegur J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1309-1318PubMed Google Scholar). Although these findings would suggest that the PKA pathway is involved in TGF-β signaling, this possibility was considered unlikely primarily because cAMP levels were not elevated following TGF-β treatment (9Kramer I.M. Koornneef I. deLaat S.W. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Kreisberg J.I. Radnik R. Kreisberg S.H. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 805-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).PKA is composed of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits in its inactive state (14Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Elevation of cAMP levels leads to dissociation of the heteromeric complex, thus allowing the free catalytic subunit to be active as a serine/threonine kinase in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Until recently, activation of PKA without a rise in cAMP levels was not thought to occur. In an elegant study by Zhonget al. (15Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), the α-catalytic subunit of PKA was found to be bound to IκB in the cytoplasm, rather than by one of its regulatory subunits; degradation of IκB led to activation of the α-catalytic subunit. Therefore, it is apparent that other mechanisms are operant to allow for PKA activation independently of cAMP. In support of a role for the PKA pathway being involved in TGF-β signaling, we recently demonstrated that TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of the type I inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor in mesangial cells appeared to be mediated by PKA (16Sharma K. Wang L. Zhu Y. Bokkala S. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14617-14623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that TGF-β stimulates PKA activity without elevating intracellular cAMP levels in mesangial cells and that inhibition of PKA attenuates TGF-β-induced stimulation of CREB phosphorylation and fibronectin gene expression.DISCUSSIONOur major conclusions are that TGF-β1 stimulates PKA in mesangial cells and that the PKA pathway plays an important role in TGF-β1-induced CREB phosphorylation and TGF-β stimulation of fibronectin gene expression. Surprisingly, we found PKA activation by TGF-β in the absence of a detectable rise in cAMP levels.Our results demonstrating TGF-β-induced activation of PKA are in contrast to other published reports in different cell types. Prior studies excluded the PKA pathway in TGF-β1 signaling in mink lung epithelial cells and rat mesangial cells primarily because TGF-β did not elevate intracellular cAMP levels (9Kramer I.M. Koornneef I. deLaat S.W. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Kreisberg J.I. Radnik R. Kreisberg S.H. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 805-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Separate studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells (13Barlat I. Henglein B. Plet A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. McKenzie F. Pouyssegur J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1309-1318PubMed Google Scholar) and murine embryonic palatal cells (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using overexpression of the regulatory subunit to block PKA activity (13Barlat I. Henglein B. Plet A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. McKenzie F. Pouyssegur J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1309-1318PubMed Google Scholar) and a competitive analogue of cAMP ((Rp)-cAMP) (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), respectively, concluded that TGF-β-induced CREB phosphorylation occurred independently of the PKA pathway. However, the recent demonstration by Zhong et al.(15Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) that PKA may be activated without cAMP elevation sets an important precedent that may provide an explanation to justify the different results. This group reported that the α-catalytic subunit of PKA is constitutively associated with IκB, likely via an ankyrin repeat region of IκB, and degradation of IκB leads to stimulation of α-catalytic subunit kinase activity. These authors further suggested that other proteins containing ankyrin repeat sites may also function to bind the α-catalytic subunit of PKA and to regulate its activity independently of intracellular cAMP. Therefore, failure to observe an increase in cAMP-mediated kinase activity is not adequate evidence to exclude the involvement of the PKA pathway in a given cellular process.It should be noted that in two of the above-mentioned studies (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Barlat I. Henglein B. Plet A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. McKenzie F. Pouyssegur J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1309-1318PubMed Google Scholar), PKA activity was measured by in vitro kinase assays after 10–15 min of exposure to TGF-β and was found not to be increased. The in vitro kinase assays utilized either Kemptide substrate peptide (13Barlat I. Henglein B. Plet A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. McKenzie F. Pouyssegur J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1309-1318PubMed Google Scholar) or a nonspecific peptide (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as a phosphate acceptor from [32P]ATP with subsequent washing on phosphocellulose filters. The net phosphorylation detected would reflect the amount of phosphorylated target peptide substrate that binds to the phosphocellulose filter as well as other proteins that are present in the cell lysate that have basic residues (24Lutz M. Pinon D. Miller L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, overall phosphatase activity in the cell lysate may also be reflected in this assay. As TGF-β has been shown to activate serine/threonine kinases (6Massague J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 25Massague J. Weisgarcia F. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 41-64PubMed Google Scholar) as well as various phosphatases (26Fontenay M. Bryckaert M. Tobalem G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), this assay method may not be conclusive. Our studies used two separate in vitro kinase assays wherein the Kemptide substrate is biotinylated or fluorescently labeled, thus assuring that phosphorylation of only the peptide substrate of interest would be measured. To enhance specificity, only the PKI-inhibitable fraction of kinase activity was taken to reflect PKA activity. In addition, we demonstrate translocation of the α-catalytic subunit to the nucleus with TGF-β treatment by immunoblot analysis as well as confocal microscopy, providing an independent means of demonstrating PKA activation.The mechanism(s) by which TGF-β stimulates PKA activation remains unclear. Our studies failed to demonstrate that IκB protein underwent degradation in whole cell lysate or that NF-κB was translocated to the nucleus with TGF-β treatment. This would suggest that TGF-β may affect degradation of another protein that associates with and inhibits the α-catalytic subunit of PKA, possibly via ankyrin repeat sites. In a study in which platelet-derived growth factor-BB was found to stimulate PKA without raising intracellular cAMP levels (27deBlaquiere J. Walker F. Michelangeli V. Fabri L. Burgess A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was suggested that phosphorylation of regulatory subunits may affect affinity of cAMP. Additionally, it is conceivable that localized intracellular compartments of cAMP may increase in response to TGF-β, without a concomitant increase in total cellular cAMP. These possibilities are presently being explored in our laboratory.TGF-β-induced PKA activation likely contributes to CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation. CREB phosphorylation by TGF-β has been demonstrated by several independent studies (9Kramer I.M. Koornneef I. deLaat S.W. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Kreisberg J.I. Radnik R. Kreisberg S.H. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 805-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In a study employing murine embryonic palatal cells (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of CREB was demonstrated with an anti-phospho-CREB antibody specific for serine 133 (22Ginty D. Kornhauser J. Thompson M. Bading H. Mayo K. Takahashi J. Greenberg M. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Serine 133 is not only the site of CREB phosphorylation by PKA, but also the site of CREB phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase-stimulated CREB kinase and calcium-calmodulin kinase. Evidence against the role of the latter two pathways in mediating TGF-β-induced CREB phosphorylation was provided in the above study (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that TGF-β-induced CREB phosphorylation, employing the same anti-phospho-CREB antibody, is completely attenuated in mesangial cells when pretreated with the relatively specific inhibitor of PKA, H-89. Of note, H-89 inhibits the catalytic activity of PKA and is therefore not dependent on regulatory subunit binding of the catalytic subunit. Similar results were also found with the PKI peptide, which also binds to the free catalytic subunit of PKA. In addition, the phospho-CREB antibody also recognizes phospho-ATF-1 (22Ginty D. Kornhauser J. Thompson M. Bading H. Mayo K. Takahashi J. Greenberg M. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), and this nuclear transcription factor was also found to be phosphorylated by TGF-β1 treatment and reversed with PKA inhibition. The role of CREB phosphorylation in mediating gene regulation by TGF-β is unclear; however, a recent study in Drosophila demonstrated that a CREB-binding site was important in mediating decapentaplegic (the Drosophila homologue of TGF-β) stimulation of the homeotic gene Ultrabiothorax (28Eresh S. Riese J. Jackson D. Bohmann D. Bienz M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).TGF-β1 stimulation of the fibronectin promoter appears to require a consensus CRE (TGACGTCA) site (4Dean D.C. Newby R.F. Bourgeois S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2159-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Bowlus C.L. McQuillan J.J. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1122-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both CREB and ATF-1 derived from mesangial cells bind to this site (10Kreisberg J.I. Radnik R. Kreisberg S.H. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 805-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CREB phosphorylation enhances CREB binding to CREB-binding protein, thus activating gene transcription via the CRE (29Arias J. Alberts A. Brindle P. Claret F. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Inhibiting CREB phosphorylation would thus inhibit CREB binding to CREB-binding protein and may inhibit TGF-β-induced stimulation of fibronectin gene transcription. Our finding that inhibition of PKA in mesangial cells (by overexpressing PKI) prior to TGF-β treatment attenuates stimulation of fibronectin mRNA levels supports this hypothesis. The role of other transcription factors that are regulated by PKA and that bind to the CRE of the fibronectin promoter, such as ATF-1 and ATF-2, may also be relevant to TGF-β stimulation of fibronectin gene transcription. In addition, it is likely that cross-talk among the PKA pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and the Smad pathway participates in mediating specific responses to TGF-β in various cell types.

In a variety of kidney diseases characterized by excess glomerular matrix deposition, TGF-β has been found to be up-regulated (1Sharma K. Ziyadeh F.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F829-F842PubMed Google Scholar). Diabetic kidney disease is characterized by accumulation of a variety of matrix molecules, including fibronectin (2Ziyadeh F.N. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1993; 22: 736-744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that TGF-β1 is stimulated in the diabetic kidney and that neutralization with anti-TGF-β antibodies significantly inhibits diabetes-induced fibronectin gene expression (3Sharma K. Guo J. Jin Y. Ziyadeh F.N. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Although stimulation of fibronectin by TGF-β is well recognized (4Dean D.C. Newby R.F. Bourgeois S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2159-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 5Ignotz R.A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4337-4345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the signaling pathways by which TGF-β regulates fibronectin gene expression are poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that TGF-β initially binds to its type II receptor and then forms a heteromeric complex with the type I receptor (reviewed in Ref. 6Massague J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Cross-phosphorylation of the type I receptor by the type II receptor is critical for subsequent phosphorylation of various members of the recently described Smad family of proteins. Phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 has been demonstrated to play an important role in mediating the effects of TGF-β on cell proliferation (7Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar); however, their role in stimulation of matrix molecules such as fibronectin is unclear. The protein kinase A (PKA) pathway induces many effects on cells similar to TGF-β, and in particular, activation of both TGF-β and PKA stimulates fibronectin production, at least in part, by stimulating gene transcription (4Dean D.C. Newby R.F. Bourgeois S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2159-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A critical step involved in the transcriptional gene regulation by the PKA pathway is the phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Interestingly, CREB phosphorylation by TGF-β has been demonstrated in several cell types (9Kramer I.M. Koornneef I. deLaat S.W. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M.

Garoni J.A. Radnik R. Ayo S.H. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 1019-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and on the cyclin A promoter in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (13Barlat I. Henglein B. Plet A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. McKenzie F. Pouyssegur J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1309-1318PubMed Google Scholar). Although these findings would suggest that the PKA pathway is involved in TGF-β signaling, this possibility was considered unlikely primarily because cAMP levels were not elevated following TGF-β treatment (9Kramer I.M.

Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 805-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PKA is composed of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits in its inactive state (14Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Elevation of cAMP levels leads to dissociation of the heteromeric complex, thus allowing the free catalytic subunit to be active as a serine/threonine kinase in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Until recently, activation of PKA without a rise in cAMP levels was not thought to occur. In an elegant study by Zhonget al. (15Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), the α-catalytic subunit of PKA was found to be bound to IκB in the cytoplasm, rather than by one of its regulatory subunits; degradation of IκB led to activation of the α-catalytic subunit. Therefore, it is apparent that other mechanisms are operant to allow for PKA activation independently of cAMP. In support of a role for the PKA pathway being involved in TGF-β signaling, we recently demonstrated that TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of the type I inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor in mesangial cells appeared to be mediated by PKA (16Sharma K. Wang L. Zhu Y. Bokkala S. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14617-14623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that TGF-β stimulates PKA activity without elevating intracellular cAMP levels in mesangial cells and that inhibition of PKA attenuates TGF-β-induced stimulation of CREB phosphorylation and fibronectin gene expression. DISCUSSIONOur major conclusions are that TGF-β1 stimulates PKA in mesangial cells and that the PKA pathway plays an important role in TGF-β1-induced CREB phosphorylation and TGF-β stimulation of fibronectin gene expression. Surprisingly, we found PKA activation by TGF-β in the absence of a detectable rise in cAMP levels.Our results demonstrating TGF-β-induced activation of PKA are in contrast to other published reports in different cell types. Prior studies excluded the PKA pathway in TGF-β1 signaling in mink lung epithelial cells and rat mesangial cells primarily because TGF-β did not elevate intracellular cAMP levels (9Kramer I.M.

Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using overexpression of the regulatory subunit to block PKA activity (13Barlat I. Henglein B. Plet A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. McKenzie F. Pouyssegur J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1309-1318PubMed Google Scholar) and a competitive analogue of cAMP ((Rp)-cAMP) (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), respectively, concluded that TGF-β-induced CREB phosphorylation occurred independently of the PKA pathway. However, the recent demonstration by Zhong et al.(15Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) that PKA may be activated without cAMP elevation sets an important precedent that may provide an explanation to justify the different results. This group reported that the α-catalytic subunit of PKA is constitutively associated with IκB, likely via an ankyrin repeat region of IκB, and degradation of IκB leads to stimulation of α-catalytic subunit kinase activity. These authors further suggested that other proteins containing ankyrin repeat sites may also function to bind the α-catalytic subunit of PKA and to regulate its activity independently of intracellular cAMP. Therefore, failure to observe an increase in cAMP-mediated kinase activity is not adequate evidence to exclude the involvement of the PKA pathway in a given cellular process.It should be noted that in two of the above-mentioned studies (11Potchinsky M.

The in vitro kinase assays utilized either Kemptide substrate peptide (13Barlat I. Henglein B. Plet A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. McKenzie F. Pouyssegur J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M.

Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as a phosphate acceptor from [32P]ATP with subsequent washing on phosphocellulose filters. The net phosphorylation detected would reflect the amount of phosphorylated target peptide substrate that binds to the phosphocellulose filter as well as other proteins that are present in the cell lysate that have basic residues (24Lutz M. Pinon D. Miller L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, overall phosphatase activity in the cell lysate may also be reflected in this assay. As TGF-β has been shown to activate serine/threonine kinases (6Massague J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 25Massague J. Weisgarcia F. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 41-64PubMed Google Scholar) as well as various phosphatases (26Fontenay M. Bryckaert M. Tobalem G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), this assay method may not be conclusive. Our studies used two separate in vitro kinase assays wherein the Kemptide substrate is biotinylated or fluorescently labeled, thus assuring that phosphorylation of only the peptide substrate of interest would be measured. To enhance specificity, only the PKI-inhibitable fraction of kinase activity was taken to reflect PKA activity. In addition, we demonstrate translocation of the α-catalytic subunit to the nucleus with TGF-β treatment by immunoblot analysis as well as confocal microscopy, providing an independent means of demonstrating PKA activation.The mechanism(s) by which TGF-β stimulates PKA activation remains unclear. Our studies failed to demonstrate that IκB protein underwent degradation in whole cell lysate or that NF-κB was translocated to the nucleus with TGF-β treatment. This would suggest that TGF-β may affect degradation of another protein that associates with and inhibits the α-catalytic subunit of PKA, possibly via ankyrin repeat sites. In a study in which platelet-derived growth factor-BB was found to stimulate PKA without raising intracellular cAMP levels (27deBlaquiere J. Walker F. Michelangeli V. Fabri L. Burgess A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was suggested that phosphorylation of regulatory subunits may affect affinity of cAMP. Additionally, it is conceivable that localized intracellular compartments of cAMP may increase in response to TGF-β, without a concomitant increase in total cellular cAMP. These possibilities are presently being explored in our laboratory.TGF-β-induced PKA activation likely contributes to CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation. CREB phosphorylation by TGF-β has been demonstrated by several independent studies (9Kramer I.M. Koornneef I. deLaat S.W. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Kreisberg J.I. Radnik R. Kreisberg S.H. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 805-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In a study employing murine embryonic palatal cells (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of CREB was demonstrated with an anti-phospho-CREB antibody specific for serine 133 (22Ginty D. Kornhauser J. Thompson M. Bading H. Mayo K. Takahashi J. Greenberg M. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Serine 133 is not only the site of CREB phosphorylation by PKA, but also the site of CREB phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase-stimulated CREB kinase and calcium-calmodulin kinase. Evidence against the role of the latter two pathways in mediating TGF-β-induced CREB phosphorylation was provided in the above study (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that TGF-β-induced CREB phosphorylation, employing the same anti-phospho-CREB antibody, is completely attenuated in mesangial cells when pretreated with the relatively specific inhibitor of PKA, H-89. Of note, H-89 inhibits the catalytic activity of PKA and is therefore not dependent on regulatory subunit binding of the catalytic subunit. Similar results were also found with the PKI peptide, which also binds to the free catalytic subunit of PKA. In addition, the phospho-CREB antibody also recognizes phospho-ATF-1 (22Ginty D. Kornhauser J. Thompson M. Bading H. Mayo K. Takahashi J. Greenberg M. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), and this nuclear transcription factor was also found to be phosphorylated by TGF-β1 treatment and reversed with PKA inhibition. The role of CREB phosphorylation in mediating gene regulation by TGF-β is unclear; however, a recent study in Drosophila demonstrated that a CREB-binding site was important in mediating decapentaplegic (the Drosophila homologue of TGF-β) stimulation of the homeotic gene Ultrabiothorax (28Eresh S. Riese J. Jackson D. Bohmann D. Bienz M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).TGF-β1 stimulation of the fibronectin promoter appears to require a consensus CRE (TGACGTCA) site (4Dean D.C. Newby R.F. Bourgeois S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2159-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Bowlus C.L. McQuillan J.J. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1122-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both CREB and ATF-1 derived from mesangial cells bind to this site (10Kreisberg J.I. Radnik R. Kreisberg S.H. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 805-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CREB phosphorylation enhances CREB binding to CREB-binding protein, thus activating gene transcription via the CRE (29Arias J. Alberts A. Brindle P. Claret F. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Inhibiting CREB phosphorylation would thus inhibit CREB binding to CREB-binding protein and may inhibit TGF-β-induced stimulation of fibronectin gene transcription. Our finding that inhibition of PKA in mesangial cells (by overexpressing PKI) prior to TGF-β treatment attenuates stimulation of fibronectin mRNA levels supports this hypothesis. The role of other transcription factors that are regulated by PKA and that bind to the CRE of the fibronectin promoter, such as ATF-1 and ATF-2, may also be relevant to TGF-β stimulation of fibronectin gene transcription. In addition, it is likely that cross-talk among the PKA pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and the Smad pathway participates in mediating specific responses to TGF-β in various cell types. Our major conclusions are that TGF-β1 stimulates PKA in mesangial cells and that the PKA pathway plays an important role in TGF-β1-induced CREB phosphorylation and TGF-β stimulation of fibronectin gene expression. Surprisingly, we found PKA activation by TGF-β in the absence of a detectable rise in cAMP levels. Our results demonstrating TGF-β-induced activation of PKA are in contrast to other published reports in different cell types. Prior studies excluded the PKA pathway in TGF-β1 signaling in mink lung epithelial cells and rat mesangial cells primarily because TGF-β did not elevate intracellular cAMP levels (9Kramer I.M. Koornneef I. deLaat S.W. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Kreisberg J.I. Radnik R. Kreisberg S.H. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 805-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Separate studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells (13Barlat I. Henglein B. Plet A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. McKenzie F. Pouyssegur J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1309-1318PubMed Google Scholar) and murine embryonic palatal cells (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using overexpression of the regulatory subunit to block PKA activity (13Barlat I. Henglein B. Plet A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. McKenzie F. Pouyssegur J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1309-1318PubMed Google Scholar) and a competitive analogue of cAMP ((Rp)-cAMP) (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), respectively, concluded that TGF-β-induced CREB phosphorylation occurred independently of the PKA pathway. However, the recent demonstration by Zhong et al.(15Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) that PKA may be activated without cAMP elevation sets an important precedent that may provide an explanation to justify the different results. This group reported that the α-catalytic subunit of PKA is constitutively associated with IκB, likely via an ankyrin repeat region of IκB, and degradation of IκB leads to stimulation of α-catalytic subunit kinase activity. These authors further suggested that other proteins containing ankyrin repeat sites may also function to bind the α-catalytic subunit of PKA and to regulate its activity independently of intracellular cAMP. Therefore, failure to observe an increase in cAMP-mediated kinase activity is not adequate evidence to exclude the involvement of the PKA pathway in a given cellular process. It should be noted that in two of the above-mentioned studies (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Barlat I. Henglein B. Plet A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. McKenzie F. Pouyssegur J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1309-1318PubMed Google Scholar), PKA activity was measured by in vitro kinase assays after 10–15 min of exposure to TGF-β and was found not to be increased. The in vitro kinase assays utilized either Kemptide substrate peptide (13Barlat I. Henglein B. Plet A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. McKenzie F. Pouyssegur J. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1309-1318PubMed Google Scholar) or a nonspecific peptide (11Potchinsky M. Weston W. Lloyd M. Greene R. Exp.

https://openalex.org/W2003914197,"Duck gp180 was previously identified by its ability to bind to the preS envelope protein of duck hepatitis B virus particles (Kuroki, K., Cheung, R., Marion, P. L., and Ganem, D. (1994) J. Virol. 68, 2091–2096). Cloning and sequencing of gp180 cDNA revealed that it is a polyprotein with three carboxypeptidase-like domains (Kuroki, K., Eng, F., Ishikawa, T., Turck, C., Harada, F., and Ganem, D. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 15022–15028). To evaluate enzymatic properties of this protein, a soluble 170-kDa form of the protein (gp170) lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail was expressed in a baculovirus system. The purified 170-kDa protein cleaved 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl)-Phe-Ala-Arg with a pH optimum of 5.5–6.5. With this substrate at pH 5.5, the 170-kDa protein displayed a Km of 12 μm and a Kcat of 57 s−1. Dansyl-Pro-Ala-Arg and dansyl-Phe-Phe-Arg were cleaved with Km values of 17 and 21 μm, and Kcat values of 57 and 17 s−1, respectively. Constructs containing only the first or second carboxypeptidase domains also showed enzymatic activity. The effects of inhibitors and ions on enzyme activity of gp170 were generally similar to the effects of these compounds on purified bovine carboxypeptidase D. To evaluate the regions within gp180 necessary for binding preS, a series of deletion mutants were expressed in the 293T human kidney cell line. Deletions of the first and second domains, leaving the third domain intact, eliminated carboxypeptidase activity but retained preS binding. Deletion of the third domain eliminated preS binding but not carboxypeptidase activity. These results indicate that the third domain is responsible for preS binding, and this binding does not require carboxypeptidase activity. Duck gp180 was previously identified by its ability to bind to the preS envelope protein of duck hepatitis B virus particles (Kuroki, K., Cheung, R., Marion, P. L., and Ganem, D. (1994) J.

Duck hepatitis B virus is a member of the hepadnavirus group, which includes human hepatitis B virus (1Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). These viruses are small enveloped DNA viruses that infect liver cells, causing acute and chronic hepatitis (1Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The cellular receptor for human hepatitis B virus has not been identified. A candidate receptor for the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) 1The abbreviations used are: DHBV, duck hepatitis B virus; kb, kilobase pair(s); dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; CPE, carboxypeptidase E; CPD, carboxypeptidase D; SV40, simian virus 40; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GEMSA, guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: DHBV, duck hepatitis B virus; kb, kilobase pair(s); dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; CPE, carboxypeptidase E; CPD, carboxypeptidase D; SV40, simian virus 40; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GEMSA, guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid. has recently been described (2Kuroki K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15022-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This 180-kDa protein, named gp180, was identified based on its ability to co-precipitate with DHBV particles or recombinant DHBV envelope proteins (2Kuroki K. Cheung R. Marion P.L. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2091-2096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). gp180 was found to bind with high affinity and specificity to the preS region of the DHBV large envelope protein (2Kuroki K. Cheung R. Marion P.L. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2091-2096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding domain within the preS region that is responsible for the gp180 interaction overlaps key areas that have been established as important for viral infectivity (4Ishikawa T. Kuroki K. Lenhoff R. Summers J. Ganem D. Virology. 1994; 202: 1061-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cDNA for gp180 has recently been cloned, revealing that gp180 is a member of the metallocarboxypeptidase gene family (3Kuroki K. Eng F. Ishikawa T. Turck C. Harada F. Ganem D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15022-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, gp180 contains an N-terminal signal peptide, three metallocarboxypeptidase-like domains, a putative C-terminal transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Of the known carboxypeptidases, gp180 has the highest homology to carboxypeptidase E (CPE). Specifically, the first and second domains of gp180 have 39% and 43% amino acid identity with mammalian CPE, and the third domain has 29% amino acid identity.CPE functions in the biosynthesis of numerous peptide hormones and transmitters (5Fricker L.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 6Fricker L.D. Peptide Biosynthesis and Processing. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 199-230Google Scholar). CPE removes C-terminal Arg and Lys residues remaining after endoprotease cleavage of the prohormone. For many years, CPE was thought to be the only carboxypeptidase involved with neuropeptide biosynthesis. However, recent studies on the Cpe fat /Cpe fat mouse suggest that additional CPE-like carboxypeptidases partially compensate for a defective CPE. These mice have a point mutation within the coding region of the CPE gene that renders the protein inactive (7Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of active CPE in the Cpe fat /Cpe fat mice, a reduced but detectable amount of peptide processing occurs, implying that additional carboxypeptidases may perform this step in vivo. A novel carboxypeptidase with CPE-like properties, named metallocarboxypeptidase D (CPD), was identified in bovine pituitary and in other tissues (CPD) (8Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In bovine tissues, the major form of CPD is 180 kDa (8Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition to the 180-kDa form, rat tissues also contain several smaller forms ranging from 100 to 180 kDa (9Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol.

The size of the major species of CPD is similar to that of gp180, raising the possibility that these proteins are homologs. In addition, the partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of bovine CPD is similar to that of the duck gp180, and both proteins are broadly distributed in many tissues (3Kuroki K. Eng F. Ishikawa T. Turck C. Harada F. Ganem D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15022-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28884-28889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The purpose of the present study was to investigate the enzymatic properties of gp180 and to compare them to the properties of bovine CPD. To accomplish this, both gp180 and a 170-kDa form lacking the putative transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail (termed gp170) were expressed in a baculovirus system. The enzymatic properties of the purified gp170 protein are generally similar to those of the previously reported CPD, providing strong evidence that these proteins represent species homologs. In addition, the enzymatic activities of deletion mutants expressing only the first carboxypeptidase-like domain (termed gp75), only the second carboxypeptidase domain (termed gp60–120), or the combined first and second carboxypeptidase-like domains (termed gp120) were characterized to determine the regions responsible for carboxypeptidase activity. Furthermore, a series of deletion mutations were expressed in 293T cells to determine the regions responsible for binding to the DHBV preS protein. Interestingly, this analysis showed that the third domain is responsible for binding preS but is not enzymatically active. In contrast, constructs deleting portions of the third domain did not bind preS but were enzymatically active. These results demonstrate that preS binding and carboxypeptidase activity are localized to different regions of the protein.RESULTSUpon expression of gp180 in insect Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system, an immunoreactive protein of 178 kDa is detected on Western blots (Fig. 1). Medium from these cells also shows some immunoreactive protein, although the apparent molecular weight is slightly smaller than the expressed cellular gp180 protein (Fig. 1). When a comparable Western blot was probed with an antiserum directed against the C-terminal 57 amino acids of gp180, a strong band of 178 kDa was detected in the gp180-expressing cells (not shown). Medium from these cells showed essentially no immunoreactive protein suggesting that the major form of gp180 in the medium is lacking this C-terminal region, presumably due to proteolytic processing. Expression of the form of the protein lacking the C-terminal 82 amino acids (gp170) with the baculovirus system shows both cellular and medium immunoreactive proteins of 170 kDa (Fig. 1). In addition, smaller forms are also detected in cells and to a lesser extent in the medium. Expression of only the first and second carboxypeptidase-like domains (gp120) or only the first domain (gp75) also shows both cellular and medium immunoreactive proteins of 123 and 76 kDa, respectively. The construct containing only the second carboxypeptidase domain (gp60–120) also showed a similar level of expression in medium upon Western blot analysis (data not shown).Carboxypeptidase activity of the Sf9 cells and medium infected with baculovirus for 3 days was measured with dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg (dansyl-FAR) at pH 5.5. The background activity of cells infected with wild-type virus was 2.3 nmol of product/min of incubation with dansyl-FAR/106 cells. The medium from these cells also contained 1.5 nmol/min/106 cells of activity toward the substrate. Upon infection with the gp180-expressing baculovirus, the cells expressed 78 nmol/min/106 cells of activity and the medium expressed 13 nmol/min/106 cells of activity. Infection with gp170-expressing baculovirus produced 54 and 52 nmol/min/106 cells of activity for the cell homogenates and medium, respectively. Infection with gp120-expressing baculovirus produced 156 and 167 nmol/min/106 cells of activity and gp75-expressing baculovirus produced 92 and 81 nmol/min/106cells of activity for the cell homogenates and medium, respectively. Infection with the gp60–120 expressing baculovirus produced 38 nmol/min/106 cells of activity in the medium; activity for cell homogenates was not measured. These results indicate that gp180, gp170, gp120, gp75, and gp60–120 are able to cleave the dansyl-FAR substrate.The baculovirus-expressed gp170, gp120, gp75, and gp60–120 were purified from medium using a substrate affinity column and conditions previously developed for the purification of bovine and rat CPD (Fig.2). As found for mammalian CPD, duck gp170 remains bound to the affinity column when the pH is raised to 8.0 (not shown) and elutes when Arg is added (Fig. 2). After the affinity column purification, bands of 170, 123, 76, and 66 kDa are present for gp170, gp120, gp75, and gp60–120, respectively (Fig. 2). In contrast, attempts to purify the baculovirus-expressed gp180 from Sf9 cells were less successful, with low recovery and purity (not shown). Thus, the purified gp170 was used for further characterization of the enzymatic properties. This enzyme was compared with CPD purified from bovine pituitary glands, and in some experiments also compared with gp120 and gp75.Figure 2Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified gp170, gp120, gp75, and gp60–120. Media from Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus expressing the various proteins were fractionated on a p-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Sepharose column. The affinity column was eluted with 5 mm Arg in the pH 8 buffer, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Aliquots were analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (36Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar) for gp170, gp120, or gp75, and by Coomassie Blue for gp60–120. The positions and molecular masses of prestained protein standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The pH optimum of gp170 is 5.5–6.5 and is similar to that of purified bovine CPD (Fig. 3). This pH optimum distinguishes CPD from CPE and other metallocarboxypeptidases (8Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The pH optima of the shorter constructs are generally similar to that of gp170, although the first domain (gp75) is less active at acidic pH values and the second domain (gp60–120) is more active at acidic pH values (Fig. 3). The chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline inhibits both gp170 and bovine CPD (Table I), consistent with the proposal that these enzymes are metalloproteases. Inhibitors of serine proteases (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or cysteine proteases (iodoacetamide) do not substantially affect either gp170 or bovine CPD (Table I). However, the compoundp-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate partially inhibits both activities at 0.1 mm concentration, indicating a sensitivity to thiol-directed reagents. Other compounds, such as leupeptin, benzamidine, tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, and tosyl lysyl chloromethyl ketone do not substantially alter the enzyme activity of gp170 or bovine CPD. GEMSA, an active site-directed inhibitor of carboxypeptidase B-like enzymes, potently inhibits both gp170 and bovine CPD (Table I).Figure 3Effect of pH on enzyme activity of CPD, gp170, gp120, gp75, and gp60–120. Carboxypeptidase (CP) activity was determined using 100 μmdansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer at the indicated pH (measured at 37 °C). Activity was normalized to the maximal activity detected at the optimal pH.

In contrast, CaCl2 and MnCl2 do not substantially affect either activity. CdCl2 has a differential effect on the two activities, activating gp170 by 60% and inhibiting bovine CPD by approximately 40% (Table II).

Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters of substrate hydrolysis were determined for dansyl-FAR and two related substrates (TableIII). Of the three substrates examined, dansyl-FAR is cleaved with the highest Kcat and Kcat/Km by both gp170 and bovine CPD, and dansyl-FFR is cleaved with the lowestKcat and Kcat/Km for both enzymes (Table III). The Km for all three substrates with gp170 are 3–5-fold lower than the Km with bovine CPD (Table III). In comparing dansyl-FAR hydrolysis with gp170, gp120, and gp75, the Kcat decreases by about 60% between gp170 and gp120, and by 50% between gp120 and gp75 (Fig. 3). The Km for gp75 is 6–7-fold higher than the Km for gp120 and gp170. Thus, the Kcat/Km for gp75 is only 2–3% of the value for gp170 (Fig. 3). In contrast, the construct that contains only the second carboxypeptidase domain (gp60–120) cleaves dansyl-FAR with a Kcat comparable to that with the construct containing both domains (gp120). the Km for gp60–120 is slightly higher than the Km for gp120, and so the Kcat/Km for gp60–120 is approximately 50% of that for gp120 (Table III).Table IIIKinetic parameters of substrate hydrolysis by duck gp170, gp120, gp75, and bovine CPDSubstrateEnzymeKmKcatKcat/Kmμms−1s−1μm−1Dansyl-FARCPD3-2001Data for CPD have been published previously (8).63510.81gp17012 ± 257 ± 24.7 ± 0.9gp12014 ± 222 ± 0.41.6 ± 0.3gp7582 ± 89.2 ± 0.30.11 ± 0.04gp60–12026 ± 422 ± 0.20.83 ± 0.05Dansyl-PARCPD3-2001Data for CPD have been published previously (8).54220.41gp17017 ± 257 ± 13.4 ± 0.6Dansyl-FFRCPD3-2001Data for CPD have been published previously (8).1005.90.059gp17021 ± 417 ± 10.8 ± 0.23-2001 Data for CPD have been published previously (8Song L.

Open table in a new tab Previously, gp180 was shown to bind to the preS region of DHBV. To determine the region of gp180 involved in this binding, a series of deletion mutations were transiently expressed in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line 293T. This cell line differs from its progenitor, HEK293, in that the SV40 T antigen was introduced to allow for high levels of expression from vectors carrying an SV40 origin of replication. The recombinant proteins were C-terminally tagged with the human hepatitis B virus surface antigen (S protein) to facilitate purification of the expressed proteins by immunoprecipitation. In all constructs, the gp180 transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail was replaced with this tag (Fig. 4). The expression of each construct in the 293T cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation using an antiserum to the S protein (Fig.5). Although there was some variability in the expression levels and the recovery by immunoprecipitation, the fusion protein was detected for each construct (Fig. 5). Carboxypeptidase activity of the immunoprecipitate was assayed using the radioactive substrate [3H]benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Arg. The preS binding was assessed by the ability of the 293T expressed proteins to bind to the GST-preS fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Fig. 5). Cells transfected with the construct containing all three carboxypeptidase-like domains (pG180S4) gave enzyme activity 56-fold above the background of the blank controls that lacked lysate. As expected, this construct bound the preS fusion protein (Fig. 5). A construct containing nearly all of the first two domains and lacking the third domain (pG180D16, Fig. 4), showed enzymatic activity (13-fold above background) but however did not bind preS (Fig. 5). Deletions within the first two domains (pGD180DS24 and pGD180DS33, Fig. 4) eliminated the carboxypeptidase activity, but did not interfere with preS binding (Fig. 5). A deletion of the second domain and the N-terminal half of the third domain (pG180DS2) eliminated preS binding but showed carboxypeptidase activity (Figs. 4and 5).Figure 4Comparison of carboxypeptidase activity and preS binding to deletion mutants of epitope-tagged gp170 proteins.Epitope-tagged proteins were constructed by replacing the transmembrane (TM) and cytosolic tail (CT) of gp180 with portions of the human hepatitis B virus S protein. Numbersindicate amino acid positions that demarcate the three domains of gp180 (there are two short bridge regions between the carboxypeptidase domains), the transmembrane domain of wild type gp180 (top), and the C-terminal S protein epitope tag of the various constructs. All constructs contained the N-terminal signal peptide domain (Pre) of gp180. Carboxypeptidase activity was determined after immunoprecipitation with antiserum directed to the S tag, whereas preS binding was determined by a construct's ability to bind to a GST-preS fusion protein, as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Expression and preS binding of epitope-tagged gp170 and deletion mutants. 293T cells, either wild type (wt) or transfected with the constructs indicated in Fig. 4(labeling indicates the last 2–3 characters of the plasmid name), were labeled with 35S-Met as described under “Materials and Methods.” Left, to confirm expression of the constructs, lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antiserum directed to the S tag and protein A-Sepharose. Right, to determine preS binding, lysates were incubated with a GST-preS fusion protein and glutathione-agarose. Proteins bound to the protein A-Sepharose and glutathione-agarose beads were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To evaluate whether the three constructs that bound preS had comparable binding affinities, the ability of purified baculovirus-expressed gp170 to compete for binding was examined. Binding of S4 to preS was competed by increasing amounts of gp170 (Fig.6 A). Quantitation of this binding showed that approximately 40 ng of purified gp170 reduced the binding of S4 to preS by 50% (Fig. 6 B). The binding of S24 and S33 to preS was also competed by purified gp170 (Fig.6 A). Quantitation of the results from two separate experiments showed that approximately 20–30 ng of purified gp170 reduced the preS binding by 50% (Fig. 6 B). This result indicates that gp170 competes for binding of all three constructs with a generally similar potency. In contrast, 500 ng of purified gp75 (domain 1) or gp120 (domains 1 and 2) were unable to compete for preS binding to S33, which encodes for only the third domain (Fig.7). Furthermore, 10 μmGEMSA (an active site inhibitor) does not compete for binding of S33 to preS (Fig. 7).Figure 6A, preS binding to epitope-tagged gp170 and deletion mutants in the presence of gp170 competitor. 293T cells transfected with constructs that are able to bind preS (indicated with the last 2–3 characters of plasmid name) were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met. Aliquots (1 ml) of the labeled extract were premixed with the indicated amounts of purified gp170 (ng).

Furthermore, this activity is similar to that of bovine CPD. A key property that distinguishes CPD from other metallocarboxypeptidases, and which is shared by duck gp180 (or gp170), is the ability to bind to the p-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Sepharose affinity column at pH 5.5, and to remain bound at pH 8.0. Although CPE shares many enzymatic properties with CPD and also binds to the affinity column at pH 5.5, the CPE protein elutes from the affinity column when the pH is raised to 8.0 or higher. This difference is the basis for the purification of CPD from CPE, and the similar binding of mammalian CPD and duck gp180/170 is strong evidence that they are similar proteins. Other similar properties of duck gp180/170 and bovine CPD include the pH optima, the sensitivity to many ions, and the effect of various protease inhibitors. Some of these properties are common to all metallocarboxypeptidases, such as the inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline, which presumably chelates the active site metal (13Woodbury R.G. Everitt M.T.

Moreover, results provided evidence that AII responsiveness of SM α-actin was at least partially dependent on modulation of serum response factor (SRF) binding to the SM α-actin CArGs by the homeodomain containing protein, MHox. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether the degeneracy of the SM α-actin CArGs (both contain a Gua or Cyt substitution in their A/T-rich center) and their reduced SRF binding activity as compared with c-fos serum response element (SRE) is important for conferring cell type-specific expression and AII responsiveness. Transient transfection assays using SM α-actin reporter gene constructs in which the endogenous SM α-actin CArGs were replaced by c-fos SREs demonstrated the following: 1) relaxation of cell-specific expression, 2) a 50% reduction in AII responsiveness, and 3) reduced ability to be transactivated by MHox. In addition, we also showed that the position of the SM α-actin CArGs was important in that interchanging them abolished both basal and AII-induced activities. Taken together, these results suggest that the reduced SRF binding activities of the SM α-actin CArGs and CArG positional context contribute to SMC-specific expression of SM α-actin as well as maximal AII responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2334993460,"N-myc is a short-lived transcription factor, frequently amplified in human neuroblastomas. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in the degradation of many short-lived cellular proteins and previous studies have shown that ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is implicated in the turn-over of N-myc in vitro. However, calpain has also been implicated in N-myc degradation in vitro. Here we report that, in vivo, N-myc is a sensitive substrate for the 26S proteasome in N-myc amplified neuroblastoma cells. We observed that inhibition of the 26S proteasome with two inhibitors, ALLnL and lactacystin, led to an elevation of the N-myc protein steady-state and increased N-myc protein polyubiquitination, as revealed by ubiquitin Western blotting. Pulse-chase experiments have shown that the increased N-myc levels resulted from stabilization of the protein. In contrast treatment with several calpain and cathepsin inhibitors failed to block N-myc degradation in vivo. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy of ALLnL-treated cells localized N-myc exclusively to the nuclear compartment, suggesting the absence of a requirement for transport to the cytoplasm prior to degradation."

The catalytic domain required geldanamycin-inhibitable heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) function to achieve its active protease-resistant conformation, but the src homology 2 (SH2) domain acquired phosphopeptide-binding competence independently of hsp90 function. The SH2 domain of hsp90-bound p56(lck) was folded and functional. In addition to the facilitation by hsp90 of kinase biogenesis, a conditional role in maintenance folding could be demonstrated; although wild type p56(lck) molecules with a negative-regulatory C-terminal tyrosine matured to a nearly hsp90-independent state, p56(lck) molecules with a mutated C-terminal tyrosine continued to require hsp90-mediated maintenance. De novo folding could be distinguished from maintenance folding on the basis of proteolytic fingerprints and the effects of different temperatures on folding behavior. Results indicate that during p56(lck) biogenesis, the SH2 domain rapidly folds independently of hsp90 function, followed by the slower hsp90-dependent folding of the catalytic domain and suggest the final stabilization of p56(lck) structure by phosphorylation-mediated interdomain interactions."

During DNA replication (S phase), these stabilized enzyme-DNA adducts are converted into lethal double-stranded DNA breaks due to their interaction with the DNA replication fork (9Avemann K.

Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar). Although this enzyme participates in numerous cellular processes, strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae deleted for the gene encoding DNA topoisomerase I (top1Δ) are viable because other gene products, such as DNA topoisomerase II, can compensate for the loss of TOP1 (11Holm C.

Genetics. 1995; 141: 465-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thesetop1Δ strains are completely resistant to the cytotoxic action of camptothecin (14Bjornsti M.-A. Benedetti P. Viglianti G.A. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6318-6323PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 16Eng W.-K. Faucette L. Johnson R.K. Sternglanz R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 755-760PubMed Google Scholar). However, expression of either S. cerevisiae or human DNA topoisomerase I restores the sensitivity of these cells to camptothecin-induced lethality (4Bjornsti M.-A. Knab A.M. Benedetti P.

These results demonstrate the specificity of camptothecin for eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I and the utility of using yeast as a model system for the analysis of drug-enzyme interactions. In fact, mutations in yeast and human TOP1 that render the enzyme resistant to camptothecin (17Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Benedetti P. Fiorani P. Capuani L. Wang J.C.

Benedetti, manuscript in preparation.have been defined using this yeast system. These results indicate a significant conservation of function between the yeast and human enzymes, consistent with extensive similarities in TOP1 sequences. Nevertheless, differences between these proteins do exist. For example, expression of a camptothecin-resistant yeast or human DNA topoisomerase I mutant (top1vac) has different effects on the viability of yeast strains defective in the repair of double strand DNA breaks (17Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, these mutant enzymes exhibit different sensitivities to other DNA topoisomerase I poisons, including saintopin, a DNA intercalator that targets both DNA topoisomerase I and II, and the minor groove binding ligand netropsin (21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The human enzyme plays a direct role in transcriptional activation in vitro (22Merino A. Madden K.R. Lane W.S. Champoux J.J. Reinberg D. Nature. 1993; 365: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 23Kretzschmar M. Meisterernet M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1993; 365: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic activity of human DNA topoisomerase I is dispensable for its role in suppressing transcription, the yeast enzyme could not replace the human enzyme in these assays (22Merino A. Madden K.R. Lane W.S. Champoux J.J. Reinberg D. Nature. 1993; 365: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether these observations reflect intrinsic differences in enzyme structure or in specific functional domains that mediate enzyme interactions with other cellular factors. However, because these enzymes constitute the cellular targets of clinically important chemotherapeutic agents, it is essential that the mechanisms of DNA topoisomerase I-induced DNA damage be better understood. Here we investigate the potential differences between yeast and human DNA topoisomerase I with regards to camptothecin-induced cytotoxicity. A family of S. cerevisiae mutants were transiently expressed in mammalian COS cells and examined for their effects on drug-induced apoptosis. These assays included wild-type yeast TOP1 (eScTOP1), the camptothecin-resistant mutant eSctop1vac (17Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a catalytically inactive mutant (eSctop1Y727F) (25Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M.-A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the lethal mutant eSctop1T722A, which mimics that action of camptothecin in stabilizing the covalent enzyme DNA intermediate (20Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12801-12808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Given the difficulties inherent in the selection of cytotoxic phenotypes in mammalian cells, the effects of such lethal mutations on mammalian cell viability have not previously been described. In the studies presented here, expression of yeast wild-type protein enhanced COS cell sensitivity to camptothecin, consistent with earlier observations that overexpression of the human enzyme in mammalian cells enhances their sensitivity to the drug (26Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 525-532PubMed Google Scholar). The phenotypic consequences of overexpressing the other classes of yeasttop1 mutants were also faithfully reiterated in these mammalian cells; no appreciable increase in camptothecin-induced apoptosis was observed in cells expressing eSctop1vac or the inactive mutant eSctop1Y727F, whereas eSctop1T722A expression induced an apoptotic response in the absence of the drug. Moreover, when these yeast enzymes were immunoprecipitated, the activities of the bead-bound enzymes correlated with the observed patterns of drug sensitivity and cell lethality. These results highlight the conservation of enzyme function both in inducing DNA damage and in the cellular responses to this DNA topoisomerase I-mediated damage. An eight-amino acid residue epitope tag, recognized by monoclonal antibody M2 (Kodak/IBI), was engineered into the amino terminus of yeast DNA topoisomerase I. To avoid confusion with the endogenous mammalian enzyme, the yeast gene and its protein products are prefixed with an eSc to indicate the epitope tag (e.g.eScTOP1 and eScTop1p). Complementary oligos encoding the sequence MDYKDDDDKAI were cloned into an NcoI site, previously engineered into the sequences encoding the initiating methionine residue in the eScTOP1 plasmid YCpGAL1-TOP1 (17Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to yield YCpGAL1-eScTOP1. The epitope tag (underlined in the sequence above) was immediately amino-terminal to the original methionine in the fusion protein eScTop1p. The eSctop1Y727F, eSctop1 vac, and eSctop1T722A constructs were prepared by swapping a 989-base pair BamHI-Bsu 36I DNA fragment from YCpGAL1-eTOP1 into the backbones of plasmids YCpGAL1-top1Y727F, YCpGAL1-top1 vac (17Knab A.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and YCpGAL1-top1T722A (20Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12801-12808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), respectively. The resultant eSctop1 constructs were all excised by digestion with MluI and PstI, and the blunted-ended DNA fragments were cloned into the blunt-ended EcoRI site of the pMT2 COS cell expression vector (27Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). COS cells (African green monkey kidney cells transformed with SV40 T antigen) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. All transfections were performed on subconfluent monolayer cultures. Plasmids (30 μg) were transfected into COS cells by the calcium phosphate procedure. The cells were glycerol shocked 5–6 h after DNA addition. Camptothecin (Sigma) was resuspended in Me2SO at a concentration of 10 mm, and aliquots were stored at −20 °C. Prior to adding camptothecin to the tissue culture medium, the drug was serially diluted in fresh Me2SO to equalize the final Me2SO concentration in each experiment. Camptothecin was added to the cells over a final concentration range of 0.001–50 μm. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described by Logan et al. (28Logan T.J. Jordan K.L. Hall D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS cells were plated on 10-cm tissue culture dishes containing glass coverslips at approximately 500,000 cells/plate. The cells were cultured for 24 h and then were transfected with the various eScTOP1expression plasmids (described above). After the glycerol shock, the cells were treated with various concentrations of camptothecin for an additional 24 h. The cells were then washed twice in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min followed by two washes in PBS. To permeabilize the cells, the coverslips were then treated with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min followed by three 5-min washes in PBS containing 0.2% gelatin (as described in Ref. 29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak/IBI) was diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.2% gelatin. Coverslips containing the fixed and permeabilized cells were placed cell side down on 50 μl of diluted antibody and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were then washed three times in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin and inverted on 50 μl of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) diluted to 30 μg/ml in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin. After 30 min at 37 °C, the coverslips were successively washed in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin (10 min), PBS plus 0.2% gelatin plus 0.05% Tween 20 (10 min), and PBS (10 min). The DNA within the nuclei of the cells was then stained with DAPI. 3The abbreviations used are: DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; TBST, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The coverslips were rinsed in deionized water, dried, mounted onto glass slides, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Confocal microscopy was performed on the fluorescein-stained cells, using a Leica TCS 4D confocal microscope with a 100× oil objective lens. The cell thickness was 2.24 μm, and the optical sections taken were 0.24 μm. For the immunoprecipitations, 15 μg of nuclear extract was incubated at 4 °C with 3 μg of M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak/IBI) for one hour. Two micrograms of Staphylococcus protein A acrylamide beads were added to the extracts for an additional 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted, washed five times in NTEN (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris pH 8, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and resuspended in 50 μl of DNA relaxation assay buffer (see below). The immunoprecipitates were assayed in a plasmid DNA relaxation activity as described below. Nuclear extracts for Western blots and activity assays were generated as described by Moberg et al. (30Moberg K.H. Logan T.J. Tyndall W.A. Hall D.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 411-421PubMed Google Scholar), by lysing the cells on ice in 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaCl, and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μg/ml). The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 ×g for 10 min, resuspended in extraction buffer consisting of 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μg/ml) for 10 min on ice and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 8 min to pellet the residual nuclear material. The supernatant fraction was termed nuclear extract. Proteins in the nuclear extracts were electrophoretically resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The blots were then washed in TBST buffer, blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin in TBST for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with the primary antibodies for 30–60 min at room temperature in TBST. The blots were incubated with either a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for yeast DNA topoisomerase I (17Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or with the M2 monoclonal. The blots were then incubated with a 1:7500 dilution of secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse, Vector Laboratories) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at room temperature in TBST. The blot was stained using the Protoblot system from Promega. DNA topoisomerase I activity was assayed by the relaxation of negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA as described previously (17Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts were first equalized for any differences in protein concentration and then serially 10-fold diluted in relaxation assay buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm Na2EDTA, 150 mm KCl, and 50 μg/ml gelatin. 2-μl volumes were then incubated in 20-μl reactions containing relaxation buffer and 0.3 μg of pHC624 DNA (2015 base pair) (17Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h at 30 °C (the optimal growth temperature for yeast). The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1% SDS. The extent of plasmid DNA relaxation was assessed following electrophoresis of the reaction products in a 1% agarose gel in 0.1 m Tris-borate buffer at 5 V/cm for 4 h and subsequent visualization by staining with ethidium bromide. Immunoprecipitates were similarly assayed by incubating the protein-bound beads in a final 100-μl reaction mixture containing relaxation buffer, protease inhibitors (as above), and 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA. Following incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the beads were pelleted, and the plasmid DNA topoisomers (in the supernatant) were phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated, and resolved in 1% agarose gels as detailed above. A single 944-base pair DNA fragment representing a high affinity site was 3′-end labeled with32P-ATP. Approximately 10 ng (5000 cpm) of this labeled fragment was incubated with washed immunoprecipitates, as described above, from cells transfected with either eScTOP1, eSctop1T722A, or the control vector (pMT2). The 50-μl mixtures included 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 4% Me2SO. Where indicated, camptothecin was added to a final concentration of 100 μm. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 1% SDS, heating to 75 °C for 10 min, and treatment with 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K. The cleaved DNA fragments were resolved in a 7 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography (as described in Ref. 21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To investigate the function of yeast DNA topoisomerase I in mammalian cells, an epitope tag was introduced at the amino terminus of the yeast enzyme. The epitope is represented by four amino acids (DYKD) that are specifically recognized by the M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak/IBI). This tag made it possible to efficiently detect the ectopically expressed yeast enzyme by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation of the yeast protein from COS cell nuclear extracts. Along with the wild-type ScTop1 protein, several mutant yeast DNA topoisomerase I genes were also tagged (see Fig. 1 A). One was the catalytically inactive mutant Sctop1Y727F, in which the active site tyrosine was changed to phenylalanine (25Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M.-A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In a second yeast mutant enzyme, Top1vacp, the two amino acid residues immediately amino-terminal to the active site tyrosine, Ile725 and Asn726, were mutated to the Arg and Ala residues found at the corresponding position in the camptothecin-resistant vaccinia virus DNA topoisomerase I (17Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M.-A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These substitutions render the catalytically active yeast Top1vac enzyme resistant to camptothecin-induced DNA cleavage (4Bjornsti M.-A. Knab A.M. Benedetti P. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1994; 34: S1-S5Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A third yeast mutant, top1T722A, is lethal when overexpressed in yeast cells, even in the absence of camptothecin, as discussed below (20Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12801-12808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The introduction of the epitope tag had no detectable effect on the catalytic activity of partially purified preparations of wild-type and mutant DNA topoisomerase I (data not shown). In addition, the camptothecin-sensitive, camptothecin-resistant, and lethal phenotypes associated with overexpression of ScTOP1 Sctop1Y727F, Sctop1vac, and Sctop1T722A, respectively, were unaffected by the epitope tag in top1Δ yeast strains. 4C. Hann and M.-A. Bjornsti, unpublished observations. To assess the function of the yeast enzymes in higher eukaryotic cells, the genes encoding eScTop1p, eScTop1Y727Fp, eScTop1T722Ap, and eScTop1vacp were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pMT2. High levels of gene expression can be achieved when this vector is introduced into COS cells (African green monkey) (27Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 31Pyrc J. Logan T.J. Hall D.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 1085-1091PubMed Google Scholar). These pMT2eSctop1 constructs were then transiently transfected into COS cells, along with the vector alone as a negative control. After a period of 24 h, nuclear extracts were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and the proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose. The epitope-tagged yeast enzymes were visualized by probing the blots with either the M2 monoclonal antibody or an anti-ScTop1 specific polyclonal antibody, followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. As shown in Fig.1 B, the ectopically expressed eScTop1 and eScTop1Y727F proteins were specifically recognized by the M2 and anti-ScTop1p antibodies and were expressed to equivalent levels in COS cells. The proteins were intact and migrated to a position expected for their size (approximately 90 kDa) (17Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with nuclear extracts of COS cells transfected with pMT2eSctop1vac, shown in Fig.1 C. Over a number of experiments, the levels of expression of the wild-type and mutant enzymes appeared to be equal and the enzymes appeared to be of equal stability. To ensure that the yeast proteins were targeted to the nucleus, indirect immunofluorescence was performed on cells 24 h after transfection. In these experiments, the M2 monoclonal antibody was used as the primary antibody, whereas the secondary antimouse antibody used was conjugated to fluorescein. As can be seen in the photomicrographs in Fig. 2, the eScTop1, eScTop1Y727F, and eScTop1vac proteins accumulate in the nuclei, indicating that the yeast enzymes contain nuclear localization sequences efficiently recognized by the mammalian nuclear transport machinery. The fluorescence appeared to be uniformly distributed throughout the nuclei for all the enzymes shown. At lighter exposures of the fluorescence and at lower levels of expression, these proteins are clearly present in the nucleoli (data not shown), consistent with previous reports (32Danks M.K. Garrett K.E. Marion R.C. Whipple D.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1664-1673PubMed Google Scholar, 33Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.C. Kaufman S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1674-1681PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies have indicated that the DNA topoisomerase I may also be localized to other sites within the nucleus such as the nuclear membrane (32Danks M.K. Garrett K.E. Marion R.C. Whipple D.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1664-1673PubMed Google Scholar, 33Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.C. Kaufman S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1674-1681PubMed Google Scholar). Although the eScTop1 protein in COS cells appears to be distributed uniformly throughout the nucleus, the intensity of the staining precluded any assessment of a perinuclear distribution. To determine whether the protein was targeted to the nuclear membrane, the fluorescent positive eScTop1p cells were viewed by confocal microscopy. Shown in Fig. 3,a–l, are 0.24 μm optical sections of a fluorescein positive cell (the same cell stained with DAPI is shown in Fig. 3 m). The epitope-tagged yeast enzyme appears to be localized near the inner surface of the nuclear membrane. When the fluorescence intensity was measured across the nucleus in a single optical section, in the direction of the arrow at the top of Fig. 4, the intensity was maximal at positions corresponding to the nuclear membrane (Fig. 4,bottom).Figure 4The eScTop1 protein exhibits a perinuclear distribution. An optical section of a fluorescent-positive nuclei (from Fig. 3 above) was processed for densitometry, laterally across the image of the nuclei. The arrow next to the nucleus shows the direction of the densitometric scan. The scan was quantitated (relative intensity versus relative distance across the cell) and plotted as shown. The peaks of intensity from the scan (bottom) correspond to the region overlapping the nuclear membrane (top).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To next assess whether the ectopically expressed yeast enzymes were catalytically active, nuclear extracts of transfected COS cells were prepared, and equal amounts were incubated with negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA in a relaxation assay (as described in Refs. 14Bjornsti M.-A. Benedetti P. Viglianti G.A. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6318-6323PubMed Google Scholar and 17Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2011996576,"The 393-base pair minimal origin,oriV, of plasmid RK2 contains three iterated motifs essential for initiation of replication: consensus sequences for binding the bacterial DnaA protein, DnaA boxes, which have recently been shown to bind the DnaA protein; 17-base pair direct repeats, iterons, which bind the plasmid encoded replication protein, TrfA; and A + T-rich repeated sequences, 13-mers, which serve as the initial site of helix destabilization. To investigate how the organization of the RK2 origin contributes to the mechanism of replication initiation, mutations were introduced into the minimal origin which altered the sequence and/or spacing of each particular region relative to the rest of the origin. These altered origins were analyzed for replication activity in vivo and in vitro, for localized strand opening and for DnaB helicase mediated unwinding. Mutations in the region between the iterons and the 13-mers which altered the helical phase or the intrinsic DNA curvature prevented strand opening of the origin and consequently abolished replication activity. Insertions of more or less than one helical turn between the DnaA boxes and the iterons also inactivated the replication origin. In these mutants, however, strand opening appeared normal but the levels of DnaB helicase activity were substantially reduced. These results demonstrate that correct helical phasing and intrinsic DNA curvature are critical for the formation of an open complex and that the DnaA boxes must be on the correct side of the helix to load DnaB helicase. The 393-base pair minimal origin,oriV, of plasmid RK2 contains three iterated motifs essential for initiation of replication: consensus sequences for binding the bacterial DnaA protein, DnaA boxes, which have recently been shown to bind the DnaA protein; 17-base pair direct repeats, iterons, which bind the plasmid encoded replication protein, TrfA; and A + T-rich repeated sequences, 13-mers, which serve as the initial site of helix destabilization.

Many plasmid replicons isolated from Gram-negative bacteria contain at their origin clusters of iterated repeats as well as consensus binding sites for the DnaA protein (for review, see Ref. 1Helinski D.R.

Most have evolved various replication initiation strategies utilizing the concerted action of a plasmid-specific protein and the host DnaA protein. Interestingly, the organization of the origin region of most narrow host range plasmids such as P1, F, pSC101, and R6K as well as the Escherichia coli chromosome, oriC, consists of DnaA boxes immediately adjacent to the A + T-rich region with the polarity of the DnaA boxes corresponding to the direction of replication (see Ref. 2Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is not the case with the broad host range plasmid RK2 (3Figurski D.H. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl.

It is possible that this organization contributes to an initiation mechanism which allows for replication of this plasmid in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. The TrfA protein exists in two forms, 44 and 33 kDa, as a result of an internal translational start in the trfA gene; both are functional in E. coli (9Durland R.H. Helinski D.R. Plasmid. 1987; 18: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Fang F.C. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5861-5868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified TrfA protein is largely dimeric but binds as a monomer (11Toukdarian A.E. Helinski D.R. Perri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7072-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to the 17-bp iterons at oriV. The sequence requirement for TrfA binding has been well studied (12Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Perri S. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3662-3669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of TrfA to the iteron sequences, with the assistance of either HU or DnaA, results in strand opening in the A + T-rich region specifically at the four 13-mers (L, M1, M2, and R) present within this region (14Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This thermodynamically unstable 13-mer motif is commonly found in plasmid replicons as well as in oriC(15Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 54: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and serves as the site of strand opening and the subsequent entry for the DnaB·DnaC complex (16Kobori J.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A.

In the case of RK2, once DnaB helicase is loaded at the open 13-mer region, replication proceeds unidirectionally toward the G + C-rich region (19Meyer R.J. Helinski D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 478: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The E. coli DnaA protein binds specifically to four 9-bp consensus sequences, DnaA boxes, arranged as inverted pairs in the RK2 origin immediately upstream of the iterons (14Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The DnaA protein enhances or stabilizes the formation of the TrfA-mediated open complex (14Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but the nature of this interaction in not yet understood. Additionally, DnaA is required to recruit DnaB to oriVduring RK2 replication initiation (20Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). DnaB recruitment to oriV is similar to that observed for oriC which is facilitated through a DnaA-DnaB protein interaction (2Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed (20Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that the initial recruitment of DnaB occurs at the four upstream DnaA boxes and that a rearrangement of this prepriming complex is required for the correct positioning of either the DnaB·DnaC complex or DnaB at the open region of oriV. In this study we examine how the positioning of various regions in the RK2 minimal origin effect its replication activity in E. coli, specifically the initiation of replication including the key steps of localized strand opening and DnaB helicase loading. The data indicate that helical phasing and intrinsic DNA curvature are critical factors for the formation of a functional nucleoprotein structure and advance our understanding of the mechanism of RK2 replication initiation.

Plasmid pKD19L1 is a dual RK2-R6K mini-replicon derived from pTJS42 (24Schmidhauser T.J. Filutowicz M. Helinski D.R.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6557-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. Ken Timmis). The HpaII fragment containing the minimal five iteron RK2 origin (6Stalker D.M. Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) along with the multiple cloning sites of pUC19 was subcloned as anEcoRI-HindIII fragment from pSP6 into pTJS42, replacing the existing minimal oriV sequence to yield pTJS42*. The R6K γ origin from pUTKM was cleaved with EcoRI-BamHI, blunted, and inserted into the filled in EcoRI site of pTJS42* to yield pKD19L1. Commercially available reagents were from the following sources: creatine phosphate, rNTPs, and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) from Sigma; dNTPs from Pharmacia; [methyl-3H]dTTP from ICN radiochemicals; [γ-32P]ATP 6,000 Ci/mmol from NEN Life Science Products; Ultra Clean DNA purification kit, MolBio Laboratories. All oligonucleotide primers used for PCR or primer extension were synthesized by OPERON, Inc. Mutagenesis was performed following the protocol of either ExSite or QuickChange PCR-based Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Inc.) except that Pfu DNA polymerase (26Lundberg K.S. Shoemaker D.D. Adams M.W.W. Short J.M. Sorge J.A. Mathur E.J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) was used in every case. Primers used for mutagenesis were designed according to manufacturers recommendations and included the recognition sequence for either EcoRI or BamHI. Amplification on template DNA, pSP6, was for 9–18 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 8 min. the KpnI-XbaI fragment from pSP6 containing the mutated oriV sequence was subcloned into pKD19L1 replacing the wild-type origin. Unlike the other derivatives, oriV Δ GC was not generated by PCR but by cutting pKD19L1 oriV 4–6 (which has an additional BamHI site due to the insertion) with BamHI and religating which resulted in a deletion of 65 bp. Plasmids containing a mutated oriV in pKD19L1 were obtained and maintained in E. coli strain CC118 (λpir) on Luria-Bertani agar plates supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline. To test for oriV function in vivo, plasmids were purified through two CsCl buoyant density gradients and between 200 and 500 ng was used for the transformation of the parent E. coli strain, CC118, where replication can be initiated only from the RK2 origin. Preparation of E. coli C600 crude extracts (FII) competent for RK2 replication and reaction conditions were essentially as described (27Kittell B.L. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 0.3 μg of DNA template and the indicated amounts of His6-TrfA 254D/267L protein. Incubation was at 32 °C for 60 min. Permanganate (KMnO4) footprinting and primer extension using PCR were carried out as described previously (14Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A 24-mer primer (5′-GCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTC-3′) was used for the top strand analysis and a 25-mer primer (5′-GAATTCATCCAGCATTTGCAAGGGT-3′) for bottom strand analysis. Where indicated, reactions contained 420 ng of TrfA (His6-TrfA 254D/267L) protein and 625 ng of DnaA protein. 8 ng of HU protein was present in all reactions. Assays were performed as essentially as described previously (20Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Reactions (25 μl) contained 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4% (w/v) sucrose, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 11 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mmATP, 500 mm (each) CTP, GTP, UTP, 20 mmcreatine phosphate, 20 μg/ml creatine kinase, 160 ng of SSB, 160 ng of DNA gyrase, 125 ng of DnaB, 625 ng of DnaA, 24 ng of DnaC, 300 ng of DNA template (containing wild-type or mutated oriV), and 560 ng of His6-TrfA 254D/267L. Incubation was at 32 °C for 30 min and reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 10 mm and SDS to 2.5% followed by incubation at 65 °C for 2 min. The samples were electrophoresed at 25 V for 20–22 h in a 1% agarose gel in 90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 2 mm EDTA, then stained with ethidium bromide. The percent of FI* conversion was measured using densitometry scans. Static bending of oriV containing fragments was determined directly by mobility in 5% polyacrylamide gels run at 100 V for 4 h at 4 °C. 1 μg of plasmid template (pKD19L1) was cleaved with KpnI-XbaI to generate fragments containing wild-type or mutated origins. The apparent molecular weight of each fragment was determined using the Alpha Innotech Imaging System. The DNA sequence required for the binding of the TrfA protein to the iteron region has been well characterized (12Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Perri S. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3662-3669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the DnaA protein binds to four DnaA boxes just upstream of the iterons (14Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the importance of the spatial arrangement of the DnaA boxes, iterons, and the A + T-rich (including 13-mers) and G + C-rich regions within the RK2 minimal origin. In this work mutants with altered spacing were constructed in four different areas of oriV: between the iterons and the A + T-rich region, oriV 1; within the A + T-rich region itself, oriV 2; between the DnaA boxes and the iterons,oriV 3; and between the A + T- and G + C-rich regions,oriV 4 (Fig. 1). Mutants were generated by PCR and subcloned into a dual origin (RK2-R6Kγ) plasmid, pKD19L1. All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis (data not shown). pKD19L1 derivatives can replicate by the R6Kγ origin in E. coli strain CC118 (λpir) which supplies the replication protein required for R6K replication (25Herrero M. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6557-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar); however, in the parent strain, CC118, replication can only be initiated by the RK2 origin. Thus, the ratio of transformation frequencies obtained in CC118versus CC118 (λpir) was used to quantitateoriV function in vivo. Ratios obtained for oriV mutants were normalized against the ratio obtained for pKD19L1 (wild-type oriV) (TableI). The insertion of 6 bp (approximately half of one helical turn) in the first three regions (oriV1, oriV 2, and oriV 3) inactivated or greatly reduced replication activity. Only the insertion at the start of the G + C-rich region (oriV 4–6) had little to no affect on plasmid replication.Table IEffect of insertion mutations on the transformation frequency of oriV templatesOrigin template1-2001Both mutant and wild-type origins are contained on plasmid pKD19L1.CC118CC118λ pirCC118/CC118 λpir1-bRatio of transformants of CC118 (pir-) and CC118 λpir (pir+) normalized to wild-type.relative %oriV wt1.1 × 1042.6 × 104100oriV 1–601 × 1050oriV 2–65 × 1005.8 × 104<0.01oriV 3–63 × 1011-2003Transformants exhibited a slower growth rate.3.4 × 1040.2oriV 4–68.2 × 1032 × 104971-2001 Both mutant and wild-type origins are contained on plasmid pKD19L1.1-b Ratio of transformants of CC118 (pir-) and CC118 λpir (pir+) normalized to wild-type.1-2003 Transformants exhibited a slower growth rate. Open table in a new tab The mutants that were effected by the altered spacing (oriV1–6, oriV 2–6, and oriV 3–6) were further analyzed for replication activity in vitro using an in vitro replication assay that has been described previously (27Kittell B.L. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This assay utilizes a 40% (NH4)2SO4 fraction from a solubleE. coli extract to replicate supercoiled DNA containing an RK2 origin in the presence of initiator protein, TrfA. Fig.2 shows DNA synthesis for wild-type and mutant oriV templates in response to increasing amounts of TrfA protein. In this assay as well as all other in vitroexperiments performed here and described previously (11Toukdarian A.E. Helinski D.R. Perri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7072-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol.

Helinski, manuscript in preparation. 33-kDa TrfA mutant protein (His6-TrfA 254D/267L) which exhibits elevated iteron binding (23Blasina A. Kittell B.L. Toukdarian A.E. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3559-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was used. Wild-type oriV template reached maximal DNA replication levels with 0.56 μg of His6-TrfA 254D/267L protein (Fig.2) and was inhibited by greater amounts of protein (data not shown). Replication reactions with oriV 1–6 and oriV2–6 remained at background levels, while oriV 3–6 responded somewhat to higher levels of His6-TrfA 254D/267L. This is consistent with the in vivo transformation results whereoriV 3–6 did allow the establishment of a low level of transformants which exhibited a slower growth rate than wild-type transformants. To rule out the possibility that the lack of function of mutated origins observed in vivo and in vitro was due to the inability of the TrfA initiator protein to bind to the iterons in the mutant constructs, we utilized a gel mobility shift assay with fragments containing wild-type and mutant origins and the His6-TrfA 254D/267L protein. Each of the mutant oriV derivatives displayed binding of all five iterons at comparable protein levels as observed for wild-type oriV (data not shown). We have recently shown that strand opening in the A + T-rich region of oriV is mediated by the TrfA protein when assisted by HU or DnaA, but the extent of opening is enhanced or stabilized with the DnaA protein (14Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant oriV derivatives in pKD19L1 were analyzed for opening activity by His6-TrfA 254D/267L with and without DnaA protein using KMnO4 as a chemical probe. Fig. 3 shows the results of primer extension of KMnO4-treated templates for both the top (panel A) and bottom (panel B) strands of oriV. Wild-type oriV showed the expected pattern, detecting KMnO4 modification of thymines on the top strand at positions 500–544 which corresponds to the four 13-mers, respectively (L, M1, M2, and R), and the bottom strand at position 519–531 which corresponds to the one 13-mer oriented in the opposite direction (M2) (14Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mutant oriV 1–6 which has a 6-bp insertion between the iterons and the 13-mers exhibited no modification by KMnO4 in the 13-mer region on either strand indicating the absence of any open structure. Mutant oriV 2–6 exhibited some modification at the positions of the L and R 13-mers although the pattern of modification at the L 13-mer was shifted upward in the gel. However, no modification of the middle 13-mers at the site of the 6-bp insertion was observed. Similarly, the bottom strand analysis of oriV 2–6 showed a reduced level of modification with a shift in some of the modified thymines at the beginning of the M2 13-mer (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the insertion in the M2 13-mer disrupted the region of helical instability required for strand opening. Mutant oriV 3–6 displayed the same pattern of modification as wild-type oriV on both stands, indicating that this insertion upstream of the iterons had no affect on the formation of the TrfA·DnaA-mediated open complex. Following strand opening at the A + T-rich region, DnaB helicase is recruited through a protein-protein interaction with DnaA (20Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and then must be loaded at the open region of oriV to facilitate further template unwinding. In the presence of DNA gyrase this unwound form is converted to a highly negatively supercoiled DNA, FI*, which migrates more rapidly on an agarose gel than normally supercoiled DNA, FI (17Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1986; 45: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Previously it has been demonstrated that unwinding of wild-type oriV supercoiled templates requires TrfA, DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, DNA gyrase, HU, SSB, and ATP (20Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The same assay was used to compare wild-type and mutant oriVtemplates for their ability to serve as substrates for DnaB helicase unwinding. Upon the addition of His6-TrfA 254D/267L protein to the reaction, 50% (using densitrometry scans) of the wild-typeoriV template was converted to the faster migrating FI* species (Fig. 4). No FI* was observed for mutant templates oriV 1–6 and oriV 2–6. The lack of DnaB unwinding activity in mutant oriV 2–6 suggests that the small amount of strand opening that was observed in oriV 2–6 (see Fig. 3) was not sufficient for DnaB loading. The formation of FI* was observed for mutant oriV 3–6, however, densitometric quantitation indicated that only 33% of the original supercoiled template was converted to the FI* form. This mutant reproducibly showed significantly less FI* formation than the wild-type template. Additionally, when the assay was performed in the presence of varying amounts of the DnaB and DnaC proteins, FI* formation occurred at a lower level of the two proteins for the wild-type oriV template than for the oriV 3–6 template (data not shown). These observations indicate that the 6-bp insertion in the oriV 3 region, between the DnaA boxes and the iterons, effects the efficiency of DnaB loading at the open complex. To determine whether the loss of function observed by altering spacing within mutants oriV 1–6 and oriV 3–6 was due to the disruption of a defined helical positioning or a specific sequence requirement, we constructed additional mutants in the regions of oriV 1 and oriV 3 (see Fig. 1). Mutations were made using PCR as described previously in the exact position, unless noted, as the original 6-bp insertion incorporating the same restriction enzyme recognition sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”). New mutations in oriV are shown in TableII and include; oriV 1–6P, a 6-bp insertion just 7 bp upstream of oriV 1–6;oriV 1s, a 6-bp substitution; oriV 1–11, an 11-bp insertion; oriV 3–11, an 11-bp insertion; and oriV 3–17, a 17-bp insertion. Also a mutant was constructed which contained a deletion of almost the entire G + C-rich region,oriV Δ GC. Since the original 6-bp insertion in this region had no effect (Table I), it was of interest to assess the importance of this region. All mutant derivatives were analyzed for origin function in vivo by the transformation assay and in vitro using the in vitro replication assay (Table II).Table IIProperties of oriV derivativesOrigin template2-2001Both mutated and wild-type origins are contained on plasmid pKD19L1.Sequence of mutants 5′ to 3′2-bSequence that was inserted or substituted is shown in bold underline.Spacing2-2003The spacing change is expressed relative to the wild-type origin.Relative transformation frequency2-dTransformation frequency and in vitro replication activity are normalized to that of the wild-type origin.Relative activity in vitro 2-dTransformation frequency and in vitro replication activity are normalized to that of the wild-type origin.(%)oriVwt0100100oriV1–6AAAGAATTCATCCAGPlus 603oriV1–6P2-2005Mutation is an insertion 7 bp upstream of the oriV 1–6 insertion site.AGGAATTCGCAGAAAATCCAGPlus 6013oriV1sAAAGAATTC02940oriV1–11AAAGAATTCGTCAGAACCAGPlus 115578oriV2–6AACGAATTCCAATATPlus 6010oriV3–6GCCGAATTCCTGCGGPlus 60.219oriV3–11GCCGAATTCGTCAGCTGCGGPlus 118786oriV3–17GCCGAATTCGTCAGTGGATCCTGCGGPlus 17010oriV4–6GGCGGATCCTGCGCCPlus 69787oriVΔGCGGCG- - - - - - - - - - -Minus 62112922-2001 Both mutated and wild-type origins are contained on plasmid pKD19L1.2-b Sequence that was inserted or substituted is shown in bold underline.2-2003 The spacing change is expressed relative to the wild-type origin.2-d Transformation frequency and in vitro replication activity are normalized to that of the wild-type origin.2-2005 Mutation is an insertion 7 bp upstream of the oriV 1–6 insertion site. Open table in a new tab In the region between the DnaA boxes and the iterons the insertion of half of a helical turn, mutant oriV 3–6, reduced origin activity, but the insertion of a full helical turn, mutantoriV 3–11, restored origin activity close to that of wild-type. Also, the insertion of one and a half helical turns, mutantoriV 3–17, inactivated oriV function (Table II). Additionally, we observed no DnaB activity on the oriV 3–17 template as evidenced by the absence of FI* formation (data not shown). This suggests that the helical phasing in this region is critical for the loading of DnaB helicase at the open region. It should be noted that the DnaA protein was still capable of binding to oriVmutant derivatives using a gel retardation assay (data not presented). Mutations in the region between the iterons and the 13-mers,oriV 1, showed that specific helical positioning as well as a specific sequence contribute to origin function. A 6-bp insertion at a different position, mutant oriV 1–6P, again resulted in a complete inactivation of oriV. The insertion of a full helical turn in the oriV 1 region, oriV 1–11, partially restored activity, although only 55–78% that of wild-type (Table II). Mutant oriV 1s, which has a substitute sequence with wild-type spacing, surprisingly was only somewhat active compared with wild-type oriV, suggesting that in addition to helical phasing there is an actual sequence requirement in this region. The deletion of the G + C-rich region had little to no affect on origin function as results showed that the activity of oriV Δ GC was close to that of oriV wild-type. It is important to note that this region is 80% G + C-rich in wild-type oriV, while the adjoining sequence from the plasmid vector in the oriVΔ GC construct is only"

https://openalex.org/W2074319644,"Factor Va, the essential cofactor for prothrombinase, is phosphorylated on the acidic COOH terminus of the heavy chain of the cofactor, at Ser692, by a platelet membrane-associated casein kinase II (CKII). Consistent with this observation, phosphorylation of the factor Va heavy chain by the platelet kinase was inhibited by heparin. The membrane-associated platelet CKII kinase was partially purified using heparin-agarose, phosphocellulose, and ion exchange chromatography. CKII antigen was monitored using a polyclonal antibody to the α-subunit, and kinase activity in the various fractions was confirmed using human factor Va as a substrate. Immunoblotting experiments using polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides mimicking a portion of the deduced amino acid sequence of the α-, α′-, and β-subunits of human CKII demonstrated the coexistence of both α- and α′-subunits in platelets and suggested that the platelet CKII kinase may exist in part as an αα′β2 complex. It is also possible that there are two distinct populations of CKII in platelets, one that is αα/ββ and one that is α′α′/ββ. In the presence of the purified platelet-derived CKII, human factor Va incorporates between 0.8 and 1.3 mol of phosphate/mol of factor Va depending on the concentration of the β-subunit in the kinase preparation. A peptide mimicking the sequence 687–705 of the human factor V molecule incorporates radioactivity in the presence of purified CKII and inhibits factor Va heavy chain phosphorylation by the platelet CKII. In contrast, a peptide with an alanine instead of a serine at position 692 neither incorporates phosphate nor inhibits factor Va phosphorylation by the platelet CKII. Human factor Va is inactivated by activated protein C following three cleavages of the heavy chain at Arg506, Arg306, and Arg679. Cleavage at Arg506 is necessary for efficient exposure of the inactivating cleavage site at Arg306. The phosphorylated cofactor has increased susceptibility to inactivation by activated protein C, since phosphorylated factor Va was found to be inactivated approximately 3-fold faster than its native counterpart. Acceleration of the inactivation process of the phosphorylated cofactor occurs because of acceleration of the rate of cleavage at Arg506. These data suggest a critical role for factor Va phosphorylation on the surface of platelets in regulating cofactor activity. Factor Va, the essential cofactor for prothrombinase, is phosphorylated on the acidic COOH terminus of the heavy chain of the cofactor, at Ser692, by a platelet membrane-associated casein kinase II (CKII).

Acceleration of the inactivation process of the phosphorylated cofactor occurs because of acceleration of the rate of cleavage at Arg506. These data suggest a critical role for factor Va phosphorylation on the surface of platelets in regulating cofactor activity. Coagulation factor Va is the cofactor for prothrombinase (1Kalafatis M. Swords N.A. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factor Va combines with the serine protease factor Xa on a phospholipid or platelet surface in the presence of divalent cations to catalyze the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Factor Xa alone can activate prothrombin to α-thrombin. However, the binding of factor Va to factor Xa on a membrane surface in the presence of Ca2+increases the efficiency of the complex by 5 orders of magnitude as compared with factor Xa alone (3Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the factor V is found in the plasma, where it circulates at a concentration of 7 μg/ml (20 nm). Approximately 20% of the total human factor V found in whole human blood originates from the platelets' α-granules (4Tracy P.B Eide L.L Bowie E.J.W. Mann K.G. Blood. 1982; 60: 59-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factor V circulates in plasma as a large single chain protein with a Mr of 330,000 (5Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequences for human and bovine factor V have been already determined (6Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 7Guinto E.R.

Thrombin cleaves single chain factor V to give rise to the active cofactor (factor Va), which participates in the activation of prothrombin (5Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The factor Va resulting from α-thrombin cleavage is composed of a heavy chain of Mr 105,000 containing the NH2-terminal part of the factor V molecule (A1-A2 domains) and a light chain of Mr 74,000 that derives from the COOH-terminal end of the cofactor (A3-C1-C2 domains). Factor Va is inactivated by activated protein C (APC) 1The abbreviations used are: APC, activated protein C; CKII, casein kinase II; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; APSF, activated platelet soluble fraction; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; PCPS vesicles, phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% phosphatidylcholine, 25% phosphatidylserine. 1The abbreviations used are: APC, activated protein C; CKII, casein kinase II; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; APSF, activated platelet soluble fraction; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; PCPS vesicles, phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% phosphatidylcholine, 25% phosphatidylserine. in the presence of a membrane surface (8Kalafatis M.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). APC inactivates human factor Va by cleavage at Arg506, Arg306, and Arg679. Cleavage at Arg506 is necessary for efficient exposure of the inactivating, lipid-dependent cleavage site at Arg306 (9Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The expression of the cofactor's catalytic activity requires the presence of a phospholipid or cell surface. Factor Va interaction with the lipid bilayer is promoted by two regions located on the light chain of the cofactor: a binding site located on the carboxyl-terminal part of the A3 domain, which involves hydrophobic interactions, and a binding site located on the C2 domain involving Ca2+-independent electrostatic interactions (10Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the catalytic behavior of the prothrombinase complex on activated platelets is kinetically equivalent to the same phenomenon using synthetic phospholipid vesicles in the bovine system. Factor Va binds to platelets in a specific manner, and the binding involves high and low affinity binding sites with dissociation constants of 0.3 and 3 nm, respectively (11Tracy P.B. Peterson J.M. Nesheim M.E. McDuffie F.C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10354-10361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor V binds to platelets with aKd of 3 nm. The number of binding sites and their affinity are not affected by the state of platelet activation. Early data have shown that platelet membranes possess protein kinase activity, which can phosphorylate endogenous platelet membrane proteins as well as exogenous proteins (12Steiner M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 171: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of proteins has been previously shown to occur upon activation of platelets. It has been thus proposed that protein phosphorylation could be involved in hemostasis and thrombosis during blood clotting (13Kork-Grodzieki B. Tauber-Finkelstein M. Shaltiel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7541-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Further, it has been demonstrated that thrombin stimulation of platelets results in the activation of 14 new electrophoretically distinct, serine/threonine protein kinases (14Ferrell Jr., J.E. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20723-20729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activation of seven of the 14 new kinases was correlated with platelet secretion and aggregation. On the other hand, it has been repeatedly shown that human platelets contain a protein possessing casein kinase II (CKII) activity (15Papanicolaou P. Humble E. Engstrom L. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Krust B. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Heldin P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 257: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Chiang T.M. Kang A.H. Arch.

Commun. 1983; 113: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It has thus been proposed that the plasma protein kinases may originate from platelets, since no kinase activity seems to be present in human blood plasma. Finally, immunoelectron microscopy (20Hoyt C.H. Oh C.J. Beekman J.B. Litchfield D.W. Lerea K.M. Blood. 1994; 83: 3517-3523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently provided evidence for the presence of CKII in platelets. Recent data have demonstrated that bovine coagulation factor Va incorporates 32PO4 into the heavy chain in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and a platelet kinase contained in the activated platelet soluble fraction (APSF) following activation of human platelets by α-thrombin (21Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Jenny R.J. Ehrlich Y.H. Mann K.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 704-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that human plasma factor Va is stoichiometrically phosphorylated on both the heavy and light chains in the presence of whole platelets (platelet membranes plus APSF) (22Rand M.D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Blood. 1992; 83: 2180-2190Crossref Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of factor Va on the heavy chain implicates a platelet protein-kinase that has many similarities with CKII (20Hoyt C.H. Oh C.J. Beekman J.B. Litchfield D.W. Lerea K.M. Blood. 1994; 83: 3517-3523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas factor Va light chain is phosphorylated by a platelet protein kinase C isoform (21Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Jenny R.J. Ehrlich Y.H. Mann K.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 704-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to identify and characterize the platelet kinase that phosphorylates the heavy chain of factor Va. HEPES, ATP, diisopropyl phosphofluoridate, bovine serum albumin, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidyl serine, 2-mercaptoethanol, heparin-agarose resin, heparin salt, and sodium pyrophosphate were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Heparin-agarose and Q-Sepharose fast flow resins were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and phosphocellulose was obtained from Whatman. The α-thrombin inhibitor, hirudin, was obtained from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Bio-Beads SM-2 adsorbent was purchased from Bio-Rad. Thromboplastin was purchased from Organon Teknika Corp. (Durham, NC). Purified casein kinase II from sea star (Ptilocerus ochraceus) as well as the polyclonal antibody against the α-subunit of human CKII were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Human prothrombin, thrombin, factor V, bovine factor Va, and bovine factor Va heavy and light chains were purified according to previously described methods (23Lundblad R.L. Kingdom H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 24Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G.

Platelet membranes, the fluorescent thrombin inhibitor dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl) amide, human factor Xa, and human APC were gifts from Drs. Paul Haley and Richard Jenny (Hematologic Technologies Inc, Essex Junction, VT). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against specific epitopes of the α-, α′-, and β-subunits of human casein kinase II were prepared as described (27Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Cicirelli M.F. Harrylock M. Ericsson L.H. Piening C.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20380-20389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were provided by Dr. David Litchfield (University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada). Two peptides were synthesized (peptides 67 and 73). These peptides correspond to the region 687–705 of human factor V (6Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Peptide 67 has the sequence PEDEESDADYDYQNRLAAA, whereas peptide 73 has an alanine instead of a serine at position 692 (underlined within the sequence of peptide 67). The peptides were prepared following a previously described method (28Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6680) Google Scholar). Single donor platelet packs from 50–150 donors were pooled, and platelets were washed and isolated as described (29Mustard J.F. Perry D.W. Ardlie N.G. Packham M.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1972; 22: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 200 ml of Tyrode's solution. Platelets were activated by thrombin (1 unit/ml). Following the addition of 25 μm Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, the solution was centrifuged, the supernatant was collected, and the platelet membranes were stored at −20 °C. Frozen platelet membranes were thawed at 37 °C and solubilized in HEPES (20 mm), NaCl (0.15 m), CaCl2 (2 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), pH 7.4 (HBS++), containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and diisopropyl phosphofluoridate (2 mm). The solution was mixed frequently, pulse-sonicated on ice (3 × 5 min), and centrifuged for 30 min (10,000 × g). Further steps of purification were carried out (at 4 °C) on the supernatant, which contains the solubilized platelet membrane CKII. All of the chromatography columns were preequilibrated with HBS++ buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After eluting each column, fractions were analyzed on an 8–18% linear gradient vertical slab SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206965) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions. Transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane was performed as described (31Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44885) Google Scholar), and the presence of the α-subunit of CKII was confirmed by using a commercially available rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide spanning region 70–91 of the α-subunit of human CKII using chemiluminescence. Fractions containing the CKII antigen were pooled and dialyzed overnightversus HBS++, containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The supernatant obtained following centrifugation of activated platelets was loaded onto a heparin-agarose column (100 ml). The column was washed with the equilibration buffer (HBS++), and elution was performed with a continuous gradient (0.15–1.0 m NaCl in HBS++, 0.5% Triton X-100). Fractions of 5 ml were collected. The positive fractions were pooled, and the pool was assessed for the presence of the CKII-like kinase activity using human factor Va or bovine factor Va heavy chain as a substrate. Following dialysis, the heparin-agarose eluate was loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (65 ml). The column was washed with HBS++ and then eluted with a NaCl gradient (0.15–0.5m NaCl in HBS++, 0.5% Triton X-100). Fractions of 3 ml were collected. Fractions containing the CKII-like kinase antigen and activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight as described above in HBS++. The dialyzed pooled fractions obtained from the phosphocellulose column were loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (3 ml). Washing and eluting the column was performed as described above (using a NaCl gradient of 0.15–2.0 mNaCl in HBS++, 0.5% Triton X-100). Since the platelet CKII was still eluted in a large volume, the pooled fractions containing CKII antigen and activity were dialyzed against HBS++ and loaded onto a 3-ml heparin-agarose column. Elution was performed with 1m NaCl, and 300–400 μl fractions were collected. Following dialysis, the kinase was kept at −80 °C in small aliquots (100 μl). Based on activity as compared with the commercially available CKII, a total of approximately 20–40 μg of the partially purified platelet CKII was obtained from 100 units of platelets. Under these conditions, the kinase activity was stable for 4–5 months. Purified human factor V, bovine factor Va, and bovine factor Va heavy chain were used as substrates for the platelet CKII. To demonstrate that kinase activity was present in the pooled fractions, a control phosphorylation reaction was performed in which a fraction that did not show immunoreactivity with the anti-CKII antibody was used as a source of kinase to phosphorylate the substrate. Human factor V at a final concentration varying from 50 to 250 μg/ml (100–750 nm) was incubated with an aliquot of the purified CKII-like kinase (representing approximately 1 μg of protein) and a mixture of unlabeled ATP (2 mm) and [γ-32P]ATP in a total reaction volume of 400 ml in HBS++ for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was loaded on an Excellulose GF-5 gel filtration desalting column (Pierce) at room temperature to remove excess [γ-32P]ATP. The column was previously saturated with bovine serum albumin (0.5%) and equilibrated with HBS++. A small column (approximately 0.5 cm) composed of Bio-Beads SM-2 adsorbent (Bio-Rad) was poured on the top of the Excellulose column to remove the Triton X-100 and thus to allow APC inactivation of factor Va, which is a phospholipid-dependent mechanism. The column was eluted manually in the equilibrating buffer (400-μl fractions were collected). The final concentration of phosphorylated factor V was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient (ε280 nm1%) of 0.9 for factor V and 1.74 for bovine factor Va (32Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or 1.2 for bovine factor Va heavy chain. The stoichiometry of the phosphorylation catalyzed by the platelet CKII was determined by direct precipitation of the phosphorylated protein with 2.5% trichloroacetic acid in 1% sodium pyrophosphate. The disintegrations/min obtained from the liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000IC) were compared with the specific activity of the ATP solution used and the known protein concentration of the phosphorylated factor Va molecule to calculate the stoichiometry of the phosphorylation reaction. Phosphorylated human factor V was activated to factor Va by α-thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C. Following the addition of hirudin (20 nm), phosphorylated factor Va was assessed for its susceptibility to inactivation by APC. APC (at a 1:100 enzyme/substrate ratio) was added to the reaction mixture containing native or phosphorylated factor Va at 37 °C in the presence of PCPS vesicles (20 μm). Cofactor activity was monitored by either a clotting assay using factor V-deficient plasma or an assay measuring thrombin generation and employing a fluorescent thrombin inhibitor and purified prothrombinase reagents as described by Nesheimet al. (32Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). At each time point, a sample was also withdrawn for SDS-PAGE analysis (5–15% linear gradient). A control reaction was performed under similar experimental conditions but in the absence of ATP. In some experiments, the degradation pattern of factor Va by APC was analyzed by using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope between amino acid residues 307 and 506 of human factor V as described (34Kalafatis M.

Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 87: 4695-4707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of bovine and human factor Va and bovine factor Va heavy chain by APSF was performed as described previously (21Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Jenny R.J. Ehrlich Y.H. Mann K.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 704-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mol of phosphate incorporated into the proteins were calculated from the specific activity of the ATP mixture (21Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Jenny R.J. Ehrlich Y.H. Mann K.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 704-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In some experiments, inhibition of bovine factor Va phosphorylation (3.4 μm) by the platelet kinase, by heparin (final concentration of 40 μg/ml) and the two synthetic peptides (at a final concentration of 80 μm) was assessed using APSF and ATP (100 μm, 0.5 μCi/μl). Following gel filtration, the proteins were analyzed on a 5–15% linear SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Radioactive proteins were identified by autoradiography. Previous data have demonstrated that while bovine factor Va heavy chain incorporates radioactivity in the presence of APSF and [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 5), a fragment containing the major portion of the heavy chain (Mr 90,000) but lacking the acidic COOH terminus segment does not incorporate phosphate in the presence of either APSF or purified CKII (21Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Jenny R.J. Ehrlich Y.H. Mann K.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 704-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, human factor V is phosphorylated by purified CKII exclusively on the heavy chain portion of the molecule (21Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Jenny R.J. Ehrlich Y.H. Mann K.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 704-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rand M.D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Blood. 1992; 83: 2180-2190Crossref Google Scholar). Since CKII is known to be inhibited by heparin (37Hathaway G.M. Lubben T.H. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8038-8041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of factor Va heavy chain phosphorylation by the platelet kinase was evaluated. Fig. 1,lane 2, shows that factor Va heavy chain phosphorylation by APSF was completely inhibited by an excess of heparin. Thus, heparin binds and inhibits the platelet CKII. Previous data have shown that the heavy chain of factor Va (human or bovine) is phosphorylated within the acidic COOH terminus on a serine (21Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Jenny R.J. Ehrlich Y.H. Mann K.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 704-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rand M.D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Blood. 1992; 83: 2180-2190Crossref Google Scholar). APC cleaves human factor Va heavy chain sequentially at Arg506, Arg306, and Arg679 (8Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following cleavage of phosphorylated human factor Va by APC at Arg506, radioactivity was found in the COOH-terminal fragment of the heavy chain (amino acid residues 507–709). Subsequent cleavage of this fragment at Arg679 resulted in the disappearance of radioactivity. Since phosphoserine was the only phosphoamino acid detected (21Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Jenny R.J. Ehrlich Y.H. Mann K.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 704-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rand M.D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Blood. 1992; 83: 2180-2190Crossref Google Scholar), it was concluded that amino acid sequence 680–709 of human factor Va heavy chain must contain a serine that is phosphorylated by the platelet CKII. Examination of the human factor V deduced amino acid sequence (6Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2971-2978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that the carboxyl-terminal part of factor Va heavy chain that would result after cleavage at Arg679 (amino acid residues 680–709) contains only one serine residue, Ser692. Further, Ser692 is a potential phosphorylation site for CKII because of the presence of acidic amino acids at positions +1 (Asp693), +3 (Asp695), and +5 (Asp697) (40Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, if Tyr696 is sulfated in vivo (41Hortin G.L. Blood. 1993; 76: 946-952Crossref Google Scholar) as suggested, more negative charges will be added to an already negative amino acid region, which will favor phosphorylation of this serine by CKII in vivo. Thus, based upon the known NH2-terminal sequence of the fragments derived from the heavy chain of factor Va following APC digestion (8Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the deduced amino acid sequence of the human factor V molecule (6Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and the substrate specificity for CKII (38Meggio F. Marchiori F. Borin G. Chessa G. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14576-14579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hrubey T.W. Roach P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), two peptides were synthesized. Both contained the sequence 687–705 of the human factor V molecule. Peptide 67, which has the same sequence as human factor V with a serine at position 692, showed a net incorporation of32PO4 in the presence of purified CKII (Fig.2, filled circles). In contrast, peptide 73, which has an alanine at position 692, did not show any incorporation of radioactivity under similar experimental conditions (Fig. 2, filled triangles). It has been demonstrated that synthetic peptides that are substrates for CKII are also inhibitors of the phosphorylation of the corresponding protein substrate (38Meggio F. Marchiori F. Borin G. Chessa G. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14576-14579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibition of factor Va phosphorylation by the two synthetic peptides was evaluated next. Peptide 67 at a concentration of 80 μm almost completely inhibits factor Va heavy chain phosphorylation (Fig. 1, lane 4), whereas under similar experimental conditions peptide 73 does not have any inhibitory effect on the platelet-mediated factor Va phosphorylation (Fig. 1, lane 3). Overall, these data demonstrate that Ser692 is responsible for the incorporation of radioa"

https://openalex.org/W1979078541,"C-myc, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) protein family activates target genes in heterodimeric association with another bHLH-ZIP protein, Max. Max readily homodimerizes, competes with C-myc-Max heterodimers, and represses transcription. Four additional bHLH-ZIP proteins, Mad1, Mxi1, Mad3 and Mad4, heterodimerize with Max and also repress transcription of c-myc-responsive genes. We employed a yeast two-hybid approach to identify proteins which interact with Mxi. We identified a novel ZIP-containing protein, Mmip1 (Mad member-interacting protein 1) that strongly dimerizes with all four Mad members, but not with c-myc, Max, or with unrelated HLH proteins. The Mmip1-Mxi association is mediated by the ZIP domain of each polypeptide and is as strong or stronger than the associations between c-myc and Max or Max and Mxi1. In vitro, Mmip1 can inhibit DNA binding by Max-Mad heterodimers and, in vivo, can reverse the suppressive effects of Mad proteins on c-myc functions. Mmipl is found in a variety of cells types, is induced by serum stimulation, and can be co-immunoprecipitated from fibroblasts in association with Mxi1. By interfering with the dimerization between Max and Mad family member proteins, Mmip1 can indirectly up-regulate the transcriptional activity of c-myc and suppress the antiproliferative actions of Mad proteins."

In the cerebellum, the expression of SGC, particularly that of SGGLs, is biphasic. Several studies have suggested that the initial rise and decline in the levels of SGGLs and SGC-containing proteins correlated with the migration of granule neurons from the external granule cell layer to the internal granule cell layer and their subsequent maturation, whereas the later rise and continued expression of SGGLs in the adult was associated with their localization in the Purkinje neurons and their dendrites in the molecular layer. Here it is shown by immunocytochemical methods that the expression of SGC declined progressively in granule neurons isolated from cerebella of increasing age. The decline in the expression of SGC in granule neurons was also shown with time in culture. These results correlated with the previously shown declining activity of the regulatory enzyme lactosylceramideN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAc-Tr) with agein vivo and in isolated granule neurons in culture.

In addition, topographically, these molecules are localized in apposing cellular structures of the perinatal rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum, suggesting a functional role in the processes of cell-cell interaction and cell migration (12Nair S.M.

In the rat cerebral cortex, monoclonal antibody HNK-1-reactive sulfoglucuronylglycolipids (SGGLs) and SGC-containing glycoproteins are expressed strongly during embryonic stages (13Schwarting G.A.

In the cerebellum, SGGLs are expressed in a biphasic manner, with an initial peak at around PD1–3, followed by a second maximum at PD20 and continued expression in the adult (15Prasadarao N. Koul O.

Neurol. 1993; 332: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with a characteristic loss of specific cell types have suggested that the initial decline in the levels of SGGLs correlated with the migration of immature granule neurons from the germinal zone in the external granule cell layer (EGCL) to the internal granule cell layer (IGCL), guided by Bergmann glial fibers. In contrast, the later rise and continued expression of SGGLs in the cerebellum was associated with their localization in the dendrites of the Purkinje cells in the molecular layer and their axon terminals in the deep cerebellar nuclei (17Nair S.M. Zhao Z. Chou D.K.H. Tobet S.A. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: S26Google Scholar). The in vivo expression of SGGLs, both in the cerebral cortex and in the cerebellum, is regulated by the enzyme lactosylceramideN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAc-Tr), which synthesizes a key precursor, lactotriosylceramide (LcOse3Cer) (see Scheme 1) (22Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21727-21733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the cerebral cortex, the activity of GlcNAc-Tr was down-regulated from a maximum at embryonic day 15 to an undetectable level by PD10, whereas the other enzymes involved in the subsequent steps for the synthesis of SGGLs were not as severely affected (1Jungalwala F.B.

Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the cerebellum, the activity of GlcNAc-Tr initially declined from birth to PD3, but subsequently increased up to PD15, explaining the observed initial decrease and then increase in the synthesis of SGGLs in the cerebellum. In the cerebella of Purkinje cell-deficient adult mutant mice, in which Purkinje cells are lost, SGGLs and GlcNAc-Tr were absent, but the other three glycosyltransferases were not as affected (23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This indicated that in the normal adult cerebellum, GlcNAc-Tr and the latter three enzymes were localized in Purkinje cells, whereas only the latter three enzymes were localized in other cell types, such as in mature granule neurons of the IGCL and glial cells. The lack of SGGLs in the mutants was due to the absence of GlcNAc-Tr (23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Analyses of the enzymes in the specific microdissected cellular layers of normal adult rat also showed that the Purkinje cell layer and the molecular layer (where Purkinje cell dendrites are localized) contained all four enzymes (23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, granule neurons and glial cells in the white matter lacked GlcNAc-Tr, but expressed the other three enzymes (23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the absence of SGGLs in adult granule neurons and glial cells was due to a specific deficiency of GlcNAc-Tr. Although adult granule neurons lacked GlcNAc-Tr and therefore SGGLs, isolated granule neurons from the perinatal cerebellum contained all four enzymes necessary for the synthesis of SGGLs (23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). With development, the activity of GlcNAc-Tr in the isolated granule neurons declined, but the other enzymes were not as affected, indicating that immature granule neurons are capable of synthesizing SGGLs and that, with maturation, their synthesis is down-regulated (23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, we directly show that isolated immature granule neurons are able to synthesize SGC and that the expression of SGC is down-regulated with maturation of the cells in culture. In addition, we demonstrate that the down-regulated synthesis of SGGLs in the mature granule neurons is restored when a precursor such as glucuronylneolactotetraosylceramide (GlcA-nLcOse4Cer, GGL-1), which is beyond the GlcNAc-Tr step, is exogenously provided to these cells. The biological effect of such restoration of the synthesis of SGGLs in the mature granule neurons leads to dedifferentiation, cell aggregation, and enhanced proliferation of neurites.

The supernatant of the HNK-1 hybridoma clone was mixed with an equal volume of EZ-SepA solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at pH 7.5 at room temperature. After 30 min, the precipitates formed were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in EZ-SepB solution, and the IgM was reprecipitated with EZ-SepC solution. After 30 min, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation as partially purified IgM protein. Mixed cell cultures of neonatal rat cerebellum as well as enriched granule neuronal and astrocytic cell cultures were prepared essentially according to the methods of Hatten (29Hatten M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) as modified by Chou and Jungalwala (23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated cells from the cerebellum were separated on a three-step Percoll gradient (60, 35, and 20%) by centrifugation at 3300 rpm for 10 min in an IEC Centra-8R centrifuge. The granule neurons were collected from the interface of the 35/60% Percoll gradient, whereas enriched astroglial cells were collected from the interface of the 20/35% Percoll. Astroglial cells were further purified by plating them on polylysine-coated coverslips for 10–15 min and then vigorously shaking them for 5 min. The bound cells were used as purified astroglial cells. Alternatively, astroglial cells collected from the 20/35% Percoll gradient interface were grown in culture without additional KCl or glucose for 2 weeks. Neuronal cells under these conditions were killed, and the remaining cells were used as pure astroglial population. A mixed granule neuron-astroglial cell population was isolated from the dissociated cells at the interface of the 20/60% Percoll gradient. Granule neurons were plated on polylysine (50 μg/ml)-coated coverslips at low density (1–2 × 105 cells/15-mm diameter coverslip) in complete minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 25 mm KCl, 2.0 mmglutamine, 0.6% glucose, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin. The purity of the granule neurons and astroglial cells in culture was monitored as described previously (23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Granule cells isolated from PD5–7 rat cerebella were plated at a cell density of 1–2 × 105 cells/coverslip for 4 h as described above. The coverslips were rinsed with Opti-MEM and transferred to 0.4 ml of medium (23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) containing GGL-1 delivered to the cells via the lipid carrier α-cyclodextrin prepared as follows. Purified GGL-1 (4 μg) was dried from organic solvents, resuspended in 0.2 ml of ethanol, and mixed with α-cyclodextrin (1 mg/0.2 ml of ethanol/water (1:1)). The entire mixture was evaporated, and the residue was resuspended in 0.35 ml of culture medium (Opti-MEM) and sonicated in a sonicator bath for 1 min. Na235SO4 (125 nmol, 100 μCi) and horse serum (2.5% final concentration) were added. The cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight (or as stated otherwise) in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in cell culture chambers. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with Dulbecco's buffered saline and collected by scrapping. The cells were then extracted with 6 ml of chloroform/methanol/H2O (1:1:0.1). To the cell extracts, SGGL-1 (2 μg) was added as a carrier. The extracted samples were processed to isolate radioactive SGGL-1 as described previously (23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The isolated products were then analyzed by HPTLC with a developing solvent of chloroform, methanol, and 0.25% CaCl2 (5:4:1) and autoradiography using Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cerebellar cells on coverslips at the appropriate stages, treated with and without GGL-1, were also analyzed by immunocytochemistry after fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, for 1 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then exposed to the appropriate primary antibodies at room temperature for 15 min. Monoclonal antibody HNK-1 in the hybridoma supernatant, purified with EZ-Sep, was used at a 1:40 dilution. The cells were then exposed to rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM at a dilution of 1:40 for 15 min at room temperature. When cells were treated with anti-GFAP monoclonal antibodies (1:40 dilution) or anti-MAP polyclonal antibodies (1:40 dilution), the cells were incubated for 10 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, to render the cells permeable. FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgGγ and goat anti-rabbit IgG were used, respectively, as secondary antibodies for 15 min at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount (Fisher) containing freshly prepared 0.1% p-phenylenenediamine to prevent fading (30Valnes K. Brandtzaeg P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1985; 33: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The coverslips were viewed using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope. In some experiments, sodium chlorate (5–30 mm) was added to the medium (to inhibit the synthesis of SGGL-1 from added GGL-1) to evaluate the effect of added GGL-1 by itself on granule neuron cell morphology and aggregation. Coverslips of granule cells labeled with HNK-1 followed by fluorescent rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies were mounted on a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope with a 40× objective lens. Fields of cells were viewed and digitized according to optical density using a Hammamatsu Newvicon video camera and an IBAS image analysis system (Version 2.0, Zeiss/Kontron). Selected individual cells were traced, and an average optical density was determined for the total of all selected cells. Cell counts were also determined with the assistance of the computer program. The average background pixel optical density was determined for regions of each image not containing cells to determine background for substraction. For each culture coverslip, 15–30 cells from three to five different randomly selected fields were analyzed, and the data were averaged. For each paradigm measured, at least two separate experiments were performed. Measurement of neurite length of granule cells was done with coverslips of granule cell cultures labeled with anti-MAP antibodies followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. Images were digitized according to optical density as described previously. All visible neurites were traced initially by an automated segmentation algorithm and edited manually for accuracy. The number of granule cells in the field was also determined. The sum of all traced neurites and a cell count for each field were determined. For each cell culture coverslip, three randomly selected fields were analyzed, and the data were averaged. SGC-containing glycoproteins and glycolipids are recognized by monoclonal antibody HNK-1 (27Chou D.K.H. Ilyas A.A. Evans J.E Costello C. Quarles R.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11717-11725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of SGC in isolated cerebellar granule cells from postnatal day 3, 8, and 14 rats was studied by plating the cells in culture for 1 h. The cells were then exposed to HNK-1 antibody followed by rhodamine-conjugated IgM secondary antibodies and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.1). Practically all granule neurons as visualized by bright-field phase microscopy were HNK-1-reactive. The reactivity of HNK-1 was highest with granule cells isolated from cerebella of PD3 animals (Fig. 1 D). This reactivity declined in the cells from PD8 animals (Fig. 1 E) and almost completely disappeared in the cells isolated from PD14 rats (Fig.1 F). The results show that the expression of SGC was down-regulated with the animal age in granule cells. Purified granule cells isolated from PD5 rat cerebellum were maintained in culture from 1 to 24 h, and the expression of SGC in the cells was monitored with HNK-1 antibody. The significant expression of SGC in granule neurons after 1 h in culture (Fig.2 B) declined severely after 24 h in culture (Fig. 2 D). Astroglial cells were isolated from PD4 rat cerebellum and purified by panning on polylysine-coated coverslips. The isolated cells after 24 h in culture were double-stained with HNK-1 and anti-GFAP antibodies followed by rhodamine- and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively. SGC was expressed strongly only in a small population of astroglial cells (Fig.3 B) since several GFAP-positive cells (Fig. 3 C) did not express HNK-1-reactive SGC. A mixed population of granule neurons and astroglial cells from PD4 rats was maintained in culture for 16 h. The cultures were then exposed to 4 μg of GGL-1 in the medium along with the lipid carrier α-cyclodextrin for 10 h. The control cultures were exposed to α-cyclodextrin in the medium without GGL-1. Both the control (unexposed) and GGL-1-exposed cells were treated with HNK-1 antibody. SGC was not expressed in granule neurons of the control cultures, except some astroglial cells expressed SGC (Fig.4 B). However, granule neurons of cultures exposed to GGL-1 strongly expressed SGC and showed extensive neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4, C and D). The SGGL-expressing cells also appeared to aggregate more readily (Fig.4, C and D). There was no effect when other glycolipids, such as glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, LcOse3Cer, globoside, and paragloboside, were tested instead of GGL-1. The relative intensity of the rhodamine fluorescence due to reactivity of SGC with HNK-1 was measured with a digital camera and a computer-assisted image analysis system. The relative fluorescence intensity due to SGC in granule cells increased with the amount of GGL-1 added to the medium (Fig.5 A). The fluorescence intensity due to SGC in granule neurons was also dependent upon the amount of α-cyclodextrin added along with a fixed amount of GGL-1 (data not shown). 1 mg of α-cyclodextrin in 0.4 ml of medium was optimal. Higher levels of cyclodextrin were damaging to the cells. The relative fluorescence intensity due to SGC in granule cells in the presence of GGL-1 also increased up to 6 days in culture (Fig.5 B). The biosynthesis of SGGL-1 by different cerebellar cell types from precursor GGL-1 and Na235SO4 in the medium was studied by HPTLC and autoradiography. The mixed granule neuron-astroglial cell population of cells synthesized radioactive SGGL-1 from GGL-1 and Na235SO4 in the medium (Fig.6, lanes 4 and 7). However, these cells failed to synthesize SGGL-1 in the absence of cyclodextrin and/or GGL-1 (Fig. 6, lanes 1–3). These results show that cyclodextrin was required for the transport of GGL-1 across the plasma membrane of the cells. Enriched astroglial cells and granule neurons as well as pure populations of astrocytes grown in culture for 2 weeks also synthesized SGGL-1 (Fig. 6, lanes 5, 6, and 8, respectively). The mixed cell population as well as the enriched astroglial fraction also synthesized sulfatide, presumably from endogenous cerebroside and added Na235SO4 (Fig. 6, lanes 1–5 and 7). However, the synthesis of sulfatide in granule neurons and pure astrocytes was minimal (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 8, respectively), indicating minimal contamination of these cells by oligodendroglial cells, which specifically synthesize sulfatide. The synthesis of radioactive SGGL-1 by the mixed cell population was dependent upon the amount of GGL-1 added to the medium (Fig.7). The synthesis of radioactive sulfatide was affected minimally by addition of GGL-1 between 2.5 and 5.0 μg (Fig. 7, inset). The morphological effect of the restoration of synthesis of SGGL-1 in granule neurons by addition of GGL-1 was measured. After addition of 4 μg of GGL-1 and cell culture for 16 h, the control and experimental cells were processed with antibodies to MAPs followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies to identify granule neurons and their cell processes (neurites). The lengths of the neurites were determined by computer-assisted image analysis, and the total length of neurites in all the cells and the average length of the neurite per granule cell were calculated (Fig. 8 and TableI). The mean total neurite length for about the same number of granule neurons treated with GGL-1 was about twice that of untreated cultures. The average neurite length per granule neuron was more than double for the GGL-1-treated culture compared with the untreated cultures.Table IComputer-assisted image analysis of neurite length of granule neurons in culture in the absence and presence of added GGL-1 in the mediumCoverslipTotal neurite lengthNo. of granule neurons analyzedNeurite length/cellμmμmControl 11661-2001Granule neurons in culture on coverslips were immunostained with anti-MAP antibodies followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies.

Open table in a new tab To evaluate if the granule neuron cell morphology was altered due to synthesis of SGGL-1 or due merely to added GGL-1, the synthesis of SGGL-1 from GGL-1 was suppressed by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme GGL-1 sulfotransferase by sodium chlorate. Previously, it has been reported that up to 30 mm chlorate ions specifically inhibited the synthesis of 3′-phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate, the active donor of sulfate, without significantly affecting growth and viability of cells in culture (31Hortin G.L. Schilling M. Graham J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Humpries D.E. Silbert J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Granule neurons from PD5 rat cerebellum, when treated with 0–30 mm chlorate in the medium, did not appear to have significant toxic effect up to 48 h. Granule neurons treated with 20 mm chlorate failed to synthesize SGGL-1 from added GGL-1 (Fig.9 E); however, without chlorate, they synthesized a significant amount of SGGL-1 as visualized by immunocytochemistry with HNK-1 antibody (Fig. 9 C). Neurite outgrowth and cell aggregation, as visualized with anti-MAP antibodies, were significantly increased in cells treated with GGL-1 (Fig. 9 D) compared with cells without GGL-1 (Fig.9 B). However, in the presence of chlorate and GGL-1, neurite outgrowth and cell aggregation were almost similar (Fig. 9 F) to cells without added GGL-1 (Fig. 9 B). The results show that the synthesis of SGGL-1 from GGL-1 was required for the alteration of morphological characteristics and cell aggregation and that GGL-1 by itself did not have similar effects. Adult mammalian cerebellum is composed of four major cell types. Granule neurons are >80% of the total neuronal population, and they form the major portion of the IGCL. Purkinje neurons are ∼10% of the total neuronal population and are localized at the junction of the IGCL and molecular layer (33Altman J. Bayer S.A. Development of the Cerebellar System: In relation to Its Evolution, Structure and Function. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1997: 324-333Google Scholar). The dendrites of the Purkinje neurons form the molecular layer. Oligodendroglia and astroglia are the two glial cell types. Oligodendroglia generate myelin membranes and are mostly concentrated in the white matter layer. Astroglia are primarily located in the IGCL; however, a specific type of astroglia, viz.Bergmann glia, and their processes span the molecular layer into the EGCL, especially during neonatal development. Neuroanatomical studies (33Altman J. Bayer S.A. Development of the Cerebellar System: In relation to Its Evolution, Structure and Function. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1997: 324-333Google Scholar) have shown that during early development of the rodent cerebellum (embryonic day 17 to PD3), granule neurons start to proliferate over the entire surface of the primordial cerebellum in the EGCL. The EGCL reaches its peak in size by PD6–7. During this period, a portion of the granule neurons start migrating internally from the EGCL, along the Bergmann glial fibers, to reside in the IGCL. By PD21, almost all granule neurons complete their migration, leaving the EGCL to regress and disappear. This cellular migration is cued by cellular interactions; however, the precise nature of the molecules involved is mostly unknown. The characterization of such molecules is important not only in defining normal cerebellar development, but also in understanding steps that cause arrested or abnormal migration as manifested in several neuronal migration disorders, leading to severe mental retardation and profound developmental disabilities in humans. SGC has been implicated previously in the migration of neural crest cells (4Bronner-Fraser M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) as well as in the upward migration of neuronal cells from the proliferating ventricular zone to their final destination in the cortical plate in the cerebral cortex (11Nair S.M. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1286-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Nair S.M. Zhao Z. Chou D.K.H. Tobet S.A. Jungalwala F.B. Neuroscience. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). The expression of SGC is down-regulated after cell migration is completed. Our biochemical and immunocytochemical studies have shown that, analogous to that in the cerebral cortex, the expression of SGC declines in the IGCL of the cerebellum after the granule neuron migration and maturation are completed. Previously, we have shown that the down-regulation of SGC, particularly that of SGGLs, with development in vivo both in the cortex and in the cerebellum is due to declining activity of the enzyme GlcNAc-Tr (22Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21727-21733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the GlcNAc-Tr activity was down-regulated in granule neurons isolated from PD3–14 animals (23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 1 show that a significant level of SGC present in the isolated granule neurons from PD3 animals declined in the cells from PD8 animals and was almost completely absent in the granule neurons from PD14 animals. Thus, immature granule neurons appeared to have SGC, which was down-regulated with maturation. Some, but not all, isolated astroglial cells also show SGC expression (Fig. 3), indicating that different astrocytes may be at dissimilar stages of maturation in the isolated population. Previous studies in vivo and in vitro have indicated that although mature granule cells lack GlcNAc-Tr, and therefore SGGLs, they do have significant activities of the enzymes involved in the subsequent steps of the biosynthesis of SGGLs, as shown in Scheme 1 (22Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21727-21733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol.

Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that when isolated intact mature granule cells were provided with precursor GGL-1, they were able to synthesize SGGL-1 (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Precursors such as LcOse3Cer or nLcOse4Cer beyond the GlcNAc-Tr step were also added in the medium similar to GGL-1, and the cells were analyzed by immunocytochemistry with anti-nLcOse4Cer (1B2) and HNK-1 antibodies as well as by biochemical analysis. For the latter, the cells were extracted and analyzed for the synthesis of nLcOse4Cer from LcOse3Cer by HPTLC and immunoblotting with 1B2 antibodies and by [14C]galactose incorporation as well as for the synthesis of SGGL-1 from both these precursors by 35SO4 incorporation. We were unable, however, to show the expected synthesis of nLcOse4Cer or SGGL-1 under the conditions of the assays. It is likely that these precursors were not taken up by the live cells or, if taken up, did not reach the correct site in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus where the synthesis is known to occur. It is also likely that competing glycosyltransferases, such as β1–3-galactosyltransferase, sialyltransferase, or fucosyltransferase, that act on LcOse3Cer and nLcOse4Cer to synthesize other glycolipids would diminish the level of the final product (SGGL-1) below the limits of detection. In addition to granule neurons, the pure population of astroglial cells also synthesized SGGL-1 when supplied with exogenous GGL-1 in the medium, indicating that these cells also carry the specific GGL-1 sulfotransferase required for the synthesis of SGGL-1. The restoration of the synthesis of SGGL-1 in the mature granule cells on addition of GGL-1 had remarkable morphological consequences. Restoration had no toxic effects on the viability of the cells. Granule neurons restored with the synthesis of SGGL-1 had more than double neurite outgrowth compared with unrestored neurons. In addition, the former appeared to aggregate more than the latter. The results suggest that SGGL-1 had either directly or indirectly altered the differentiation stage of the granule neurons. When other lipids were added to the medium, no change in cell morphology was observed, suggesting the requirement of the specificity of SGGL-1. GGL-1 by itself appeared to have little effect on neurite outgrowth and cell aggregation when added to the medium in the presence of chlorate to prevent its conversion to SGGL-1. This is perhaps the first report demonstrating that the induction of the synthesis of a membrane lipid can alter the morphology and differentiation stage of primary neuronal cells in cultures. It would be of interest to determine the effect of such manipulation on cell morphology and migration in vivo. We thank Dr. Zen Zhao for assistance with photography."

https://openalex.org/W2317985090,"Decreased expression of C-CAM, a member of the CEA family of immunoglobulin like cell adhesion molecules, occurs in carcinomas of the colon, liver and prostate. Down regulation of C-CAM during the early stages of carcinogenesis in rat liver and human prostate has also been reported. We have recently shown that restoration of the expression of the isoform with long cytoplasmic domain, C-CAM1, leads to suppression of the tumorigenicity of prostatic carcinoma cells in vivo and growth suppression in vitro. These observations suggest that C-CAM1 may play an important role in regulating cell growth in normal tissues. Previous studies have demonstrated that the function of many members of the Ig-supergene family is dependent on interactions with cytoplasmic proteins. In the present study, we have used a bifunctional cross-linker to identify cellular proteins that interact directly with C-CAM1. Immunoblot analysis of WGA bound membrane proteins crosslinked with DSS identified a 180 kDa complex composed of C-CAM and an 80 kDa protein designated CAP-80 (C-CAM Associated Protein). Immunoprecipitation with anti-C-CAM antibodies showed that CAP-80 was co-precipitated with C-CAM from detergent solubilized, WGA-purified proteins. To assess the specificity of CAP-80 binding, the ability of CAP-80 to form stable complexes with C-CAM1 mutants expressed in insect cells was tested. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of C-CAM1 abolished complex formation whereas deletion of the extracellular Ig domains had no effect. These results suggest that a CAP-80 homologue (ICAP-80) is present in insect cells and ICAP-80 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of C-CAM1. Replacement of Tyr488, a residue in the cytoplasmic domain known to be phosphorylated in vivo, with Phe did not diminish the association between C-CAM1 and ICAP-80, suggesting that Tyr488 phosphorylation is not required for association. The ability of various C-CAM1 mutants to associate with ICAP-80 correlated with their growth inhibitory activities, suggesting that ICAP-80/CAP-80 may play an important role in C-CAM1-mediated growth inhibition."

Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Severe reduction in plasma FVII activity usually leads to bleeding problems in human patients although the phenotype is heterogeneous (2Cooper D.N. Millar D.S. Wacey A. Banner D.W. Tuddenham E.G.D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Complete absence of circulating FVII appears to be lethal due to traumatic postnatal bleeding 2J. H. McVey, personal communication. 2J. H. McVey, personal communication.; in addition, a recent report on FVII knock-out mice indicates poor survival of neonates, with the majority dying within 24 h from severe bleeding and virtually no survival beyond 21 days (3Rosen E. Chan J.Y.C. Idusogie E. Clotman F. Vlasuk G. Luther T. Jalbert L.R. Albrecht S. Zhong L. Lissens A. Schoonjans L. Moons L. Collen D. Castellino F.J. Carmeliet P. Nature. 1997; 390: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Many subjects listed in the FVII mutation data base, 3Available on the World Wide Web at the following address: http://europium.mrc.rpms.ac.uk. 3Available on the World Wide Web at the following address: http://europium.mrc.rpms.ac.uk. when characterized at the molecular genetic level, are revealed to be heterozygous for one or more mutations in the FVII gene, making it difficult to assess the functional deficit resulting from a particular amino acid substitution in the molecule. FVII Gln100 → Arg (Q100RFVII) is a naturally occurring EGF2 variant found in compound heterozygotes with other FVII mutations; it has been suggested that its circulating plasma antigen level is low (4Kuppuswamy M.N. Sabharwal A.K. Birktoft J.J. Bajaj S.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69 (abstr.): 1293Google Scholar), although its functional characteristics have not been determined. Previously we identified a subject heterozygous for Q100RFVII with greatly reduced plasma FVII activity (5Takamiya O. Kemball-Cook G. Martin D.M.A. Cooper D.N. Von Felten A. Meili E. Hann I. Prangnell D.R. Lumley H. Tuddenham E.G.D. McVey J.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1355-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but we were unable to determine whether this was due to reduced plasma levels of a functionally normal factor or a dysfunctional protein. In the latter case, reduced or abolished function might result from one of the following different reasons: the inability to be activated to FVIIa; absence of active site peptide bond cleavage; defective binding to macromolecular substrate (factor X); or altered binding to TF. In the present study, we undertook the expression, purification, and characterization of Q100RFVII to determine the nature of the functional deficiency in subjects with this mutation. Unless stated all buffers were based on 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS). TBS-A was TBS containing 1 mg/ml human albumin (Bio Products Laboratory, Elstree, UK). All chemicals were of analytical grade or better and were obtained from Sigma (Poole, UK) unless stated otherwise. Protein grade Tween 20 was supplied by Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). Chromatography media were purchased from Pharmacia (St. Albans, UK). SDS-PAGE was performed on 10% Nupage precast gels using SeeBlue markers (Novex GmBH, Frankfurt, Germany). Non-activated human FX was obtained from ERL (Swansea, UK). Recombinant human transmembrane tissue factor (TF1–243, residues 1–243) was a kind gift of Dr. D. L. Eaton (Genentech Inc., San Francisco) and was relipidated before use as follows: 5 μl of 10 μmTF1–243 were mixed with 30 μl of TBS-A, 30 μl of 9:1 (v/v) platelet substitute mixed phospholipid (Diagnostic Reagents, Thame, UK), 25 mg/ml sodium deoxycholate, and 3 μl of 100 mm CdCl2 and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The mixture was then diluted in TBS-A to 16 nm final TF1–243 concentration before use in FX activation assays. Chromogenic substrates used to detect amidolytic activity of FXa (S-2765) and FVIIa (S-2288) were from Chromogenix/Quadratech (Epsom, UK). Immobilized FXa beads were produced by incubation of 270 μg of human FXa (ERL), predialyzed into 50:50 (v/v) glycerol, H20, with 150 μl of AminoLink Plus beads (Pierce, Chester, UK) according to the instructions supplied with the beads. FXa beads were extensively washed before use, and no FXa activity was detected in the washings after prolonged incubation with the amidolytic substrate S-2765, whereas inclusion of a few beads led to rapid color generation. Vectors for stable transfection of wild-type and variant FVII were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis essentially as described previously (6O'Brien D.P. Kemball-Cook G. Hutchinson A.M. Martin D.M.A. Johnson D.J.D. Byfield P.G.H. Takamiya O. Tuddenham E.G.D. McVey J.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14162-14169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the desired variant nucleotide sequence was confirmed by direct sequencing (7Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Recombinant human soluble tissue factor (sTF, residues 1–219) was produced in Escherichia coli essentially as described previously (8Gibbs C.S. McCurdy S.N. Leung L.L.K. Paborsky L.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14003-14010Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), apart from omission of the FLAG sequence. sTF was purified directly from clarified culture broth by sequential cation and anion exchange chromatography. First, broth was buffer-exchanged into 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, clarified, and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose high performance column and eluted with a linear gradient of the identical buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl. Second, sTF-containing fractions were pooled and buffer-exchanged into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then loaded onto a 6-ml Resource Q column; sTF was eluted with a linear gradient of start buffer to 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25m NaCl. The protein was homogeneous as assessed by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant WTFVII and Q100RFVII were produced by mammalian roller bottle tissue culture in CHO-K1 cells using protein-free expression medium as described previously (9Kemball-Cook G. Garner I. Imanaka Y. Nishimura T. O'Brien D.P. Tuddenham E.G.D. McVey J.H. Gene (Amst .). 1994; 139: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Single chain FVII preparations were isolated at 4 °C from clarified media by sequential barium citrate precipitation (9:1:1 conditioned medium, 3.8% w/v trisodium citrate, 1 m BaCl2 added dropwise), resolution of the precipitate in 200 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmbenzamidine HCl, pH 7.4, and extensive buffer exchange at 4 °C into 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm benzamidine HCl, pH 7.4. Following clarification the crude FVII was loaded onto a 6-ml Resource Q column and eluted by a linear gradient to the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The resulting FVII was further purified by affinity chromatography on a 1-ml Hi-Trap heparin-Sepharose column using a linear gradient from 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, to the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. To rule out incomplete gamma-carboxylation of candidate Glu residues (residue numbers 6, 7, 14, 16, 19, 20, 25, 26, 29, and 35) (10Thim L. Bjoern S. Christensen M. Nicolaisen E.M. Lund-Hansen T. Pedersen A.H. Hedner U. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7785-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), purified single chain Q100RFVII was subjected to direct Edman sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 473A instrument (Warrington, UK). FVII:C and FVII:Ag values of conditioned media and purified single chain Q100RFVII were measured to estimate specific activity in comparison with normal plasma FVII; the 6th British Plasma Standard for Blood Coagulation Factors (code 93/622, NIBSC, South Mimms, UK) was used as reference. One-stage coagulant assays were performed with human thromboplastin (Thromborel, Hoechst/Behring, Milton Keynes) and FVII-deficient plasma (Sigma) using a Coag-a-Mate XC instrument (Organon Teknika, Cambridge, UK), whereas antigen assays were performed with the Asserachrom FVII:Ag kit (Shield, Dundee, UK). A normal plasma level of 1.0 IU/ml is equivalent to a plasma concentration of approximately 0.5 μg/ml (11Fair D.S. Blood. 1983; 62: 784-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant WTFVII and Q100RFVII (0.8 μm) were incubated overnight at room temperature in the presence and absence of an equal volume of immobilized FXa beads to produce activated FVII species. After removal of the beads the activated and non-activated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm complete FXa cleavage and then compared in functional and ligand-binding systems. In addition, several milligrams of Resource-Q-purified wild-type FVII (see above) were concentrated to ∼4 mg/ml and autoactivated by overnight incubation at room temperature in TBS, 5 mm CaCl2, followed by repurification using anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q to remove small amounts of des-Gla FVIIa and residual single chain FVII; this material was homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE and was used as an additional reference preparation of highly purified wild-type FVIIa to ensure that the FXa bead treatment produced fully activated FVIIa. In this section all reagent levels given are final concentrations. FVIIa direct amidolytic activity was assessed in 96-well plates by incubation of wild-type and variant FVII/FVIIa samples (10 nm) with varying concentrations of purified recombinant human sTF (0–8.8 μm) in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 followed by addition of S-2288 (1 mm). Generation of color was followed at 405 nm using a Thermomax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Crawley, UK). The ability of FVII/FVIIa preparations to activate FX was studied by coincubating relipidated TF1–243 (3.2 nm), wild-type, or variant FVII/FVIIa (2 pm), S-2765 (0.68 mm), and CaCl2 (5 mm) in a 96-well plate. The reaction was initiated by addition of FX to a final concentration of 20 nm and exponential color generation followed in the Thermomax reader. All experiments were performed using a Biacore X instrument and reagents unless otherwise stated below (Biacore, St. Albans, UK). Recombinant sTF (4 μm) was injected and immobilized onto flow cell 2 of a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling according to the manufacturer's instructions to a total of approximately 500 resonance units (RU). An irrelevant protein (an anti-FVIII monoclonal antibody) was immobilized to a similar RU on flow cell 1 to act as a control surface. 80-μl injections of wild-type or variant FVII and FVIIa (40 and 200 nm) were made at a flow rate of 40 μl/min, using running buffer of TBS, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 0.01% protein grade Tween 20 (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK), and HBS buffer (Biacore) containing 3 mmEDTA for regeneration. TF-specific association was detected as the net signal when nonspecific RU changes in flow cell 1 were subtracted from flow cell 2. Data from both injections were prepared for analysis using BiaEvaluation 2.2 software and exported to the global analysis program CLAMP 3.0 (12Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), which was also used for kinetic simulations. To examine the environment of residue Gln100 in FVIIa, the coordinates of FVIIa were extracted from the FVIIa-sTF complex crystal structure 1DAN.PDB (13Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar); visualizations were performed using MOLSCRIPT (14Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). All residue numbers correspond to mature human FVII. As previously reported (9Kemball-Cook G. Garner I. Imanaka Y. Nishimura T. O'Brien D.P. Tuddenham E.G.D. McVey J.H. Gene (Amst .). 1994; 139: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), WTFVII accumulated into medium consistently reaching levels between 2.5 and 5 μg/ml (approximately 5–10 IU/ml FVII:Ag): however, in more than 10 independent expression experiments, Q100RFVII:Ag levels were found to be extremely low, varying between 0.05 and 0.4 μg/ml (0.1–0.8 IU/ml), suggesting an expression defect in comparison with wild-type FVII. Increasing the levels of methotrexate used for amplification of the FVII cDNA in the Q100RFVII-expressing cells stepwise from 12.8 μm (9Kemball-Cook G. Garner I. Imanaka Y. Nishimura T. O'Brien D.P. Tuddenham E.G.D. McVey J.H. Gene (Amst .). 1994; 139: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to as high as 100 μm did not result in increased accumulation of FVII:Ag in the medium (data not shown). In addition, while FVII:C values for WTFVII were similar to those of FVII:Ag, FVII:C was essentially undetectable in Q100RFVII medium. Typical FVII:C and FVII:Ag levels obtained after expression from CHO-K1 cells into protein-free medium are given in TableI.Table IFVII coagulant activity, antigen levels, and specific activity in mammalian expression media and purified FVII samplesFVII sampleFVII:CFVII:AgSpecific activityIU/mlIU/mlIU/mgWTFVII medium6.47.51710WTFVII purified9258502180Q100RFVII medium<0.010.8<25Q100RFVII purified∼0.1590∼3.3 Open table in a new tab Due to the very low level of expressed Q100RFVII from CHO-K1 cells, a large volume (9 liters) of conditioned medium (0.4 μg/ml Q100RFVII as assessed by FVII:Ag assay, total 3.6 mg) was generated to allow purification of the variant for further characterization. Q100RFVII was quantitatively precipitated from conditioned medium by addition of BaCl2 and eluted similarly to WTFVII from the Resource Q and heparin-Sepharose columns but with low yields. A total of approximately 140 μg of variant protein was isolated with an overall yield of approximately 4%. After purification SDS-PAGE showed full-length single chain FVII with a minor component presumed to be des-Gla FVII. Due to the low yields of variant protein and the requirements for characterization by several different methods, further repurification to remove this minor contaminant was not attempted. Table I shows that purified Q100RFVII possessed very low FVII:C activity (∼0.15 IU/ml) but with a FVII:Ag level of 90 IU/ml; thus Q100RFVII possessed a specific coagulant activity less than 0.2% of WTFVII, approximately 3.3 versus 2180 IU/mg, assuming a plasma unit to be equivalent to 0.5 μg (11Fair D.S. Blood. 1983; 62: 784-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following Edman degradation and direct sequencing, signals were absent in all the residue positions given above up to 29, despite clear and unambiguous responses for other residues as far as position 33. We were also unable to detect a signal at position 35 (the 10th and last Gla position), but the surrounding residue signals were too attenuated to be certain as to the significance of the absence of signal at Glu35; however, it has been stated that a Gla rather than Glu at position 35 does not increase the affinity of FVIIa for TF (15Persson E. Nielsen L.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus the level of gamma-carboxylation in Q100RFVII is comparable to that in WTFVII (10Thim L. Bjoern S. Christensen M. Nicolaisen E.M. Lund-Hansen T. Pedersen A.H. Hedner U. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7785-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of wild-type and variant FVII incubated together with immobilized FXa beads showed complete activation of both FVII samples, as seen by quantitative loss of the single chain form and generation of heavy and light chains for both proteins following silver staining (Fig.1). Purified Q100RFVII contained a minor des-Gla component that was apparently cleaved normally to give a small amount of des-Gla light chain (just visible, marked by gdLC). The FVIIa amidolytic activity found in the presence of a wide range of sTF concentrations was then studied using the oligopeptide substrate S-2288. Without prior FXa bead treatment, both wild-type and Q100R samples were virtually inactive (not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 A, after FXa activation, wild-type FVIIa (10 nm) demonstrated a typical TF-promoted increase in amidolytic activity (16Lawson J.H. Butenas S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4834-4843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with approximately 50% of maximum stimulation at 8.8 nm sTF and essentially 100% at 88 nm sTF. Purified FVIIa at the same concentration produced by bulk autoactivation and repurification (see “Experimental Procedures”) gave a very similar response. In comparison, Q100RFVIIa showed no stimulation in amidolytic activity at an sTF concentration of 88 nm; a small augmentation was seen only at very high sTF concentrations (approximately 2-fold at 8.8 μm, Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, in the absence of sTF the amidolytic activities of WTFVIIa and Q100RFVIIa were similar (1.24 milliabsorbance units/min and 0.98 milliabsorbance units/min), indicating that the underlying functionality of the Q100RFVIIa active site toward the oligopeptide substrate was essentially normal but was not greatly augmented in the presence of sTF. Results shown are representative of duplicate experiments; data obtained from two separate purified preparations of Q100RFVIIa were very similar. To assess the ability of wild-type and variant FVII and FVIIa to activate FX in the presence of TF1–243, FVII and FVIIa samples (10 pm) produced by FXa bead treatment were incubated with equal volumes of a large molar excess of relipidated TF1–243, CaCl2, and S-2765, and the reaction was started with addition of purified FX to a final concentration of 20 nm. Cleavage of the FXa chromogenic substrate was monitored at 405 nm, and FXa generation curves representative of two duplicate experiments are shown in Fig.3. WTFVIIa (activated by FXa beads) generated FXa rapidly, and bulk autoactivated/purified WTFVIIa gave very similar results (not shown); wild-type non-activated FVII gave similar FXa generation following a lag phase resulting from the necessity for back activation of FVII by FXa. In contrast, Q100RFVIIa gave a very low level of FXa generation (less than 5% that of WTFVIIa), and no color was generated in the presence of non-activated Q100RFVII suggesting absence of back activation (not shown). Thus, the results of both direct amidolytic and FX activation systems indicate a profound defect in TF-modulated FVIIa function. The lack of TF-promoted activity in the Q100R variant might result from a defect in TF binding or the lack of allosteric activation following normal binding. The binding of Q100RFVII/FVIIa to immobilized sTF was therefore compared with that of wild-type protein by surface plasmon resonance. As seen in Fig.4, on injection of 200 nmwild-type FVII and FVIIa prepared by FXa bead treatment onto the sTF chip both gave a significant response although the shapes of the curves were qualitatively different. Two separate purified preparations of Q100RFVII and Q100RFVIIa gave similar results. Careful analysis of the sensorgrams by global fitting indicated that the interactions of both analytes were heterogeneous, as has been found previously using randomly immobilized ligand (17Karlsson R. Roos H. Fagerstam L. Persson B. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 99-110Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar); however, estimation of the apparent dissociation constant KD for the highest affinity interaction taking place gave values of approximately 20 nmfor wild-type FVII and 8–10 nm for FVIIa, in broad agreement with previously published values (6O'Brien D.P. Kemball-Cook G. Hutchinson A.M. Martin D.M.A. Johnson D.J.D. Byfield P.G.H. Takamiya O. Tuddenham E.G.D. McVey J.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14162-14169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Persson E. Nielsen L.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383-10392Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast, the variant Q100R samples (± FXa bead activation) showed very weak interactions with the sTF surface, giving response curves that were difficult to resolve from instrument noise even at this high injection concentration; a lower limit for KD values in these cases was estimated using kinetic simulation as >500 nm. Thus, a severe binding defect has been demonstrated for variant Q100R, found in both the non-activated and amidolytically functional activated form. Fig.5 A shows a ribbon diagram (14Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) of the WTFVIIa/sTF complex; the structure was taken from 1DAN.PDB (13Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). It can be seen that the Gln100 side chain is positioned between FVIIa EGF2 and the protease domain, at a considerable distance from the N-terminal TF domain. Fig. 5 B shows a stereo diagram of the Gln100 side chain and its immediate environment. Gln100 lies in the interface between the EGF2 domain of the light chain (to left) and the heavy chain catalytic domain (to right); this residue has unusual main chain torsion angles (φ = −123° and ψ = −99°) and falls on the edge of the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The homologous residues in FXa (19Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and activated protein C (20Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) have also been reported to have strained bond angles. In the crystal structure, the Gln100 side chain is held in place by a hydrogen bond to its amide oxygen OE-1 from the peptide —NH of His115. This leaves the Gln100 amide amino group (upper right atom as shown) apparently with no hydrogen bonding partners. However, to the lower right is a water molecule (HOH-1:O-216) at a distance of 3.6 Å in the correct direction to accept a hydrogen bond; in addition, above the amino group is the phenyl ring of Tyr118, in the correct position and orientation to accept a hydrogen bond to its π electrons. Mutation of Gln100 to arginine as in Q100RFVIIa would seriously disrupt this region of the molecule. Furthermore, any displacement of Tyr118 would also affect the loop Pro134-Cys135-Gly136-Lys137; in WTFVII the Cys135 residue makes the disulfide bridge to Cys262 in the heavy chain as shown, enabling the formation of disulfide-linked FVIIa after cleavage at Arg152. There are few reports in the literature describing recombinant expression and functional characterization of specific FVII missense mutations originally identified in human subjects. Two mutations in EGF1 have been studied, N57D (21Leonard B. Chen Q. Blajchman M. Ofosu F. Sridhara S. Yang D. Clarke B. Blood. 1998; 91: 142-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and R79Q (6O'Brien D.P.

Hematol. 1996; 53: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), both of which showed absent or reduced affinity toward sTF as might be predicted from the extensive interaction of EGF1 with sTF in the crystal structure (13Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The FVII activation site variant R152Q was found to be severely dysfunctional as expected (23Chaing S. Clarke B. Sridhara S. Chu K. Friedman P. VanDusen W. Roberts H.R. Blajchman M. Monroe D.M. High K.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 3524-3535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in the protease domain R304Q was also shown to have decreased affinity for sTF (25Matsushita T. Kojima T. Emi N. Takahashi I. Saito H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7355-7363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently the characterization of the variant F328S in the protease domain was reported (26Bharadwaj D. Iino M. Kontoyianni M. Smith K.J. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30685-30691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); although its binding affinity to sTF was not greatly reduced, this interesting variant showed undetectable coagulant activity. Both amidolytic and proteolytic activity in the presence of sTF were abolished, indicating a severe dysfunction in the interaction of substrate within the FVIIa active site. To date there has been no recombinant expression and detailed characterization of an EGF2 variant found in a human subject. Our studies indicate that the Q100RFVII EGF2 variant is unusual in two distinct ways. First, the purified protein lacks, in the presence of TF, both coagulant activity and (following activation) the ability to activate factor X, although it appears to possess basal amidolytic function in the absence of TF; a gross deficiency in TF binding is responsible for this defect. Second, it apparently circulates at a very low or absent level in subjects with the mutation. We wanted to account for both these characteristics in terms of its single molecular defect. Amidolytic assays with FXa-activated Q100RFVIIa demonstrated that no functional defect is evident in the absence of sTF, suggesting that dysfunctional interaction with TF is responsible for its lack of coagulant activity. Although this could result from simple loss of binding, defective allosteric activation at the active site, or defective interaction with macromolecular substrate, the surface plasmon resonance results presented here indicate that the recombinant purified variant Q100RFVII(a) shows no detectable TF binding. In this situation it is to be expected that the variant would show little or no activity in FX activation assays; in a tissue thromboplastin-initiated clotting system, Q100RFVII procoagulant activity would be further compromised by the inability of non-TF-bound zymogen to be activated. A possible defect in post-translational modifications of Glu residues in the Gla domain is very unlikely to be responsible for affecting TF binding to the extent seen, since under-carboxylated FVIIa binds TF similarly to wild-type FVIIa (27Clarke B.J. Sridhara S. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 93: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and des-Gla FVIIa shows only a 7-fold increase in KD of sTF binding (28Persson E. Haemostasis. 1996; 26: 31-34PubMed Google Scholar); in any case gamma-carboxylation in Q100RFVII appeared normal as assessed by amino acid sequencing. Thus, we can make a hypothesis at the level of molecular structure as to how the single amino acid substitution in this variant can result in this dramatic loss of affinity for sTF. Several years ago, the solution of the crystal structure of the TF extracellular portion (sTF) by two groups (29Harlos K. Martin D.M.A. O'Brien D.P. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Polikarpov I. Miller A.

A. 1991; 88: 8430-8434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A large interfacial area of binding was predicted, likely to involve multiple domains in the two proteins. More recently, the solution of the crystal structure of FVIIa/sTF (13Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) demonstrated the extended nature of this interface, with intermolecular chain contact contributions from all four FVIIa domains (Gla, EGF1, EGF2, and protease) and both fibronectin type III-like domains of sTF. The most important interactions are contributed by the EGF1 and protease domains as evidenced both by the contact chain areas in the crystal structure and the consequences of FVIIa alanine scanning mutagenesis (37Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, the contact areas of EGF2 are relatively small, and the contribution of the residues involved in stability of the complex has been found to be minor. In addition, the Gln100 residue does not form part of the TF binding face of EGF2 (Fig. 5) but rather is placed at the interface of EGF2 and the protease domain. These two domains are often described as forming a single rigid structural unit with no interdomain flexibility. It has been reported that the WTFVIIa molecule free in solution has an extended conformation (38Ashton A.W. Kemball-Cook G. Johnson D.J.D. Martin D.M.A. O'Brien D.P. Tuddenham E.G.D. Perkins S.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and possesses interdomain flexibility (resulting from Gla-EGF1 and EGF1-EGF2 flexibility) which is reduced on binding to sTF (39Waxman E. Laws W.R. Laue T.M. Nemerson Y. Ross J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is likely that both the high affinity of the sTF-WTFVIIa interaction and part of the allosteric promotion of FVIIa activity which results derive from the stabilization by TF of FVIIa inter- and intradomain conformation, requiring some movement of FVIIa domains to orient the large surface involved. The FVIIa EGF2-protease interface is rigid, as seen also in the crystal structures of the homologous serine proteases factor Xa (19Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), factor IXa (40Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); however, it is possible that a disruption of the main chain fold in this region could have a dramatic effect on the mutual orientation of the protease domain and EGF1, both of whose surfaces are closely involved in TF interaction. Abnormal main chain dihedral angles φ and ψ (resulting from a very short three-residue bridge between two disulfide links) are seen for Gln100 in FVIIa and also the homologous residues in both factor Xa (19Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and activated protein C (20Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The Gln100 side chain position is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between its amide oxygen and the peptide —NH of His115, and by hydrogen bonds from the amino group to a water molecule and to the π electrons of Tyr118. Replacement of the glutamine side chain by the larger, positively charged arginine side chain in Q100RFVII will disrupt this hydrogen bonding network and destabilize this interdomain area. In addition movement of the Tyr118 side chain will affect the short loop C-terminal to EGF2 which bears Cys135; since this cysteine forms one-half of the light chain-heavy chain disulfide link (with Cys262), proper interchain disulfide formation in variant Q100RFVII may be significantly disturbed. In this respect it is of interest that mutation of the FIX homologous residue Gln97 to Glu in a case of severe hemophilia B results in absence of circulating FIX protein (41Tartary M. Vidaud D. Piao Y. Costa J.-M. Bahnak B.R. Fressinaud E. Congard B. Laurian Y. Meyer D. Lavergne J.-M. Vidaud M. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 84: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We suggest that folding and/or disulfide linkage disturbances in the EGF2 protease region of Q100RFVII are responsible both for the absence of measurable affinity for TF (and thus, coagulant activity) and also for the apparent defect in secretion or stability in human subjects with this variant. This variant may define a new class of mutation affecting function via substitutions of amino acid side chains positioned at interdomain interfaces, distorting global conformation and indirectly preventing extended receptor-ligand interactions. We are indebted to Dr. Peter Byfield of the Haemostasis Research Group for carrying out the protein sequencing of Q100FVII and WTFVII."

We discuss the mechanism of prlA-mediated export and the role of the protein translocation apparatus in contributing to membrane protein topology. Assembly of cytoplasmic membrane proteins depends on features of the protein itself and on the cell's protein translocation machinery. Long hydrophobic stretches in membrane proteins, averaging around 20 amino acids, can act as export signals promoting the translocation of hydrophilic domains across the membrane. These stretches themselves remain embedded in the membrane, acting as anchors and sometimes contributing to the protein's function. Such hydrophobic stretches also act as stop transfer sequences when they follow a hydrophilic domain that has been translocated across the membrane. Thus, these transmembrane sequences can be oriented with either their amino terminus or their carboxyl terminus in the cytoplasm. Features of transmembrane proteins that determine their membrane topology include 1) basic amino acids in hydrophilic domains that result in a cytoplasmic location for that domain (1von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 3Boyd D. Beckwith J. Cell. 1990; 62: 1031-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar); 2) amphipathic helices in hydrophilic domains that may also contribute to anchoring those domains in the cytoplasm (4Kimbrough T.G. Manoil C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 119: 736-747Google Scholar); 3) rapid folding of a hydrophilic domains (folding in the cytoplasm may prevent export of a domain, while folding of a domain in the periplasm may ensure the location of that domain (5Bardwell J.C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)); 4) salt bridges (or other linkages) between transmembrane segments may maintain their transmembrane configuration (7Lee J.I. Hwang P.P. Hansen C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20758-20764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and 5) the lipid composition of the membrane may influence topology. 1W. Dowhan, personal communication. The efficient assembly of many membrane proteins also depends on the cell's protein translocation machinery. The assembly of the E. coli leader peptidase into the membrane and the translocation of a large hydrophilic domain of the cytoplasmic membrane protein, MalF, are defective in sec mutants that alter the translocation machinery (8Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1984; 36: 1067-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For MalF, effects on assembly occur only when the defects in the secretion apparatus are severe. This stringent requirement for sec defects may be due to high affinity of the very hydrophobic transmembrane stretches of MalF for the secretory apparatus compared with much shorter hydrophobic regions of cleavable signal sequences (9Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This dependence for membrane protein assembly on sec gene products has led us to examine further the effects of mutantsec genes on this process. In particular, we have studied the prlA mutations of E. coli that lie in the secY gene, encoding a core membrane component of the bacterial protein translocation apparatus. The prlAmutations alter SecY so as to allow the export of proteins with defective signal sequences. In prlA mutants, alkaline phosphatase (AP) 2The abbreviations used are: AP, alkaline phosphatase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; IPTG, isopropyl-thio-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MSS, membrane-spanning segment. carrying point mutations or a complete deletion of the signal sequence can be exported relatively efficiently (10Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Moreover, prlAmutations allow the export of AP when it is fused to the cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins (11Puziss J.W. Strobel S.M. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 92-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Uhland K. Ehrle R. Zander T. Ehrmann M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4565-4571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Allard J.D. Bertrand K.P. J.

We were interested in studying the mechanism that allows AP fused to a cytoplasmic domain of a membrane protein to be translocated across the membrane in prlA strains. Here we show, using a set of fusions of alkaline phosphatase to cytoplasmic domains of the MalF protein, that the topology of a number of these fusions is altered in prlA mutants. Further, we present evidence that, in one case, prlA mutations result in the inversion of the topology of a membrane protein. These results are discussed both in terms of the role of the Sec proteins in contributing to the topology of membrane proteins and the mechanism of prlA-mediated export.

After mutagenesis, cells were plated on NZ-amine-A plates containing 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-3-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (a chromogenic substrate for AP). Plates were incubated for 1 day at 37 °C and 1 day at 4 °C, and dark blue colonies were picked. Elevated AP activity in the mutants was assayed. The mutants were mapped by P1 cotransduction. Mutants mapping near secY were tested in two ways to see if they contained prlA mutations. The mutants' ability to export MalE18–1 (a version of MalE with a defective signal sequence) was assessed by transducing malE18–1 into the mutants from WP144 and plating on maltose tetrazolium medium (15Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar);malE18–1, prlA mutants are white on this medium;prlA + cells are red. The mutants' ability to export APΔ2–22 (a signal sequenceless version of AP) was assessed by transforming the mutants with pAID135 and plating on media containing 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-3-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 5 mmisopropyl-thio-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce production of APΔ2–22; prlA mutants are dark blue on these plates, while prlA + cells are light blue. Cells were grown in NZ-amine-A plus 200 μg/ml ampicillin to an optical density at 600 nm of approximately 0.4. The production of the MalF-AP fusions was induced for 30 min by the addition of IPTG at a final concentration of 5 mm. The cells were harvested, and alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed in duplicate as in Ref. 10Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar with less than 5% variation. 1.5-ml cultures were grown at 37 °C in M63 minimal medium containing 0.2% glucose, 50 μg/ml each of all amino acids except cysteine and methionine, and 5 mm IPTG. After growth to an optical density of approximately 0.4 at 600 nm, the cultures were labeled for 1 min with 45 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and chased with an excess of cold methionine for 30 min. 1 ml of cells was placed at 0 °C for 20 min, pelleted, and resuspended in cold spheroplast buffer containing 40% sucrose, 33 mm Tris, pH 8, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 5 μg/ml lysozyme. After 15 min at 0 °C, the spheroplasts were divided into 0.5-ml portions that were either left untreated or proteolyzed with proteinase K at a final concentration of 500 μg/ml for 20 min at 0 °C. Proteolysis was stopped with the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 0.4 μg/ml. The spheroplasts were separated from cell envelope proteins by pelleting (7 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C), resuspended in spheroplast buffer, and disrupted by freezing and thawing three times. Immunoprecipitation with antisera against AP and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography were performed as described (16Traxler B. Lee C. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5339-5345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in MOPS minimal medium (17Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 37 °C with 0.2% glucose and a 50 μg/ml concentration each of all amino acids except cysteine and methionine. They were induced with 0.04 mm IPTG for 15 min, pulse-labeled with 45 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 1 min, and chased for 2 min with an excess of cold methionine. Fractions of 0.5 ml were put on ice, and the following was added: 1 ml of 8 m urea, 0.2 ml of 1m iodoacetamide, 0.02 ml of 0.5 m EDTA, and 0.02 ml of 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples were then incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was taken as the urea-extractable fraction. The pellet was taken up in an equal volume of a urea solution of the same composition as the supernatant. The fractions were made 10% in trichloroacetic acid, incubated 15 min on ice, and then centrifuged. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were washed twice with cold 100% acetone. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described (18Pogliano K.J. Beckwith J. Genetics. 1993; 133: 763-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were released from IGSorb by suspension in 0.05 ml of SDS sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol and separated into two fractions. One fraction was reduced by incubation at 80 °C for 5 min with 1/10 volume of 0.2m dithiothreitol, and then 1/5 volume of 1m iodoacetamide was added to each fraction followed by a 5-min incubation at 80 °C. Equal volumes of each fraction were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels. Cultures were grown in MOPS medium as described above, induced with 0.1 mm IPTG for 15 min, and pulse-labeled as described above. At 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 min of chase, samples were removed to tubes on ice with 1/100 volume of 1 m iodoacetamide. After at least 5 min on ice, trichloroacetic acid precipitation, immunoprecipitation, sample preparation, and SDS-PAGE were carried out as described above. Initially, we set out to study the mechanism whereby basic amino acids act to anchor the cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins. To do this, we sought suppressor mutations that would reduce the anchoring activity of these amino acids and allow export of a cytoplasmic domain of a membrane protein. Such suppressors might be expected to alter the mechanism that responds to the presence of the basic amino acids. Their analysis, thus, might yield insights into this mechanism. We employed a strain in which alkaline phosphatase is fused to a cytoplasmic domain of MalF (the M fusion, Fig.1). The AP portion of this fusion is stably anchored in the cytoplasm by the basic aminoacyl residues in the MalF cytoplasmic domain that precedes it. In the cytoplasm, AP does not assemble into an active enzyme, since the the two essential intrachain disulfide bonds in AP cannot form (19Derman A.I. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7719-7722Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20Derman A.I. Prinz W.A. Belin D. Beckwith J. Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Thus, when AP is fused to cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins, it exhibits low enzymatic activity (21Boyd D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In contrast, when AP is fused to a periplasmic domain of a membrane protein, it is exported to the periplasm and becomes enzymatically active. Selecting mutants that increase AP activity of the M fusion should yield strains in which the AP is exported to the periplasmic space. Such mutants could include those that no longer recognize the basic amino acids as signals to anchor the AP in the cytoplasm. We chose the M fusion because we have previously shown that eliminating the basic aminoacyl residues in the MalF cytoplasmic domain that precedes the AP portion of this fusion results in increased export of AP (22Boyd D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9446-9450Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After mutagenesis with nitrosoguanidine, we detected 44 mutant colonies (at a frequency of 5 × 10−5) that exhibited increased alkaline phosphatase activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). P1 cotransduction experiments showed that 24 of 41 mutants tested carried suppressor mutations unlinked to the gene fusion. The remainder were due to alterations within the gene fusion that increased alkaline phosphatase activity. The unlinked suppressors were further mapped and all shown to lie in or close to the secY gene. Since it had already been shown thatprlA mutations can promote the export of cytoplasmic alkaline phosphatase in membrane protein fusions (11Puziss J.W. Strobel S.M. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 92-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Uhland K. Ehrle R. Zander T. Ehrmann M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4565-4571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Allard J.D. Bertrand K.P. J.

Bacteriol. 1997; 272: 4087-4093Google Scholar), we guessed that our set of mutations might also be prlA mutations. To test this explanation, we examined the effect of the suppressor mutations on the export of two proteins with defective signal sequences, the maltose-binding protein (MalE) with the signal sequence alteration 18–1 (M18R) and AP missing its entire signal sequence. All of the secY-linked mutants restored export to these proteins (data not shown), suggesting that they contained typicalprlA mutations that suppress a variety of alterations of signal sequences. Thus, the effects of these mutations were not limited to reversing the interference with export by basic amino acids, as we had hoped. To further study the suppression by prlA mutants, we transferred the following MalF-AP fusion constructs into the prlA4 mutant background: B, C, D, J, M, O, P, CΔ1, and DΔ1 (Fig. 1). For fusions C, M, O, P, and DΔ1, we found a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, indicating export of AP to the periplasmic space (TableII). The absence of any increase for all of the remaining fusions, except for D, was expected, since the alkaline phosphatase is already efficiently exported to the periplasm. The D fusion, on the other hand, allows little export of alkaline phosphatase and is unaffected by the prlA mutation. This refractory behavior may be due to the strength of the cytoplasmic anchoring signal in this fusion, to the stabilization of the topology resulting from interactions between the two transmembrane segments, or to a combination of both.Table IIAP activity of MalF-AP fusions expressed in prlA+ and prlA4 cellsFusion2-2001Expressed from plasmids.AP activityprlA +prlA4B7801200C21120D1316J620770M2-bExpressed from chromosome.2.210O61140P8.026C▵110001100D▵11408802-2001 Expressed from plasmids.2-b Expressed from chromosome. Open table in a new tab We considered two explanations for the export of the AP moiety of the MalF-AP M fusion protein in prlA strains (Fig. 2). First, the prlA mutation may result in a change in the topology of the membrane protein so that AP, still attached to MalF, is now in the periplasm rather than the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 B). Alternatively, the AP moiety in the cytoplasm may be cleaved from the fusion protein, and then the cleaved AP, lacking any export signal, is exported by the altered secretion machinery (Fig. 2 A). This latter explanation represents a reasonable alternative, since 1) many of the MalF-AP fusion proteins are known to be unstable (21Boyd D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and 2) AP without a signal sequence is exported in certain prlAmutants (10Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we examined the form of AP in the strain expressing the M fusion suppressed by aprlA mutation. SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the M fusion protein was still intact in the prlA mutant background, and very little free AP could be detected (Fig.3). When spheroplasts of this strain were treated with protease, there was a large increase in the amount of free soluble AP-sized breakdown product, indicating that the AP portion of the full-length fusion protein was in the periplasm. Such a product was not seen in the prlA + (wild-type) background. These results show that it is not cleaved cytoplasmic AP that is exported and, therefore, at least some aspects of the topological arrangement of the M fusion protein have been altered in the prlA mutant (Fig. 2 B). Since the AP portion of the L fusion (Fig. 1) is exported to the periplasm in prlA + cells (16Traxler B. Lee C. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5339-5345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Boyd D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), a strain expressing this fusion was included in Fig. 3 as a positive control. We wished to determine whether the altered protein translocation machinery in the prlA strain had affected the membrane topology of the entire MalF-AP M fusion protein or only affected the region where AP is fused. However, due to technical difficulties in assessing the topology of the M fusion strain, we studied alterations in topology of a simpler fusion protein (see below). For these studies, we chose the MalF-AP DΔ1 fusion protein (Fig. 1). The D fusion protein has AP fused to the second cytoplasmic domain of MalF and exhibits very low AP activity (Table II). The DΔ1 fusion protein was derived from the D fusion by the deletion of the first membrane-spanning segment of MalF (MSS1) and the short periplasmic domain that follows it (Fig.1 B; Ref. 23McGovern K. Ehrmann M. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2773-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The construct was made in such a way that MSS2 is now bounded by two hydrophilic domains that correspond to the first two cytoplasmic domains of MalF. The second cytoplasmic domain is then followed by AP. Both of these hydrophilic domains are enriched for basic amino acids. Since each of these domains could, in principle, act as a cytoplasmic anchor, it was not immediately obvious what the topology of this protein would be. However, analysis of the protein showed 1) that the AP moiety is in the cytoplasm, thus exhibiting very low enzymatic activity and 2) that the amino terminus of the fusion protein is exposed to proteolytic attack on the periplasmic surface of the cytoplasmic membrane (23McGovern K. Ehrmann M. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2773-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These findings led to the conclusion that the DΔ1 fusion protein has the topology indicated in Fig.1 B. We proposed that the net positive charge in the second cytoplasmic domain predominated in orienting the protein in the membrane (23McGovern K. Ehrmann M. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2773-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the presence of the prlA4 mutation, a strain bearing the DΔ1 fusion protein now exhibits high levels of AP activity (TableII). We asked whether the exported AP in this strain was still attached to the membrane protein or was the result of export of the AP moiety after cytoplasmic cleavage. This strain showed an added complexity in that, as we describe below, the exported AP still attached to MSS2 was slowly cleaved in the periplasm to release free soluble AP. This property made it difficult to evaluate the mechanism of export of DΔ1 using the same technique that we used to assess the M fusion. Instead, we made use of the fact that AP can only form disulfide bonds when it is in the periplasm but not in the cytoplasm. These disulfide bonds provide an accurate measure of the cellular location of AP. Experiments on the kinetics of export of AP as assayed by disulfide bond formation are presented in Fig. 4. There, we show 1) that the initial export of AP is very rapid, with a substantial proportion of the protein becoming oxidized (disulfide bonded) after a 1-min pulse-label and 1-min chase and 2) that the disulfide-bonded AP is still attached to MSS2. Thus, as with the M fusion, the export of the AP in the DΔ1 fusion is not due to export of an AP moiety that was cleaved from the fusion protein in the cytoplasm. However, it is also clear that the exported AP is slowly cleaved in the periplasm from the fusion protein. The cleaved material is marked with an asterisk in Fig. 4. Note that the reduced breakdown product and oxidized full-length protein run with the same mobility. In addition, two forms of mature OmpA are seen, because a fraction of this protein retained some secondary structure. We were interested in determining the topological arrangement of the DΔ1 fusion in the prlA background. We imagined two possible topologies for this protein that would depend on the mechanism of AP export (Fig. 5). In the first, the fusion protein initially inserts into the membrane in the same way as in a wild-type background, but the altered protein translocation machinery promotes export of AP. This export might lead to the structure depicted in Fig. 5 A, in which both amino terminus and carboxyl terminus of the hybrid protein are on the periplasmic face of the membrane. Such a protein would not be expected to be stably inserted in the membrane. In the second, the fusion protein, before any interaction with the membrane, is recognized by the prlA-altered secretion machinery differently than in the wild-type situation so that MSS2 is seen as an export signal allowing translocation of the AP moiety that follows it. The DΔ1 protein, in this case, would end up inserted in the membrane with the opposite topology from that which it exhibits in a wild-type background (Fig.5 B). To distinguish between these possibilities, we have used urea extraction to determine whether the fusion protein is stably anchored in the membrane. It has been shown that urea treatment of membranes does not release proteins that are stably integrated membrane proteins, but rather it will cause release of a protein that is only weakly inserted (24Gilmore R. Blobel G. Cell. 1985; 42: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The DΔ1 fusion protein in the prlAbackground is resistant to urea extraction, suggesting that it is stably anchored in the membrane via the full insertion of its MSS in the membrane (Fig. 6). Control experiments showed that the conditions we used extracted 97% of wild-type AP, while OmpA was resistant to extraction (data not shown). Longer exposures of the gel in Fig. 6 revealed small amounts of AP-sized breakdown product in the supernatant of the prlA4strain expressing the DΔ1 fusion. This probably reflects the slow cleavage of AP from DΔ1 after DΔ1 is inserted into the membrane (Fig. 4). Other fractionation methods, including extraction of spheroplasts or membranes with urea or extraction with 0.1n NaOH gave similar results; all full-length fusion protein was associated with the membrane fraction. Extraction with octyl glucoside, on the other hand, solubilized about half of the full-length fusion protein, as is seen with other integral membrane proteins under similar conditions (data not shown). SecB is a chaperone required for the efficient export of certain secreted proteins. AP is not one of these proteins (25Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in a prlA strain that exports AP lacking its signal sequence, the export is SecB-dependent (10Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This change in SecB dependence is thought to be due to the slower post-translational export of alkaline phosphatase that occurs in prlA-suppressed signal sequence mutants. We asked whether, in a prlA4 mutant, the translocation of the AP portion of the M and DΔ1 fusions is SecB-dependent. Whereas asecB + prlA4 strain expressing the M fusion has 10 units of AP activity (Table II), an isogenicsecB strain has only 1.7 units, indicating that export of the AP moiety of the M fusion requires SecB. In contrast, the translocation of AP in the DΔ1 fusion is largely independent of SecB (Fig. 4). The kinetics of OmpA export are slowed in the cells missing SecB (Fig. 4). Our results show that the topology of a membrane protein can be altered by mutations that alter the bacterial protein export machinery. The AP moiety of the MalF-AP M and DΔ1 fusions is localized to the cytoplasm in wild-type cells and the periplasm in prlA mutants. For both fusions, the export of AP caused by the prlA mutation was not due to cleavage of AP from the hybrid protein in the cytoplasm and subsequent translocation of the free signal sequenceless AP; the exported AP is still part of the hybrid protein. Thus, in both cases, the arrangement of the hybrid protein in the membrane of prlA mutants must be at least partly altered from the arrangement it assumes in wild-type cells. In the case of DΔ1, our results suggest that the topology of the protein has been completely and efficiently inverted. A transmembrane segment that in the wild-type protein and in the DΔ1 fusion acts as a stop-transfer sequence now appears to be acting as an export signal. These results suggest that the protein translocation apparatus contributes to determining the topology of the DΔ1 fusion; the prlA-altered Sec machinery may be unable to recognize some of the topogenic determinants in DΔ1. The mechanism of prlA-mediated export of DΔ1 is discussed below. An alternative explanation of our results is that the DΔ1 fusion is targeted for export in prlA mutants by its AP moiety, since the mature domain of AP is known to contain targeting information that allows it to be exported in prlA mutants (10Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 26Prinz W.A. Spiess C. Ehrmann M. Schierle C. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5209-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, there is a noticeable difference in the kinetics of prlA-mediated export of DΔ1 (Fig. 4) and that of AP with an altered or missing signal sequence. In the latter case, the export is quite slow, with half-times of export of about 5 min. In contrast, the AP moiety of the DΔ1 fusion is translocated quite rapidly, with about 50% being localized to the periplasm within a minute. Thus, it seems unlikely that the AP portion of DΔ1 is responsible for determining the topology of this fusion in prlA mutants. These findings raise the question of the role of the Sec machinery in the topological arrangement of membrane proteins under wild-type conditions. In most cases, the protein translocation machinery, if it is involved, would be only one of the several factors that contribute to the assumption and stability of membrane protein topology we have outlined in the introduction. Thus, alteration of this machinery by prlA mutations may not affect topology for most proteins. However, it could be that for membrane proteins of simple structure, for instance with a single transmembrane segment, some confusion of signals could take place in prlA strains, leading to a mixed population of topological structures. An effect of the altered secretion machinery on topology would then suggest that this machinery may be a contributor to the orientation of transmembrane segments of membrane proteins, in general. Such experiments may be limited by the folding properties of the normal cytoplasmic domains of these proteins. To consider this question, we take into account studies with the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane protein leader peptidase, which suggest the following properties of the assembly system for membrane proteins (27Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). When a hydrophilic domain of a membrane protein is less than 25 amino acids, the translocation of the domain across the membrane does not depend on the sec gene products. However, for domains larger than 25 amino acids, translocation does require the bacterial export machinery. Such long hydrophilic domains simply cannot pass through the lipid bilayer. A feature of the sec machinery that is also relevant to this discussion is the effect of basic amino acids on the exportability of proteins with signal sequences. Mutations that alter the amino acid sequence at the beginning of the mature protein to yield a net positive charge cause a defect in export (28Li P. Beckwith J. Inouye H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7685-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 29Yamane K. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19690-19696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gennity J. Goldstein J. Inouye M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 22: 233-269Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). But these altered proteins can be exported in strains carrying prlA mutations. The altered secretion machinery ignores the ordinarily inhibiting effect of the basic amino acids. This effect is not specific to the mechanism by which basic amino acids block export, since these prlAmutations also suppress mutants with altered or missing signal sequences (10Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We have proposed that prlA mutants alter the export machinery so that it no longer requires a signal sequence-induced change in conformation and now allows export of any unfolded protein (26Prinz W.A. Spiess C. Ehrmann M. Schierle C. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5209-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To explain the export of DΔ1, we picture the following steps in its assembly in a wild-type background. The positive charges at the carboxyl terminus of the hydrophobic MSS prevents DΔ1 from being engaged by the export machinery or being properly oriented in the machinery. Instead, this hydrophobic sequence inserts into the lipid bilayer as a result of its natural affinity for the membrane. Ordinarily, the orientation of this MSS is determined by the “positive-inside rule,” whereby positively charged hydrophilic domains of membrane proteins tend to be localized to the cytoplasm. However, in DΔ1, there are positively charged residues at both ends of the MSS. Our previous studies have shown that the N terminus of DΔ1 is translocated into the periplasm, despite its net positive charge (23McGovern K. Ehrmann M. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2773-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This translocation may not besec-dependent, since it has been suggested that N-terminal export of this sort does not utilize the secmachinery (31Whitely P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Cao G. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two possibilities are as follows. 1) The prlA-altered secretion machinery is now primed to accept unfolded proteins and begins to incorporate alkaline phosphatase with its attached hydrophobic export signal. Since the prlA-altered export machinery no longer rejects proteins with basic amino acids following this hydrophobic sequence, the protein is aligned with the machinery with its export signal in the portion of the complex where signal sequences normally lie. Previous studies with prlA mutants have shown slow export of proteins with defective or missing signal sequences (10Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, DΔ1 still maintains an intact highly hydrophobic sequence, which may add to the facilitation of export by contributing to the activation of the apparatus already primed by the prlA mutation. 2) Alternatively, the prlA-altered machinery may act to export AP after DΔ1 has assumed the orientation in the membrane found in the wild type. If this is the case, the translocation of the AP to the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane will bring with it at least a portion of the carboxyl terminus of the MSS. This would lead to the likely membrane-unstable structure shown in Fig. 5 A. Our results with urea extraction and other fractionation techniques support the first model, in which the DΔ1 protein is stably inserted in the membrane, with its amino terminus in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6). Export of wild-type alkaline phosphatase is not SecB-dependent (25Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the export of signal sequenceless AP or AP in the M fusion in a prlA mutant is SecB-dependent (10Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). SecB is required to maintain certain exported proteins in a translocation-competent conformation (33Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Cell. 1986; 46: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We suggest that export of wild-type AP is so rapid that SecB is not required; translocation outpaces folding. However, in the signal sequenceless AP or in the M fusion, the export is so slow that SecB is needed to maintain the cytoplasmically accumulating form in a conformation that can be exported. If this explanation is correct, it is the rapid export of AP seen in the DΔ1 fusion in a prlA background that avoids the requirement for SecB."

Most known mobile IS 1The abbreviations used are: IS, insertion sequence; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s). can be inserted at a large number of chromosomal sites. They can subsequently be recombined and excised precisely or imprecisely, and they can engender inversions or deletions in neighboring chromosomal regions (1Galas D.J. Chandler M. Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1989: 109-162Google Scholar, 2Kleckner N. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 297-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The presence of these insertion elements in the chromosome of Escherichia coli and other bacteria such asSalmonella typhimurium or Bacillus subtilisoriginally became apparent as a result of the transposition of these sequences from their natural positions into functional genes, which can lead to recognizable mutant phenotypes. As a corollary, their derived deletions, inversions, and other gene rearrangements could also result in phenotypic changes that could normally be stable and easily identifiable. Relevant models of cryptic gene activation by insertion of IS elements into the regulator or promoter region have been reported by several authors. The cryptic cel operon is activated in E. coli by insertion of IS1, IS2 or IS5 into a region 72–180 bp upstream from the transcription start site due to an unknown mechanism that does not involve provision of a promoter sequence (3Parker L.L. Hall B.G. Genetics. 1990; 124: 473-482PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been described that certain excisions of inserted elements function as activation mechanisms. For example, phnE is activated by excision of an 8-bp insertion, which causes a frameshift mutation present in the crypticphn operon (4Makino K. Kim S.K. Shinagawa H. Amemura M. Nakata A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2665-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In another context, transpositions and subsequent deletions or inversions cause changes in the regular expression of several gene systems. Among the mutations mapped in the promoter region of the araBAD operon (5Eleuterio M. Griffin B. Sheppard D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 111: 383-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) two insertions of IS1 were found, which resulted in reduced expression of this operon and hence the inability to utilize arabinose (6Miyada G.C. Sheppard D.E. Wilcox G. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 765-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inversion, of uncertain origin in this case, of a 6-kb fragment containingslpA and slpB in Lactobacillus acidophilus, leads to the positioning of the silentslpB gene behind the slpA promoter, which is located outside the inverted segment, whereas the slpA gene is stored at the silent position of the slpB gene (7Boot H.J. Kolen C.P.A.M. Pouwels P.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Various chromosomal rearrangements subsequent to Tn10-mediated inversions that connect the udpgene and promoters of rrn operons were characterized in E. coli (8Fonstein M. Nikolskaya T. Zaporojets D. Nikolsky Y. Kulakauskas S. Mironov A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), some of them involving more complicated events such as partial internal reinversions. Overexpression of udpin these mutants complemented thymine auxotrophy. Another example of these events is a rearrangement subsequent to a REP-mediated gene duplication, which placed the his operon under the control of argR in Salmonella typhimurium (9Anderson R.P. Roth J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 119: 147-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Shyamala V. Schneider E. Ames G.F.-L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Unexplained inversions and chromosomal rearrangements of up to one-third of the total length have been found in E. coli(11Xia X.M. Enomoto M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 12Hill C.W. Harnish B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although precise phenotypic changes were not determined in these models, the effects of these major chromosomal rearrangements on cell fitness have been studied by Hill and Gray (14Hill C.W. Gray J.A. Genetics. 1988; 119: 771-778PubMed Google Scholar) following the growth of two E. coli strains with inversions between rRNA operons. According to this and other studies (15Mahan M.J. Roth J.R. Genetics. 1991; 129: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) establishment of the inversions appears to depend on the type of genes present within the chromosomal interval. In thinking about evolutionary mechanisms, rearrangements have not been given the consideration that point mutations have received (16Roth J.R. Benson N. Galitski T. Haack K. Lawrence J.G. Miesel L. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1996: 2256-2276Google Scholar). Nevertheless, rearrangements subsequent to insertion element-jumping events appear to play a role in evolution. Among the insertion sequences able to participate in genome rearrangements, IS1 is one of the smallest autonomous transposable elements known. It can transpose in both a replicative and a conservative manner, but it rarely gives rise to inversions (17Turlan C. Chandler M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5410-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An inversion induced by a resident IS1 of the lactose transposon Tn951 (18Cornelis G. Saedler H. Mol. Gen.

Res. Commun. 1973; 51: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were grown aerobically on Luria broth or minimal medium (24Boronat A. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For growth on minimal medium, carbon sources were added at concentrations of 12 mm for l-lyxose, 20 mm for glycerol, and 0.5% for casein acid hydrolysate. When necessary, the antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; tetracycline, 12.5 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 30 μg/ml. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside were used at 30 and 10 μg/ml, respectively. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (24Boronat A. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).l-Xylulose kinase activity was determined from the rate of NADH oxidation. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 4 mml-xylulose, 1 mm ATP, 1.75 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm NADH, 0.35 mm reduced glutathione and 2 units/ml of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Chromosomal DNA was obtained using the genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmid DNA was routinely prepared by the boiling method (25Holmes D.S. Quigley M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). For a large scale preparation, a crude DNA sample was purified through a column (Qiagen GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany). Other standard DNA manipulations were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination procedure of Sanger et al. (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) by using the T7 sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Double-stranded plasmid DNA was used as the template. Ordered deletions were obtained with the Erase-a-Base system (Promega). Universal or T3 primers were used. To avoid sequencing errors, both strands were sequenced by regular dGTP as well as dITP or 7-deaza-dGTP reactions. Primer A (TTTGGTGGTCAGGCGAT) and primer B (CACACTTTGCGCTACCA) were also used to confirm the sequence of the two insertional points in the regulator gene. The GenBankTM data base was searched with the TFASTA algorithm (28Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). For Southern blot analysis, restriction fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nylon filters, and fixed by incubating at 80 °C for 2 h. A 32P-labeled probe was used in the detection of hybridization products. Chromosomal DNA from strains ECL1 and JA134 were totally digested with SalI and then ligated with the λ EMBL4 cleaved with SalI as described by Sambrooket al. (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The packaging of ligation mixtures in vitro was performed by using the Packagene extract system (Promega) and propagated on NM539 (P2) for Spi selection of recombinant phages. For strain JA134 a partial Sau3A genomic library was also prepared in a BamHI digested EMBL4 phage. For preparation of total RNA, cells of a 25-ml culture grown to anA650 of 0.5 were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min and processed as described by Belasco et al. (29Belasco J.G. Beatty T. Adams C.W. von Gabain A. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1985; 40: 171-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Northern blot hybridization was performed with each RNA sample (10 μg) by following the procedure described previously by Moralejo et al. (30Moralejo P. Egan S.M. Hidalgo E. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5585-5594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chloramphenicol resistance cassette CAT19 was used in the gene inactivation experiments (31Fuqua W.C. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 223-225PubMed Google Scholar) by inserting it into the restriction site indicated below. This cassette had no terminator in the downstream region of the CAT gene and thus did not cause polarity when inserted in the same orientation as the interrupted gene. The plasmid-carrying inactivated gene was linearized by SalI digestion and used to transform strain JC7623 to chloramphenicol resistance. This strain efficiently recombines linear DNA into its chromosome (32Winans S.C. Elledge S.J. Krueger J.H. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P1virlysates obtained from the selected chloramphenicol resistance recombinants were used to transduce the CAT insertions into the parental strain ECL1 or the mutant strain JA134. Reactions were performed on purified chromosomal DNA with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol and 100 pmol of each of the oligonucleotide primers in 100 μl of reaction mixture. The reaction routinely consisted of 30 cycles. The primers used to amplify the junction region proximal to the origin (min 0) in the mutant strain were: REG2 (GTCACTTTCATCCCAGGC) and HIS1 (GAAATCATCACCTACGGC) and those used to amplify the distal junction region were REG1 (CGCCATGTAGATCTTGC) and 28K1 (AGCCTGGCCTTTGGTAGC). For Southern analysis covering the full-length of inverted DNA, over 50 probes of 1 kb at intervals of approximately 15 kb were prepared by PCR using pairs of primers of 18–20 bp (not shown), which were designed following the E. coli genome sequence in GenBankTM. PCR products were resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen GmbH). Mutant strain JA134 is an ECL1 derivative selected for its ability to grow on the rare sugarl-lyxose, which does not support growth of wild-type strain. This mutant was characterized by constitutively expressing thel-xylulose kinase activity involved in thel-lyxose metabolism (20Sánchez J.C. Giménez R. Schneider A. Fessner W.D. Baldomà L. Aguilar J. Badı́a J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29665-29669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encodingl-xylulose kinase was cloned in plasmid pJC2 (Fig.1). Here we have attempted the sequencing of the insert present in pJC2. This sequence displayed total identity with that of the open reading frame located between positions 6123 and 7619 in the entry AE000435 (section 325 of 400). Thel-xylulose kinase gene was thus identified as part of a gene cluster, which according to its location at 80.6 min of the E. coli genome has been designated as yiaJ-S(33Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. Rudd K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11921-11925Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Based on the genome analysis by Sofia et al. (34Sofia H.J. Burland V. Daniels D.L. Plunkett G. Blattner R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) this cluster is formed by nine genes encoding products for carbohydrate metabolism (yiaK to yiaS), transcribed clockwise, and one (yiaJ) transcribed anticlockwise (Fig. 1). Northern analysis of total RNA of strain JA134 using probes of the structural genes yiaP and yiaR showed that transcription of the operon was detected in all growth conditions used. Fig. 2 A displays a typical experiment with a yiaP internal probe. The probe was32P-labeled by the random primed method (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a 360-bpAgeI-XhoI fragment as template. The pattern of transcript molecules always showed several bands due to fragmentation of the long messenger RNA. In contrast, no transcript was found in wild-type strain preparations run in parallel. Determination ofl-xylulose kinase in crude extracts of the same cultures used for isolation of RNA displayed similar high activity values of 105–115 nmol/min/mg. These results allowed us to usel-xylulose kinase as a reporter activity of the expression of the yiaK-S operon. The putative role of yiaJ gene as regulator of yiaK-Swas approached by characterization and inactivation of this gene. Sequence analysis of the regulator gene product and comparison with other regulator sequences showed a helix-turn-helix motif of binding to DNA and a second motif of unknown function (Fig.3). Both motifs were also found in regulator proteins such as glycerol activator (streptomyces), acetate repressor (S. typhimurium), or Kdg repressor involved in pectinolysis in Erwinia chrysanthemi, all belonging to the known “IclR” family (35Reverchon S. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2203-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The proposed regulator gene upstream of the operon was inactivated by a CAT cassette insertion in wild-type cells. To this end a clone encompassing the complete operon was isolated from a SalI chromosomal library of wild-type strain ECL1 prepared as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” The clone was selected by hybridization with a probe 32P-labeled by the random primed method (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using as template a 520-bp XhoI-EcoRV internal fragment obtained from pJC2. The 3.2-kb HindIII fragment containing the proposed regulator gene was subcloned in pBR322 (plasmid pJB1). Inactivation of the putative regulator gene was carried out by insertion of CAT cassette in the BglII restriction site present in plasmid pJB1 insert, yielding plasmid pJB2 (Fig. 1) and the mutant gene transferred to the wild-type ECL1 background yielding strain JA161. The correct integration of the CAT resistance gene was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (not shown). The effects of the inactivation of the putative regulator gene were analyzed in cell extracts of strain JA161 by measuring thel-xylulose kinase activity, which was found to be present in growth conditions that did not yield this same activity in wild-type cells. Furthermore, Northern analysis of total RNA of strain JA161 using probes of the structural genes yiaP and yiaR (not shown) were indistinguishable from those obtained with total RNA of strain JA134. When a BglII-AgeI probe internal to the regulator gene was used, Northern analysis showed a single constitutive transcript in RNA preparations of strain ECL1 (Fig. 2 B) and no transcript in the CAT mutated strain JA161 (not shown). The derived constitutivity in the expression of the yiaK-S operon in strain JA161 indicated that the yiaJ had regulatory functions and that this system is under the control of a repressor protein encoded by this gene. The constitutive expression of yiaK-S operon in strain JA134 thus suggested that the mutation responsible could affect this operon regulatory region. To characterize the mutation, a probe32P-labeled by the random primed method using a 640-bpEcoRV-HindIII fragment belonging to yiaK (see Fig. 1) was used to hybridize Southern blots of the wild type and mutant JA134 DNA digested with SalI,BamHI, or HindIII. The hybridization pattern obtained in these experiments for each of the indicated restriction enzymes was clearly different in the wild type and mutant strain (Fig.4). These results are consistent with the presence of an insertion or deletion in the nearby region encompassing the regulator and the yiaK-S operon promoter. Furthermore, the search of the regulator gene transcript using aBglII-AgeI probe internal to the regulator gene, showed no band of hybridization (Fig. 2 B), consistent with the type of proposed mutation that could abolish initiation of transcription or synthesize an anomalous messenger not detected with the probe used. The absence of transcript of the regulator gene reported above was the result of a mutation in this gene and is not compatible with a mutation in the promoter region of the structural genes. For this reason the nature of the mutation was studied in the yiaJ regulator gene. A clone of the mutated regulator was isolated from a SalI library of strain JA134, using a probe prepared with the internalBglII-AgeI fragment (Fig. 1). Its SalI insert was transferred to Bluescript vector yielding clone pJB3 (Fig.5). Restriction analysis of the insert in plasmid pJB3 indicated that foreign DNA sequences were present in the regulator. To further identify the DNA fragment not belonging to the regulator gene, different subclones of plasmid pJB3 were prepared and their terminal ends were sequenced. Computational analysis showed 100% similarity with sequences corresponding to IS186, and to the ant, dnaJ and dnaK genes, all located at 0.4 min. The shortest clone (pJB4) containing the fragment with the joining site for regulator and foreign DNA was obtained and the corresponding insert was totally sequenced. Comparison of the sequences of pJB4 clone with GenBankTM sequences allowed us to locate an IS1insertion element between sequences corresponding to the regulator gene and those corresponding to the 0.4 min, which were found to be inverted with respect to their natural genome order (see Fig. 5). To determine the other joining site, not included in pJB3, a clone from a Sau3A library of strain JA134 was isolated using a probe prepared with the yiaK internal fragmentEcoRV-HindIII. Likewise, a 2-kb internalHindIII fragment of the Sau3A clone was transferred to Bluescript vector, yielding clone pJB5. Restriction analysis of the insert in plasmid pJB5 indicated again that DNA sequences not belonging to the regulator region were present. Sequencing of clone pJB6, derived from pJB5, showed sequences of the regulator and of another IS1 insertion element determining the other junction point in the interrupted repressor gene. This implied an IS1 transposition into the repressor. This insertion element sits in this case between the 5′-end part sequences of the regulator and sequences identical to those located between positions 20227 and 20460 in the 0–2.4 min region (accession numberD10483). The IS1 transposed displayed opposite polarity and a totally identical sequence with the IS1 naturally found in the 0.4 min of the E. coli chromosome (36Yura T. Mori H. Nagay H. Nagata T. Ishihama A. Fujita N. Isono K. Mizobuchi K. Nakata A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3305-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The two IS1 elements had the transposition-generated repeats derived from the target regulator sequences on only one side. The size of the inversion and possible changes in the gene order inside the inverted fragment were checked by Southern analysis. To this end, PCR fragments of about 1 kb were used to prepare32P-labeled probes every 15 kb along the putative inverted region. Comparison of the patterns in the Southern experiments using digested DNA from wild-type strain ECL1 and mutant strain JA134 with BamHI, EcoRI, SalI, PstI orHindIII restriction enzymes displayed no differences. It was thus established that the inversion was up to 920 kb in length and that no other internal rearrangement occurred in the inverted fragment. To confirm the specific mutation two oligomers flanking each of the junction sites of the inversion (see “Materials and Methods”) were used in amplification of genomic DNA obtained from wild type (strain ECL1) and mutant strain JA134. A PCR product of amplification was found when mutant DNA, but not wild-type DNA, was the template. The constitutivity of the yiaK-S operon expression subsequent to the IS1 transposition into its regulator implied phenotypic consequences reflected by the acquisition of the ability to utilizel-lyxose. The stability of this mutation is of obvious interest for its evolutionary significance. To determine the stability of the constitutive expression of yiaK-S operon in strain JA134, the permanence of the l-lyxose utilization as a reporter phenotype was followed in its offspring. To this end, a culture of 1 colony-forming unit/ml of strain JA134 was grown on LB broth up to 5 × 109 colony-forming unit/ml. This culture was diluted and reinoculated for a second growth to the same cell densities. The experiment allowed more than 30 generations without any selective pressure for l-lyxose utilization. At the end of the culturing, 5 × 103 colony-forming units were plated on glycerol and replica-plated on l-lyxose. All colonies kept the l-lyxose positive phenotype. Among the multiple changes that may originate phenotypic modifications, we present a case in which the regulator gene of an operon is interrupted by an inserted DNA fragment. This fragment, of an unusual length of approximately 920 kb, is flanked by two IS1 elements. Fine analysis of the sequences of plasmids pJB4 and pJB6 suggested that the insertion into the regulator was the result of an intramolecular transposition, leaving the IS1elements with opposite polarity. Furthermore, an inverted gene order of the foreign DNA is seen in plasmid pJB3, whereas sequences of the repressor and 0.4 min region are found adjacent to each of the terminal ends of the IS1 in plasmid pJB5. Attending to these observations, it is concluded that a genome inversion from 0.4 to 80.6 min, interrupting the regulator gene (yiaJ), has taken place in mutant strain JA134. The indicated region could be inverted in the process of IS1 intramolecular transposition itself as a consequence of ligation in opposite polarity of IS1 ends with the staggered break ends in the target (yiaJ) gene, precisely located in 80.6 min (Fig. 6). However, as indicated by Turlan and Chandler (17Turlan C. Chandler M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5410-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) for IS1 and by Weinert et al. (37Weinert T.A. Schaus N.A. Grindley N.D. Science. 1983; 222: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) for IS903 these insertion-inversion events, although possible in intramolecular transposition, are very infrequent if present at all. The mutation presented here, despite the scarce occurrence of this type of rearrangements, indicates its potential participation in genome evolution. At present we have no information on the frequency of this or similar mutations. Despite the relatively well known genetic organization of IS1, its mechanism of transposition and consequently the resulting rearrangement products are poorly understood. As has been widely discussed (1Galas D.J. Chandler M. Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1989: 109-162Google Scholar, 37Weinert T.A. Schaus N.A. Grindley N.D. Science. 1983; 222: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) another speculative mechanism cannot be ruled out as an alternative to the process described above. Transposition, intermolecular in this case, and subsequent recombination between IS1 at min 0.4 and the IS1 newly inserted into the repressor, could also promote one such rearrangement. Since the products of any of the two mechanisms are indistinguishable, including the distribution of the transposition-generated repeats of the neighbor target sequences, we cannot at present discriminate between them. Nevertheless, the requirement of two independent events in this second proposed mechanism argues against the probability of its occurrence in the selection process. It has been pointed out by several authors that insertion-inversion events that change the location of certain genes with respect to the origin of replication may be detrimental or lethal (38Segall A. Mahan M.J. Roth J.R. Science. 1988; 241: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This is seen as one of the functional barriers to inversion detection. To explain this, several functional consequences are invoked. They are, among others, changes in copy number of some fundamental genes, obstructive orientation impeding replication, or disturbance of the symmetrical positioning of the origin, requiring one of the growing forks to copy more than half of the chromosome. The fragment inverted in mutant strain JA134 spanned from 80.6 to 0.4 min and thus involved the replication origin oriC located at 84.5 min. It is of interest that in our study, not only was the insertion-inversion mutant viable and able to be isolated, but also growth on different carbon sources and conditions were indistinguishable from that obtained with wild-type strain. In this model a genome rearrangement (insertion-inversion) of specific phenotypic consequences is presented as well as the mechanism leading to it. This is in contrast to most of the similar or larger insertion-inversions of unknown origin and undetermined phenotypic consequences. The constitutivity of yiaK-S operon, as indicated by the ability to utilize l-lyxose, is a stable genetic trait indicating that the mutation inactivating the repressor does not easily revert. In this context it is of interest to consider that reversion of insertion mutations such as the one described here are likely to be imperfect, leaving the IS1 element or other parts of the transposed DNA in place. These reversions would maintain the target gene interruption, giving rise to stable phenotypes.

https://openalex.org/W2008852269,"Muscle-specific alternative RNA splicing is an essential step during myogenesis. In this paper, we report that a muscle-specific transcription factor, MyoD, plays a central role in the induction of muscle-specific alternative splicing during myogenesis. Recently, we reported that muscle and nonmuscle isoforms of the mitochondrial ATP synthase γ-subunit (F1γ) were generated by alternative splicing and that acidic stimulation promoted this muscle-specific alternative splicing (Endo, H., Matsuda, C., and Kagawa, Y. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 12488–12493). In this report, mouse myoblasts are shown to express the muscle-specific isoform of F1γ after induction with low-serum medium (differentiation medium) or acidic medium, although myotube formation was not detected after acidic induction. RNA blot analysis revealed that the expression levels of both MEF2 and myogenin were increased by low-serum induction, but not by acidic induction. High expression of MyoD mRNA was observed after both types of induction. Overexpression of exogenous MyoD in fibroblasts showed that MyoD was necessary for muscle-specific alternative splicing in both types of induction. Exogenous Id, a negative regulator of MyoD, blocked muscle-specific alternative splicing of F1γ pre-mRNA by both types of induction. In addition, MyoD induced several muscle-specific alternative splicings, including structural protein pre-mRNAs such as β-tropomyosin and neural-cell adhesion molecule and transcriptional protein pre-mRNAs such as MEF2A and MEF2D. Our analysis of the two induction systems shows a common MyoD-dependent mechanism of muscle-specific alternative splicing in several genes, independent of MEF2 and myogenin.

Understanding the regulatory cascade for tissue-specific alternative splicing during terminal differentiation would elucidate a direct trigger for the alternative splicing mechanism.

On the other hand, Id, a helix-loop-helix protein, is a negative regulator of bHLH proteins through direct protein-protein interaction. Id is expressed at various levels in some stem cell lines, and a decrease in Id mRNA levels triggers terminal differentiation (18Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) was originally identified as a muscle-specific DNA-binding factor induced when skeletal myoblasts differentiate into myotubes (19Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). There are four members of the MEF2 family of proteins (MEF2A through MEF2D), and all share a region of homology, the MADS box and the MEF2 domain (20Pollock R. Treisman R.

A recent study shows that the MEF2 and MyoD families act within a regulatory network that establishes differentiated phenotypes of skeletal muscle and that MEF2 factors act as coregulators to potentiate the myogenic activities of myogenic bHLH proteins (26Molkentin J.D.

The gene of β-TM contains two sets of alternatively spliced, mutually exclusive exons whose utilization is tissue-dependent and developmentally regulated (3Helfman D.M. Cheley S. Kuismanen E. Finn L.A. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3582-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Wang Y.C. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 13821-13827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); exon 6a is shared by mRNAs expressed in mouse smooth muscle and nonmuscle tissues, whereas exon 6b is present only in skeletal muscle-specific transcripts (27Wang Y.C. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2728-2736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wang Y.C. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12004-12010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-CAM mRNA includes the muscle-specific sequence domain (MSD) located between exons 12 and 13 in a cassette mode. Whereas β-TM mRNA contains exon 6a and N-CAM mRNA does not include the MSD in mouse myoblasts, exon 6b is selected in β-TM mRNA and the MSD is included in N-CAM mRNA when myoblasts convert to myotubes (27Wang Y.C.

MEF2A transcripts are ubiquitous, but accumulate preferentially in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain (20Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 21Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In these tissues, MEF2A activity is elevated because the tissue-specific isoform containing the SEEEELEL sequence is present (21Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). MEF2D transcripts are widely expressed, but alternative splicing in the two domains gives rise to a muscle-specific isoform (24Breitbart R.E. Liang C. Smoot L.B. Laheru D.A. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Martin J.F. Miano J.M. Hustad C.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). One domain is alternatively spliced in a mutually exclusive fashion, and the other is regulated in a cassette mode and includes the peptide TGDHLDL. Recently, we cloned the mitochondrial ATP synthase γ-subunit(F1γ) gene and showed that its heart and skeletal muscle-specific isoforms are generated by alternative splicing in the human and the cow (34Matsuda C. Endo H. Hirata H. Morosawa H. Nakanishi M. Kagawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 35Matsuda C. Endo H. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24950-24958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As muscle tissues require a rapid energy supply, the expression of muscle-type F1γ is thought to be an adaptation to the tissue-specific energy requirement. We also showed that this muscle-type mRNA excluding exon 9 in a cassette mode was induced cell-specifically by intracellular acidosis in human fibrosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cells (36Endo H. Matsuda C. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12488-12493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This acidic induction of alternative splicing is a reversible system, indicating that the nonmuscle-type mRNA containing exon 9 is a default type and thatde novo protein synthesis is required for muscle-specific alternative splicing. The alternative splicing of F1γ is very useful as a marker for studying muscle-specific splicing because the splicing is controlled in a simple cassette mode and the expression levels before and after induction do not change significantly. In this report, we show the new muscle-specific alternative splicing induction system using mouse myoblasts, in which acidic stimulation induces muscle-specific splicing without expression of MEF2 and myogenin and finally without myotube formation. We identified a muscle-specific transcriptional regulatory factor involved in splicing regulation and investigated its influence on many genes. A common MyoD-dependent regulatory cascade for muscle-specific alternative splicing is described, and Id is shown to inhibit muscle-specific alternative splicing via blocking the induction of MyoD. The cDNA encoding mouse F1γ was isolated from a Balb/c 3T3 cDNA library using the plaque hybridization method with the cloned PCR product of human F1γ cDNA as a probe (35Matsuda C. Endo H. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24950-24958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For preparation of the probe, sense and antisense strand oligonucleotides (5′-TTC-GAA-ATA-TGG-CAA-CTT-TGA-AAG-AT-3′ and 3′-GGA-CTT-CTG-TTC-TTC-TTT-GTG-G-5′, corresponding to nucleotides 96–121 and 284–305, respectively, in HeLa F1γ cDNA (GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank accession number D16562)) were synthesized and used as primers in the PCR amplification of cDNA from human liver. The amplified DNA fragment (210 base pairs in length) was subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene). A Balb/c 3T3 cDNA library, constructed in the λgt10 phage vector, was a gift from Dr. S. Tominaga (Jichi Medical school, Tochigi, Japan). Plaque hybridization was performed using 32P-labeled human F1γ cDNA, and positive clones were isolated. The cDNA was subcloned and sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method (37Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The nucleotide sequences of both strands of the cDNA were determined. Mouse BALB/c genomic DNA was purified from liver cells according to a previously described method (38Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). A portion of the mouse F1γ genomic gene was amplified using the long and accurate PCR method at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles at 98 °C for 20 s and 68 °C for 15 min using a pair of specific primers (5′-CCC-GCC-AGG-CTG-TCA-TCA-CAA-AGG-AGT-TGA-TT-3′ and 3′-CAG-TCT-TCT-TTG-AAC-CAG-GTG-ACT-CAA-TGT-TTC-5′, corresponding to the cDNA sequences upstream and downstream, respectively, of an alternatively spliced exon), in a total volume of 50 μl using the TaKaRa LA PCR kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan). This PCR fragment (∼2.8 kilobase pairs in length) was subcloned into the dideoxy-T vector of pBluescript II SK+ and then sequenced on both strands. Mouse C3H10T1/2 clone 8 fibroblast cells (10T1/2 cells) were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank. Mouse C2C12 cells (a myoblast cell line) and BC3H1 cells (a myoblastoid cell line) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The C2C12 and 10T1/2 cells were grown in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Flow Laboratories)) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were plated on 10-cm diameter tissue culture dishes. When the C2C12 cells grew to semiconfluence, the growth medium was replaced with two different media. Differentiation (low-serum) medium contained Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% heat-inactivated horse serum (Irvine Scientific), and acidic (low-pH) medium contained Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2.7 mm NaHCO3 for C2C12 and 10T1/2 cells or 5.4 mm NaHCO3 for BC3H1 cells. BC3H1 cells are less viable in acidic medium. Cells were harvested after 3 days. Total RNA was prepared from C2C12 and 10T1/2 cells using the acid guanidine method (39Chomczynsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Formaldehyde gel for RNA electrophoresis was prepared as described previously (38Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). cDNA for probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a random priming kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA blot hybridization was performed as described previously (38Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Full-length mouse MyoD cDNA (provided by Dr. H. Weintraub, Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) (6Davis R.L. Weintraub H.

Mouse Id cDNA encompassing nucleotides 61–851 (18Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) were constructed by RT-PCR. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) and primed with oligo(dT16) primer. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min in a total volume of 100 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 11.5 mm MgCl, 200 nm each dNTP, 10 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer, 1:20 (v/v) synthesized first-strand cDNA, and 2.5 units of recombinantTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co.). These cloned cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK+ and subsequently sequenced according to the dideoxy termination method (37Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). Primer sequences used for amplification were as follows: mouse Id, 5′-GCT-CCC-CTC-CGC-CTG-TTC-TC-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-AGT-GTC-TTT-CCC-AGA-GAT-CCC-3′ (antisense strand); MEF2A, 5′-CGA-GTT-GTC-ATC-CCC-CCT-TCA-A-3′ (sense strand, primer G) and 5′-GTG-TTG-TAG-GCA-GTC-GGC-ATT-G-3′ (antisense strand, primer H); and myogenin, 5′-CGC-CTA-CAG-GCC-TTG-CTC-AGC-T-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-GCA-ACA-GAC-ATA-TCC-TCC-ACC-3′ (antisense strand). To identify the possible alternative exons of F1γ, β-TM from exons 5 to 7, N-CAM from exons 12 and 13, MEF2A, and MEF2D (10 μg of total RNA) were used to synthesize first-strand cDNAs as described above. PCR amplifications of F1γ, β-TM, N-CAM, and MEF2A were performed in a total volume of 100 μl as described above by heating the DNA at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min in 25, 25, 35, and 30 cycles, respectively. PCR of MEF2D was performed (stored at 94 °C for 9 min; subjected to 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and then stored at 72 °C for 7 min) in a total volume 100 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl, 200 μm each dNTP, 10 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer, 1:20 (v/v) synthesized first-strand cDNA, and 2.5 units of recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold™, Perkin-Elmer). The oligonucleotides were as follows: F1γ, 5′-GTC-ATC-ACA-AAA-GAG-TTG-ATT-G-3′ (sense strand, primer A) and 5′-TAA-TGG-AGG-AAC-AGT-TTC-TTC-G-3′ (antisense strand, primer B); N-CAM, 5′-GAC-TGG-CGG-CCC-TCA-ACG-GCA-A-3′ (sense strand at exon 12, primer E) and 5′-CCA-GAT-AGT-GTC-TGA-TGG-GGG-A-3′ (antisense strand at exon 13, primer F); β-TM, 5′-GCT-GGT-GAT-CCT-GGA-AGG-GG-3′ (sense strand at exon 5, primer C) and 5′-GTA-TTT-GTC-CTC-TTT-GGT-GG-3′ (antisense strand at exon 7, primer D); MEF2A, as described above; and MEF2D, 5′-CAA-CGA-GCC-ACA-CGA-GAG-CCG-CAC-CAA-3′ (sense strand, primer I) and 5′-AAG-CTC-GGG-CAC-TGA-CAT-AGC-C-3′ (antisense strand, primer J) (25Martin J.F. Miano J.M. Hustad C.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Amplified PCR products of MEF2D were digested with XmnI. The size of the PCR products was determined by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the products were stained with ethidium bromide. One-fifth of the β-TM PCR products was fractionated on a 3% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under denaturing conditions. The nylon membrane was then hybridized with (probe A 5′-CTT-GAG-GGC-TTG-GTC-CAT-3′) for exon 6a and (probe B 5′-TTC-CAG-GGA-TTT-CAA-GTT-GT-3′) for exon 6b as probes. The oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by T4 nucleotide kinase. The Id cDNA coding sequence 61–851 (18Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar) was cloned as described above. Human 6-o-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (hMGMT) (provided by Dr. H. Hayakawa, Kyushu University School of Medicine) (40Hayakawa H. Koike G. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was used as a control. MyoD, Id, and hMGMT cDNAs were ligated to the XhoI site of pcDEBSRα, which is an eukaryotic expression vector containing a hygromycin resistance gene (pcDEBSRα-MyoD, pcDEBSRα-Id, and pcDEBSRα-hMGMT). To confirm the expression of MyoD mRNA, we used RT-PCR analysis. The oligonucleotide sequences for PCR amplification were as follows: 5′-CGG-CGG-CAG-AAT-GGC-TAC-GAC-ACC-3′ (sense strand, corresponding to MyoD cDNA codons 817–840); and oligonucleotide B, 5′-CAC-TGC-ATT-CTA-GTT-GTG-GTT-TGT-3′ (antisense strand, corresponding to an SV40 poly(A) additional site). After 10T1/2 fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts were stored in growth medium at 37 °C, the cells were transfected with 5 μg each of pcDEBSRα-MyoD, pcDEBSRα-Id, and pcDEBSRα-hMGMT using the polycationic liposome method (DMRIE-C®, Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, cells were cultured in growth medium containing 200–300 μg/ml hygromycin B. Hygromycin-resistant clones were isolated and amplified in growth medium. We cloned muscle and nonmuscle types of mouse F1γ cDNA and part of the genomic gene as described under “Materials and Methods.” Two isoforms were produced by alternative splicing of a cassette exon corresponding to exon 9 of the human F1γ gene (Fig.1). In mouse C2C12 myoblasts, we induced muscle-specific alternative splicing in F1γ pre-mRNA during myogenesis using differentiation medium (Fig.2 a, lane 1). This splicing was detected 48 h after induction (Fig. 2 a,lane 1). At this time, the myotube had not yet formed (Fig.2 b, lane 1). Acidic stimulation also induced the muscle type of F1γ in the myoblasts (Fig. 2 c,lane 1), but myotubes did not form for more than 3 days. In addition, acidic induction of muscle-specific alternative splicing in F1γ pre-mRNA appeared to be reversible in mouse myoblasts (see below), as in human cells (36Endo H. Matsuda C. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12488-12493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Patterns of F1γ transcripts analyzed by RT-PCR. C2C12 myoblasts were prepared and grown in growth medium. After the cells were grown to semiconfluence, the medium was changed to differentiation medium and acidic medium containing the indicated amounts of TGF-β1 (lanes 2–6) and cultured for the indicated number of days. Total RNAs were subjected to RT-PCR for analyzing patterns of F1γ transcripts. The PCR products were separated by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis and then stained with ethidium bromide. a, pattern of F1γ transcripts in differentiation medium; b, myotube formation in differentiation medium; c, pattern of F1γ transcripts in acidic medium.
