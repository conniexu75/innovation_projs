https://openalex.org/W2986362275,"The engineered AAV-PHP.B family of adeno-associated virus efficiently delivers genes throughout the mouse central nervous system. To guide their application across disease models, and to inspire the development of translational gene therapy vectors for targeting neurological diseases in humans, we sought to elucidate the host factors responsible for the CNS tropism of the AAV-PHP.B vectors. Leveraging CNS tropism differences across 13 mouse strains, we systematically determined a set of genetic variants that segregate with the permissivity phenotype, and rapidly identified LY6A as an essential receptor for the AAV-PHP.B vectors. Interfering with LY6A by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Ly6a disruption or with blocking antibodies reduced transduction of mouse brain endothelial cells by AAV-PHP.eB, while ectopic expression of Ly6a increased AAV-PHP.eB transduction of HEK293T and CHO cells by 30-fold or more. Importantly, we demonstrate that this newly discovered mode of AAV binding and transduction can occur independently of other known AAV receptors. These findings illuminate the previously reported species- and strain-specific tropism characteristics of the AAV-PHP.B vectors and inform ongoing efforts to develop next-generation AAV vehicles for human CNS gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2986602744,"Objective Gait movies recorded in daily clinical practice are usually not filmed with specific devices, which prevents neurologists benefitting from leveraging gait analysis technologies. Here we propose a novel unsupervised approach to quantifying gait features and to extract cadence from normal and parkinsonian gait movies recorded with a home video camera by applying OpenPose, a deep learning–based 2D-pose estimator that can obtain joint coordinates from pictures or videos recorded with a monocular camera. Methods Our proposed method consisted of two distinct phases: obtaining sequential gait features from movies by extracting body joint coordinates with OpenPose; and estimating cadence of periodic gait steps from the sequential gait features using the short-time pitch detection approach. Results The cadence estimation of gait in its coronal plane (frontally viewed gait) as is frequently filmed in the daily clinical setting was successfully conducted in normal gait movies using the short-time autocorrelation function (ST-ACF). In cases of parkinsonian gait with prominent freezing of gait and involuntary oscillations, using ACF-based statistical distance metrics, we quantified the periodicity of each gait sequence; this metric clearly corresponded with the subjects’ baseline disease statuses. Conclusion The proposed method allows us to analyze gait movies that have been underutilized to date in a completely data-driven manner, and might broaden the range of movies for which gait analyses can be conducted."
https://openalex.org/W2983553581,"Infections of the cow udder leading to mastitis and reducing milk quality are a critical challenge facing all dairy farmers. Mastitis may be linked to the ecological disruption of an endogenous mammary microbial community, suggesting an ecosystems approach to management and prevention of this disease. The teat end skin represents a first point of host contact with mastitis pathogens and may offer an opportunity for microbially mediated resistance to infection, yet we know little about the microbial community of teat end skin or its potential interaction with the microbial community of intramammary milk of organic dairy cattle. High-throughput sequencing of marker genes for bacterial and fungal communities was used to characterize the skin and milk microbiome of cows with both a healthy and infected gland (i.e., udder quarter) and to assess the sharing of microbial DNA between these tissue habitat sites. The mammary microbiome varied among cows, through time, and between skin and milk. Microbiomes of milk from healthy and infected quarters reflected a diverse group of microbial DNA sequences, though milk had far fewer operational taxonomic units (OTUs) than skin. Milk microbiomes of infected quarters were generally more variable than healthy quarters and were frequently dominated by a single OTU; teat end skin microbiomes were relatively similar between healthy and infected quarters. Commonly occurring genera that were shared between skin and milk of infected glands included Staphylococcus spp. bacteria and Debaryomyces spp. fungi. Commonly occurring genera that were shared between skin and milk of healthy glands included bacteria SMB53 (Clostridiaceae) and Penicillium spp. fungi. Results support an ecological interpretation of the mammary gland and the notion that mastitis can be described as a dysbiosis, an imbalance of the healthy mammary gland microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2987556570,"Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) is a leading indication for antibiotic use in the hospital setting, with demonstrated high rates of inappropriateness. Decision-making for SAP is complex and multifactorial. A greater understanding of these factors is needed to inform the design of targeted antimicrobial stewardship interventions and strategies to support the optimization of SAP and its impacts on patient care.A qualitative case study exploring the phenomenon of SAP decision-making. Focus groups were conducted with surgeons, anaesthetists, theatre nurses and pharmacists across one private and two public hospitals in Australia. Thematic analysis was guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Capabilities, Opportunities, Motivators-Behaviour (COM-B) model.Fourteen focus groups and one paired interview were completed. Ten of the fourteen TDF domains were identified as relevant. Thematic analysis revealed six significant themes mapped to the COM-B model, and subthemes mapped to the relevant TDF domains in a combined framework. Key themes identified were: 1) Low priority for surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis prescribing skills; 2) Prescriber autonomy takes precedence over guideline compliance; 3) Social codes of prescribing reinforce established practices; 4) Need for improved communication, documentation and collection of data for action; 5) Fears and perceptions of risk hinder appropriate SAP prescribing; and 6) Lack of clarity regarding roles and accountability.SAP prescribing is a complex process that involves multiple professions across the pre-, intra- and post-operative surgical settings. The utilisation of behaviour change frameworks to identify barriers and enablers to optimal SAP prescribing supports future development of theory-informed antimicrobial stewardship interventions. Interventions should aim to increase surgeon engagement, enhance the prioritisation of and accountability for SAP, and address the underlying social factors involved in SAP decision-making, such as professional hierarchy and varied perceptions or risks and fears."
https://openalex.org/W2984726926,"As the number of known proteins has expanded, how to accurately identify DNA binding proteins has become a significant biological challenge. At present, various computational methods have been proposed to recognize DNA-binding proteins from only amino acid sequences, such as SVM, DNABP and CNN-RNN. However, these methods do not consider the context in amino acid sequences, which makes it difficult for them to adequately capture sequence features. In this study, a new method that coordinates a bidirectional long-term memory recurrent neural network and a convolutional neural network, called CNN-BiLSTM, is proposed to identify DNA binding proteins. The CNN-BiLSTM model can explore the potential contextual relationships of amino acid sequences and obtain more features than can traditional models. The experimental results show that the CNN-BiLSTM achieves a validation set prediction accuracy of 96.5%—7.8% higher than that of SVM, 9.6% higher than that of DNABP and 3.7% higher than that of CNN-RNN. After testing on 20,000 independent samples provided by UniProt that were not involved in model training, the accuracy of CNN-BiLSTM reached 94.5%—12% higher than that of SVM, 4.9% higher than that of DNABP and 4% higher than that of CNN-RNN. We visualized and compared the model training process of CNN-BiLSTM with that of CNN-RNN and found that the former is capable of better generalization from the training dataset, showing that CNN-BiLSTM has a wider range of adaptations to protein sequences. On the test set, CNN-BiLSTM has better credibility because its predicted scores are closer to the sample labels than are those of CNN-RNN. Therefore, the proposed CNN-BiLSTM is a more powerful method for identifying DNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2988259721,"Background Muscle wasting in the critically ill is up to 2% per day and delays patient recovery and rehabilitation. It is linked to inflammation, organ failure and severity of illness. The aims of this study were to understand the relationship between muscle depth loss, and nutritional and inflammatory markers during prolonged critical illness. Secondly, to identify when during critical illness catabolism might decrease, such that targeted nutritional strategies may logically be initiated. Methods This study was conducted in adult intensive care units in two large teaching hospitals. Patients anticipated to be ventilated for >48 hours were included. Serum C-reactive protein (mg/L), urinary urea (mmol/24h), 3-methylhistidine (μmol/24h) and nitrogen balance (g/24h) were measured on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 of the study. Muscle depth (cm) on ultrasound were measured on the same days over the bicep (bicep and brachialis muscle), forearm (flexor compartment of muscle) and thigh (rectus femoris and vastus intermedius). Results Seventy-eight critically ill patients were included with mean age of 59 years (SD: 16) and median Intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay of 10 days (IQR: 6–16). Starting muscle depth, 8.5cm (SD: 3.2) to end muscle depth, 6.8cm (SD: 2.2) were on average significantly different over 14 days, with mean difference -1.67cm (95%CI: -2.3 to -1cm), p<0.0001. Protein breakdown and inflammation continued over 14 days of the study. Conclusion Our patients demonstrated a continuous muscle depth loss and negative nitrogen balance over the 14 days of the study. Catabolism remained dominant throughout the study period. No obvious ‘nutritional tipping point” to identify anabolism or recovery could be identified in our cohort. Our ICU patient cohort is one with a moderately prolonged stay. This group showed little consistency in data, reflecting the individuality of both disease and response. The data are consistent with a conclusion that a time based assumption of a tipping point does not exist. Trial registration International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN79066838.

https://openalex.org/W2968831583,"We report the phenomenon of frequency clustering in a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with spike timing-dependent plasticity. The clustering leads to a splitting of a neural population into a few groups synchronized at different frequencies. In this regime, the amplitude of the mean field undergoes low-frequency modulations, which may contribute to the mechanism of the emergence of slow oscillations of neural activity observed in spectral power of local field potentials or electroencephalographic signals at high frequencies. In addition to numerical simulations of such multi-clusters, we investigate the mechanisms of the observed phenomena using the simplest case of two clusters. In particular, we propose a phenomenological model which describes the dynamics of two clusters taking into account the adaptation of coupling weights. We also determine the set of plasticity functions (update rules), which lead to multi-clustering."
https://openalex.org/W2987881855,"Genomic selection (GS) has been used to optimize genetic gains when phenotypic selection is considered costly and difficult to measure. The objective of this work was to evaluate the efficiency and consistency of GS prediction for cassava yield traits (Manihot esculenta Crantz) using different methods, taking into account the effect of population structure. BLUPs and deregressed BLUPs were obtained for 888 cassava accessions and evaluated for fresh root yield, dry root yield and dry matter content in roots in 21 trials conducted from 2011 to 2016. The deregressed BLUPs obtained for the accessions from a 48K single nucleotide polymorphism dataset were used for genomic predictions based on the BayesB, BLASSO, RR-BLUP, G-BLUP and RKHS methods. The accessions’ BLUPs were used in the validation step using four cross-validation strategies, taking into account population structure and different GS methods. Similar estimates of predictive ability and bias were identified for the different genomic selection methods in the first cross-validation strategy. Lower predictive ability was observed for fresh root yield (0.4569 –RR-BLUP to 0.4756—RKHS) and dry root yield (0.4689 –G-BLUP to 0.4818—RKHS) in comparison with dry matter content (0.5655 –BLASSO to 0.5670 –RKHS). However, the RKHS method exhibited higher efficiency and consistency in most of the validation scenarios in terms of prediction ability for fresh root yield and dry root yield. The correlations of the genomic estimated breeding values between the genomic selection methods were quite high (0.99–1.00), resulting in high coincidence of clone selection regardless of the genomic selection method. The deviance analyses within and between the validation clusters formed by the discriminant analysis of principal components were significant for all traits. Therefore, this study indicated that i) the prediction of dry matter content was more accurate compared to that of yield traits, possibly as a result of the smaller influence of non-additive genetic effects; ii) the RKHS method resulted in high and stable prediction ability in most of the validation scenarios; and iii) some kinship between the validation and training populations is desirable in order for genomic selection to succeed due to the significant effect of population structure on genomic selection predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2986543561,"Handheld chlorophyll meters as Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) have proven to be useful tools for rapid, no-destructive assessment of chlorophyll and nitrogen status in various crops. This method is used to diagnose the need of nitrogen fertilization to improve the efficiency of the agricultural system and to minimize nitrogen losses and deficiency. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of repeated conservative agriculture practices on the SPAD readings, leaves chlorophyll concentration and Nitrogen Nutrition Index (NNI) relationships in durum wheat under Mediterranean conditions. The experimental site is a part of a long-term-experiment established in 1994 and is still on-going where three tillage managements and three nitrogen fertilizer treatments were repeated in the same plots every year. We observed a linear relationship between the SPAD readings performed in the central and distal portion of the leaf (R2 = 0.96). In fertilized durum wheat, we found all positive exponential relationships between SPAD readings, chlorophyll leaves concentration (R2 = 0.85) and NNI (R2 = 0.89). In the unfertilized treatment, the SPAD has a good attitude to estimate leaves chlorophyll concentration (R2 = 0.74) and NNI (R2 = 0.77) only in crop grow a soil with relative high content of soil organic matter and nitrogen availability, as observed in the no tilled plots. The results show that the SPAD can be used for a correct assessment of chlorophyll and nitrogen status in durum wheat but also to evaluate indirectly the content of soil organic matter and nitrogen availability during different growth stages of the crop cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2985116520,"Influenza A virus (IAV) is a highly contagious pathogen in pigs. Swine IAV (swIAV) infection causes respiratory disease and is thereby a challenge for animal health, animal welfare and the production economy. In Europe, the most widespread strategy for controlling swIAV is implementation of sow vaccination programs, to secure delivery of protective maternally derived antibodies (MDAs) to the newborn piglets. In this study we report a unique case, where a persistently swIAV (A/sw/Denmark/P5U4/2016(H1N1)) infected herd experienced an acute outbreak with a new swIAV subtype (A/sw/Denmark/HB4280U1/2017(H1N2)) and subsequently decided to implement a mass sow vaccination program. Clinical registrations, nasal swabs and blood samples were collected from four different batches of pigs before and after vaccination. Virus isolation, sequencing of the virus strain and hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) tests were performed on samples collected before and during the outbreak and after implementation of mass sow vaccination. After implementation of the sow mass vaccination, the time of infection was delayed and the viral load significantly decreased. An increased number of pigs, however, tested positive at two consecutive sampling times indicating prolonged shedding. In addition, a significantly smaller proportion of the 10-12 weeks old pigs were seropositive by the end of the study, indicating an impaired induction of antibodies against swIAV in the presence of MDAs. Sequencing of the herd strains revealed major differences in the hemagglutinin gene of the strain isolated before- and during the acute outbreak despite that, the two strains belonged to the same HA lineage. The HI tests confirmed a limited degree of cross-reaction between the two strains. Furthermore, the sequencing results of the hemagglutinin gene obtained before and after implementation of mass sow vaccination revealed an increased substitution rate and an increase in positively selected sites in the globular head of the hemagglutinin after vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2989058351,"The scale effect is an important research topic in the field of geography. When aggregating individual-level data into areal units, encountering the scale problem is inevitable. This problem is more substantial when mining collective patterns from big geo-data due to the characteristics of extensive spatial data. Although multi-scale models were constructed to mitigate this issue, most studies still arbitrarily choose a single scale to extract spatial patterns. In this research, we introduce the nugget-sill ratio (NSR) derived from semi-variograms as an indicator to extract the optimal scale. We conducted two simulated experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of this method. Our results showed that the optimal scale is negatively correlated with spatial point density, but positively correlated with the degree of dispersion in a point pattern. We also applied the proposed method to a case study using Weibo check-in data from Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Wuhan. Our study provides a new perspective to measure the spatial heterogeneity of big geo-data and selects an optimal spatial scale for big data analytics."
https://openalex.org/W2988473859,"Introduction Epidemiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) is highly dependent on patient characteristics, context and geography. Considering the limited information in Latin America and the Caribbean, we performed a study with the aim to contribute to improve its better understanding. Methods Observational, prospective, longitudinal, multinational cohort study addressed to determine risk factors, clinical profile, process of care and outcomes of AKI in the region. Patients meeting KDIGO AKI definition were included over a 9-month period and designated community or hospital-acquired. De-identified clinical and lab data were entered in a specifically designed on-line platform. Co-variables potentially linked to AKI onset, in-hospital and 90-days mortality, were recorded and correlated using a multiple logistic regression model. Results Fifty-seven physicians from 15 countries provided data on 905 patients, most with acceptable basic needs coverage. Median age 64 (50–74) yrs; most of them were male (61%) and mestizos (42%). Comorbidities were present in 77%. AKI was community-acquired in 62%. Dehydration, shock and nephrotoxic drugs were the commonest causes. During their process of care, 77% of patients were assessed by nephrologists. Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) was performed in 29% of cases. In-hospital mortality was 26.5% and independently associated to older age, chronic liver disease, hypotension, shock, cardiac disturbances, hospital-acquired sepsis, KRT and mechanical ventilation. At 90-days follow up partial or complete renal recovery was 81% and mortality 24%. Conclusions AKI was mainly community-acquired, in patients with comorbidities and linked to fluid loss and nephrotoxic drugs. Mortality was high and long-term follow up poor. Notwithstanding, the study shows partially the situation in the participant countries rather than the actual epidemiology of AKI in Latin America and Caribbean, a pending and needed task."

Sedentary behavior is a growing public health concern in young adolescents from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, a paucity of multinational studies, particularly in LMICs, have investigated correlates of leisure-time sedentary behavior (LTSB) in young adolescents. In the current study, we assessed socio-demographic, socio-economic, socio-cultural and health behavior related correlates of LTSB among adolescents aged 12–15 years who participated in the Global school-based Student Health Survey (GSHS).


Methods 
Self-reported LTSB, which was a composite variable assessing time spent sitting and watching television, playing computer games, talking with friends during a typical day excluding the hours spent sitting at school and doing homework, was analyzed in 181,793 adolescents from 66 LMICs [mean (SD) age 13.8 (1.0) years; 49% girls). Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the potential LTSB correlates.


Results 
The overall prevalence of ≥3 hours/day of LTSB was 26.4% (95%CI = 25.6%-27.2%). Increasing age (OR = 1.14; 95%CI = 1.11–1.17), past 30-day smoking (OR = 1.85; 95%CI = 1.69–2.03), alcohol consumption (OR = 2.01; 95%CI = 1.85–2.18), and bullying victimization (OR = 1.39; 95%CI = 1.31–1.48) were positively associated with increased LTSB across the entire sample of 181,793 adolescents. Food insecurity (OR = 0.93; 95%CI = 0.89–0.97) and low parental support/monitoring (OR = 0.91; 95%CI = 0.85–0.98) were negatively associated with LTSB. There were some variations in the correlates between countries.


Conclusions 
Our data indicate that in adolescents aged 12 to 15 years living in LMICs, LTSB is a complex and multi-dimensional behavior determined by socio-demograhic, sociocultural, socio-economic, and health behavior related factors. Future longitudinal data are required to confirm/refute these findings, and to inform interventions which aim to reduce sedentary levels in adolescents living in LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W2989234055,"Flu vaccination, as well as being effective to prevent seasonal influenza, decreases staff illness and absenteeism and reduces costs resulting from loss of productivity. Despite the effectiveness of flu vaccination, the seasonal coverage among healthcare workers is usually low. The aim of this retrospective observational study was to analyze the vaccination coverage rate among all employees (healthcare workers and administrative staff) of a large teaching hospital in Rome during the 2017–2018 influenza season, to perform a cost-consequence analysis of influenza vaccination (by evaluating the absenteeism due to illness in the epidemic period), and to assess the impact of vaccination in terms of both costs and sick days. The flu vaccination coverage rate was 9.8% among 4631 healthcare workers and 852 administrative employees. The human capital approach estimated a loss of productivity equal to 297.06 € for each vaccinated worker and 517.22 € for each unvaccinated worker (cost-outcome ratio: 120.07 €/sick day). Applying the friction cost method, a loss of productivity equal to 237.65 € for each vaccinated worker and 413.78 € for each unvaccinated worker (cost-outcome ratio: 104.19 €/sick day) was found. These results confirm the benefits of the flu vaccination for the society and the company. This allowed the management to grant one hour of permission to the flu-vaccinated workers in the following annual vaccination campaign (2018–2019)."
https://openalex.org/W2983934838,"DNA metabarcoding assays are powerful tools for delving into the DNA in wildlife feces, giving unprecedented ability to detect species, understand natural history, and identify pathogens for a range of applications in management, conservation, and research. Next-generation sequencing technology is developing rapidly, which makes it especially important that predictability and reproducibility of DNA metabarcoding assays are explored together with the post-depositional ecology of the target taxon’s fecal DNA. Here, we defined the constraints of an assay called ‘Species from Feces’ used by government agencies, research groups, and non-governmental organizations to identify bat species from guano. We tested assay sensitivity by examining how time and humidity affect the ability to recover and successfully sequence DNA in guano, assessing whether a fecal pellet from a rare bat species could be detected in a background of feces from other bat species, and evaluating the efficacy of Species from Feces as a survey tool for bat roosts in temperate and tropical areas. We found that the assay performs well with feces over two years old in dry, cool environments, and fails by 12 months at 100% relative humidity. We also found that it reliably identifies rare DNA, has great utility for surveying roosts in temperate and tropical regions, and detects more bat species than do visual surveys. We attribute the success of Species from Feces to characteristics of the assay paired with application in taxa that are particularly well-suited for fecal DNA survival. In a time of rapid evolution of DNA metabarcoding approaches and their use with feces, this study illustrates the strengths and limitations of applied assays."
https://openalex.org/W2988003692,"Green roofs help ameliorate some of the adverse social, economic and environmental effects of urbanisation. However, green roofs are harsh environments for plants, as they must cope with shallow soils, low nutrient availability, high solar radiation, low water availability and high pollution/disturbances. The effect of shade plants on vegetation survivability was investigated using green roof mesocosms with four different native species pairs (shade plant and a target ground cover plant). To examine the effect of shading and competition on plant growth and survival, plant pairs were subjected to four treatments; naturally shaded with a shade plant shading the target plant, artificially shaded with an artificial plant shading the target plant, unshaded natural which had a trimmed shade plant providing no shade to the target plant and an unshaded treatment with the target plant being the sole occupant of the mesocosm. The experiment ran for 11 months with measurements taken monthly to record growth and visual health of the target plant. Soil moisture and biomass data was collected at the end of the experiment. Overall, natural shade treated plants had the highest biomass while unshaded plants had the lowest biomass. Contrary to our predictions, the shaded artificial and the unshaded natural had similar moderate biomass. This similarity suggests that while shading had a positive influence on plant growth, there was also a positive influence of growing with a shade plant which is not accounted for by shading. The results highlight the complexity of biotic relations between plants and emphasises that the presence of a nurse plants can be benefit to the survival and growth of other species within a green roof ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2983814113,"Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are one of the most common drug-related problems. Recently, electronic databases have drug interaction tools to search for potential DDIs, for example, Micromedex and Drugs.com. However, Micromedex and Drugs.com have different abilities in detecting potential DDIs, and this might cause misinformation to occur between patients and health care providers.The aim of this study was to compare the ability of Micromedex and Drugs.com to detect potential DDIs with metabolic syndrome medications using the drug list from the U-central database, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital in April 2019. There were 90 available drugs for the treatment of the metabolic syndrome and its associated complications, but six were not found in the Micromedex and Drugs.com databases; therefore, only 84 items were used in the present study. There were 1,285 potential DDI pairs found by the two databases. Micromedex reported DDIs of 724 pairs, while, Drugs.com reported 1,122 pairs. For the severity of the potential DDI reports, the same severity occurred between the two databases of 481 pairs (37.43%) and a different severity for 804 pairs (62.57%).Drugs.com had a higher sensitivity to detect potential DDIs by approximately 1.5-fold, but Micromedex supplied more informative documentation for the severity classification. Therefore, pharmacists should use at least two databases to evaluate potential DDIs and determine the appropriate drug regimens for physician communications and patient consultations."
https://openalex.org/W2986135686,"The placenta is a dynamic organ which undergoes extensive remodeling throughout pregnancy to support, protect and nourish the developing fetus. Despite the importance of the placenta, very little is known about its gene expression beyond very early pregnancy and post-partum. Therefore, we utilized RNA-sequencing to characterize the transcriptome from the fetal (chorioallantois) and maternal (endometrium) components of the placenta from mares throughout gestation (4, 6, 10, 11 m). Within the endometrium, 47% of genes changed throughout pregnancy, while in the chorioallantois, 29% of genes underwent significant changes in expression. Further bioinformatic analyses of both differentially expressed genes and highly expressed genes help reveal similarities and differences between tissues. Overall, the tissues were more similar than different, with ~ 95% of genes expressed in both tissues, and high similarities between the most highly expressed genes (9/20 conserved), as well as marked similarities between the PANTHER pathways identified. The most highly expressed genes fell under a few broad categories, including endocrine and immune-related transcripts, iron-binding proteins, extracellular matrix proteins, transport proteins and antioxidants. Serine protease inhibitors were particularly abundant, including SERPINA3, 6 and 14, as well as SPINK7 and 9. This paper also demonstrates the ability to effectively separate maternal and fetal components of the placenta, with only a minimal amount of chorioallantoic contamination in the endometrium (~8%). This aspect of equine placentation is a boon for better understanding gestational physiology and allows the horse to be used in areas where a separation of fetal and maternal tissues is essential. Overall, these data represent the first large-scale characterization of placental gene expression in any species and include time points from multiple mid- to late-gestational stages, helping further our understanding of gestational physiology."

Methods This study took the mucosal microecology as the entry point and an antibiotic mixture was used to induce diarrhea in mice. D. hansenii suspension was used to treat the mice and the bacterial communities of mucosa was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing. Results The Shannon-Wiener index indicated that the sequencing depth is reasonable and reflected the majority of microbial information. The principal coordinate analysis results showed that mice in the treatment group and the normal group had a similar microbial community structure, while differences in microbial community structure were observed between the model group and the treatment group. The inter-group bacterial structures were analyzed at the phylum level and genus level. The results revealed that antibiotic treatment increased the proportion of Proteobacteria and decreased the proportion of Bacteroides, while D. hansenii treatment inhibited the increase in Proteobacteria. Linear discriminant analysis coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe) suggested d that the beneficial bacteria Candidatus Arthromitus were the only common bacteria in the normal group (P<0.05). Conclusion The treatment with D.hansenii could contribute to the maintenance of the structure of the mucosal microbiota in comparison with the normal group and inhibit the proliferation of opportunistic bacteria. However, high-dose antibiotic treatment causes mucosal dysbiosis and the proliferation of opportunistic bacteria during the self-recovery period, such as Pseudoalteromonas, Alteromonas, Vibrio."

Retention on ART was lower in the first year on ART compared to subsequent years for all guideline periods and age groups. Infants (0-3 years), adolescents and young adults (15-24 years) were at highest risk of LTFU. Comparing the different calendar periods of ART initiation we found that retention improved initially, but remained stable thereafter.Even though the number of patients and the burden on health care system increased substantially during the study period of rapid ART expansion, retention on ART improved in the early years of ART provision, but gains in retention were not maintained over 5 years on ART. Reducing high attrition in the first year of ART should remain a priority for ART programs, and so should addressing poor retention among adolescents, young adults and men."
https://openalex.org/W2987431393,"Emotional intimate partner violence (IPV) is extremely common and has significant health and social consequences, yet typically receives much less attention in research and programming than physical and sexual IPV. This limits our understanding of how women experience and understand emotional IPV in different settings, which is required to inform effective prevention and response. This paper draws on qualitative data collected in mixed-methods impact evaluations of two IPV prevention programmes conducted as part of the What Works to Prevent Violence Against Women and Girls Global Programme. In doing so, we seek to develop a more nuanced understanding of the forms, causes and consequences of emotional IPV in heterosexual relationships in two distinct African settings. We draw on two rounds of in-depth interviews conducted with 15 women in South Africa and three rounds of interviews conducted with 57 women and men in Rwanda, all of whom were participants in the programmes, around their experiences of and conceptualizations of emotional IPV. Thematic analysis around emotional IPV was conducted and compared across both data sets, informed by a cross comparative analysis approach. The analysis found that the categories or types of acts perceived as emotional IPV by women experienced were similar across settings. Women in both contexts described public humiliation, control of mobility, access to housing and silencing as important categories of actions experienced emotional IPV. These types of emotional IPV were underpinned by similar patterns of gender inequalities, with the intention for men to assert control and power over women. The specific acts through which these categories of emotional IPV manifested in the two settings arose from contextual differences related to the social structure of relationships and dominant social norms. This analysis highlights commonalities in the underlying categorial understanding of IPV in two distinct African settings, and well as the differences in specific manifestations which stem from the social context of relationships. In doing so, we highlight both broad categorical areas of IPV that may be important to address in future research and prevention programming, as well as affirming the need for information on context-specific manifestations of emotional IPV to inform local intervention programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2988583371,"Restless legs syndrome is a common complex disorder with different genetic and environmental risk factors. Here we used human cell lines to conduct an RNA-Seq study and observed how the gene showing the most significant association with RLS, MEIS1, acts as a regulator of the expression of many other genes. Some of the genes affected by its expression level are linked to pathways previously reported to be associated with RLS. We found that in cells where MEIS1 expression was either increased or prevented, mineral absorption is the principal dysregulated pathway. The mineral absorption pathway genes, HMOX1 and VDR are involved in iron metabolism and response to vitamin D, respectively. This shows a strong functional link to the known RLS pathways. We observed the same enrichment of the mineral absorption pathway in postmortem brain tissues of RLS patients showing a reduced expression of MEIS1. The expression of genes encoding metallothioneins (MTs) was observed to be dysregulated across the RNA-Seq datasets generated from both human cells and tissues. MTs are highly relevant to RLS as they bind intracellular metals, protect against oxidative stress and interact with ferritins which manage iron level in the central nervous system. Overall, our study suggests that in a subset of RLS patients, the contribution of MEIS1 appears to be associated to its downstream regulation of genes that are more directly involved in pathways that are relevant to RLS. While MTs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s diseases, this is a first report to propose that they have a role in RLS."
https://openalex.org/W2988952349,"Aims Cardiovascular manifestations are a major cause of mortality in Marfan syndrome (MFS). Animal models that mimic the syndrome and its clinical variability are instrumental for understanding the genesis and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in MFS. This study used morphological and ultrastructural analysis to the understanding of the development of cardiovascular phenotypes of the the mgΔloxPneo model for MFS. Methods and results We studied 6-month-old female mice of the 129/Sv background, 6 wild type (WT) and 24 heterozygous animals from the mgΔloxPneo model. Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm and/or dissection (dTAAD) were identified in 75% of the MFS animals, defining two subgroups: MFS with (MFS+) and without (MFS-) dTAAD. Both subgroups showed increased fragmentation of elastic fibers, predominance of type I collagen surrounding the elastic fiber and fragmentation of interlaminar fibers when compared to WT. However, only MFS animals with spine tortuosity developed aortic aneurysm/dissection. The aorta of MFS+ animals were more tortuous compared to those of MFS- and WT mice, possibly causing perturbations of the luminal blood flow. This was evidenced by the detection of diminished aorta-blood flow in MFS+. Accordingly, only MFS+ animals presented a process of concentric cardiac hypertrophy and a significantly decreased ratio of left and right ventricle lumen area. Conclusions We show that mgΔloxPneo model mimics the vascular disease observed in MFS patients. Furthermore, the study indicates role of thoracic spine deformity in the development of aorta diseases. We suggest that degradation of support structures of the aortic wall; deficiency in the sustenance of the thoracic vertebrae; and their compression over the adjacent aorta resulting in disturbed blood flow is a triad of factors involved in the genesis of dissection/aneurysm of thoracic aorta."
https://openalex.org/W2983428891,"Values, beliefs, and traits differ across individuals, and these concepts might impact whether individuals choose to engage in (dis)honest behavior. This project focuses on interindividual differences in Machiavellianism, which is defined as a tendency toward cynicism and manipulativeness, and the belief that the ends justify the means. We hypothesized that trait Machiavellianism would predict dishonest behavior. Furthermore, we speculated that some situations are more conducive than others for Machiavellianism to translate into behavior. In particular, Construal Level Theory holds that individuals construe social situations on a concrete level, or an abstract level, and that an abstract construal level triggers values and value-related traits to be more influential on behavior. Against this background, we hypothesized that differences in Machiavellianism produce differences in dishonest monetary behavior when situations are construed abstractly. Four studies tested these considerations by asking participants to toss a coin and self-report the toss' outcome. Inconsistent with our theorizing, we did not find that higher Machiavellianism is consistently associated with a higher self-reported probability of receiving an individual bonus. We also did not find consistent support that higher Machiavellianism is associated with cheating under abstract compared to concrete construal."

The measures are based on graph polynomials utilizing the out- and in-degrees of directed graphs. Based on these polynomial, we define another polynomial and use their positive zeros as graph measures. The measures have meaningful properties that we investigate based on analytical and numerical results. As the computational complexity to compute the measures is polynomial, our approach is efficient and can be applied to large networks. We emphasize that our approach clearly complements the literature in this field as, to the best of our knowledge, existing complexity measures for directed graphs have never been applied on a large scale."
https://openalex.org/W2986117885,"Calreticulin (CRT) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) are crucial for angiogenesis, and mediate multiple malignant behaviors in gastric cancer. In this study, we report that CRT is positively correlated with VEGF-A in gastric cancer patients. Moreover, high expressions of both CRT and VEGF-A are markedly associated with the pathological stage, progression, and poor prognosis in the patients. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the mechanism by which CRT affects VEGF-A in gastric cancer. Firstly, we demonstrate the novel finding that knockdown of CRT reduced VEGF-A mRNA stability in two gastric cancer cell lines, AGS and MKN45. The AU-Rich element (ARE) is believed to play a crucial role in the maintenance of VEGF-A mRNA stability. Luciferase reporter assay shows that knockdown of CRT significantly decreased the activity of renilla luciferase with VEGF-A ARE sequence. Additionally, competition results from RNA-binding/electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicate that CRT forms an RNA-protein complex with the VEGF-A mRNA by binding to the ARE. In addition, the proliferation rate of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was significantly reduced when treated with conditioned medium from CRT knockdown cells; this was rescued by exogenous VEGF-A recombinant protein. Our results demonstrate that CRT is involved in VEGF-A ARE binding protein complexes to stabilize VEGF-A mRNA, thereby promoting the angiogenesis, and progression of gastric cancer."

All women who underwent induced abortion between 2000 and 2009 in Finland were identified through the Register of Induced Abortions (n = 88 522). The study group consisted of women who underwent induced abortion and subsequently had an IVF treatment (n = 379); the comparison group were all women who had a spontaneous pregnancy and delivery 12-24 months after the index abortion (n = 7434). Demographic characteristics at the time of index abortion, and factors associated with the abortion (gestational age at abortion, indication and method of abortion, complications after abortion) were compared between the study groups. Logistic regression was used to assess whether some of the demographic characteristics or abortion associated factors increased the use of IVF treatment in the future.The proportion of women with IVF treatment after induced abortion in the whole cohort was 0.4%. Women needing IVF treatment were older, of a higher socioeconomic status, and had fewer previous induced abortions and deliveries compared to women in the comparison group. No statistically significant differences were observed in the gestational age (≤ 12 weeks or >12 weeks of gestation) at abortion, method or complications of abortion. In multivariable analysis higher age increased, and history of previous deliveries or one or two abortions decreased the use of IVF.Infertility necessitating the use of IVF treatment after induced abortion is uncommon. The factors associated with use of IVF after abortion are those generally recognized as risk factors of infertility. Abortion-related outcomes are not associated with an increased need of future IVF-treatment."

Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) zoospores attach to and invade the amphibian epidermis, with subsequent invasive growth in the host skin. Availability of an in vitro assay would facilitate in depth study of this interaction while reducing the number of experimental animals needed. We describe a fluorescent cell-based in vitro infection model that reproduces host-Bd interactions. Using primary keratinocytes from Litoria caerulea and the epithelial cell line A6 from Xenopus laevis, we reproduced different stages of host cell infection and intracellular growth of Bd, resulting in host cell death, a key event in chytridiomycosis.

https://openalex.org/W2984152791,"Emotional competence (EC) reflects individual differences in the identification, comprehension, expression, regulation, and utilization of one’s own and others’ emotions. EC can be operationalized using the Profile of Emotional Competence (PEC). This scale measures each of the five core emotional competences (identification, comprehension, expression, regulation, and utilization), separately for one’s own and others’ emotions. However, the higher-order structure of the PEC has not yet been systematically examined. This study aimed to fill this gap using four different samples (French-speaking Belgian, Dutch-speaking Belgian, Spanish, and Japanese). Confirmatory factor analyses and Bayesian structural equation modeling revealed that a structure with two second-order factors (intrapersonal and interpersonal EC) and with residual correlations among the types of competence (identification, comprehension, expression, regulation, and utilization) fitted the data better than alternative models. The findings emphasize the importance of distinguishing between intrapersonal and interpersonal domains in EC, offer a better framework for differentiating among individuals with different EC profiles, and provide exciting perspectives for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2984226888,"The relationship between deforestation and malaria in Amazonian Brazil is complex, and a deeper understanding of this relationship is required to inform effective control measures in this region. Here, we are particularly interested in characterizing the impact of land use and land cover change on the genetics of the major regional vector of malaria, Nyssorhynchus darlingi (Root). We used nextera-tagmented, Reductively Amplified DNA (nextRAD) genotyping-by-sequencing to genotype 164 Ny. darlingi collected from 16 collection sites with divergent forest cover levels in seven municipalities in four municipality groups that span the state of Amazonas in northwestern Amazonian Brazil: São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Presidente Figueiredo, four municipalities in the area around Cruzeiro do Sul, and Lábrea. Using a dataset of 5,561 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), we investigated the genetic structure of these Ny. darlingi populations with a combination of model- and non-model-based analyses. We identified weak to moderate genetic differentiation among the four municipality groups. There was no evidence for microgeographic genetic structure of Ny. darlingi among forest cover levels within the municipality groups, indicating that there may be gene flow across areas of these municipalities with different degrees of deforestation. Additionally, we conducted an environmental association analysis using two outlier detection methods to determine whether individual SNPs were associated with forest cover level without affecting overall population genetic structure. We identified 14 outlier SNPs, and investigated functions associated with their proximal genes, which could be further characterized in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2987980037,"The response to environmental stresses by eukaryotic organisms includes activation of protective biological mechanisms, orchestrated in part by transcriptional regulators. The tri-member Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) family of DNA-binding transcription factors include HIF-2, which is activated under conditions of oxygen or glucose deprivation. Although oxygen-dependent protein degradation is a key mechanism by which HIF-1 and HIF-2 activity is regulated, HIF-2 is also influenced substantially by the coupled action of acetylation and deacetylation. The acetylation/deacetylation process that HIF-2 undergoes employs a specific acetyltransferase and deacetylase. Likewise, the supply of the acetyl donor, acetyl CoA, used for HIF-2 acetylation originates from a specific acetyl CoA generator, acetate-dependent acetyl CoA synthetase 2 (Acss2). Although Acss2 is predominantly cytosolic, a subset of the Acss2 cellular pool is enriched in the nucleus following oxygen or glucose deprivation. Prevention of nuclear localization by a directed mutation in a putative nuclear localization signal in Acss2 abrogates HIF-2 acetylation and blunts HIF-2 dependent signaling as well as flank tumor growth for knockdown/rescue cancer cells expressing ectopic Acss2. In this study, we report generation of a novel mouse strain using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis that express this mutant Acss2 allele in the mouse germline. The homozygous mutant mice have impaired induction of the canonical HIF-2 target gene erythropoietin and blunted recovery from acute anemia. Surprisingly, Acss2 protein levels are dramatically reduced in these mutant mice. Functional studies investigating the basis for this phenotype reveal multiple protein instability domains in the Acss2 carboxy terminus. The findings described herein may be of relevance in the regulation of native Acss2 protein as well as for humans carrying missense mutations in these domains."

Design Analytical model for decision making, characterized by cost-effectiveness analysis. Setting Primary Care Level, considering primary health care workers in Brazil. Participants An analytical model for decision making, characterized by a tree of probabilities of events, was developed considering a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 primary health care workers, using the software TreeAge Pro™ 2013 to simulate the clinical and economic impacts of new diagnostic technology (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold in-Tube) versus the traditional tuberculin skin test. Methods This model simulated five diagnostic strategies for LTBI in primary health care workers (HCW) in Brazil: tuberculin skin testing using ≥5 mm cut-off, tuberculin skin testing ≥10 mm cut-off, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold in-Tube, tuberculin skin testing using ≥5 mm cut-off confirmed by QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube if TST positive, tuberculin skin testing using ≥10 mm cut-off confirmed by QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube if TST positive. Primary and secondary outcome measures The outcome measures are the number of individuals correctly classified by the test and the number of Tuberculosis cases avoided. Results The most cost-effective strategy was the tuberculin skin test considering ≥10mm cut-off. The isolated use of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube revealed the strategy of lower efficiency with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$ 146.05 for each HCW correctly classified by the test. Conclusions The tuberculin skin test using ≥10 mm cut-off was the most cost-effective strategy in the diagnosis of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in primary health care works in Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W2985253289,"Rigid n-point water models are widely used in atomistic simulations, but have known accuracy drawbacks. Increasing the number of point charges, as well as adding electronic polarizability, are two common strategies for accuracy improvements. Both strategies come at considerable computational cost, which weighs heavily against modest possible accuracy improvements in practical simulations. In an effort to provide guidance for model development, here we have explored the limiting accuracy of “electrostatically globally optimal” n-point water models in terms of their ability to reproduce properties of water dimer—a mimic of the condensed state of water. For a given n, each model is built upon a set of reference multipole moments (e.g. ab initio) and then optimized to reproduce water dimer total dipole moment. The models are then evaluated with respect to the accuracy of reproducing the geometry of the water dimer. We find that global optimization of the charge distribution alone can deliver high accuracy of the water model: for n = 4 or n = 5, the geometry of the resulting water dimer can be almost within 50 of the ab initio reference, which is half that of the experimental error margin. Thus, global optimization of the charge distribution of classical n-point water models can lead to high accuracy models. We also find that while the accuracy improvement in going from n = 3 to n = 4 is substantial, the additional accuracy increase in going from n = 4 to n = 5 is marginal. Next, we have explored accuracy limitations of the standard practice of adding electronic polarizability (via a Drude particle) to a “rigid base”—pre-optimization rigid n-point water model. The resulting model (n = 3) shows a relatively small improvement in accuracy, suggesting that the strategy of merely adding the polarizability to an inferior accuracy water model used as the base cannot fix the defects of the latter. An alternative strategy in which the parameters of the rigid base model are globally optimized along with the polarizability parameter is much more promising: the resulting 3-point polarizable model out-performs even the 5-point optimal rigid model by a large margin. We suggest that future development efforts consider 3- and 4-point polarizable models where global optimization of the “rigid base” is coupled to optimization of the polarizability to deliver globally optimal solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2986285117,"Background Extensive research has established a clear positive relationship between physical activity (PA), even in small amounts, and psychological well-being, including benefits for emotional and mental health (e.g., decreased depression). However, little research has examined the relationship between PA and decision-making within emotionally ambiguous contexts. The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to examine the relationship between reported amount and intensity of PA and interpretations of emotional ambiguity. Methods Adults (n = 611) recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk were assessed on their interpretations of ambiguous and clear (unambiguous) emotional stimuli and reported habitual PA and exercise. Results More positive ratings of ambiguity were associated with greater amount of vigorous activity (p = .002), but not with moderate activity (p = .826) or walking (p = .673). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that this relationship between vigorous PA and positive interpretations of ambiguity was most pronounced when comparing individuals who reported any amount of vigorous PA to those who reported no vigorous activity at all. Conclusions Our findings suggest that higher amounts of vigorous, but not moderate, PA are associated with more positive interpretations of ambiguity, and that even small amounts of PA seem to be sufficient to promote this more positive valence bias when compared to individuals conducting no vigorous PA at all. Future work should examine the longitudinal effects of PA among individuals participating in structured activity programs."
https://openalex.org/W2986662740,"The average judgment of large numbers of people has been found to be consistently better than the best individual response. But what motivates individuals when they make collective decisions? While it is a popular belief that individual incentives promote out-of-the-box thinking and diverse solutions, the exact role of motivation and reward in collective intelligence remains unclear. Here we examined collective intelligence in an interactive group estimation task where participants were rewarded for their individual or group’s performance. In addition to examining individual versus collective incentive structures, we controlled whether participants could see social information about the others’ responses. We found that knowledge about others’ responses reduced the wisdom of the crowd and, crucially, this effect depended on how people were rewarded. When rewarded for the accuracy of their individual responses, participants converged to the group mean, increasing social conformity, reducing diversity and thereby diminishing their group wisdom. When rewarded for their collective performance, diversity of opinions and the group wisdom increased. We conclude that the intuitive association between individual incentives and individualist opinion needs revising."
https://openalex.org/W2989009498,"The medial entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus are brain regions specialized in spatial information processing. While an animal navigates around an environment, grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex spike at multiple discrete locations, forming hexagonal grid patterns, and each grid cell is spatiotemporally dynamic with a different grid size, spacing, and orientation. In contrast, place cells in the hippocampus spike when an animal is at one or more specific locations, called a ""place field"". While an animal traverses through a place field, the place cell's spike phases relative to the hippocampal theta-frequency oscillation advance in phase, known as the ""spike phase precession"" phenomenon and each spike encodes the specific location within the place field. Interestingly, the medial entorhinal cortical grid cells and the hippocampal place cells are only one excitatory synapse apart. However, how the spatiotemporally dynamic multi-peaked grid cell activities are transformed into hippocampal place cell activities with spike phase precession phenomenon is yet unknown. To address this question, we construct an anatomically and physiologically realistic neural network model comprised of 10,000 grid cell models, each with a spatiotemporally dynamic grid patterns and a place cell model connected by excitatory synapses. Using this neural network model, we show that grid cells' spike activities with spatiotemporally random and diverse grid orientation, spacing, and phases as inputs to place cell are able to generate a place field with spike phase precession. These results indicate that spatiotemporally random and diverse grid cell spike activities are essential for the formation of place cell activity observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2983963495,"Urban drug scenes are characterized by high prevalence of illicit drug dealing and use, violence and poverty, much of which is driven by the criminalization of people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) and the associated stigma. Despite significant public health needs, little is understood about patterns of moving into urban drug scenes among PWUD. Therefore, we sought to identify trajectories of residential mobility (hereafter 'mobility') among PWUD into the Downtown Eastside (DTES), an urban neighbourhood with an open drug scene in Vancouver, Canada, as well as characterize distinct trajectory groups among PWUD.Data were derived from three prospective cohort studies of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver between 2005 and 2016. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify distinct patterns of moving into the DTES among participants residing outside of DTES at baseline. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used to determine baseline factors associated with each trajectory group.In total, 906 eligible participants (30.9% females) provided 9,317 observations. The LCGA assigned four trajectories: consistently living outside of DTES (52.8%); early move into DTES (11.9%); gradual move into DTES (19.5%); and move in then out (15.8%). Younger PWUD, those of Indigenous ancestry, those who were homeless or living in a single-room occupancy hotel (SRO), and those injecting drugs daily were more likely to move in then out of DTES (all p<0.05). Living in an SRO, daily injection drug use, and recent incarceration were also positively associated with early mobility (all p<0.05).Nearly half of the participants moved into the DTES. Younger PWUD and Indigenous peoples appeared to have particularly high mobility, as did those with markers of social-structural vulnerability and high intensity drug use. These findings indicate a need to tailor existing social and health services within the DTES and expand affordable housing options outside the DTES."

Five RRT nurses visited the patients according to their shifts and assessed the possibility of patient deterioration. Patient acuity rating (PAR), a scale of 1-7, was used as the tool of bedside assessment. Other scores, including the modified early warning score, VitalPAC early warning score, standardised early warning score, and cardiac arrest risk triage, were calculated afterwards. The performance of these scores in predicting mortality and/or intensive care unit admission within 1 day was compared by calculating the area under the receiver operating curve.A total of 1,426 patients were included in the study, of which 258 (18.1%) died or were admitted to the intensive care unit within 1 day. The area under the receiver operating curve of PAR was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.89), which was higher than those of modified early warning score (0.66, 95% CI 0.62-0.70), VitalPAC early warning score (0.69, 95% CI 0.66-0.73), standardised early warning score (0.67, 95% CI 0.63-0.70) and cardiac arrest risk triage (0.63, 95% CI 0.59-0.66) (P<0.001).PAR assessed by RRT nurses can be a useful tool for assessing short-term patient prognosis in the RRT setting."
https://openalex.org/W2989057568,"Targeted nanoparticle delivery is a promising strategy for increasing efficacy and limiting side effects of therapeutics. When designing a targeted liposomal formulation, the in vivo biodistribution of the particles must be characterized to determine the value of the targeting approach. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists effectively treat metabolic syndrome by decreasing dyslipidemia and insulin resistance but side effects have limited their use, making them a class of compounds that could benefit from targeted liposomal delivery. The adipose targeting sequence peptide (ATS) could fit this role, as it has been shown to bind to adipose tissue endothelium and induce weight loss when delivered conjugated to a pro-apoptotic peptide. To date, however, a full assessment of ATS in vivo biodistribution has not been reported, leaving important unanswered questions regarding the exact mechanisms whereby ATS targeting enhances therapeutic efficacy. We designed this study to evaluate the biodistribution of ATS-conjugated liposomes loaded with the PPARα/γ dual agonist tesaglitazar in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. The ATS-liposome biodistribution in adipose tissue and other organs was examined at the cellular and tissue level using microscopy, flow cytometry, and fluorescent molecular tomography. Changes in metabolic parameters and gene expression were measured by target and off-target tissue responses to the treatment. Unexpectedly, ATS targeting did not increase liposomal uptake in adipose relative to other tissues, but did increase uptake in the kidneys. Targeting also did not significantly alter metabolic parameters. Analysis of the liposome cellular distribution in the stromal vascular fraction with flow cytometry revealed high uptake by multiple cell types. Our findings highlight the need for thorough study of in vivo biodistribution when evaluating a targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2983306690,"Background Although neutral oral contrast agents are widely in use, a consensus regarding a standardized protocol in abdominal staging CT does not exist. Purpose To test the null hypothesis that there is no quantitative or qualitative difference between water and mannitol for evaluation of the small bowel at abdominal staging CT. Material and methods 180 patients prospectively underwent abdominal staging CT with oral administration of either 1 liter mannitol solution (n = 88) or water (n = 92). Intestinal distension was measured in 6 different segments of the small intestine. In addition, two radiologists separately evaluated diagnostic image quality with regards to luminal distension (three-point scale) in each segment and the possibility to rule out a possible underlying pathology. Quantitative and qualitative results were compared (Mann-Whitney test). Results Quantitatively, intestinal distension was comparable in all segments (p>0.05), except for the horizontal duodenum (p = 0.019). The mean luminal diameter over all intestinal segments was 19.0 mm (18.1–19.9 mm) for the water group and 18.4 mm (17.5–19.2 mm) for the mannitol group, respectively. Qualitatively, ratings were comparable for the first three segments, while distal segments were rated better using mannitol. Side effects were only observed using mannitol (n = 26; 29.5%). Conclusions Orally administered water and mannitol solution for evaluation of the small bowel at abdominal staging CT in clinical routine resulted in comparable results for the quantitative, but not for the qualitative analysis. Looking more differentiated at the overall performance, water has advantages in terms of patient comfort, side effects and costs, and can therefore be regarded as noninferior to mannitol in this specific patient group."

The aims of this study were to understand the effects of maintenance load and stimuli on the operation of cognitive inhibition over memory in working memory tasks in adults with Down syndrome.The study included 36 individuals with Down syndrome (mean age = 33.44 years, standard deviation = 7.54 years, 50% women) and 36 individuals with neurotypical development (mean age = 33.55 years, standard deviation = 7.52 years, 50% women). The participants performed a working memory task in which they had to solve an interference problem during the maintenance phase.The Down syndrome group performed worse on cognitive inhibition over memory than the neurotypical development group. Both groups had lower recall with interference and under high-load conditions. In the neurotypical development group, memory was similar with both materials. The Down syndrome group performed better with non-social stimuli than with social stimuli.Understanding the variables that influence cognitive inhibition over memory will help in planning effective interventions for people with Down syndrome. Considering the results, special importance should be placed on work with social stimuli, at least in individuals with Down syndrome."

Rotator cuff augmentation (RCA) is trying to solve the high retear failure percentage after the surgery procedures (20-90%). The ideal augmentation patch must provide a temporal mechanical support during the healing process. In this work, we proposed a simple method for the fabrication of synthetic RCA patches. This method combines the use of electrospraying to produce poly-L-lactic-co-ε-caprolactone (PLC) films in an organogel form and electrospinning to produce poly(lactic) acid (PLA) nanofibers. The device consists in a combination of layers, creating a multilayered construct, enabling the possibility of tuning its mechanical properties and thickness. Besides, both techniques are simple to escalate for industrial production. A complete characterization has been performed to optimize the involved number of layers and production time of PLC films and PLA nanofibers fabrication, obtaining a final optimal configuration for RCA devices. Structural, mechanical and suture properties were evaluated. Also, the possibility of surface functionalization to improve the bioactivity of the scaffold was studied, adding aligned electrospun PLA nanofibers on the surface of the device to mimic the natural tendon topography. Surface modification was characterized by culturing adult normal human dermal fibroblasts. Lack of toxicity was detected for material presented, and cell alignment shape orientation guided by aligned fibers, mimicking tendon structure, was obtained.

The results showed that F. tularensis SCHU P9 was denatured by heat treatment (94°C for 3 min and 56°C for 30 min), filtration with a 0.22 μm filter, and the use of various solutions (i.e. >70% ethanol, methanol, acetone, and 4% paraformaldehyde). F. tularensis SCHU P9 remained viable after treatment with 50% ethanol for 1 min, filtration with a 0.45 μm filter, and treatments with detergents (i.e. 1% lithium dodecyl sulfate buffer, 1% Triton X-100 and 1% Nonidet P-40) at 4°C for 24 h. Additionally, F. tularensis SCHU P9 suspended in fetal bovine serum in plastic tubes was highly resistant to ultraviolet radiation compared to suspensions in water and chemically defined medium. The methods for inactivation of F. tularensis SCHU P9 was applicable to the other five strains of F. tularensis.

Safety data collected through 96 weeks were analyzed after stratification by baseline CLcr (estimated using Cockcroft-Gault) of 30–49 mL/min (n = 168) versus ≥50 mL/min (n = 3,132) and treatment regimen. The Grade 3–4 adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (for hematological, hepatic and gastrointestinal events), maximal toxicities for liver enzymes, serum creatinine and bilirubin and maximum treatment-emergent hematology toxicities were comparable for groups with baseline CLcr 30–49 versus CLcr≥50 mL/min. No new risks or trends were identified from this dataset. Substantial and similar increases in the mean creatinine clearance (>25 mL/min) were observed from baseline though Week 96 among participants who entered the trial with CLcr 30–49 mL/min, while no increase or smaller median changes in creatinine clearance (<7 mL/min) were observed for participants who entered the trial with CLcr ≥50 mL/min. Substantial increases (> 150 cells/ mm3) in mean CD4+ cells counts from baseline to Week 96 were also observed for participants who entered the trial with CLcr 30–49 mL/min and those with baseline CLcr ≥50 mL/min. Though these results are descriptive, they suggest that HIV-positive patients with CLcr of 30–49 mL/min would have similar AE risks in comparison to patients with CLcr ≥50 mL/min when initiating antiretroviral therapy delivering doses of 300 mg of lamivudine daily through 96 weeks of treatment. Overall improvements in CLcr were observed for patients with baseline CLcr 30–49 mL/min."
https://openalex.org/W2989135478,"Dengue fever is a major worldwide public health problem that, as estimated by the WHO, causes epidemics in over 100 countries, resulting in hundreds of millions of dengue virus (DENV) infections every year. In China, dengue fever mainly occurs in coastal areas. Recurring dengue outbreaks were reported by Guangdong Province almost every year since the first epidemic in 1978. DENV infections persisted in Guangzhou in consecutive years since 2000, with the dengue epidemic reaching a historical peak in 2014. Because Guangzhou is one of the largest cities for opening up in China, understanding the epidemiological characteristics of dengue fever in the city can hopefully provide a significant basis for developing effective dengue prevention strategies. In this study, a total of 34 DENV strains, including 29 DENV-1 strains and 5 DENV-2 strains, were isolated from a blood samples drawn from patients who were diagnosed with dengue fever by hospitals in Guangzhou during 2018. To explore the epidemiological characteristics of dengue fever, the envelope (E) gene obtained from the isolates was amplified for phylogenetic analysis. The results from the phylogenetic analysis showed that DENV in Guangzhou was mainly imported from Southeast Asian countries. Additionally, propagation paths based on phylogeographical analysis suggested potential local dengue transmission in Guangzhou."
https://openalex.org/W2989254719,"Correlates of protection (CoP) are invaluable for iterative vaccine design studies, especially in pursuit of complex vaccines such as a universal influenza vaccine (UFV) where a single antigen is optimized to elicit broad protection against many viral antigenic variants. Since broadly protective antibodies against influenza virus often exhibit mutational evidence of prolonged diversification, we studied germinal center (GC) kinetics in hemagglutinin (HA) immunized mice. Here we report that as early as 4 days after secondary immunization, the expansion of HA-specific GC B cells inversely correlated to protection against influenza virus challenge, induced by the antigen. In contrast, follicular T helper (TFH) cells did not expand differently after boost vaccination, suggestive of a B-cell intrinsic difference in activation and differentiation inferred by protective antigen properties. Importantly, differences in antigen dose only affected GC B-cell frequencies after primary immunization. The absence of accompanying differences in total anti-HA or epitope-specific antibody levels induced by vaccines of different efficacy suggests that the GC B-cell response upon revaccination represents an early and unique marker of protection that may significantly accelerate the pre-clinical phase of vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2986585740,"Objectives This study aims to identify the risk factors for intensive care (IC) in severe malaria patients admitted to the “Lazzaro Spallanzani” National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Rome, Italy. Methods All patients with confirmed severe malaria and hospitalized between 2007 and 2015 were included in the analysis and stratified into two groups: those requiring IC and those who did not. Five prognostic malaria scores were estimated; clinical severity at IC unit admission was assessed using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and the quick-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to assess factors independently associated to IC. Results A total of 98 severe malaria patients were included; 10 of them required IC. There were no deaths or sequelae. Patients requiring IC had higher severity scores. At the multivariate analysis, only the number of World Health Organization criteria and the aspartate aminotransferase value were independently associated with the need of IC. Conclusions An early and accurate assessment of the severity score is essential for the management of severe malaria patients."
https://openalex.org/W2984466058,"Objective Combined computed tomography (CT) occurs when one anatomical area is simultaneously imaged both without and with contrast, or two overlapping anatomical areas are imaged concurrently. While this has been studied in a Traditional Medicare population, it has not been studied in other populations subject to prior authorization. This study explores between-facility variation in ordering and receiving orders to render combined CT in a mixed commercial and Medicare Advantage population. Methods Orders for CT abdomen (without/with contrast), CT thorax (without/with contrast), and concurrent CT brain and sinus authorized by a prior authorization company from 2013–2017, pertaining to patients with commercial or Medicare Advantage health plans from one national insurer, were extracted. Orders were issued and rendered by both hospitals and nonhospitals. The analysis was performed separately for each anatomical area in two ways: orders were grouped by ordering facility, and by designated rendering facility. For each facility, the ratio of combined to total orders was calculated, and analysis of variance was used to determine whether there were significant differences in this rate by year. The association between health plan type and combined imaging rates was assessed. Results Combined rates [ratio±standard deviation] for abdomen, thorax, and brain/sinus were 0.306±0.246, 0.089±0.142, and 0.002±0.01 respectively when the analysis was conducted according to ordering facility, and 0.311±0.178, 0.096±0.113, and 0.001±0.006 when the analysis was conducted according to designated rendering facility. Combined CT abdomen and CT thorax rates decreased monotonically from 2013 to 2017, decreases that were significant (P < .01) regardless of whether orders were grouped by ordering or rendering facility. Combined CT abdomen and CT thorax rates significantly differed between orders pertaining to people with commercial and Medicare Advantage plans. Discussion Variability was greater when orders were grouped by ordering facility, rather than rendering facility. Health plan type may influence whether a patient receives combined CT."
https://openalex.org/W2987964236,"As national HIV programs across the world mature and continue to scale up towards UNAIDS' 90-90-90 targets, it is increasingly important to accurately estimate HIV treatment needs in pediatric patient populations to prepare for anticipated increases in demand. This is particularly vital in sub-Saharan Africa, where the bulk of the global pediatric HIV burden remains concentrated, and for treatment-experienced populations, for which data are severely limited. This article discusses the conceptual framework behind and application of a five-year country-level quantification and decision-making tool aimed at providing national HIV programs and their partners with a better understanding of their evolving national HIV treatment and programming needs for second-and third-line pediatric populations. The conceptual framework of the algorithm which undergirds the tool is the patient pathway, along which key influencing factors that determine whether pediatric HIV patients are linked to care, remain in treatment, and are appropriately switched to later lines of treatment are accounted for quantitatively. Excel-based and arithmetic, the algorithm is designed to use available national, regional, and global data for factors impacting patient estimates including treatment coverage; routine viral load testing; viral load non-suppression; confirmed treatment failure; and patient loss to follow up-outcomes for which data are generally very limited in this patient population. The ultimate output of the tool is an estimate of the aggregate annual number of patients by treatment line. Given the limitations in available data for pediatric HIV, particularly for patients on second- and third-line treatments, this tool may help fill a data gap by providing a mechanism for policymakers to scenario plan, thus aiding resource allocation decisions for pediatric HIV program scale-up. The tool may be used to streamline national antiretroviral procurement of later lines of treatment, especially in resource-limited settings, and may also be used to add value to broader HIV policy and planning processes at the national level."
