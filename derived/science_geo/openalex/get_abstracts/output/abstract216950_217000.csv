https://openalex.org/W59833899,"The effects of 5-bromouracil, an analogue of thymine, have been extensively studied in microbial systems. The incorporation of this analogue into the deoxyribonucleic acid of several strains of bacteria has been demonstrated (l-5). This phenomenon was shown to be associated with morphological changes caused by unbalanced growth (1,2,5), with decrease in viability (1, 5) and with the occurrence of 6-methylaminopurine as a structural part of DNA (2). The deoxyribonucleoside of 5-bromouracil, an analogue of thymidiie, has also been studied in bacterial systems and found to be both an inhibitor (6-8) and a growth factor (8). This compound has been shown to inhibit the incorporation of labeled formaldehyde (Q), formate, erotic acid, and thymidine (10) into DNA-thymine of mammalian tissues in vitro and of labeled formaldehyde into DNA-thymine of spleen and tumor t,issues in u-iuo (9). In the present study, the incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine into DNA of HeLa cells was demonstrated and this phenomenon was shown to be associated with unbalanced growth and loss of viability of the cell. A preliminary report on these findings has been presented (11)."

https://openalex.org/W2032069506,"THE conclusion of J. H. Wright1 that blood platelets are detached portions of the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes has been supported by much circumstantial evidence, and is generally accepted2, although unequivocal direct evidence is lacking."
https://openalex.org/W2060697496,"THE separation of cytoplasmic particles into fractions by differential centrifugation has been extensively used for the study of the distribution of intracellular cell constituents. Some enzymes of oxidative metabolism have been shown to be localized chiefly in the fraction of the liver containing large particles (mitochondria)1. During the course of an investigation of the xanthine oxidase of the rat liver, we have studied the intracellular distribution of this enzyme, since there seem to be no data in tho literature."

https://openalex.org/W1995226996,"IT is well known that difficulties in speaking will result if the speaker is made to listen to the sound of his own voice delayed by about 0.l–0.3 sec. This delayed feed-back will produce stuttering, reduced rate of speaking, distortion of sound quality and other impairments of speech1."
https://openalex.org/W2029871077,Two refinements (latex micro-molding and latex-plaster molding mixture) of the basic technique for molding objects in liquid rubber--a method for making minutely detailed replicas of small and intricate surfaces and a method for quickly filling undercuts and building up mold thickness--have proved exceedingly useful in research.

https://openalex.org/W2055015089,"WE have made the following suggestions to explain the incidence and location of the tumours produced in rats with 4-aminodiphenyl and some of its nuclear methylated derivatives1. First, that in each instance the effective carcinogen is the corresponding ortho-hydroxy amine, formed in the liver and excreted in the bile; secondly, that 4-aminodiphenyl itself is largely metabolized to the 4′-hydroxy derivative and that little of the ortho-hydroxy amine, 3-hydroxy-4-aminodiphenyl, is formed; and finally, that in the metabolism of the more actively carcinogenic derivatives of 4-aminodiphenyl containing a methyl substituent in the 3 position, relatively more of the corresponding ortho-hydroxy amines are produced."

https://openalex.org/W1563382006,"Mice were exposed to atomic bomb radiation at 28 stations on both sides of the estimated L.D. /sub 50/ distance to compare the biological effect with that produced by laboratory gamma and x-radiations. At doses up to 620r., mortality was constant at 3% but above this dosage, mortality increased rapidly to 950r., which was approximately the absolute lethal dose. The estimated L. D. /sub 50/ was 759r. The relative biological effects of x-ray to bomb radiation closely approached unity."
https://openalex.org/W2037693855,IN our earlier report we directed attention to the importance of chelation as an essential step in the anti-tuberculous activity of isonicotinic hydrazide (isoniazid)1. It was impossible to decide whether the chelating action with a metal or metals took place before (in the medium) or after adsorption on the bacterial cell.

https://openalex.org/W2091671452,"I REPORTED in a recent communication1 that, in the presence of periodic acid as oxidant, ketosteroid salicyloylhydrazones couple readily with stabilized p-aminodiethylaniline to form intensely coloured blue-green indoanilines2. Further investigation has made it clear that this reaction compares favourably with existing phenol reactions in respect of sensitivity, specificity, stability and optical properties."

This can be effected in a simple and reliable way, by using phase-contrast microscopy and a modified Zollikofer's solution1, composed of 1 ml. yellow eosin (2 per cent aqueous solution, kept in a refrigerator), 3 ml. formalin (40 per cent, neutralized with calcium carbonate) and distilled water to make up 100 ml."
