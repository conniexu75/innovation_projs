https://openalex.org/W3018782651,"In Italy, 128,948 confirmed cases and 15,887 deaths of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were registered as of 5 April 2020. Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3020220880,"Ultrathin ferroelectric materials could potentially enable low-power logic and nonvolatile memories1,2. As ferroelectric materials are made thinner, however, the ferroelectricity is usually suppressed. Size effects in ferroelectrics have been thoroughly investigated in perovskite oxides—the archetypal ferroelectric system3. Perovskites, however, have so far proved unsuitable for thickness scaling and integration with modern semiconductor processes4. Here we report ferroelectricity in ultrathin doped hafnium oxide (HfO2), a fluorite-structure oxide grown by atomic layer deposition on silicon. We demonstrate the persistence of inversion symmetry breaking and spontaneous, switchable polarization down to a thickness of one nanometre. Our results indicate not only the absence of a ferroelectric critical thickness but also enhanced polar distortions as film thickness is reduced, unlike in perovskite ferroelectrics. This approach to enhancing ferroelectricity in ultrathin layers could provide a route towards polarization-driven memories and ferroelectric-based advanced transistors. This work shifts the search for the fundamental limits of ferroelectricity to simpler transition-metal oxide systems—that is, from perovskite-derived complex oxides to fluorite-structure binary oxides—in which ‘reverse’ size effects counterintuitively stabilize polar symmetry in the ultrathin regime. Enhanced switchable ferroelectric polarization is achieved in doped hafnium oxide films grown directly onto silicon using low-temperature atomic layer deposition, even at thicknesses of just one nanometre."
https://openalex.org/W3017270631,"A high tumour mutational burden (hypermutation) is observed in some gliomas1–5; however, the mechanisms by which hypermutation develops and whether it predicts the response to immunotherapy are poorly understood. Here we comprehensively analyse the molecular determinants of mutational burden and signatures in 10,294 gliomas. We delineate two main pathways to hypermutation: a de novo pathway associated with constitutional defects in DNA polymerase and mismatch repair (MMR) genes, and a more common post-treatment pathway, associated with acquired resistance driven by MMR defects in chemotherapy-sensitive gliomas that recur after treatment with the chemotherapy drug temozolomide. Experimentally, the mutational signature of post-treatment hypermutated gliomas was recapitulated by temozolomide-induced damage in cells with MMR deficiency. MMR-deficient gliomas were characterized by a lack of prominent T cell infiltrates, extensive intratumoral heterogeneity, poor patient survival and a low rate of response to PD-1 blockade. Moreover, although bulk analyses did not detect microsatellite instability in MMR-deficient gliomas, single-cell whole-genome sequencing analysis of post-treatment hypermutated glioma cells identified microsatellite mutations. These results show that chemotherapy can drive the acquisition of hypermutated populations without promoting a response to PD-1 blockade and supports the diagnostic use of mutational burden and signatures in cancer. Temozolomide therapy seems to lead to mismatch repair deficiency and hypermutation in gliomas, but not to an increase in response to immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3016352084,"Time-calibrated phylogenies of extant species (referred to here as ‘extant timetrees’) are widely used for estimating diversification dynamics1. However, there has been considerable debate surrounding the reliability of these inferences2–5 and, to date, this critical question remains unresolved. Here we clarify the precise information that can be extracted from extant timetrees under the generalized birth–death model, which underlies most existing methods of estimation. We prove that, for any diversification scenario, there exists an infinite number of alternative diversification scenarios that are equally likely to have generated any given extant timetree. These ‘congruent’ scenarios cannot possibly be distinguished using extant timetrees alone, even in the presence of infinite data. Importantly, congruent diversification scenarios can exhibit markedly different and yet similarly plausible dynamics, which suggests that many previous studies may have over-interpreted phylogenetic evidence. We introduce identifiable and easily interpretable variables that contain all available information about past diversification dynamics, and demonstrate that these can be estimated from extant timetrees. We suggest that measuring and modelling these identifiable variables offers a more robust way to study historical diversification dynamics. Our findings also make it clear that palaeontological data will continue to be crucial for answering some macroevolutionary questions. An infinite number of alternative diversification scenarios—which may have markedly different, but equally plausible, dynamics—can underpin a given time-calibrated phylogeny of extant species, suggesting many previous studies have over-interpreted phylogenetic evidence."
https://openalex.org/W3020164231,"Unidirectional radiation is important for various optoelectronic applications, such as lasers, grating couplers and optical antennas. However, almost all existing unidirectional emitters rely on the use of materials or structures that forbid outgoing waves—that is, mirrors, which are often bulky, lossy and difficult to fabricate. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a class of resonances in photonic crystal slabs that radiate only towards one side of the slab, with no mirror placed on the other side. These resonances, which we name ‘unidirectional guided resonances’, are found to be topological in nature: they emerge when a pair of half-integer topological charges1–3 in the polarization field bounce into each other in momentum space. We experimentally demonstrate unidirectional guided resonances in the telecommunication regime by achieving single-side radiative quality factors as high as 1.6 × 105. We further demonstrate their topological nature through far-field polarimetry measurements. Our work represents a characteristic example of applying topological principles4,5 to control optical fields and could lead to energy-efficient grating couplers and antennas for light detection and ranging. Unidirectional radiation is achieved in a photonic crystal slab without the use of mirrors by merging a pair of topological defects carrying half-integer charges."
https://openalex.org/W3016832984,"The taste of sugar is one of the most basic sensory percepts for humans and other animals. Animals can develop a strong preference for sugar even if they lack sweet taste receptors, indicating a mechanism independent of taste1-3. Here we examined the neural basis for sugar preference and demonstrate that a population of neurons in the vagal ganglia and brainstem are activated via the gut-brain axis to create preference for sugar. These neurons are stimulated in response to sugar but not artificial sweeteners, and are activated by direct delivery of sugar to the gut. Using functional imaging we monitored activity of the gut-brain axis, and identified the vagal neurons activated by intestinal delivery of glucose. Next, we engineered mice in which synaptic activity in this gut-to-brain circuit was genetically silenced, and prevented the development of behavioural preference for sugar. Moreover, we show that co-opting this circuit by chemogenetic activation can create preferences to otherwise less-preferred stimuli. Together, these findings reveal a gut-to-brain post-ingestive sugar-sensing pathway critical for the development of sugar preference. In addition, they explain the neural basis for differences in the behavioural effects of sweeteners versus sugar, and uncover an essential circuit underlying the highly appetitive effects of sugar."
https://openalex.org/W3019116046,"After 50 years of development, the technology of today’s electronics is approaching its physical limits, with feature sizes smaller than 10 nanometres. It is also becoming clear that the ever-increasing power consumption of information and communication systems1 needs to be contained. These two factors require the introduction of non-traditional materials and state variables. As recently highlighted2, the remanence associated with collective switching in ferroic systems is an appealing way to reduce power consumption. A promising approach is spintronics, which relies on ferromagnets to provide non-volatility and to generate and detect spin currents3. However, magnetization reversal by spin transfer torques4 is a power-consuming process. This is driving research on multiferroics to achieve low-power electric-field control of magnetization5, but practical materials are scarce and magnetoelectric switching remains difficult to control. Here we demonstrate an alternative strategy to achieve low-power spin detection, in a non-magnetic system. We harness the electric-field-induced ferroelectric-like state of strontium titanate (SrTiO3)6–9 to manipulate the spin–orbit properties10 of a two-dimensional electron gas11, and efficiently convert spin currents into positive or negative charge currents, depending on the polarization direction. This non-volatile effect opens the way to the electric-field control of spin currents and to ultralow-power spintronics, in which non-volatility would be provided by ferroelectricity rather than by ferromagnetism. The polarization direction of a ferroelectric-like state can be used to control the conversion of spin currents into charge currents at the surface of strontium titanate, a non-magnetic oxide."

https://openalex.org/W3017435827,"Improvements in pediatric cancer survival are attributed to cooperative clinical trials. Under-representation of specific demographic groups has been described in adult and pediatric cancer trials and poses a threat to the generalizability of results. An evaluation of data provided by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) of upfront trial enrollment for US patients 0 to 29 years old between 2004 and 2015 was performed.US cancer cases were estimated using incidence data and US population estimates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program and compared to observed COG cases. Percent enrollment and standardized ratios of enrollment were calculated across demographic, disease, and socioeconomic groups. The COG website was utilized to quantify available trials and assess age eligibility.19.9% of estimated US cancer patients age 0 to 19 years enrolled on COG trials. Younger patients were more represented across diseases and races/ethnicities. Patients with hematologic malignancies were more represented compared to solid and central nervous system (CNS) tumors.COG trial enrollment rates are declining when compared to previously published data, potentially from challenges in pediatric drug development, difficulty designing feasible trials for highly curable diagnoses, and issues ensuring trial availability for the heterogeneous group of solid and CNS tumors. Though racial/ethnic groups and county-level socioeconomic factors were proportionally represented, under representation of the adolescent/young adult (AYA) population and younger patients with solid and CNS tumors remains a concern. Targeted efforts should focus on these subgroups and further research should evaluate AYA enrollment rates across all available trials."
https://openalex.org/W3018038239,"Global warming is predicted to have a negative effect on plant growth due to the damaging effect of high temperatures. In order to address the effect of high temperature environments on olive oil yield and quality, we compared its effect on the fruit development of five olive cultivars placed in a region noted for its high summer temperatures, with trees of the same cultivars placed in a region of relatively mild summers. We found that the effects of a high temperature environment are genotype dependent and in general, high temperatures during fruit development affected three important traits: fruit weight, oil concentration and oil quality. None of the tested cultivars exhibited complete heat stress tolerance. Final dry fruit weight at harvest of the 'Barnea' cultivar was not affected by the high temperature environment, whereas the 'Koroneiki', 'Coratina', 'Souri' and 'Picholine' cultivars exhibited decreased dry fruit weight at harvest in response to higher temperatures by 0.2, 1, 0.4 and 0.2 g respectively. The pattern of final oil concentration was also cultivar dependent, 'Barnea', 'Coratina' and 'Picholine' not being affected by the high temperature environment, whereas the 'Koroneiki' and 'Souri' cultivars showed a decreased dry fruit oil concentration at harvest under the same conditions by 15 and 8% respectively. Regarding the quality of oil produced, the 'Souri' cultivar proved more tolerant to a high temperature environment than any other of the cultivars analyzed in this study. These results suggest that different olive cultivars have developed a variety of mechanisms in dealing with high temperatures. Elucidation of the mechanism of each of these responses may open the way to development of a variety of olives broadly adapted to conditions of high temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W3019457581,"Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is the efficiency with which plants acquire and use nitrogen. Plants have high-affinity nitrate transport systems, which involve certain nitrate transporter (NRT) genes. However, limited data are available on the contribution of the NRT2/3 gene family in barley nitrate transport. In the present study, ten putative NRT2 and three putative NRT3 genes were identified using bioinformatics methods. All the HvNRT2/3 genes were located on chromosomes 3H, 5H, 6H or 7H. Remarkably, the presence of tandem repeats indicated that duplication events contributed to the expansion of the NRT2 gene family in barley. In addition, the HvNRT2/3 genes displayed various expression patterns at selected developmental stages and were induced in the roots by both low and high nitrogen levels. Furthermore, the overexpression of HvNRT2.1 improved the yield related traits in Arabidopsis. Taken together, the data generated in the present study will be useful for genome-wide analyses to determine the precise role of the HvNRT2/3 genes during barley development, with the ultimate goal of improving NUE and crop production."
https://openalex.org/W3018381890,"Pathological fear and anxiety disorders can have debilitating impacts on individual patients and society. The neural circuitry underlying fear learning and extinction has been known to play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Pavlovian conditioning, where a subject learns an association between a biologically-relevant stimulus and a neutral cue, has been instrumental in guiding the development of therapies for treating anxiety disorders. To date, a number of physiological signal responses such as skin conductance, heart rate, electroencephalography and cerebral blood flow have been analyzed in Pavlovian fear conditioning experiments. However, physiological markers are often examined separately to gain insight into the neural processes underlying fear acquisition. We propose a method to track a single brain-related sympathetic arousal state from physiological signal features during fear conditioning. We develop a state-space formulation that probabilistically relates features from skin conductance and heart rate to the unobserved sympathetic arousal state. We use an expectation-maximization framework for state estimation and model parameter recovery. State estimation is performed via Bayesian filtering. We evaluate our model on simulated and experimental data acquired in a trace fear conditioning experiment. Results on simulated data show the ability of our proposed method to estimate an unobserved arousal state and recover model parameters. Results on experimental data are consistent with skin conductance measurements and provide good fits to heartbeats modeled as a binary point process. The ability to track arousal from skin conductance and heart rate within a state-space model is an important precursor to the development of wearable monitors that could aid in patient care. Anxiety and trauma-related disorders are often accompanied by a heightened sympathetic tone and the methods described herein could find clinical applications in remote monitoring for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3018981623,"Background Poor diet is a risk factor for anemia, overweight, and obesity among adolescent girls. However, comprehensive assessment on dietary quality and habits in this population is limited. We assessed the association of meal patterning, dietary quality, and dietary diversity with both anemia and overweight-obesity. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 335 school-going adolescent girls aged 12–19 years from three districts in West Java using multi-stage cluster sampling. Meal patterning, Dietary Quality Index for Adolescents (DQI-A), and Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) were determined using 2-day 24-h recall. Results Of the girls, 45% were anemic and 17% overweight or obese. Eating occasions of 3–4 times (AOR 2.68, 95% CI 1.21–5.98) and >4 times (AOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.01–5.83) were associated with greater odds of developing anemia compared to eating occasions of <3 times. Adolescent girls who skipped dinner had greater odds of being overweight or obese (AOR 2.13, 95% CI 1.10–4.10) and were less likely to be anemic (AOR 0.56, 95%CI 0.33–0.95) compared to those who did not skip dinner. Difference in energy intake was found between girls who had dinner and skipped dinner (p = 0.05). Mean total DQI-A score was 44.4% ± 7.71% and DDS was 4.0 out of 9.0. DQI-A score was significantly higher in non-anemic compared to anemic girls. Moreover, each unit increment of 1% of total DQI-A score was associated with a 3.967 g/dL increases of hemoglobin after adjustment for confounders. We found differences in total DQI-A score between normal-weight and overweight or obese girls. DDS score was not significantly different between groups, although lower meat, chicken, and fish consumption were correlated with anemia (p<0.01). Conclusions Overall, the girls had poor dietary quality and diversity. The findings therefore indicated the importance of improving dietary quality and diversity in a regular meal pattern, especially meal frequency and meal skipping, to reduce the risk of anemia and overweight-obesity among adolescent girls."
https://openalex.org/W3019315735,"Aims To assess the effect of data-driven custom-made footwear concepts on plantar pressure relief to prevent diabetic foot ulceration. Methods Twenty-four neuropathic diabetic patients at high risk of foot ulceration were measured for in-shoe plantar pressures during walking in four data-driven custom-made footwear conditions, an athletic shoe and an off-the-shelf non-therapeutic shoe. Two evidence-based footwear conditions (Shoe-A; Insole-A) follow a scientific-based design protocol, are handmade, and use in-shoe plantar pressure guided optimization. One evidence-based insole condition (Insole-B) uses a barefoot plantar pressure and 3D foot shape-based computer-assisted design and manufacturing (CADCAM) routine. And one insole condition (Insole-C) uses a barefoot and in-shoe plantar pressure and 3D foot shape-based CADCAM design and optimization routine. Patient satisfaction was scored on walking comfort, shoe fit, weight and appearance. Results All data-driven footwear conditions significantly reduced metatarsal head peak pressure compared with the non-therapeutic shoe (17–53% relief). Shoe-A and Insole-A showed the lowest metatarsal head peak pressures (mean 112–155 kPa, 90–98% of cases <200 kPa), significantly lower than for Insole-B and Insole-C (mean 119–199 kPa, 52–100% <200 kPa). Patient satisfaction was not significantly different between footwear concepts. Conclusions This study proves the offloading efficacy of a scientific-based, handmade, and in-shoe plantar pressure data-driven approach to custom-made footwear design, and advocates its implementation to optimize diabetic footwear for plantar foot ulcer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3020584025,"Harvesting has received most theoretical, empirical, and policy attention towards understanding common-pool resource dilemmas. Yet, pre-harvesting and post-harvesting activities influence harvesting outcomes as well. Broadening the analytical focus beyond harvesting is needed to imagine new ways of theorizing and governing the commons. Fishing—which is synonymous with harvesting—is a case in point. We contribute to a beyond-harvesting research agenda by incorporating concepts from common-pool resources theory that have not received enough attention in the literature. We compare two ubiquitous self-organizing strategies (i.e., fishing cooperatives and patron-client relationships) fishers use to access means of production and analyze their effects on the distribution of benefits resulting from harvesting. We use rarely available longitudinal data of monetary loans to fishers in Mexican small-scale fisheries and find that cooperatives can deliver broader distribution of benefits than patron-client relationships. Our study highlights the importance of historically and contextually situating analyses linking the effects of pre-harvesting processes on harvesting outcomes, and the benefits of broadening the scope of inquiry beyond a narrow policy attention on harvesting to move towards a fuller understanding of commons dilemmas."
https://openalex.org/W3105531008,"Following its flyby and first imaging the Pluto-Charon binary, the New Horizons spacecraft visited the Kuiper-Belt-Object (KBO) (486958) 2014 MU69 (Arrokoth). Imaging showed MU69 to be a contact-binary, made of two individual lobes connected by a narrow neck, rotating at low spin period (15.92 h), and having high obliquity (~98 deg), similar to other KBO contact-binaries inferred through photometric observations. The origin of such peculiar configurations is puzzling, and all scenarios suggested for the origins of contact-binaries fail to reproduce such properties and their likely high frequency. Here we show that semi-secular perturbations operating only on ultra-wide (~0.1-0.4 Hill-radius) KBO-binaries can robustly lead to gentle, slow-speed binary mergers at arbitrarily high obliquities, but low rotational velocities, that can reproduce MU69's (and similar oblique contact binaries) characteristics. Using N-body simulations, we find that ~15% of all ultra-wide binaries with cosine-uniform inclination distribution are likely to merge through this process. Moreover, we find that such mergers are sufficiently gentle as to only slightly deform the KBO shape, and can produce the measured rotation speed of MU69. The semi-secular contact-binary formation channel not only explains the observed properties of MU69, but could also apply for other Kuiper/asteroid belt binaries, and for Solar/extra-solar moon systems."
https://openalex.org/W3018911758,"Incorporating expert knowledge at the time machine learning models are trained holds promise for producing models that are easier to interpret. The main objectives of this study were to use a feature engineering approach to incorporate clinical expert knowledge prior to applying machine learning techniques, and to assess the impact of the approach on model complexity and performance. Four machine learning models were trained to predict mortality with a severe asthma case study. Experiments to select fewer input features based on a discriminative score showed low to moderate precision for discovering clinically meaningful triplets, indicating that discriminative score alone cannot replace clinical input. When compared to baseline machine learning models, we found a decrease in model complexity with use of fewer features informed by discriminative score and filtering of laboratory features with clinical input. We also found a small difference in performance for the mortality prediction task when comparing baseline ML models to models that used filtered features. Encoding demographic and triplet information in ML models with filtered features appeared to show performance improvements from the baseline. These findings indicated that the use of filtered features may reduce model complexity, and with little impact on performance."
https://openalex.org/W3020407247,"Thermosensation is crucial for humans to probe the environment and detect threats arising from noxious heat or cold. Over the last years, EEG frequency-tagging using long-lasting periodic radiant heat stimulation has been proposed as a means to study the cortical processes underlying tonic heat perception. This approach is based on the notion that periodic modulation of a sustained stimulus can elicit synchronized periodic activity in the neuronal populations responding to the stimulus, known as a steady-state response (SSR). In this paper, we extend this approach using a contact thermode to generate both heat- and cold-evoked SSRs. Furthermore, we characterize the temporal dynamics of the elicited responses, relate these dynamics to perception, and assess the effects of displacing the stimulated skin surface to gain insight on the heat- and cold-sensitive afferents conveying these responses. Two experiments were conducted in healthy volunteers. In both experiments, noxious heat and innocuous cool stimuli were applied during 75 seconds to the forearm using a Peltier-based contact thermode, with intensities varying sinusoidally at 0.2 Hz. Displacement of the thermal stimulation on the skin surface was achieved by independently controlling the Peltier elements of the thermal probe. Continuous intensity ratings to sustained heat and cold stimulation were obtained in the first experiment with 14 subjects, and the EEG was recorded in the second experiment on 15 subjects. Both contact heat and cool stimulation elicited periodic EEG responses and percepts. Compared to heat stimulation, the responses to cool stimulation had a lower magnitude and shorter latency. All responses tended to habituate along time, and this response attenuation was most pronounced for cool compared to warm stimulation, and for stimulation delivered using a fixed surface compared to a variable surface."
https://openalex.org/W3017847983,"Sympatric ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) and bobcats (Lynx rufus) in South Texas show substantial overlap in body size, food habits, and habitat use. Consequently, we explore whether temporal niche partitioning may explain ocelot and bobcat coexistence. We investigated the influence of sun angle, lunar illumination, and maximum diurnal temperature on temporal movement rates of sympatric ocelots (n = 8) and bobcats (n = 6) using a combination of high-frequency GPS locations and bi-axial accelerometer data. We demonstrated that accelerometer data could be used to predict movement rates, providing a nearly continuous measure of animal activity and supplementing GPS locations. Ocelots showed a strong nocturnal activity pattern with the highest movement rates at night whereas bobcats showed a crepuscular activity pattern with the highest movement rates occurring around sunrise and sunset. Although bobcat activity levels were lower during the day, bobcat diurnal activity was higher than ocelot diurnal activity. During warmer months, bobcats were more active on nights with high levels of lunar illumination. In contrast, ocelots showed the highest nocturnal activity levels during periods of low lunar illumination. Ocelots showed reduced diurnal activity on hotter days. Our results indicate that ocelot and bobcat coexistence in South Texas can be partially explained by temporal niche partitioning, although both felids showed periods of overlapping activity during nocturnal and crepuscular periods."
https://openalex.org/W3018808712,"Background Studies have suggested associations between self-reported engagement in health behaviors and reduced risk of cognitive decline. Most studies explore these relationships using one health behavior, often cross-sectionally or with dementia as the outcome. In this study, we explored whether several individual self-reported health behaviors were associated with cognitive decline when considered simultaneously, using data from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP), an Alzheimer's disease risk-enriched cohort who were non-demented and in late midlife at baseline. Method We analyzed longitudinal cognitive data from 828 participants in WRAP, with a mean age at baseline cognitive assessment of 57 (range = 36-78, sd = 6.8) and an average of 6.3 years (standard deviation = 1.9, range = 2-10) of follow-up. The primary outcome was a multi-domain cognitive composite, and secondary outcomes were immediate/delayed memory and executive function composites. Predictors of interest were self-reported measures of physical activity, cognitive activity, adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet (MIND), and interactions with each other and age. We conducted linear mixed effects analyses within an Information-theoretic (IT) model averaging (MA) approach on a set of models including covariates and combinations of these 2- and 3-way interactions. The IT approach was selected due to the large number of interactions of interest and to avoid pitfalls of traditional model selection approaches. Results Model-averaged results identified no significant self-reported health behavior*age interactions in relationship to the primary composite outcome. In secondary outcomes, higher MIND diet scores associated with slower decline in executive function. Men showed faster decline than women on delayed memory, independent of health behaviors. There were no other significant interactions among any other health behaviors and cognitive trajectories. Conclusions When multiple covariates and health behaviors were considered simultaneously, there were limited weak associations with cognitive decline in this age range. These results may be explained alone or in combination by three alternative explanations: 1) the range of cognitive decline is in middle age is too small to observe relationships with health behaviors, 2) the putative associations of these health behaviors on cognition may not be robust in this age range, or 3) the self-reported measures of the health behaviors may not be optimal for predicting cognitive decline. More study may be needed that incorporates sensitive measures of health behaviors, AD biomarker profiles, and/or other disease comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3019220930,"Objectives To examine potential gadolinium (Gd) accumulation in the brain of healthy mice after long-term oral administration of Gd-containing food pellets and to investigate whether Gd leads to adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects, specifically focussing on locomotor impairment in Gd exposed compared to control animals. Materials and methods The local Animal Experimental Ethics Committee approved all procedures and applications. Fifteen female C57Bl/6 mice were orally exposed to a daily intake of 0.57 mmol Gd chloride/ kg body weight over a period of 90 weeks from the age of 4 weeks on. Gd-free, but otherwise equivalent experimental diets were given to the control group (N = 13). The animals were monitored daily by animal caretakers regarding any visible signs of distress and evaluated clinically every four weeks for the first 60 weeks and afterwards every two weeks for a better temporal resolution of potential long-term effects regarding impairment of motor performance and loss of body weight. The individual Gd content was measured using mass spectrometry in a sub-cohort of N = 6 mice. Results The absolute brain Gd levels of the Gd-exposed mice were significantly increased compared to control mice (0.033± 0.009 vs. 0.006± 0.002 nmol Gd/ g brain tissue). Long-term oral Gd exposure over almost the entire life-span did not lead to adverse CNS effects including locomotor changes (rotarod performance, p = 0.1467) in healthy mice throughout the study period. Gd-exposed mice showed less increased body weight compared to control mice during the study period (p = 0.0423). Histopathological alterations, such as hepatocellular vacuolization due to fatty change in the liver and a loss of nucleated cells in the red pulp of the spleen, were found in peripheral organs of both groups. Conclusions Low levels of intracerebral Gd caused by chronic oral exposure over almost the entire life span of mice did not lead to alterations in locomotor abilities in healthy mice throughout the normal aging process."
https://openalex.org/W3018168533,"Melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR) is a rare paraneoplastic retinal disorder usually occurring in the context of metastatic melanoma. Patients present with night blindness, photopsias and a constriction of the visual field. MAR is an auto-immune disorder characterized by the production of autoantibodies targeting retinal proteins, especially autoantibodies reacting to the cation channel TRPM1 produced in melanocytes and ON-bipolar cells. TRPM1 has at least three different isoforms which vary in the N-terminal region of the protein. In this study, we report the case of three new MAR patients presenting different anti-TRPM1 autoantibodies reacting to the three isoforms of TRPM1 with variable binding affinity. Two sera recognized all isoforms of TRPM1, while one recognized only the two longest isoforms upon immunolocalization studies on overexpressing cells. Similarly, the former two sera reacted with all TRPM1 isoforms on western blot, but an immunoprecipitation enrichment step was necessary to detect all isoforms with the latter serum. In contrast, all sera labelled ON-bipolar cells on Tprm1+/+ but not on Trpm1-/- mouse retina as shown by co-immunolocalization. This confirms that the MAR sera specifically detect TRPM1. Most likely, the anti-TRPM1 autoantibodies of different patients vary in affinity and concentration. In addition, the binding of autoantibodies to TRPM1 may be conformation-dependent, with epitopes being inaccessible in some constructs (truncated polypeptides versus full-length TRPM1) or applications (western blotting versus immunohistochemistry). Therefore, we propose that a combination of different methods should be used to test for the presence of anti-TRPM1 autoantibodies in the sera of MAR patients."
https://openalex.org/W3018375665,"Introduction Recently, the rise in the incidences of thyroid cancer worldwide renders it to be the sixth most common cancer among women. Commonly, Fine Needle Aspiration biopsy predominantly facilitates the diagnosis of the nature of thyroid nodules. However, it is inconsiderable in determining the tumor’s state, i.e., benign or malignant. This study aims to identify the key RNA transcripts that can segregate the early and late-stage samples of Thyroid Carcinoma (THCA) using RNA expression profiles. Materials and methods In this study, we used the THCA RNA-Seq dataset of The Cancer Genome Atlas, consisting of 500 cancer and 58 normal (adjacent non-tumorous) samples obtained from the Genomics Data Commons (GDC) data portal. This dataset was dissected to identify key RNA expression features using various feature selection techniques. Subsequently, samples were classified based on selected features employing different machine learning algorithms. Results Single gene ranking based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) curve identified the DCN transcript that can classify the early-stage samples from late-stage samples with 0.66 AUROC. To further improve the performance, we identified a panel of 36 RNA transcripts that achieved F1 score of 0.75 with 0.73 AUROC (95% CI: 0.62–0.84) on the validation dataset. Moreover, prediction models based on 18-features from this panel correctly predicted 75% of the samples of the external validation dataset. In addition, the multiclass model classified normal, early, and late-stage samples with AUROC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.84–1), 0.76 (95% CI: 0.66–0.85) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.61–0.83) on the validation dataset. Besides, a five protein-coding transcripts panel was also recognized, which segregated cancer and normal samples in the validation dataset with F1 score of 0.97 and 0.99 AUROC (95% CI: 0.91–1). Conclusion We identified 36 important RNA transcripts whose expression segregated early and late-stage samples with reasonable accuracy.

https://openalex.org/W3019710878,"Cross-reactive carbohydrate determinant (CCD) structures found in plant and insect glycoproteins are commonly recognized by IgE antibodies as epitopes that can lead to extensive cross-reactivity and obscure in vitro diagnostic (IVD) serology results. With the introduction of component resolved diagnosis (CRD), recombinant non-glycosylated components have been utilized to mitigate the risk of CCD-specific IgE (sIgE) detection. However, a recent study has shown that CCD-sIgE may bind directly to the cellulose solid phase matrix used in certain in vitro diagnostic assays, eliminating the advantage of CRD over traditional extract-based testing. The aim of this study is to further investigate the prevalence of CCD-sIgE interference on a commonly-used in vitro sIgE automated platform which employs a cellulose-based matrix to immobilize CCD-free recombinant components.Sera from patients sensitized to peanut, silver birch, and/or timothy grass were analyzed for CCD-sIgE reactivity on ImmunoCAP/Phadia and NOVEOS autoanalyzers against the MUXF3 carbohydrate component. Positive CCD-sIgE sera were further analyzed against non-glycosylated recombinant components bound to the ImmunoCAP solid phase in the absence and presence of a soluble CCD inhibitor. For comparison, sera were then analyzed on NOVEOS, a non-cellulose based automated sIgE assay.Sera from 35% of the sensitized population tested in this study were positive (≥0.35 kU/L) for CCD-sIgE. Of those positives, 17% resulted in CCD-sIgE-positive (false positive) results on ImmunoCAP using non-glycosylated allergosorbents that were negative on NOVEOS. Sera producing false-positive results on ImmunoCAP had varying levels of CCD-sIgE from 0.67 kU/L to 36.52 kU/L. The incidence of CCD interference was predominantly delimited to low-positive IgE results (0.35 kUA/L- 3.00 kUA/L).Falsely elevated diagnostic allergen-sIgE results can commonly occur due to the presence of CCD-sIgE using assays that employ a carbohydrate matrix-based allergosorbent. Even the use of non-glycosylated recombinant allergenic components coupled to cellulose matrices do not reduce their risk of detection. The risk of CCD interference that compromises quantitative IgE results can be mitigated by the addition of a soluble CCD inhibitor to positive CCD-sIgE containing sera or by alternatively using a non-cellulose based sIgE assay, such as the NOVEOS assay."
https://openalex.org/W3018973696,"Background Rwanda conducted a national tuberculosis (TB) prevalence survey to determine the magnitude of TB in the country and determine to what extent the national surveillance system captures all TB cases. In addition we measured the patient diagnostic rate, comparing the measured TB burden data with the routine surveillance data to gain insight into how well key population groups are being detected. Methods A national representative nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted in 73 clusters in 2012 whereby all enrolled participants (residents aged 15 years and above) were systematically screened for TB by symptoms and chest X-ray (CXR). Those with either clinical symptoms (cough of any duration) and/or CXR abnormalities suggestive of TB disease were requested to provide two sputum samples (one spot and one morning) for smear examination and solid culture. Results Of the 45,058 eligible participants, 43,779 were enrolled in the survey. Participation rate was high at 95.7% with 99.8% of participants undergoing both screening procedures and 99.0% of those eligible for sputum examination submitting at least one sputum sample. Forty cases of prevalent mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and 16 mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT) cases were detected during the survey. Chest x-ray as screening tool had 3 and 5 times greater predictive odds for smear positive and bacteriological confirmed TB than symptom screening alone respectively. A TB prevalence of 74.1 (95% CI 48.3–99.3) per 100,000 adult population for smear positive TB and 119.3 (95% CI 78.8–159.9) per 100,000 adult population for bacteriological confirmed MTB was estimated for Rwanda. Conclusions The survey findings indicated a lower TB prevalence than previously estimated by WHO providing key lessons for national TB control, calling for more sensitive screening and diagnostic tools and a focus on key populations. Use of chest x-ray as screening tool was introduced to improve the diagnostic yield of TB."
https://openalex.org/W3020230417,"Connexin37 (Cx37) forms intercellular channels between endothelial cells (EC), and contributes to coordinate the motor tone of vessels. We investigated the contribution of this protein during physiological angiogenesis. We show that, compared to WT littermates, mice lacking Cx37 (Cx37−/−) featured (i) a decreased extension of the superficial vascular plexus during the first 4 days after birth; (ii) an increased vascular density at the angiogenic front at P6, due to an increase in the proliferative rate of EC and in the sprouting of the venous compartment, as well as to a somewhat displaced position of tip cells; (iii) a decreased coverage of newly formed arteries and veins by mural cells; (iv) altered ERK-dependent endothelial cells proliferation through the EphB4 signaling pathway, which is involved in the specification of veins and arteries. In vitro studies documented that, in the absence of Cx37, human venous EC (HUVEC) released less platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and more Angiopoietin-2, two molecules involved in the recruitment of mural cells. Treatment of mice with DAPT, an inhibitor of the Notch pathway, decreased the expression of Cx37, and partially mimicked in WT retinas, the alterations observed in Cx37−/− mice. Thus, Cx37 contributes to (i) the early angiogenesis of retina, by interacting with the Notch pathway; (ii) the growth and maturation of neo-vessels, by modulating tip, stalk, and mural cells; (iii) the regulation of arteriovenous specification, thus, representing a novel target for treatments of retina diseases."

The HIV epidemiology in South Africa reveals stark age and gender disparities, with young women being the most vulnerable to HIV acquisition in 2017. Evaluation of HIV exposure is a challenge in HIV prevention research. Intermittent in-clinic interviewer-administered risk behaviour assessments are utilised but may be limited by social desirability and recall biases. We piloted a mobile phone application for daily self-report of sexual risk behaviour in fifty 18–25 year old women at risk of HIV infection enrolled in HIV Vaccine Trials Network 915 (HVTN 915) in Soweto, South Africa. Through a mixed-methods investigation, we explored barriers and facilitators to completing daily mobile phone surveys among HVTN 915 study participants and staff.


Methods 
We analysed quantitative data on barriers and facilitators to mobile phone study completion collected during the larger HVTN 915 study as well as two post-study focus group discussions (FGDs) with fifteen former participants with a median age of 24 years (IQR 23–25) and six individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) with HVTN 915 staff. FGDs and IDIs utilised semi-structured interview guides, were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated to English. After coding, thematic analysis was performed.


Results 
The main facilitator for daily mobile phone survey completion assessed across 336 follow-up visits for 49 participants was the daily short message system (SMS) reminders (93%, 312/336). Across 336 visits, 31/49 (63%) retained participants reported barriers to completion of daily mobile phone surveys: forgetting (20%, 12/49), being too busy (19%, 11/49) and the survey being an inconvenience (15%, 9/49). Five main themes were identified during the coding of IDIs and FGDs: (1) facilitators of mobile phone survey completion, such as daily SMS reminders and follow up calls for non-completers; (2) barriers to mobile phone survey completion, including partner, time-related and technical barriers; (3) power of incentives; (4) response bias in providing sensitive information, and (5) recommendations for future mobile phone based interventions.


Conclusion 
Despite our enthusiasm to use innovation to optimise sexual risk assessments, technical and practical solutions are required to improve implementation. We recommend further engagement with participants to optimise this approach and to further understand social desirability bias and study incentives in sexual risk reporting."
https://openalex.org/W3017832826,"Resilience contributes to the recovery of disaster victims. The resilience of Tibetan adolescents after the Yushu earthquake has not been properly studied. This study aimed to examine the current resilience and associated factors in Tibetan adolescent survivors in the hardest-hit area 5 years after the Yushu earthquake. This cross-sectional survey was conducted in the area hit the hardest by the Yushu earthquake. Data were collected from 4681 respondents in October and November 2015. Measurements included the participant characteristics, traumatic earthquake experience, the Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC), and the social support appraisals (SS-A) scale. The individual datasets were randomized as 80% for the training set and 20% for the validation set. The mean resilience score of the Tibetan adolescent survivors was 55.0±12.3. Thirteen variables were entered into the regression equation. The three dimensions of social support (from family, from friends, from others than family/friends) were positively associated with resilience (all P<0.05), among which support from others than family/friends was the strongest (r = 0.388, P<0.001). Academic performance, activeness of participation in school activities, harmonious relationship with teachers/classmates, health over the last year, and regular physical exercise were positively associated with resilience (all P<0.05). Being female and being extremely worried about their own lives were negatively associated with resilience (both P<0.05). In conclusion, among Tibetan adolescent survivors to the Yushu earthquake of 2010, support from others than family/friends was the strongest positive factor associated with resilience, while being female and extreme worry about their own lives were negative factors. These results expand our knowledge regarding resilience in Tibetan adolescent disaster survivors."
https://openalex.org/W3019172384,"The Assam Roofed Turtle, Pangshura sylhetensis is an endangered and least studied species endemic to India and Bangladesh. The present study decodes the first complete mitochondrial genome of P. sylhetensis (16,568 bp) by using next-generation sequencing. The assembly encodes 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and one control region (CR). Most of the genes were encoded on the majority strand, except NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (nad6) and eight tRNAs. All PCGs start with an ATG initiation codon, except for Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (nad5), which both start with GTG codon. The study also found the typical cloverleaf secondary structures in most of the predicted tRNA structures, except for serine (trnS1) which lacks of conventional DHU arm and loop. Both Bayesian and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic inference using 13 concatenated PCGs demonstrated strong support for the monophyly of all 52 Testudines species within their respective families and revealed Batagur trivittata as the nearest neighbor of P. sylhetensis. The mitogenomic phylogeny with other amniotes is congruent with previous research, supporting the sister relationship of Testudines and Archosaurians (birds and crocodilians). Additionally, the mitochondrial Gene Order (GO) analysis indicated plesiomorphy with the typical vertebrate GO in most of the Testudines species."
https://openalex.org/W3017482633,"Background Higher levels of hospital admissions among people with lower socioeconomic level, including immigrants, have been observed in developed countries. In Europe, immigrants present a more frequent use of emergency services compared to the native population. The aim of our study was to evaluate the socioeconomic and citizenship differences in the hospitalisation of the adult population in Italy. Methods The study was conducted using the database created by the record linkage between the National Health Interview Survey (2005) with the National Hospital Discharge Database (2005–2014). 79,341 individuals aged 18–64 years were included. The outcomes were acute hospital admissions, urgent admissions and length of stay (1–7 days, > = 8 days). Education level, occupational status, self-perceived economic resources and migratory status were considered as socioeconomic determinants. A multivariate proportional hazards model for recurrent events was used to estimate the risk of total hospital admissions. Logistic models were used to estimate the risk of urgent hospitalisation as well as of length of stay. Results Low education level, the lack of employment and negative self-perceived economic resources were conditions associated with the risk of hospitalisation, a longer hospital stay and greater recourse to urgent hospitalisation. Foreigners had a lower risk of hospitalisation (HR = 0.75; 95% CI:0.68–0.83) but a higher risk of urgent hospitalisation (OR = 1.36; 95% CI:1.18–1.55) and more frequent hospitalisations with a length of stay of at least eight days (OR = 1.19; 95% CI:1.02–1.40). Conclusions To improve equity in access, effective primary, secondary and tertiary prevention strategies must be strengthened, as should access to appropriate levels of care."
https://openalex.org/W3019018094,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative γ-proteobacterium that forms part of the normal human microbiota and it is also an opportunistic pathogen, responsible for 30% of all nosocomial urinary tract infections. P. aeruginosa carries a highly branched respiratory chain that allows the colonization of many environments, such as the urinary tract, catheters and other medical devices. P. aeruginosa respiratory chain contains three different NADH dehydrogenases (complex I, NQR and NDH-2), whose physiologic roles have not been elucidated, and up to five terminal oxidases: three cytochrome c oxidases (COx), a cytochrome bo3 oxidase (CYO) and a cyanide-insensitive cytochrome bd-like oxidase (CIO). In this work, we studied the composition of the respiratory chain of P. aeruginosa cells cultured in Luria Broth (LB) and modified artificial urine media (mAUM), to understand the metabolic adaptations of this microorganism to the growth in urine. Our results show that the COx oxidases play major roles in mAUM, while P. aeruginosa relies on CYO when growing in LB medium. Moreover, our data demonstrate that the proton-pumping NQR complex is the main NADH dehydrogenase in both LB and mAUM. This enzyme is resistant to HQNO, an inhibitory molecule produced by P. aeruginosa, and may provide an advantage against the natural antibacterial agents produced by this organism. This work offers a clear picture of the composition of this pathogen’s aerobic respiratory chain and the main roles that NQR and terminal oxidases play in urine, which is essential to understand its physiology and could be used to develop new antibiotics against this notorious multidrug-resistant microorganism."
https://openalex.org/W3019635606,"Background Extreme pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) values have been associated with reduced fecundability and prolonged time to pregnancy in previous studies. However, the effect in fertile couples is unclear. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the association between pre-pregnancy BMI and fecundability, measured as time to pregnancy (TTP), among couples that achieved pregnancy within 1 year. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of 50,927 couples wishing to conceive, enrolled in the National Free Preconception Health Examination Project (NFPHEP) in Chongqing, China, during 2012–2016. Participants’ weight and height were measured by NFPHEP-trained preconception guidance physicians. TTP measured in months was used to determine subfecundity (TTP >6 months). The strength of association between BMI and TTP/subfecundity was measured with fecundability odds ratios (FOR)/odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), calculated with Cox and logistic regression analysis. We used restricted cubic spline regression (RCS) to test the observed FOR trends. Results Compared to women with normal BMI, women with pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity had longer TTP (FOR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94–0.99) and increased risk of subfecundity (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00–1.17). There was no association between TTP and male BMI. RCS trends varied when data were stratified by male pre-pregnancy BMI, with the greatest change detected in pre-pregnancy underweight men. Conclusions Pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity was associated with longer TTP and subfecundity among women who became pregnant within 1 year; this effect was likely mediated by their partners’ pre-pregnancy BMI. These findings indicate that BMI could affect fecundability, independently of affecting the risk of sterility. Advice on weight management and maintaining healthy weight should be included in couples’ preconception guidance."
https://openalex.org/W3017853578,"The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL10) is essential for attenuating inflammatory responses, which includes reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory microRNA-155 (miR155) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activated macrophages. miR155 enhances the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and suppresses expression of anti-inflammatory molecules such as SHIP1 and SOCS1. We previously found that IL10 interfered with the maturation of pre-miR155 to miR155. To understand the mechanism by which IL10 interferes with pre-miR155 maturation we isolated proteins that associate with pre-miR155 in response to IL10 in macrophages. We identified CELF2, a member of the CUGBP, ELAV-Like Family (CELF) family of RNA binding proteins, as protein whose association with pre-miR155 increased in IL10 treated cells. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockdown of CELF2 impaired IL10’s ability to inhibit both miR155 expression and TNFα expression."
https://openalex.org/W3018035824,"We conducted a cross sectional survey in Zimbabwe to describe urban-rural disparity in socio-demographic characteristics and sexual behaviors of HIV-positive adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and their male sexual partners. Between September and November 2016, we interviewed 360 sexually active HIV positive AGYW, aged 15--24 years attending ART and PMTCT clinics in urban and rural health facilities in Harare and Mazowe district respectively. HIV positive AGYW in rural areas as compared to those in urban areas were older, less educated, more frequently married or cohabiting, had lower number of male sexual partners in their lifetime and in the last 12 months preceding the survey. They were mostly heterosexually infected, more likely to disclose their status to a family member and to be more adherent to ART (OR = 2.5-95% CI = 1.1-5.5). Most recent male sexual partners of HIV positive AGYW in urban areas as compared to those from rural areas were mainly current or former boyfriends, single, more educated, less likely to have a child with them and to engage in couple voluntary counseling and testing (CVCT). They were more likely to patronize dancing and drinking venues and involved in transactional sex (OR = 2.2-95% CI: 1.2-4). They were also more likely to be circumcised (OR = 2.3-95% CI: 1.3-4.1) and to use condom more consistently in the last 12 months preceding the survey. Our study findings called for the strengthening of HIV prevention interventions in urban areas among HIV positive AGYW who had more than one partner in their lifetime or are patronizing dancing and drinking venues. In Zimbabwe, promotion of CVCT, index testing, male circumcision and condom use should be sustained to engage male sexual partners of both urban and rural HIV positive AGYW in HIV prevention."

PT, as well as rate of torque development and impulse during the early (0-50 ms; RTD0-50, IMP0-50) and late (100-200 ms; RTD100-200, IMP100-200) contraction phases were calculated. Torque at 50 (TQ50), 100 (TQ100), and 200 (TQ200) ms was also obtained. CSA and echo-intensity (EI) of the gastrocnemii were acquired via ultrasonography. Torque variables were normalized to PT and CSA. Rate of EMG rise (RER) for the medial gastrocnemius was calculated at 30, 50 and 75 ms.TQ100 (MM = 69.71 ± 16.85 vs. OM = 55.99 ± 18.54 Nm; p = 0.046), TQ200 (MM = 114.76 ± 26.79 vs. OM = 91.56 ± 28.10 Nm; p = 0.031), and IMP100-200 (MM = 4.79 ± 1.11 vs. OM = 3.83 ± 1.17 Nm·s; p = 0.032) were lower in OM. PT, TQ50, RTD0-50, IMP0-50, RTD100-200, RER, CSA, and EI were similar between groups (p > 0.05). No differences were found for normalized torque variables (p > 0.05). EI was moderately associated with normalized torque parameters only (r = -0.38 --0.45). RER, at 75 ms, was moderately correlated with early, absolute torque measures and rapid torque variables made relative to PT and CSA (r = 0.41 --0.64).Late rapid torque parameters of the PFs were preferentially impaired in OM compared to MM, and PT as well as CSA appeared to mediate this result."
https://openalex.org/W3019220954,"Recent studies suggest that both high and low levels of vitamin B12 (vitB12) may have negative health impacts. We measured VitB12 in patients with the Neurodevelopmental disorders (ND) (n = 222), comprised of Autism Spectrum Disorders, specific Developmental disorders, and Intellectual Disability (aged 2-53 years), schizophrenia (n = 401), and healthy controls (HC) (n = 483). Age-and gender-adjusted vitB12 z-scores were calculated by comparisons with a reference population (n = 76 148). We found higher vitB12 in ND (median 420 pmol/L, mean z-score: 0.30) than in HC (316 pmol/L, z-score: 0.06, P < .01) and schizophrenia (306 pmol/L, z-score: −0.02, P < .001), which was significant after adjusting for age, gender, vitB12 supplement, folate, hemoglobin, leukocytes, liver, and kidney function (P < .02). In ND, 20% (n = 44) had vitB12 above 650 pmol/L, and 1% (n = 3) had below 150 pmol/L (common reference limits). In 6.3% (n = 14) of ND, vitB12 was above 2SD of mean in the age-and gender-adjusted reference population, which was more frequent than in HC (n = 8, 1.6%), OR: 4.0, P = .001. Low vitB12 was equally frequent as in HC, and vitB12 z-scores were equal across the age groups. To conclude, vitB12 was higher in ND than in HC and schizophrenia, suggesting a specific feature of ND, which warrants further studies to investigate the underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3017397440,"Stored muscle carbohydrate supply and energetic efficiency constrain muscle functional capacity during exercise and are influenced by common physiological variables (e.g. age, diet, and physical activity level). Whether these constraints affect overall functional capacity or the timing of muscle energetic failure during acute hypoxia is not known. We interrogated skeletal muscle contractile properties in two anatomically distinct rodent hindlimb muscles that have well characterized differences in energetic efficiency (locomotory- extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and postural- soleus muscles) following a 24 hour fasting period that resulted in substantially reduced muscle carbohydrate supply. 180 mins of acute hypoxia resulted in complete energetic failure in all muscles tested, indicated by: loss of force production, substantial reductions in total adenosine nucleotide pool intermediates, and increased adenosine nucleotide degradation product—inosine monophosphate (IMP). These changes occurred in the absence of apparent myofiber structural damage assessed histologically by both transverse section and whole mount. Fasting and the associated reduction of the available intracellular carbohydrate pool (~50% decrease in skeletal muscle) did not significantly alter the timing to muscle functional impairment or affect the overall force/work capacities of either muscle type. Fasting resulted in greater passive tension development in both muscle types, which may have implications for the design of pre-clinical studies involving optimal timing of reperfusion or administration of precision therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3017658363,"Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription is a limiting step in ribosome biogenesis, crucial for protein synthesis and cell growth—especially at the early stages of embryonic development—and is regulated in a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent manner. Our previous report demonstrated that treatment with mTOR inhibitors during artificial embryonic activation improved the development of embryos derived from somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). We hypothesize that inhibition of ribosome biogenesis in somatic cells facilitates reactivation of embryonic nucleolar establishment and ribosome biogenesis in SCNT embryos. Herein, we show that mTOR inhibitors suppressed ribosome biogenesis in somatic cells, and more importantly, improved development potential of SCNT embryos (blastocyst rate, 34% vs 24%). SCNT embryos derived from drug-treated somatic cells exhibited higher levels of 47S, 18S, and 5S rRNAs, upstream binding factor (UBF) mRNA, ribosomal protein S6; they also improved the rebuilding of the nucleolar ultrastructure. In addition, treatment of donor cells with the RNA polymerase I (Pol I) inhibitor cx5461 caused similar effects on SCNT embryos. These results indicated that transient inhibition of rDNA transcription in donor cells facilitated the establishment of functional nucleoli and improved preimplantation development of SCNT embryos."
https://openalex.org/W3017803529,"Objective The aim of the study was to compare the characteristics of procedures for gynecologic cancers conducted with conventional laparoscopy (CL) or robotically assisted laparoscopy (RAL) in the context of an enhanced recovery program (ERP). Methods This is a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from a cohort study conducted between 2016 (when the ERP was first implemented at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes, a comprehensive cancer center in France) and 2018. We included patients who had undergone minimally invasive surgery for gynecological cancers and followed our ERP. The endpoints were the analysis of postoperative complications, the length of postoperative hospitalization (LPO), and the proportion of combined procedures depending on the approach (RAL or CL). Combined procedures were defined by the association of at least two of the following operative items: hysterectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy, and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Results A total of 362 women underwent either CL (n = 187) or RAL (n = 175) for gynecologic cancers and followed our ERP. The proportion of combined procedures performed by RAL was significantly higher (85/175 [48.6%]) than that performed by CL (23/187 [12.3%]; p < 0.001). The proportions of postoperative complications were similar between the two groups (19.4% versus 17.1%; p = 0.59). Logistic regression analysis revealed a statistically insignificant trend in the association of RAL with a reduced likelihood of an LPO > 3 days after adjusting for predictors of prolonged hospitalization (adjusted OR = 0.573 [0.236–1.388]; p = 0.217). Conclusion Experts from our cancer center preferentially choose RAL to perform gynecologic oncological procedures that present elements of complexity. More studies are needed to determine whether this strategy is efficient in managing complex procedures in the framework of an ERP."
https://openalex.org/W3020418167,"Large-scale emergency assistance programmes in Somalia use a variety of transfer modalities including in-kind food provision, food vouchers, and cash transfers. Evidence is needed to better understand whether and how such modalities differ in reducing the risk of acute malnutrition in vulnerable groups, such as the 800,000 pregnant and lactating women affected by the 2017/18 food crisis.Changes in diet and acute malnutrition status were assessed among pregnant and lactating women receiving similarly sized household transfers over a four-month period (total value of ~US$450 per household) delivered either as food vouchers or as mixed transfers consisting of in-kind food, vouchers, and cash. Baseline and endline comparisons were conducted for 514 women in Wajid, Somalia. Primary study outcomes were Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women, meal frequency, and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), with MUAC<21.0 cm classified as acute malnutrition. Adjusted analyses consisted of difference-in-difference analysis using linear and logistic regression models with inverse probability weighting based on propensity scores to account for the non-randomized design.No significant difference in change in dietary quality was observed between food voucher and mixed transfer recipients; a significant difference in change in mean meal frequency was observed (0.3 meals/day, CI: 0.1-0.5, p = 0.001) and the mixed transfer group had significantly greater meal frequency at endline (p<0.001). Mean MUAC increased significantly among both voucher (0.9cm, CI: 0.6-1.3, p = 0.001) and mixed transfer recipients (1.3cm, CI: 1.1-1.5, p = 0.001) over the intervention period in adjusted analysis, however, the difference in magnitude of change between the two groups was not statistically significant (0.4cm, CI: -0.1-0.08, p = 0.086).Within the context of the 2017/18 Somalia food crisis, the modality of assistance provided to pregnant and lactating women (mixed transfers or food-vouchers) made no difference in preventing acute malnutrition and protecting nutritional status."
https://openalex.org/W3018258968,"The Boolean Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a prototypical NP-complete problem, which has been widely studied due to its significant importance in both theory and applications. Stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms are among the most efficient approximate methods available for solving certain types of SAT instances. The quantitative configuration checking (QCC) heuristic is an effective approach for improving SLS algorithms on solving the SAT problem, resulting in an efficient SLS solver for SAT named Swqcc. In this paper, we focus on combining the QCC heuristic with an aspiration mechanism, and then design a new heuristic called QCCA. On the top of Swqcc, we utilize the QCCA heuristic to develop a new SLS solver dubbed AspiSAT. Through extensive experiments, the results illustrate that, on random 3-SAT instances, the performance of AspiSAT is much better than that of Swqcc and Sparrow, which is an influential and efficient SLS solver for SAT. In addition, we further enhance the original clause weighting schemes employed in Swqcc and AspiSAT, and thus obtain two new SLS solvers called Ptwqcc and AspiPT, respectively. The eperimental results present that both Ptwqcc and AspiPT outperform Swqcc and AspiSAT on random 5-SAT instances, indicating that both QCC and QCCA heuristics are able to cooperate effectively with different clause weighting schemes."

Theory surrounding the impact of welfare advice on stress is lacking; this paper undertakes an in depth exploration of the experiences of stress among welfare advice seekers, considering these in light of existing substantive theories of stress and coping to generate new insight. A thematic analysis explored the experiences of stress in welfare advice seekers. Four overarching themes and twelve subthemes emerged. They are further understood utilising traditional theories of stress (Transactional Model of Stress and Coping and the Conservation of Resources theory), which then underpin the development of a ‘Stress Support Matrix’ and a holistic theory related specifically to welfare, stress and coping."
https://openalex.org/W3017874425,"Vom Rath's organ, located at the distal end of the third segment of the labial palp, is one of the recognized synapomorphies of Lepidoptera (Insecta). Information about the structural and histological morphology of this organ is sparse. The structure of vom Rath's organ in four species of Nymphalidae, three frugivorous: Fountainea ryphea (Charaxinae: Anaeini), Morpho helenor achillaena (Satyrinae: Morphini) and Hamadryas epinome (Biblidinae: Ageroniini), and the nectarivorous species Aeria olena (Danainae: Ithomiini) is described by means of scanning electron microscopy and histology. The species showed significant differences in the cavity shape, setal morphology and arrangement, opening shape and location, associated with the organization of cell groups, type of axon, and degree of development. These differences do not seem to be related to feeding habit. No cell groups were found in Actinote thalia (Heliconiinae: Acraeini) and Heliconius erato phyllis (Heliconiinae: Heliconiini), and for the first time the absence of vom Rath's organ is documented in the clade Ditrysia. A terminology is proposed to improve understanding of the organ morphology, with an extensive analysis of the previous descriptions."
https://openalex.org/W3019566074,"The current political discourse in the United States focuses on extreme political polarization as a contributor to ills ranging from government shutdowns to awkward family holidays. And indeed, a large body of research has documented differences between liberals and conservatives–primarily focused on Republicans and Democrats in the United States. We combine large international surveys and more fine-grained surveys of United States citizens to compare differences in opinion between Republicans and Democrats to the full range of world opinion on moral issues (N = 37,653 in 39 countries) and issues of free speech (N = 40,786 in 38 countries). When viewed in the full distribution, polarization between Democrats and Republicans appears relatively small, even on divisive issues such as abortion, sexual preference, and freedom of religious speech. The average Democrat-Republic overlap is greater than 70% of the country pair overlaps across eight moral issues, meaning that 70% of the country pairs are more dissimilar from each other than Democrats and Republicans are dissimilar; similarly, the average Democrat-Republic overlap is greater than 79% of the country pair overlaps across five freedom of speech issues. These results suggest that cross-cultural comparisons are useful for putting differences between political partisans within the same country in context."
