https://openalex.org/W2003022327,"Female canaries exposed to playback of large repertoires of male songs built nests faster and laid more eggs than did those females exposed to smaller song repertoires: females are attentive to attributes of male song, and their choices have played a role in the evolution of oscine singing behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2070514409,"Scanning electron micrographs demonstrate the presence of microcrystalline structures on the surface of coal-derived fly ash samples taken from electrostatic precipitator hoppers. Cenospheres (hollow spheres) were found to be packed with smaller cenospheres, which were also packed with spheres. Microspheres, apparently formed by uneven heating, are encapsulated in the parent sphere. Chemical analyses provide a basis for the postulation of a mechanism of formation for plerospheres (hollow spheres packed with spheres) and microcrystals."
https://openalex.org/W1974312262,"Inorganic and organic components of the gaseous tropospheric halogens chlorine, bromine, and iodine have been simultaneously measured. At four diverse remote locations the organic component contained the bulk of the halogen mass, varied less than the inorganic component, and was comparable in concentration to the independently measured halocarbon component."
https://openalex.org/W2060557466,"Kinetin induces formation of red pigment in seedlings of Amaranthus retroflexus in the dark. This effect is similar to the light-induced formation of pigment. Light and kinetin do not act in a simple additive way. The pigment is not an anthocyanin, and its formation is not affected by inhibitors of anthocyanin formation."
https://openalex.org/W2037553428,Chemical mass balance between igneous and sedimentary rocks is calculated by using a linear least squares method in which all chemical variables are evaluated simultaneously. Previous estimates of the average chemical composition of sedimentary rocks have shown excess calcium because of failure to accurately represent the composition and mass of pelagic sediments.
https://openalex.org/W2025718588,"A mechanism for producing an 11-year oscillation in ozone over the polar caps is the modulation of galactic cosmic rays by the solar wind. This mechanism has been shown to give the observed phase in ozone oscillations and the correct qualitative dependence on latitude. However, the production of nitrogen atoms from cosmic-ray collisions seems inadequate to account for the ozone amplitude. Negative ions are also produced as a result of cosmic-ray ionization, and negative-ion chemistry may be of importance in the stratosphere. Specifically, NO(x)(-) may go through a catalytic cycle in much the same fashion as NO(x), but with the important distinction that it does not depend on oxygen atoms to complete the cycle. Estimates of the relevant rates of reaction suggest that negative ions may be especially important over the winter polar cap."
https://openalex.org/W2025414365,"Calculated surface temperature changes, DeltaT(8), due to stratospheric ozone depletion (at 35 degrees N latitude in April) are less than previously estimated and range between -0.6 and +0.9 degrees K. The sign of DeltaT(8), is determined by the surface albedo and the presence or absence of a low-lying particulate layer (heating with particles, cooling without particles). The calculations indicate that a 90 percent stratospheric ozone depletion does not cause the temperature inversion at the tropopause to vanish, although it is weakened substantially."
https://openalex.org/W2019133718,"BS>A discussion is given of phenomena in which the absorption or emission of energy is clearly demonstrable as initiating or terminating a sequence of biochemical events. The events resulting from natural, ultraviolet, and highenergy radiation processes are compared. The energytransfer mechanisms of biochemical events are discussed. The physical mechanisms of the irradiation- induced phenomena of photodynamic action and photoreactivation are discussed. (C.J.G.)"
