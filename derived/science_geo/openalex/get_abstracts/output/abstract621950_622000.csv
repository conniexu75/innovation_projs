https://openalex.org/W2900166205,"Background The purpose of this study was to build a model of machine learning (ML) for the prediction of mortality in patients with isolated moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods Hospitalized adult patients registered in the Trauma Registry System between January 2009 and December 2015 were enrolled in this study. Only patients with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score ≥ 3 points related to head injuries were included in this study. A total of 1734 (1564 survival and 170 non-survival) and 325 (293 survival and 32 non-survival) patients were included in the training and test sets, respectively. Results Using demographics and injury characteristics, as well as patient laboratory data, predictive tools (e.g., logistic regression [LR], support vector machine [SVM], decision tree [DT], naive Bayes [NB], and artificial neural networks [ANN]) were used to determine the mortality of individual patients. The predictive performance was evaluated by accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as by area under the curve (AUC) measures of receiver operator characteristic curves. In the training set, all five ML models had a specificity of more than 90% and all ML models (except the NB) achieved an accuracy of more than 90%. Among them, the ANN had the highest sensitivity (80.59%) in mortality prediction. Regarding performance, the ANN had the highest AUC (0.968), followed by the LR (0.942), SVM (0.935), NB (0.908), and DT (0.872). In the test set, the ANN had the highest sensitivity (84.38%) in mortality prediction, followed by the SVM (65.63%), LR (59.38%), NB (59.38%), and DT (43.75%). Conclusions The ANN model provided the best prediction of mortality for patients with isolated moderate and severe TBI."

The potential of converting water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) charcoal into briquettes with molasses as binder was investigated in this study. Dried water hyacinth was carbonized at a temperature between 350°C to 500°C in a fabricated fine biomass carbonizer. A solution containing 80% by weight molasses was used in the production of briquettes having different charcoal/molasses ratios of 40:60, 30:70, and 20:80. Each briquette was characterized in terms of bulk density, calorific value, compressive strength, proximate analysis and micro-structure by Scanning Electron Microscopy. Charcoal briquettes were tested for their flammable characteristics through their burning rates and ignition time. Altering the molasses to charcoal ratio affected the quality and characteristics of the briquettes. Volatile combustible matter and fixed carbon increased with increasing amount of binder while ash content decreased. The 30:70 charcoal/molasses ratio produced the highest calorific value (16.6 MJ/kg) and compressive strength (19.1 kg/cm2). The results have shown the potential of converting water hyacinth into an alternative fuel source."
https://openalex.org/W2900261005,"Coagulation activation and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are hallmarks of cancer; however, there is an unmet need of improved biomarkers for individualized anticoagulant treatment. The present sub-study of the RASTEN trial was designed to explore the role of coagulation biomarkers in predicting VTE risk and outcome in a homogenous cancer patient population. RASTEN is a multicenter, randomized phase-3 trial investigating the survival effect of low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin when added to standard treatment in newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Plasma collected at baseline, during treatment, and at follow-up was used in this ad hoc sub-study (N = 242). Systemic coagulation was assessed using four assays reflecting various facets of the coagulation system: Total tissue factor (TF); extracellular vesicle associated TF (EV-TF); procoagulant phospholipids (PPL); and thrombin generation (TG). We found small variations of biomarker levels between baseline, during treatment and at follow-up, and appeared independent on low molecular weight heparin treatment. Overall, none of the measured biomarkers at any time-point did significantly associate with VTE incidence, although increased total TF at baseline showed significant association in control patients not receiving low molecular weight heparin (P = 0.03). Increased TG-Peak was significantly associated with decreased overall survival (OS; P = 0.03), especially in patients with extensive disease. Low baseline EV-TF predicted a worse survival in the low molecular weight heparin as compared with the control group (HR 1.42; 95% CI 1.04-1.95; P = 0.03; P for interaction = 0.12). We conclude that the value of the analyzed coagulation biomarkers for the prediction of VTE risk was very limited in SCLC patients. The associations between TG-Peak and EV-TF with patient survival and response to low molecular weight heparin therapy, respectively, warrant further studies on the role of coagulation activation in SCLC aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2899750794,"This paper develops a new machine vision framework for efficient detection and classification of manufacturing defects in metal boxes. Previous techniques, which are based on either visual inspection or on hand-crafted features, are both inaccurate and time consuming. In this paper, we show that by using autoencoder deep neural network (DNN) architecture, we are able to not only classify manufacturing defects, but also localize them with high accuracy. Compared to traditional techniques, DNNs are able to learn, in a supervised manner, the visual features that achieve the best performance. Our experiments on a database of real images demonstrate that our approach overcomes the state-of-the-art while remaining computationally competitive."
https://openalex.org/W2900418812,"To investigate the effects of different recovery strategies on fatigue markers following a prolonged running exercise.46 recreational male runners completed a half-marathon, followed by active recovery (ACT), cold water immersion (CWI), massage (MAS) or passive recovery (PAS). Countermovement jump height, muscle soreness and perceived recovery and stress were measured 24h before the half-marathon (pre), immediately after the recovery intervention (postrec) and 24h after the race (post24). In addition, muscle contractile properties and blood markers of fatigue were determined at pre and post24.Magnitude-based inferences revealed substantial differences in the changes between the groups. At postrec, ACT was harmful to perceived recovery (ACT vs. PAS: effect size [ES] = -1.81) and serum concentration of creatine kinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = 0.42), with CWI being harmful to jump performance (CWI vs. PAS: ES = -0.98). It was also beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI vs. PAS: ES = -0.88) and improving perceived stress (CWI vs. PAS: ES = -0.64), with MAS being beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (MAS vs. PAS: ES = -0.52) and improving perceived recovery (MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.00). At post24, both CWI and MAS were still beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI vs. PAS: ES = 1.49; MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.12), with ACT being harmful to perceived recovery (ACT vs. PAS: ES = -0.68), serum concentration of creatine kinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = 0.84) and free-testosterone (ACT vs. PAS: ES = -0.91).In recreational runners, a half-marathon results in fatigue symptoms lasting at least 24h. To restore subjective fatigue measures, the authors recommend CWI and MAS, as these recovery strategies are more effective than PAS, with ACT being even disadvantageous. However, runners must be aware that neither the use of ACT nor CWI or MAS had any beneficial effect on objective fatigue markers."

Given the limited success of angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, in clinical trials, it is important to find more promising angiogenic targets. Here, using both cell- and tissue-based assays and a mouse model of injury-induced ischemia, we investigated the involvement of the transient receptor potential canonical 5 (TRPC5) ion channel in angiogenesis and the effects of a TRPC5 activator, the Food and Drug Administration–approved drug riluzole, on recovery from ischemic injury. We demonstrate that TRPC5 is involved in endothelial cell sprouting, angiogenesis, and blood perfusion in an oxygen-induced retinopathy model and a hind limb ischemia model. We found a potential regulatory link between nuclear factor of activated T cell isoform c3 and angiopoietin-1 that could provide the mechanistic basis for the angiogenic function of TRPC5. Importantly, treatment with riluzole, which can activate TRPC5 in endothelial cells, improved recovery from ischemia in mice. Our study reveals TRPC5 as a potential angiogenic target and suggests riluzole as a promising drug for managing ischemic diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2899767232,"Brief moments of blood flow occlusion followed by reperfusion may promote enhancements in exercise performance. Thus, this study assessed the 24-h effect of post-exercise ischemic conditioning (PEIC) on exercise performance and physiological variables in trained cyclists. In a randomized, single-blind study, 28 trained cyclists (27.1 ± 1.4 years) performed a maximal incremental cycling test (MICT). The outcome measures were creatine kinase (CK), muscle soreness and perceived recovery status, heart rate, perceived exertion and power output. Immediately after the MICT, the cyclists performed 1 of the following 4 interventions: 2 sessions of 5-min occlusion/5-min reperfusion (PEIC or SHAM, 2 x 5) or 5 sessions of 2-min occlusion/2-min reperfusion (PEIC or SHAM, 5 x 2). The PEIC (50 mm Hg above the systolic blood pressure) or SHAM (20 mm Hg) treatment was applied unilaterally on alternating thighs. At 24 h after the interventions, a second MICT was performed. In all the groups, the CK levels were increased compared with the baseline (p < 0.05) after the 24-h MICT. The PEIC groups (2 x 5 and 5 x 2) felt more tired at 24 h post intervention (p < 0.05). However, both PEIC groups maintained their performance (2 x 5: p = 0.819; 5 x 2: p = 0.790), while the SHAM groups exhibited decreased performance at 24 h post intervention compared to baseline (2 x 5: p = 0.015; 5 x 2: p = 0.045). A decrease in the maximal heart rate (HR) was found only in the SHAM 2 x 5 group (p = 0.015). There were no other significant differences in the heart rate, power output or perceived exertion after 24 h compared with the baseline values for any of the interventions (p > 0.05). In conclusion, PEIC led to maintained exercise performance 24 h post intervention in trained cyclists."
https://openalex.org/W2900296445,"Microbes colonizing colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors have the potential to affect disease, and vice-versa. The manner in which they differ from microbes in physically adjacent tissue or stool within the case in terms of both, taxonomy and biological activity remains unclear. In this study, we systematically analyzed previously published 16S rRNA sequence data from CRC patients with matched tumor:tumor-adjacent biopsies (n = 294 pairs, n = 588 biospecimens) and matched tumor biopsy:fecal pairs (n = 42 pairs, n = 84 biospecimens). Procrustes analyses, random effects regression, random forest (RF) modeling, and inferred functional pathway analyses were conducted to assess community similarity and microbial diversity across heterogeneous patient groups and studies. Our results corroborate previously reported association of increased Fusobacterium with tumor biopsies. Parvimonas and Streptococcus abundances were also elevated while Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcaceae abundances decreased in tumors relative to tumor-adjacent biopsies and stool samples from the same case. With the exception of these limited taxa, the majority of findings from individual studies were not confirmed by other 16S rRNA gene-based datasets. RF models comparing tumor and tumor-adjacent specimens yielded an area under curve (AUC) of 64.3%, and models of tumor biopsies versus fecal specimens exhibited an AUC of 82.5%. Although some taxa were shared between fecal and tumor samples, their relative abundances varied substantially. Inferred functional analysis identified potential differences in branched amino acid and lipid metabolism. Microbial markers that reliably occur in tumor tissue can have implications for microbiome based and microbiome targeting therapeutics for CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2899542121,"Background Previous studies have shown a relation between intimate partner violence (IPV) and postpartum depression (PPD). However, these studies have primarily focused on physical and sexual violence as predictors for postpartum depression and little attention has been given to emotional violence (EV), despite emotional violence having been well reported as the most common type of violence experienced by women. This present study aimed to investigate the association between various types of emotional experience during life with present partner and postnatal depressive symptoms among women in Vietnam. Methods A total of 1,274 pregnant women were recruited from 24 communities in the Dong Anh District, Hanoi, Vietnam. They were interviewed four times: (a) at enrolment (before week 24 of pregnancy); (b) at a gestational age of 30–34 weeks; (c) 24–48 hours after delivery; and (d) 4–12 weeks after delivery. Emotional violence and postnatal depressive symptoms were measured using a questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), respectively. Results A total of 639 (50.4%) women experienced at least one type of emotional violence with their present partner, whereas 104 women (8.2%) experienced postnatal depressive symptoms. Women exposed to emotional violence were more likely to experience postnatal depressive symptoms (OR = 3.15; 95%CI: 1.17–8.51). Other statistically significant predictors of increased postnatal depressive symptoms included type of employment, lack of family support after delivery, lower level of education, husband’s preference for a specific sex of child, presence of mental disorder, and depression during pregnancy. Conclusions Among Vietnamese women, there was a statistically significant association between exposure to emotional violence with their present partner and postpartum depression. The findings indicate an urgent need for screening for all acts of emotional violence as risk factors for postnatal depressive symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2899863167,"The unique nucleolar environment, the repetitive nature of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), and especially the possible involvement of RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) in transcription-coupled repair (TCR) have made the study of repair of rDNA both interesting and challenging. TCR, the transcription-dependent, preferential excision repair of the template strand compared with the nontranscribed (coding) strand has been clearly demonstrated in genes transcribed by RNAPII. Whether TCR occurs in rDNA is unresolved. In the present work, we have applied analytical methods to map repair events in rDNA using data generated by the newly developed XR-seq procedure, which measures excision repair genome-wide with single-nucleotide resolution. We find that in human and mouse cell lines, rDNA is not subject to TCR of damage caused by UV or by cisplatin.

https://openalex.org/W2899987101,"Platelet activation has been reported to play a major role in inflammatory response and thrombocytopenia during dengue viral infection. Cells expressing FcϒR2Aand DC-SIGN receptors are reported to be involved in dengue virulence. The present study is designed to assess the expression level of these two receptors on platelet surface collected from dengue patients and to study its association in patients with platelet RNA positive for dengue virus. This was an analytical cross-sectional study carried out in JIPMER hospital, Puducherry. Forty-four patients with dengue infection as cases and 44 patients with non dengue acute other febrile illness(OFI) as controls were recruited. Peripheral venous blood was withdrawn on day of admission, day 3 post admission and day of discharge and serological tests for NS1 dengue antigen and anti IgM antibody were analyzed for diagnosis of dengue infection. Platelet rich plasma was assessed for DC SIGN, FcϒR2A levels and platelets separated from dengue patients were subjected to RNA extraction and detection of presence of viral RNA. The study observed a decreased expression of DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A on platelets in dengue patients compared to OFI group on all the time points. Further, cells expressing DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A were found to be decreased on platelets in dengue patients who were positive for NS1 antigen. DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A expression was also found to be notably decreased in patients positive for platelet DENV RNA when compared with patients negative for platelet DENV RNA. Our results suggest that DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A, which are receptors for viral capture and immune mediated clearance respectively, might be down regulated on platelets in patients with dengue infection. The decreased receptor expression diminishes platelet activation and subsequently has protective action on the host from the ongoing conflict between immune system and dengue virus."
https://openalex.org/W2900168001,"Children in slums are at high risk of acute malnutrition and death. Cost-effectiveness of community-based management of severe acute malnutrition programmes has been demonstrated previously, but there is limited evidence in the context of urban slums where programme cost structure is likely to vary tremendously. This study assessed the cost-utility of adding a community based prevention and treatment for acute malnutrition intervention to Government of India Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) standard care for children in Mumbai slums. The intervention is delivered by community health workers in collaboration with ICDS Anganwadi community health workers. The analysis used a decision tree model to compare the costs and effects of the two options: standard ICDS services with the intervention and prevention versus standard ICDS services alone. The model used outcome and cost data from the Society for Nutrition, Education & Health Action’s Child Health and Nutrition programme in Mumbai slums, which delivered services to 12,362 children over one year from 2013 to 2014. An activity-based cost model was used, with calculated costs based on programme financial records and key informant interviews. Cost data were coupled with programme effectiveness data to estimate disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. The community based prevention and treatment programme averted 15,016 DALYs (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 12,246–17,843) at an estimated cost of $23 per DALY averted (95%UI:19–28) and was thus highly cost-effective. This study shows that ICDS Anganwadi community health workers can work efficiently with community health workers to increase the prevention and treatment coverage in slums in India and can lead to policy recommendations at the state, and potentially the national level, to promote such programmes in Indian slums as a cost-effective approach to tackling moderate and severe acute malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2900407749,"Foxtail millet is very a drought-tolerant crop. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors are involved in many drought-stress responses, but foxtail millet bHLH genes have been scarcely examined. We identified 149 foxtail millet bHLH genes in a genome-wide analysis and performed Swiss-Prot, GO, and KEGG pathway analyses for these genes. Phylogenetic analyses placed the genes into 25 clades, with some remaining orphans. We identified homologs based on gene trees and Swiss-Prot annotation. We also inferred that some homologs underwent positive selection in foxtail millet ancestors, and selected motifs differed among homologs. Expression of eight foxtail millet bHLH genes varied with drought stress. One of these genes was localized to a QTL that contributes to drought tolerance in foxtail millet. We also perform a cis-acting regulatory element analysis on foxtail millet bHLH genes and some drought-induced genes. Foxtail millet bHLH genes were inferred to have a possible key role in drought tolerance. This study clarifies both the function of foxtail millet bHLH genes and drought tolerance in foxtail millet."
https://openalex.org/W2899681357,"The aim of this study was to evaluate hypoxia level at various tumor developmental stages and to compare various methods of hypoxia evaluation in pre-clinical CT26 tumor model. Using three methods of hypoxia determination, we evaluated hypoxia levels during CT26 tumor development in BALB/c mice from day 4 till day 19, in 2–3 days intervals. Molecular method was based on the analysis of selected genes expression related to hypoxia (HIF1A, ANGPTL4, TGFB1, VEGFA, ERBB3, CA9) or specific for inflammation in hypoxic sites (CCL2, CCL5) at various time points after CT26 cancer cells inoculation. Imaging methods of hypoxia evaluation included: positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging using [18F]fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO) and a fluorescence microscope imaging of pimonidazole (PIMO)-positive tumor areas at various time points. Our results showed that tumor hypoxia at molecular level was relatively high at early stage of tumor development as reflected by initially high HIF1A and VEGFA expression levels and their subsequent decrease. However, imaging methods (both PET and fluorescence microscopy) showed that hypoxia increased till day 14 of tumor development. Additionally, necrotic regions dominated the tumor tissue at later stages of development, decreasing the number of hypoxic areas and completely eliminating normoxic regions (observed by PET). These results showed that molecular methods of hypoxia determination are more sensitive to show changes undergoing at cellular level, however in order to measure and visualize hypoxia in the whole organ, especially at later stages of tumor development, PET is the preferred tool. Furthermore we concluded, that during development of tumor, two peaks of hypoxia occur."
https://openalex.org/W2900236791,"For proper biofilm formation, bacteria must have mechanisms in place to sense adhesion to surfaces. In Escherichia coli, the CpxAR and RcsCDB systems have been reported to sense surfaces. The CpxAR system is widely considered to be responsible for sensing attachment, specifically to hydrophobic surfaces. Here, using both single-cell and population-level analyses, we confirm RcsCDB activation upon surface contact, but find that the CpxAR system is not activated, in contrast to what had earlier been reported. Thus, the role of CpxAR in surface sensing and initiation of biofilm formation should be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W2899749895,"Background The mobility of birds across or between continents exposes them to numerous vectors that have the potential to transmit pathogens and spread them into new regions. A combination of rich species diversity of birds along with the small amount of molecular studies in Iran makes observing the blood parasite distribution in wild avian populations indispensable for further estimation and administration of blood parasites. Methodology/Principal findings In order to evaluate the infection rate and molecular context of avian blood parasites, bird samples were collected (passerine = 316 and non-passerine = 14) in eight provinces of northern Iran between June to September 2015 and 2016. All bird samples were examined for haematoprotozoan infections by morphological screening using light microscope and mtDNA cytb gene amplification. A total of 115 birds were positive for blood parasites by molecular approach (34.84% overall infection). The infection rate of Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and Leucocytozoon were 33.03%, 1.21%, and 0.6%, respectively. Sequences analysis has detected 43 lineages in Iranian birds’ hosts. Lineages were attributed to three genera Haemoproteus (n = 37), Plasmodium (n = 4), and Leucocytozoon (n = 2), of which 23 lineages fully matched previously recorded sequences in GenBank and MalAvi data reciprocities. Five lineages of ACDUM1, ACDUM2, PARUS1, PYERY01, and SISKIN1 were detected in multiple hosts’ species from dissimilar families. In Bayesian tree, all sequences were clustered in three main monophyletic clades as Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and Leucocytozoon genera. Conclusions/Significance As the first study outlining the molecular detection of hematozoa of passerines from Iran, the current study has recorded 20 new lineages for three genera of Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and Leucocytozoon. Additional investigations into these taxa in the avifauna for the other parts of Iran may provide extra information on blood parasites, hosts relationships and distribution patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2900010998,"EFs are a set of processes that supports many cognitive domains as goal setting, monitoring, planning, and cognitive-behavioural flexible control. Currently, many standardized paper-and-pencil tests or scales are used to assess EFs. These tests are easy to administer, score, and interpret but present some limitations in terms of generalizability of behaviours in real life. More recently, Information and Communication Technology has provided a higher ecological validity in the EFs assessment. In order to increase the ecological validity, we have developed a serious game (SG), named EXPANSE, which aim was to compare the participants' game performance (latency times, and correct answers) with the results obtained in the traditional tasks and scales. 354 healthy subjects participated to the study and the findings showed significant correlations among standard tasks and the serious game. The exploratory nature of the present study, on one hand, highlighted that SG could be an additional behavioral tool to assess EFs and, on the other, we need further investigations, including clinical populations, for better defining the game sensitivity toward EF components. Finally, the results show that serious games are a promising technology for the evaluation of real cognitive behavior along with traditional evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2900381013,"Despite modern chemotherapy regimens, survival of pancreatic cancer patients remains dismal. Toxicity is a major concern and it is a challenge to upfront identify patients with the highest benefit from aggressive polychemotherapy. We aimed to evaluate ORR and side effects of the FOLFIRINOX regimen, highlighting dose modification and to explore possible prognostic response factors as a clinical tool.This retrospective study includes 123 patients with metastatic PC that were treated with FOLFIRINOX between the years 2007 to 2016 in a single academic institution. Survival rates were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic models including laboratory and clinical parameters were calculated using Cox proportional models in univariate and multivariate analyses.Median age at diagnosis was 64 years (47-78 years), 71 (57, 7%) were male and the majority had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (63 patients; 83.7%). After a median follow up of 17.8 months, median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 5.7 (4.55-6.84; 95%CI) and 11.8 months (9.35-14.24; 95%CI) respectively. Overall response rate with FOLFIRINOX was 34.9% and stable disease rate was 21.9%. Regarding Grade 3/4 side effects, 62 events, were reported in 37 patients. Looking at risk factors e.g. patient characteristics, tumor marker, inflammatory markers and body composition multivariate analyses proved CEA >4 elevation and BMI > 25 at the time point before palliative chemotherapy to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS. Grouping patients with no risk factor, one or two of these risk factors we analyzed a median OS of 17.4 moths, 9.6 months and 6.7 months (p<0.001) respectively. In addition we identified thrombocytosis and low BMI as predictors of early toxicity.This study identifies two easily available factors influencing overall survival with FOLFIRINOX therapy. By combining these two factors to create a score for OS, we propose a prognostic tool for physicians to identify patients, who are unlikely to benefit more from FOLFIRINOX or likely to experience toxicity."

Two groups of Xinjiang brown cattle with extremely different intramuscular fat content in the longissimus dorsi were selected for combined of miRNA and mRNA analysis using an RNA-Seq. In total, 296 mRNAs and 362 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed, including 155 newly predicted miRNAs, 275 significantly upregulated genes, 252 significantly upregulated miRNAs, 21 significantly downregulated genes and 110 significantly downregulated miRNAs. The combined miRNA and mRNA analysis identified 96 differentially expressed miRNAs and 27 differentially expressed mRNAs. In all, 47 upregulated miRNAs had a regulatory effect on 14 differentially downregulated target genes, and 49 downregulated miRNAs had a regulatory effect on 13 upregulated target genes. To verify the sequencing results, 10 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 10 differentially expressed miRNAs were selected for qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR results confirmed the sequencing results. The results of this study shed light on the molecular regulation of bovine adipose tissue, which might help with the development of new strategies for improving meat quality and animal productivity in beef cattle to provide healthier meat products for consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2899983944,"Knowledge of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome is essential to understanding the state of human health, as over a hundred diseases have been correlated with changes in microbial populations. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the microbiome and the limitations of in vivo and in vitro experiments, studying spatial and temporal dynamics of gut bacteria in a biological setting is extremely challenging. Thus, in silico experiments present an excellent alternative for studying such systems. In consideration of these issues, we have developed a user-friendly agent-based model, GutLogo, that captures the spatial and temporal development of four representative bacterial genera populations in the ileum. We demonstrate the utility of this model by simulating population responses to perturbations in flow rate, nutrition, and probiotics. While our model predicts distinct changes in population levels due to these perturbations, most of the simulations suggest that the gut populations will return to their original steady states once the disturbance is removed. We hope that, in the future, the GutLogo model is utilized and customized by interested parties, as GutLogo can serve as a basic modeling framework for simulating a variety of physiological scenarios and can be extended to capture additional complexities of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2900043155,"Antimicrobial-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection is a global public health threat, and there is a critical need to monitor patterns of resistance and risk factors. In collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Thailand Department of Disease Control (DDC), Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) implemented the first Enhanced Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (EGASP) in November 2015. Men presenting with urethritis at two clinical settings in Bangkok, Thailand (Bangrak Hospital [BH] and Silom Community Clinic @TropMed [SCC @TropMed]) provided demographic and behavioral information and had a urethral swab for Gram’s stain and NG culture collected. The NG isolates were evaluated for antimicrobial susceptibility by the Epsilometer test (Etest) to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for cefixime (CFM), ceftriaxone (CRO), azithromycin (AZI), gentamicin (GEN), and ciprofloxacin (CIP). From November 2015 –October 2016, 1,102 specimens were collected from 1,026 symptomatic men; 861 (78.1%) specimens were from BH and 241 (21.9%) specimens were from SCC @TropMed. Among the 1,102 specimens, 582 (52.8%) had intracellular Gram-negative diplococci and 591 (53.6%) had NG growth (i.e., NG infection); antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed on 590 (99.8%) NG isolates. Among all symptomatic men, 293 (28.6%) had sex with men only, 430 (41.9%) were ages 18–29 years, 349 (34.0%) had antibiotic use in the last 2 weeks, and 564 (55.0%) had NG infection. Among 23 men with repeat NG infection during this first year of surveillance, 20 (87.0%) were infected twice, 2 (8.7%) were infected three times, and 1 (4.3%) was infected more than four times. All NG isolates were susceptible to CFM and CRO, and had MICs below 2 μg/mL for AZI and below 16 μg/mL for GEN. Overall, 545 (92.4%) isolates were resistant to CIP. This surveillance activity assessed individual patients, and included demographic and behavioral data linked to laboratory data. The inclusion of both individual and laboratory information in EGASP could help identify possible persistent infection and NG treatment failures. Expansion of EGASP to additional global settings is critical to assess trends and risk factors for NG, and to monitor for the emergence of resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2900412667,"Research has indicated that men's facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) is part of an evolved system of social dominance, aggression, and power. fWHR has been linked to antisocial behavior, measured by self-reported aggression, but recent studies have failed to replicate this finding. To overcome these inconsistencies, influencing factors such as social status have to be taken into account in order to explain the relationship between fWHR and aggression. In particular, income has been shown to be an important influencing factor in this relationship. Furthermore, previous findings suggested that testosterone is linked to fWHR and might be associated with fWHR and dominance-related outcomes. Therefore, this study examined the influence of both social status defined by income and salivary testosterone on the association between fWHR and self-reported dominance-related behavioral traits. In particular, links between fWHR and self-report measures of aggression and the Dark Triad (encompassing psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism) were investigated in N = 109 men aged 40 to 75 years. fWHR was significantly associated with physical aggression and two of the Dark Triad traits (psychopathy and Machiavellianism) in men reporting low income. The relationship between fWHR and narcissism was moderated by testosterone. The findings highlight the importance of considering social status and neuroendocrine parameters such as testosterone when examining associations between fWHR and complex psychological traits and behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2899865777,"Individual characteristics often scale allometrically with organismal body size and the form of this scaling can be influenced by ecological and evolutionary factors. Examining the specific form of this scaling can therefore yield important insights into organismal ecology and evolution and the ability of organisms to respond to future environmental changes. We examine the intraspecific allometric scaling of stomach volume with body mass for 17 species of brachyuran crabs. We also examine how this scaling is influenced by dietary strategy, maximum body size, and activity level, all while controlling for phylogenetic relationships between the species. We show that the slope and intercept of the allometric scaling relationships vary across species and are influenced by all three ecological factors examined here, as well as by evolutionary relationships. These results highlight potential divergent strategies in stomach growth taken by different groups of crabs and highlight potential limitations that may be imposed on the ability of this group of organisms to respond to warming trends expected with climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2899928124,"Unauthorised feeding and touching of the animals by visitors to zoos and wildlife parks pose serious threats to the health of both animals and visitors alike. We tested the efficacy of four different ""do not feed"" signs designed to prevent zoo visitors from feeding a group of meerkats. Signs consisted of one of two different written messages and imagery of either a pair of watching human eyes, or meerkat pawprints as a control. Covert observation of visitor behaviour in the presence and absence of the signs was analysed. Visitors were significantly less likely to feed the meerkats when signs were present, than when they were absent. The effect of the signs was specific to the targeted behaviour in that feeding was reduced, but attempts to touch the meerkats increased with the presence of the signs. We did not find that the presence of watching eyes or the different wording on the signs affected the likelihood of visitors feeding the meerkats. We also examined factors that influenced the likelihood of visitors attending to the signs. We found that children were more likely to attend to signs than adults which has important implications for the design of such signs. Together our findings show that signs are effective in reducing the unwanted behaviours they target but may also result in displacement of these negative behaviours and that children are more likely to attend to these signs than adults."
https://openalex.org/W2899964425,"Environmental signals mediated via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) shape the developing immune system and influence immune function. Developmental exposure to AHR binding chemicals causes persistent changes in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses later in life, including dampened clonal expansion and differentiation during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Naïve T cells require activation by dendritic cells (DCs), and AHR ligands modulate the function of DCs from adult organisms. Yet, the consequences of developmental AHR activation by exogenous ligands on DCs later in life has not been examined. We report here that early life activation of AHR durably reduces the ability of DC to activate naïve IAV-specific CD8+ T cells; however, activation of naïve CD4+ T cells was not impaired. Also, DCs from developmentally exposed offspring migrated more poorly than DCs from control dams in both in vivo and ex vivo assessments of DC migration. Conditional knockout mice, which lack Ahr in CD11c lineage cells, suggest that dampened DC emigration is intrinsic to DCs. Yet, levels of chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), a key regulator of DC trafficking, were generally unaffected. Gene expression analyses reveal changes in Lrp1, Itgam, and Fcgr1 expression, and point to alterations in genes that regulate DC migration and antigen processing and presentation as being among pathways disrupted by inappropriate AHR signaling during development. These studies establish that AHR activation during development causes long-lasting changes to DCs, and provide new information regarding how early life environmental cues shape immune function later in life."
https://openalex.org/W2899982176,"Background A small but significant proportion of military veterans become involved in the criminal justice system (CJS) after leaving service. Liaison and Diversion (L&D) services aim to identify vulnerable offenders in order to provide them with the health/welfare support they need, and (where possible) divert them away from custody. An administrative database of L&D service-users was utilised to compare the needs of veterans with those of non-veteran L&D service-users. Method National data collected from 29 L&D services in 2015–2016 was utilised. Of the 62,397 cases, 1,067 (2%) reported previous service in the Armed Forces, and 48,578 had no previous service history. The associations between veteran status and socio-demographic characteristics, offending behaviour, health- and mental health-problems were explored. The associations between specific types of offending and mental health problems within the veterans in the sample were also investigated. Results Veterans tended to be older, and less likely to be unemployed than non-veterans, but just as likely to have unstable living arrangements (including homelessness). Veteran status was associated with increased levels of interpersonal violence, motoring offences, anxiety disorders and hazardous drinking patterns. Veteran status was associated with decreased levels of acquisitive offending, schizophrenia, ADHD, and substance misuse. Among veterans, the presence of an anxiety disorder (umbrella term which included GAD, Phobias, PTSD etc.) was associated with increased interpersonal violence, alcohol misuse was associated with increased motoring offences, and substance use was associated with increased acquisitive offending. Conclusions Our study indicates that among offenders in the CJS who have been identified as needing health or welfare support, veterans differ from non-veterans in terms of their health and welfare needs and offending behaviour. These differences may be influenced by the impact of military service and the transition into civilian life. Our findings support the identification of military personnel within the CJS to provide appropriate interventions and support to improve outcomes and reduce offending."
https://openalex.org/W2900175356,"Background The objective of this study was to investigate the expression and localisation of thymosin β4 (Tβ4) in the developing human heart. Tβ4 is a cardioprotective protein which may have therapeutic potential. While Tβ4 is an endogenously produced protein with known importance during development, its role within the developing human heart is not fully understood. Elucidating the localisation of Tβ4 within the developing heart will help in understanding its role during cardiac development and is crucial for understanding its potential for cardioprotection and repair in the adult heart. Methods Expression of Tβ4 mRNA in the early fetal human heart was assessed by PCR using both ventricular and atrial tissue. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was used to assess the localisation of Tβ4 in sections of early fetal human heart. Co-staining with CD31, an endothelial cell marker, and with myosin heavy chain, a cardiomyocyte marker, was used to determine whether Tβ4 is localised to these cell types within the early fetal human heart. Results Tβ4 mRNA was found to be expressed in both the atria and the ventricles of the early fetal human heart. Tβ4 protein was found to be primarily localised to CD31-expressing endothelial cells and the endocardium as well as being present in the epicardium. Tβ4-associated fluorescence was greater in the compact layer of the myocardial wall and the interventricular septum than in the trabecular layer of the myocardium. Conclusions The data presented illustrates expression of Tβ4 in the developing human heart and demonstrates for the first time that Tβ4 in the human heart is primarily localised to endothelial cells of the cardiac microvasculature and coronary vessels as-well as to the endothelial-like cells of the endocardium and to the epicardium."
https://openalex.org/W2899655752,"Maternal mortality remains very high in Mozambique, with estimates from 2015 showing a maternal mortality ratio of 489 deaths per 100,000 live births, even though the rates tend to decrease since 1990. Pregnancy related hemorrhage, gestational hypertension and diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS are amongst the leading causes of maternal death in Mozambique, and a significant number of these deaths occur within health facilities. Often, the analysis of data on maternal mortality involves the use of counts of maternal deaths as outcome variable. Previously we showed that a class of hierarchical zero-inflated models were very successful in dealing with overdispersion and clustered counts when analyzing data on maternal deaths and related risk factors within health facilities in Mozambique. This paper aims at providing additional insights over previous analyses and presents an extension of such models to account for spatial variation in a disease mapping framework of facility-based maternal mortality in Mozambique."
https://openalex.org/W2899808351,"Staphylococcus epidermidis small colony variants can survive inside macrophages and their survival has been proposed as a pivotal process in the pathogenesis of biomaterial associated infections. In the present study the intracellular location of clinical isolates of SCV and parental wild type strains inside macrophages was determined. Furthermore, the effect of IFN-γ and rapamycin on the level of SCV/WT as well as lysosomes colocalisation and iNOS induction in THP-activated macrophages in response to WT and SCV strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis were examined. It was demonstrated that SCV strain of S. epidermidis can survive and persist inside macrophages and its intracellular survival is supported by the induction of phagosomal acidification. The ability to reduce the high proportion of LysoTracker positive SCV containing phagosomes was exclusively found when IFN-γ was used. The findings suggest that IFN-γ mediates SCV killing via two distinct mechanisms, phagosome alkalisation and an increased iNOS synthesis, so the cytokine may control S. epidermidis WT and SCV infection in macrophages. Staphylococcus epidermidis SCV is a less potent stimulus of iNOS than the WT strain and the feature may help SCV to persist in hostile environment of macrophages. Rapamycin treatment did not influence the iNOS synthesis but reduced the percentage of both bacterial strains within acidic organelles. However, the percentage of SCV within LysoTracker positive organelles, even though reduced comparing to non-primed cells, was higher than in the WT strain indicating that Staphylococcus epidermidis possesses unique metabolic features allowing SCV to survive within macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2900250989,"The deployment of baits containing vaccines or toxins has been used successfully in the management of wildlife populations, including for disease control. Optimisation of deployment strategies seeks to maximise uptake by the targeted population whilst ensuring cost-effectiveness. Tuberculosis (TB) caused by infection with Mycobacterium bovis affects a broad range of mammalian hosts across the globe, including cattle, wildlife and humans. The control of TB in cattle in the UK and Republic of Ireland is hampered by persistent infection in European badgers (Meles meles). The present study aimed to determine the best strategy for maximising uptake of an oral vaccine by wild badgers, using a surrogate novel bait deployed at 40 badger social groups. Baits contained a blood-borne biomarker (Iophenoxic Acid, IPA) in order to measure consumption in badgers subsequently cage trapped at targeted setts. Evidence for the consumption of bait was found in 83% (199/240) of captured badgers. The probability that badgers had consumed at least one bait (IPA >10 μg ml-1) was significantly higher following deployment in spring than in summer. Lower uptake amongst social groups where more badgers were captured, suggested competition for baits. The probability of bait consumption was significantly higher at groups where main and outlier setts were provided with baits than at those where outliers were present but not baited. Badgers captured 10–14 days post bait feeding had significantly higher levels of bait uptake compared to those caught 24–28 days later. Uptake rates did not vary significantly in relation to badger age and whether bait was placed above ground or down setts. This study suggests that high levels of bait uptake can be achieved in wild badger populations and identifies factors influencing the potential success of different deployment strategies. The implications for the development of an oral badger vaccine are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2899859235,"Software optical mark recognition (SOMR) is the process whereby information entered on a survey form or questionnaire is converted using specialized software into a machine-readable format. SOMR normally requires input fields to be completely darkened, have no internal labels, or be filled with a soft pencil, otherwise mark detection will be inaccurate. Forms can also have print and scan artefacts that further increase the error rate. This article presents a new method of mark detection that improves over existing techniques based on pixel counting and simple thresholding. Its main advantage is that it can be used under a variety of conditions and yet maintain a high level of accuracy that is sufficient for scientific applications. Field testing shows no software misclassification in 5695 samples filled by trained personnel, and only two misclassifications in 6000 samples filled by untrained respondents. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 99.73%, 99.98%, and 99.94% respectively, even in the presence of print and scan artefacts, which was superior to other methods tested. A separate direct comparison for mark detection showed a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy respectively of 99.7%, 100.0%, 100.0% (new method), 96.3%, 96.0%, 96.1% (pixel counting), and 99.9%, 99.8%, 99.8% (simple thresholding) on clean forms, and 100.0%, 99.1%, 99.3% (new method), 98.4%, 95.6%, 96.2% (pixel counting), 100.0%, 38.3%, 51.4% (simple thresholding) on forms with print artefacts. This method is designed for bubble and box fields, while other types such as handwriting fields require separate error control measures."
https://openalex.org/W2900044529,"We actively maintain postural equilibrium in everyday life, and, although we are unaware of the underlying processing, there is increasing evidence for cortical involvement in this postural control. Converging evidence shows that we make appropriate use of ‘postural anchors’, for example static objects in the environment, to stabilise our posture. Visually evoked postural responses (VEPR) that are caused when we counteract the illusory perception of self-motion in space (vection) are modulated in the presence of postural anchors and therefore provide a convenient behavioural measure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the factors influencing visual appraisal of the suitability of postural anchors. We are specifically interested in the effect of perceived ‘reality’ in VR the expected ‘stability’ of visual anchors. To explore the effect of ‘reality’ we introduced an accommodation-vergence conflict. We show that VEPR are appropriately modulated only when virtual visual ‘anchors’ are rendered such that vergence and accommodation cues are consistent. In a second experiment we directly test whether cognitive assessment of the likely stability of real perceptual anchors (we contrast a ‘teapot on a stand’ and a ‘helium balloon’) affects VEPR. We show that the perceived positional stability of environmental anchors modulate postural responses. Our results confirm previous findings showing that postural sway is modulated by the configuration of the environment and further show that an assessment of the stability and reality of the environment plays an important role in this process. On this basis we propose design guidelines for VR systems, in particular we argue that accommodation-vergence conflicts should be minimised and that high quality motion tracking and rendering are essential for high fidelity VR."
https://openalex.org/W2900247623,"Calcium signalling is critical for successful fertilization. In spermatozoa, capacitation, hyperactivation of motility and acrosome reactions are all mediated by increases in intracellular Ca2+. Our previous reports have shown that deficiency of MTMR14, a novel phosphoinositide phosphatase, induces a muscle disorder by disrupting Ca2+ homeostasis. Recently, we found that MTMR14 is also expressed in the testes; however, whether deficiency of MTMR14 in the testes also alters the Ca2+ concentration and impairs male fertility remains entirely unknown. In the present study, we found that MTMR14 is also expressed in the testes and mature sperm cells, suggesting that deficiency of MTMR14 might have some effect on male fertility. Both in vivo fertility and in vitro fertilization tests were then performed, and we found that MTMR14-/- male mice showed decreased fertility. A series of experiments were then arranged to test the testis and sperm parameters; we found that MTMR14 deficiency caused small size of the testes, small numbers of both total and immotile sperm, expanded membrane of sperm tail, a decreased proportion of acrosome reaction, and in contrast, an increased proportion of abnormal sperm and augmented apoptosis, etc. Further study also found that the muscle force of the vas deferens decreased significantly in KO mice. Intracellular calcium homeostasis in the testes and epididymis was impaired by MTMR14 deletion; moreover, the relative mRNA expression levels of Itpr1, Itpr2, and Ryr3 were dramatically decreased in MTMR14 KO mice. Thus, MTMR14 deletion impairs male fertility by causing decreased muscle force of the vas deferens and intracellular calcium imbalance."
https://openalex.org/W2900361725,"This study investigated whether visual stimuli (FACES vs. CARS) combined with the presence of maternal scent can influence suck patterning in healthy infants. Fifteen healthy full-term infants (six months and younger) were exposed to their mother’s scent during a visual preference paradigm consisting of FACES vs. CARS stimuli while sucking on a custom research pacifier. Infants looked significantly longer to the FACES compared to CARS, p = .041. Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect for non-nutritive suck (NNS) bursts and visual stimuli (p = .001) with the largest differences evident between FACES and when the infant looked away from the visual stimuli (p = 0.008) as well as between FACES and CARS (p = 0.026). These preliminary findings suggest that infants have more suck attempts when looking at FACES in the presence of maternal scent thereby indicating potent links between visual preference and suck behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2899809828,"A lack of knowledge of naturally occurring pathogens is limiting our ability to use the Antarctic to study the impact human-mediated introduction of infectious microorganisms have on this relatively uncontaminated environment. As no large-scale coordinated effort to remedy this lack of knowledge has taken place, we rely on smaller targeted efforts to both study present microorganisms and monitor the environment for introductions. In one such effort, we isolated Campylobacter species from fecal samples collected from wild birds in the Antarctic Peninsula and the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. Indeed, in South Georgia, we found Campylobacter lari and the closely related Campylobacter peloridis, but also distantly related human-associated multilocus sequence types of Campylobacter jejuni. In contrast, in the Antarctic Peninsula, we found C. lari and two closely related species, Campylobacter subantarcticus and Campylobacter volucris, but no signs of human introduction. In fact, our finding of human-associated sequence types of C. jejuni in South Georgia, but not in the Antarctic Peninsula, suggests that efforts to limit the spread of infectious microorganisms to the Antarctic have so far been successful in preventing the introduction of C. jejuni. However, we do not know how it came to South Georgia and whether the same mode of introduction could spread it from there to the Antarctic Peninsula."
https://openalex.org/W2900201767,"There is accumulating evidence that task demands and psychological states can affect perceived pain intensity. Different accounts have been proposed to explain this attenuation based either on how limited attentional resources are allocated to the pain stimulus or on how the threat value of the pain stimulus biases attention. However, the evidence for both proposals remains mixed. Here we introduce an incremental dual-task paradigm in which participants were asked to detect pain on their fingertip without any additional tasks during baseline phases or while concurrently detecting visual targets during task phases. The force applied to participants' fingertip in all phases increased incrementally until they detected moderate pain. In Experiment 1, we used coloured shapes and in Experiment 2 we used affective images as visual targets. We also manipulated the threat value of the pain stimulus in Experiment 2. For both experiments, we found that a concurrent task attenuated perceived pain intensity: mean force was significantly greater for the same moderate pain during task compared to baseline phases. Furthermore although task difficulty and affective content did not affect pain perception, the threat value of the pain stimulus moderated the magnitude of pain attenuation."
https://openalex.org/W2899609697,"A prevailing technique to infer function from lists of identifications, from molecular biological high-throughput experiments, is over-representation analysis, where the identifications are compared to predefined sets of related genes often referred to as pathways. As at least some pathways are known to be incomplete in their annotation, algorithmic efforts have been made to complement them with information from functional association networks. While the terminology varies in the literature, we will here refer to such methods as Network Enrichment Analysis (NEA). Traditionally, the significance of inferences from NEA has been assigned using a null model constructed from randomizations of the network. Here we instead argue for a null model that more directly relates to the set of genes being studied, and have designed one dynamic programming algorithm that calculates the score distribution of NEA scores that makes it possible to assign unbiased mid p values to inferences. We also implemented a random sampling method, carrying out the same task. We demonstrate that our method obtains a superior statistical calibration as compared to the popular NEA inference engine, BinoX, while also providing statistics that are easier to interpret."
https://openalex.org/W2899874284,"Background Up to 80% of wheelchair users are affected by shoulder pain. The Clinical Practice Guidelines for preservation of upper limb function following spinal cord injury suggest that using a proper wheelchair propulsion technique could minimize the shoulder injury risk. Yet, the exact relationship between the wheelchair propulsion technique and shoulder load is not well understood. Objective This study aimed to examine the changes in shoulder loading accompanying the typical changes in propulsion technique following 80 min of low-intensity wheelchair practice distributed over 3 weeks. Methods Seven able-bodied participants performed the pre- and the post-test and 56 min of visual feedback-based low-intensity wheelchair propulsion practice. Kinematics and kinetics of propulsion technique were recorded during the pre- and the post-test. A musculoskeletal model was used to calculate muscle force and glenohumeral reaction force. Results Participants decreased push frequency (51→36 pushes/min, p = 0.04) and increased contact angle (68→94°, p = 0.02) between the pre- and the post-test. The excursion of the upper arm increased, approaching significance (297→342 mm, p = 0.06). Range of motion of the hand, trunk and shoulder remained unchanged. The mean glenohumeral reaction force per cycle decreased by 13%, approaching significance (268→232 N, p = 0.06). Conclusions Despite homogenous changes in propulsion technique, the kinematic solution to the task varied among the participants. Participants exhibited two glenohumeral reaction force distribution patterns: 1) Two individuals developed high force at the onset of the push, leading to increased peak and mean glenohumeral forces 2) Five individuals distributed the force more evenly over the cycle, lowering both peak and mean glenohumeral forces."
https://openalex.org/W2900243633,"Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate CMR myocardial first-pass perfusion in the injured region as well as the non-infarcted area in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients few days after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Materials and methods 220 patients with first time STEMI successfully treated with PCI (with or without postconditioning) were recruited from the Postconditioning in STEMI study. Contrast enhanced CMR was performed at a 1.5 T scanner 2 (1–5) days after PCI. On myocardial first-pass perfusion imaging signal intensity (SI) was measured in the injured area and in the remote myocardium and maximum contrast enhancement index (MCE) was calculated. MCE = (peak SI after contrast—SI at baseline) / SI at baseline x 100. Results There were no significant differences in first-pass perfusion between patients treated with standard PCI and patients treated with additional postconditioning. The injured myocardium showed a significantly lower MCE compared to remote myocardium (94 ± 55 vs. 113 ± 49; p < 0.001). When patients were divided into four quartiles of MCE in the injured myocardium (MCE injured myocardium), patients with low MCE injured myocardium had: significantly lower ejection fraction (EF) than patients with high MCE injured myocardium, larger infarct size and area at risk, smaller myocardial salvage and more frequent occurrence of microvascular obstruction on late gadolinium enhancement. MCE in the remote myocardium revealed that patients with larger infarction also had significantly decreased MCE in the non-infarcted, remote area. Conclusion CMR first-pass perfusion can be impaired in both injured and remote myocardium in STEMI patients treated with primary PCI. These findings indicate that CMR first-pass perfusion may be a feasible method to evaluate myocardial injury after STEMI in addition to conventional CMR parameters."

We explored the field experiences and perceptions of local health care workers regarding home-based strategies as opportunities to improve the cascade of care of people living with HIV in rural South Africa as part of a Universal Test-and-Treat approach.In Hlabisa sub-district, home-based HIV services, including rapid HIV testing and counselling, and support for linkage to and retention in clinic-based HIV care, were implemented by health care workers within the ANRS 12249 Treatment-as-Prevention (TasP) trial. From April to July 2016, we conducted a mixed-methods study among health care workers from the TasP trial and from local government clinics, using self-administrated questionnaires (n = 90 in the TasP trial, n = 56 in government clinics), semi-structured interviews (n = 13 in the TasP trial, n = 5 in government clinics) and three focus group discussions (n = 6-10 health care workers of the TasP trial per group). Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data and qualitative data were analysed thematically.More than 90% of health care workers assessed home-based testing and support for linkage to care as feasible and acceptable by the population they serve. Many health care workers underlined how home visits could facilitate reaching people who had slipped through the cracks of the clinic-based health care system and encourage them to successfully access care. Health care workers however expressed concerns about the ability of home-based services to answer the HIV care needs of all community members, including people working outside their home during the day or those who fear HIV-related stigmatization. Overall, health care workers encouraged policy-makers to more formally integrate home-based services in the local health system. They promoted reshaping the disease-specific and care-oriented services towards more comprehensive goals.Because home-based services allow identification of people early during their infection and encourage them to take actions leading to viral suppression, HCWs assessed them as valuable components within the panel of UTT interventions, aiming to reach the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets, especially in the rural Southern African region.The registration number of the ANRS 12249 TasP trial on ClinicalTrials.gov is NCT01509508."

Combining data sequenced in this study and downloaded from GenBank, we sampled 112 (chloroplast data) / 122 (ITS data) specimens belonging to 49 (chloroplast data) / 46 (ITS data) poplar species or hybrids from six (chloroplast data) / five sections (ITS data). Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference were used to analyze phylogenetic relationships within the genus Populus based on eight chloroplast combinations and ITS regions. The results suggested that Bayesian inference might be more suitable for the phylogenetic reconstruction of Populus. All Populus species could be divided into two clades: clade 1, including subclades 1 and 2, and clade 2, including subclades 3 and 4. Species within clade 1, involving five sections except for Leuce, clustered coinciding with their two specific main geographical distribution areas: China (subclade 1) and North America (subclade 2). Clustering in subclade 3, section Leuce was confirmed to be of monophyletic origin and independent evolution. Its two subsections, namely Albidae and Trepidae, could be separated by chloroplast data but had frequent gene flow based on ITS data. Phylogeny analysis based on chloroplast data demonstrated once more that section Aigeiros was paraphyletic and further showed that the P. deltoides lineage is restricted in subclade 2 and that P. nigra lineage, located in subclade 3, originated from a hybrid of which an Albidae ancestor species was the material parent. Similarly, section Tacamahaca was found to be paraphyletic and had two lineages: a clade 1 lineage, such as P. cathayana, and a clade 2 lineage, such as P. simonii. Section Leucoides was paraphyletic and closely linked to section Tacamahaca. Their section boundaries were not conclusively delimitated by sequencing information."
https://openalex.org/W2899976303,"The goal of this study is to examine the extent to which child temperament predicts the adiposity rebound, a steep increase in the body mass index (BMI) between ages 5 and 7 years. If this increase occurs at an earlier age, the risk for later obesity is elevated. To improve the accuracy of the examination, we use a genetically informed design, a sibling-control study, to control for genetic and familial confounding. We hypothesize that temperament traits tapping negative emotionality, approach and avoidance are associated with the adiposity rebound. Methods We repeatedly examined 25889 siblings within the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, following them from the mothers’ pregnancy through child age 8 years. Information on the children’s height and weight was collected by means of health registries and maternal reports. Information on the siblings’ temperament was collected by questionnaires completed when they were 1.5, 3, and 5 years old. We examined the associations of temperament at different child ages with the timing of the adiposity rebound among siblings and controls by means of growth curve and multilevel analyses. Results Within siblings, high scores on the approach trait of sociability predicted an earlier adiposity rebound and high scores on the avoidance trait of shyness predicted a later adiposity rebound with timing differences ranging between 6 and 16 weeks. Surprisingly, negative emotionality did not predict the adiposity rebound. The associations between temperament and the adiposity rebound increased with increasing child age. The results within controls—comparing siblings with the population, broadly paralleled those within siblings, Conclusions The findings encourage the notion that child temperament functions as an early marker for the adiposity rebound. Future studies may advance our knowledge by including measures of child personality along the taxonomy of the adult Five Personality Factors."

The extent to which these models resemble one another and their human counterparts at the molecular level is critical in understanding tumorigenesis. In this study, we carried out a comparative gene expression analysis to generate a detailed molecular portrait of a transgenic mouse model of IGFIR-driven lung cancer. IGFIR-driven tumors displayed a strong resemblance with established mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma, particularly EGFR-driven models highlighted by elevated levels of the EGFR ligands Ereg and Areg. Cross-species analysis revealed a shared increase in human lung adenocarcinoma markers including Nkx2.1 and Napsa as well as alterations in a subset of genes with oncogenic and tumor suppressive properties such as Aurka, Ret, Klf4 and Lats2. Integrated miRNA and mRNA analysis in IGFIR-driven tumors identified interaction pairs with roles in ErbB signaling while cross-species analysis revealed coordinated expression of a subset of conserved miRNAs and their targets including miR-21-5p (Reck, Timp3 and Tgfbr3). Overall, these findings support the use of SPC-IGFIR mice as a model of human lung adenocarcinoma and provide a comprehensive knowledge base to dissect the molecular pathogenesis of tumor initiation and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2900145603,"Purpose House dust mites Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus are the main source of major inhalatory allergens inducing inflammatory response. Mite extract contain both allergenic proteins and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The main allergenic protein, Der p 2, is a functional homolog of sMD-2, a protein providing blood cell response on LPS. Der p 2 may restore the response to LPS in absence of MD-2, but its interaction with LPS in whole blood is unknown. We studied the effect of Der p 2 on LPS-mediated activation of human whole blood cells. Methods Interaction of Der p 2 and LPS was studied on eight healthy donors. The whole blood was incubated with extract of house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DP-e), recombinant antigenic protein Der p 2 variant 5 (rDep 2), Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and their combination. Supernatants were collected for ELISA analysis of protein content. Activation degree was determined by change in concentration of TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1Ra cytokines and sMD-2 protein. Results extract of mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DP-e) possessed weak inherent activity and did not cause significant increase of cytokine production. Simultaneous activation of blood cells by LPS and DP-e led to considerable increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. We have shown the intrinsic inducing activity of Der p 2 allergen on sMD-2 protein and TNF-α cytokine expression. Conclusions Der p 2 allergen enhances the response of human whole blood cells to external LPS by inducing additional expression of LPS-transporting protein sMD-2. The obtained data show an important role of LPS contamination of allegrens in the progress of allergic inflammatory response."

We use the leopard frogs of the eastern U.S. as a case study of this issue. We refined the known range of the recently described Rana kauffeldi, the Atlantic Coast Leopard Frog, relative to the region’s two other leopard frog species, conducted assessments of conservation status, and improved methods for separating the three species using morphological field characters. We conducted over 2,000 call and visual surveys and took photographs of and tissue samples from hundreds of frogs. Genetic analysis supported a three-species taxonomy and provided determinations for 220 individual photographed frogs. Rana kauffeldi was confirmed in eight U.S. states, from North Carolina to southern Connecticut, hewing closely to the Atlantic Coastal Plain. It can be reliably differentiated in life from R. pipiens, and from R. sphenocephala 90% of the time, based on such characters as the femoral reticulum patterning, dorsal spot size and number, and presence of a snout spot. However, the only diagnostic character separating R. kauffeldi from R. sphenocephala remains the breeding call described in 2014. Based on our field study, museum specimens, and prior survey data, we suggest that R. kauffeldi has declined substantially in the northern part of its range, but is more secure in the core of its range. We also report, for the first time, apparent extirpations of R. pipiens from the southeastern portion of its range, previously overlooked because of confusion with R. kauffeldi. We conclude with a generalized ecological research agenda for cryptic species. For R. kauffeldi, needs include descriptions of earlier life stages, studies of niche partitioning with sympatric congeners and the potential for hybridization, and identification of conservation actions to prevent further declines."
https://openalex.org/W2899807221,"The introduction of biologic agents opened a new era of treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) over the past decade. From clinical experience, it appears that biological agents are well tolerated overall, and serious adverse events are rare. However, such clinical studies have not been conducted in Korea. Therefore, we examined the safety profile of JIA patients with biologics in a single center in Korea. All JIA outpatients treated from April 2004 to June 2013 were enrolled and retrospectively reviewed. Pharmacy-based surveillance of adverse drug events (ADEs) was identified by recording the patient's symptoms in the medical record and suspected ADEs were additionally explored by screening laboratory test values and observing changes in medication orders. Finally, 83 patients were enrolled and experienced 109 ADEs in 52 patients. Most ADEs (99.1%) were mild to moderate in severity assessment. The total follow-up time was 328 patient-treatment years and the overall rate of ADEs was 0.33 per patient-years for etanercept. Infection including upper respiratory tract was the most common ADE and concomitant corticosteroids contributed to the risk of infections. If the dose of prednisolone increases 0.34 mg/kg/day, the probability of developing infections increases 3.29 times. Also, all 11 patients who stopped etanercept with injection site reactions were receiving a single use prefilled syringe. In our study, etanercept appears well tolerated and safe. Children affected by JIA should be carefully monitoring so as to limit the risk of ADEs during etanercept as much as possible. To gain further knowledge about risk profiles, national collaboration for the accumulation of long-term data should be encouraged in Korea."
https://openalex.org/W2900443482,"Plant immunity has mainly been studied under controlled conditions, limiting our knowledge regarding the regulation of immunity under natural conditions where plants grow in association with multiple microorganisms. Plant pathology theory, based on laboratory data, predicts complex biochemical plant-pathogen interactions leading to coevolution of pathogen infectivity vs. plant recognition of microbes in multiple layers over time. However, plant immunity is currently not evaluated in relation to ecological time-scales and field conditions. Here we report status of immunity in plants without visible disease symptoms in wild populations of nightshades, Solanum dulcamara and Solanum nigrum, and in agricultural fields of potato, Solanum tuberosum. We analysed presence of pathogenesis-related proteins in over 500 asymptomatic leaf samples collected in the field in June, July and August over three years. Pathogenesis-related proteins were present in only one-third of the collected samples, suggesting low activity of the immune system. We could also detect an increase in pathogenesis-related proteins later in the growing season, particularly in S. tuberosum. Our findings, based on pathogenesis-related protein markers, indicate major gaps in our knowledge regarding the status and regulation of plant immunity under field conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2899739650,"Early-onset cataracts (EOC) are associated with an increased inflammatory response; therefore, a potential risk of other inflammatory diseases, like peptic ulcer, may be related. This study investigated the risk of peptic ulcer after being diagnosed with EOC. Retrospective claims data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were analyzed. Study subjects comprised patients with EOC (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9- CM] codes 366.00, 366.01, 366.02, 366.03, 366.04, 366.09, 366.17 and 366.18), aged 20-55 years and newly diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 (n = 1910), and a comparison cohort without the disease (n = 7515). Both cohorts were followed up until 2010 to estimate the incidences of peptic ulcer. We used the Poisson regression model to compare incidence rate ratios and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the hazard ratio (HR) of peptic ulcer associated with EOC. The overall incidence rate of peptic ulcer was higher in the EOC cohort than in the comparison cohort (10.3 vs 7.68 per 1000 person-years) with an adjusted HR of 1.33 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.69). The present study suggests that patients with EOC are at an increased risk of being diagnosed with peptic ulcer in subsequent years."
https://openalex.org/W2900010953,"Bacillus anthracis is a major biological warfare threat. The inhalation form of infection can kill quickly. While antibiotic treatment is effective, if diagnosis is delayed, the rapidly produced toxin may already be present in lethal amounts. This report describes a fast, sensitive, specific and accurate method for detection of active infection by Bacillus anthracis in plasma. One of the virulence factors, anthrax lethal factor, is an endopeptidase present in blood early in the infection. However, the use of peptidic substrates to detect endopetidases is problematic in plasma due to the presence of other proteases and the likelihood of nonspecific cleavage of the substrate. The fluorescently labeled peptide substrate MAPKKide Plus designed in this study is not cleaved by plasma proteases and thus is specific for lethal factor. Three detection strategies are described. Two include enrichment by capture from plasma using lethal factor antibody-coated microtiter plates or similarly coated immuno-tubes. The captured lethal factor is exposed to the MAPKKide Plus, and the amount of cleavage is determined either by HPLC or microplate reader. Concentration of lethal factor using the antibody-coated plates aplnd HPLC allows for detection of less than 5 pg lethal factor/ml of neat plasma after 2 hours of incubation. Using antibody-coated immuno-tubes, 20 pg lethal factor/ml plasma can be detected in 5 hours by a simple end point read of fluorescence in a microplate reader. For a third strategy, the substrate is added directly to diluted plasma, and cleavage is monitored by the increase in fluorescence as a function of time. The limit of detection by this simple method is 25 ng lethal factor/ml of plasma in 15 minutes, 5 ng/ml after 45 minutes, and <1 ng lethal factor/ml of plasma after 5 hours."
https://openalex.org/W2900032384,"Little is known about the interplay between affective and cognitive processes of decision making within the bounded rationality perspective, in particular for the debate on adaptive decision making and strategy selection. This gap in the knowledge is particularly important as affect and deliberation may direct preferences in opposite directions. How do decision makers solve such dissonance? In this paper, we address this question by exploring the use of integral affect as a choice heuristic in comparison with and in conjunction to ""take the best,"" and weighted addition of attributes (WADD). We operationalize theories of reliance on affect in choice through a ""Take the emotionally best"" algorithm. Its predictive power is experimentally tested against other models, including mixed-sequential cognitive/affective procedures. We find that individual decisions are better predicted by a sequential combination of ""Take the emotionally best"" and ""Take the best"" with a slight dominance of the former. Conditions of cognitive/affective ambivalence, low discrimination ability and high complexity provide the cognitive architecture where such blended choice strategies predict decisions more precisely. This implies that reliance on integral affect may precede the use of cognitive cues following an ecological rationality perspective rather than supporting a kind of competition between affect and cognition as implied in current literature."
