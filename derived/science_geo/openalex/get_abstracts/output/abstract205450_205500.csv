https://openalex.org/W2104261027,Single 10-minute light periods can cause a phase shift in the rhythm of the daily locomotor activity of flying squirrels otherwise maintained in constant darkness. A daily rhythm of sensitivity to these standard light periods was found.

https://openalex.org/W2076526995,"Mice were shocked with 0.1, 0.3, or 0.5 ma of current at 2 to 3, 8 to 9, or 15 to 16 days. Handled, nonshocked and nonhandled controls were also used. In adulthood each group was split into thirds and taught an avoidance response under shock of 0.3, 0.5, or 0.7 ma. The amount of shock given during infancy and adulthood, and the age at which shock occurred, were all found to have significant effects upon learning."
https://openalex.org/W1991230550,"Animals were handled during ages 1 to 10, 11 to 20, or 1 to 20 days, or were nonhandled controls. Animals handled for 20 days weighed the most in adulthood, while the controls weighed the least. Animals handled on days 1 to 10 survived food and water deprivation the longest of any group. Mice handled for 20 days died earlier than controls, while the reverse was true for the rat."
https://openalex.org/W2138238156,"The techniques previously available for the study of purified animal viruses have not permitted the production under controlled conditions of sufficient virus for experiments involving degradative chemical analysis. The utilization of suspension cell cultures (1) and the development of a simple, convenient virus purification procedure (2) have now made possible an investigation of the questions of the origin and time of synthesis of virus protein. Type 1 poliovirus was propagated in HeLa 53 cells (3) differentially labeled with L-valine-Cl”, and the isotope content of the valine of the isolated virus protein was determined. The results indicate that the virus protein is assembled from the large intracellular amino acid pool of the cells, and that the synthesis of the virus protein begins almost at the same time as the appearance of mature virus, but proceeds thereafter at a more rapid rate than maturation."

https://openalex.org/W1988265222,Puffer-fish poison and clam poison reversibly inhibit conduction in single nerve fiber preparation of frog in a concentration of 3 x 10-10 M. In the isolated electroplax of Electrophorus electricus higher concentrations block both transmission and conduction. Neither toxin is a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. The mechanism of action of these toxins in blocking transmission and conduction has not yet been established.

https://openalex.org/W1993907400,"Smear preparations of cells taken from primary explants of normal and adjacent tumor wood of Picea glauca showed completely regular mitotic behavior in the normal cells, with the great majority of cells diploid (22 chromosomes), a few tetraploid, but almost none aneuploid. Tumor tissue was extremely unstable, with numbers ranging from 3 to more than 70, with a high proportion of aneuploids but otherwise normal-appearing mitoses. The relation of this mitotic instability to other data on these tumors is pointed out."

https://openalex.org/W2015735550,Rats in a low-ceiling shuttlebox initially show a lower level of learning than rats in a high-ceiling box. After an hour's interruption of conditioning the performance of animals in low-ceiling boxes improves and avoidance is slightly more efficient than in the unimproved performance of animals in high-ceiling boxes. Box height also interacts significantly with length of box.

https://openalex.org/W1995391037,"SOME animal plasminogens, which are unaffected by streptokinase alone, are activated by streptokinase and human globulin. Mullertz1 has postulated the existence of a proactivator in human serum. Staphylokinase, without human globulin, activates a wider range of animal plasminogens2 and may, therefore, not require proactivator."

https://openalex.org/W2095148229,IT is known that the different acridine derivatives are able to become bound to isolated nucleic acids1. The compounds are more strongly bound by the highly polymerized deoxyribonucleic acid than by the ribonucleic acid1. The results of studying the interactions with deoxyribonucleic acid and the strong antibacterial effects of nitroacridine2 suggest that these compounds may be used as virus chemotherapeutic agents.

https://openalex.org/W2055345406,PAPER electrophoresis became a suitable technique for embryological purposes when Kohn1 proposed the use of pure cellulose acetate as a supporting medium instead of filter paper. This method enables us to separate much smaller amounts of protein than hitherto : one single amphibian embryo yields enough protein to give a clear electrophoretic pattern.
https://openalex.org/W2067778656,"ELECTROPHORESIS has been of value in determining the physico-chemical constitution of cell-free extracts of micro-organisms1,2. These studies have been confined mainly to the bacteria and no such investigation of trypanosomal extracts has been made. Moving-boundary electrophoresis has been the method most frequently employed to analyse microbial extracts although the simplicity of paper electrophoresis would be of obvious advantage. The purpose of this communication is to describe the technique for paper electrophoresis and the resultant electro-phoretic patterns of trypanosomal extracts."

https://openalex.org/W2038206715,"IN order to improve the specificity of a bovine tuberculin purified protein derivative, precipitated with trichloracetic acid from heated culture filtrates1, we decided to investigate its protein composition2, and in this connexion we experimented with zone electrophoresis on paper-strips. Now this procedure has hitherto not been very successful3–5, and in spite of our own numerous experiments with various procedures and methods we did not obtain anything other than unusable pictures of ‘comets’ or streaks. (This is in contrast with the more satisfying results obtained by others with non-heated tuberculins4,5.) Smithies introduced starch gel electrophoresis which seems to be of great value in determining the ultrastructure of serum-protein patterns6,7, the composition of toxins8 and of cerebrospinal fluid9. Sorkin et al. 10 made preparative separations of some tuberculoprotein preparations from unheated culture filtrates by electrophoresis in starch gels, followed by transfer into glass. Our own investigations on this starch-gel electrophoresis led to the following method."
