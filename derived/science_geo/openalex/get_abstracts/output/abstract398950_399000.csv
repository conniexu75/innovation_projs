https://openalex.org/W2127634492,"Evidence for the etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has consistently pointed to a strong genetic component complicated by substantial locus heterogeneity. We sequenced the exomes of 20 individuals with sporadic ASD (cases) and their parents, reasoning that these families would be enriched for de novo mutations of major effect. We identified 21 de novo mutations, 11 of which were protein altering. Protein-altering mutations were significantly enriched for changes at highly conserved residues. We identified potentially causative de novo events in 4 out of 20 probands, particularly among more severely affected individuals, in FOXP1, GRIN2B, SCN1A and LAMC3. In the FOXP1 mutation carrier, we also observed a rare inherited CNTNAP2 missense variant, and we provide functional support for a multi-hit model for disease risk. Our results show that trio-based exome sequencing is a powerful approach for identifying new candidate genes for ASDs and suggest that de novo mutations may contribute substantially to the genetic etiology of ASDs."
https://openalex.org/W1975239375,"Fast inhibitory neurotransmission is essential for nervous system function and is mediated by binding of inhibitory neurotransmitters to receptors of the Cys-loop family embedded in the membranes of neurons. Neurotransmitter binding triggers a conformational change in the receptor, opening an intrinsic chloride channel and thereby dampening neuronal excitability. Here we present the first three-dimensional structure, to our knowledge, of an inhibitory anion-selective Cys-loop receptor, the homopentameric Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel α (GluCl), at 3.3 Å resolution. The X-ray structure of the GluCl–Fab complex was determined with the allosteric agonist ivermectin and in additional structures with the endogenous neurotransmitter l-glutamate and the open-channel blocker picrotoxin. Ivermectin, used to treat river blindness, binds in the transmembrane domain of the receptor and stabilizes an open-pore conformation. Glutamate binds in the classical agonist site at subunit interfaces, and picrotoxin directly occludes the pore near its cytosolic base. GluCl provides a framework for understanding mechanisms of fast inhibitory neurotransmission and allosteric modulation of Cys-loop receptors. The atomic resolution structure of the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) from Caenorhabditis elegans has been determined, in the presence of the allosteric agonist ivermectin, the endogenous neurotransmitter L-glutamate and the open-channel blocker picrotoxin. These structures provide a framework for understanding mechanisms of the fast inhibitory neurotransmission that is essential for nervous system function."

https://openalex.org/W2070439333,"Mechanical force causes stiffening, or reinforcement, of integrin-based cellular adhesions. This reinforcement is shown to be mediated by the recruitment of the LARG and GEF-H1 guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which activate distinct signalling pathways in response to integrin stimulation. How individual cells respond to mechanical forces is of considerable interest to biologists as force affects many aspects of cell behaviour1. The application of force on integrins triggers cytoskeletal rearrangements and growth of the associated adhesion complex, resulting in increased cellular stiffness2,3, also known as reinforcement4. Although RhoA has been shown to play a role during reinforcement3, the molecular mechanisms that regulate its activity are unknown. By combining biochemical and biophysical approaches, we identified two guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), LARG and GEF-H1, as key molecules that regulate the cellular adaptation to force. We show that stimulation of integrins with tensional force triggers activation of these two GEFs and their recruitment to adhesion complexes. Surprisingly, activation of LARG and GEF-H1 involves distinct signalling pathways. Our results reveal that LARG is activated by the Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn, whereas GEF-H1 catalytic activity is enhanced by ERK downstream of a signalling cascade that includes FAK and Ras."
https://openalex.org/W2008945055,"Genome-wide association studies have identified many genetic variants associated with complex traits. However, at only a minority of loci have the molecular mechanisms mediating these associations been characterized. In parallel, whereas cis regulatory patterns of gene expression have been extensively explored, the identification of trans regulatory effects in humans has attracted less attention. Here we show that the type 2 diabetes and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol–associated cis-acting expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of the maternally expressed transcription factor KLF14 acts as a master trans regulator of adipose gene expression. Expression levels of genes regulated by this trans-eQTL are highly correlated with concurrently measured metabolic traits, and a subset of the trans-regulated genes harbor variants directly associated with metabolic phenotypes. This trans-eQTL network provides a mechanistic understanding of the effect of the KLF14 locus on metabolic disease risk and offers a potential model for other complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W1973170774,"Mitochondria are maternally transmitted; hence, their genome can only make a direct and adaptive response to selection through females, whereas males represent an evolutionary dead end. In theory, this creates a sex-specific selective sieve, enabling deleterious mutations to accumulate in mitochondrial genomes if they exert male-specific effects. We tested this hypothesis, expressing five mitochondrial variants alongside a standard nuclear genome in Drosophila melanogaster, and found striking sexual asymmetry in patterns of nuclear gene expression. Mitochondrial polymorphism had few effects on nuclear gene expression in females but major effects in males, modifying nearly 10% of transcripts. These were mostly male-biased in expression, with enrichment hotspots in the testes and accessory glands. Our results suggest an evolutionary mechanism that results in mitochondrial genomes harboring male-specific mutation loads."

https://openalex.org/W2110112655,"Investigations of serine hydrolases have been frustrated by a lack of selective chemical inhibitors. Profiling of synthetically accessible 1,2,3-triazole ureas in cells and mice now identifies several effective compounds, application of which yields new insights into N-acetylation by APEH. Serine hydrolases are a diverse enzyme class representing ∼1% of all human proteins. The biological functions of most serine hydrolases remain poorly characterized owing to a lack of selective inhibitors to probe their activity in living systems. Here we show that a substantial number of serine hydrolases can be irreversibly inactivated by 1,2,3-triazole ureas, which show negligible cross-reactivity with other protein classes. Rapid lead optimization by click chemistry–enabled synthesis and competitive activity-based profiling identified 1,2,3-triazole ureas that selectively inhibit enzymes from diverse branches of the serine hydrolase class, including peptidases (acyl-peptide hydrolase, or APEH), lipases (platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase-2, or PAFAH2) and uncharacterized hydrolases (α,β-hydrolase-11, or ABHD11), with exceptional potency in cells (sub-nanomolar) and mice (<1 mg kg−1). We show that APEH inhibition leads to accumulation of N-acetylated proteins and promotes proliferation in T cells. These data indicate 1,2,3-triazole ureas are a pharmacologically privileged chemotype for serine hydrolase inhibition, combining broad activity across the serine hydrolase class with tunable selectivity for individual enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1976484400,"In regions of high rates of malaria transmission, mosquitoes repeatedly transmit liver-tropic Plasmodium sporozoites to individuals who already have blood-stage parasitemia. This manifests itself in semi-immune children (who have been exposed since birth to Plasmodium infection and as such show low levels of peripheral parasitemia but can still be infected) older than 5 years of age by concurrent carriage of different parasite genotypes at low asymptomatic parasitemias. Superinfection presents an increased risk of hyperparasitemia and death in less immune individuals but counterintuitively is not frequently observed in the young. Here we show in a mouse model that ongoing blood-stage infections, above a minimum threshold, impair the growth of subsequently inoculated sporozoites such that they become growth arrested in liver hepatocytes and fail to develop into blood-stage parasites. Inhibition of the liver-stage infection is mediated by the host iron regulatory hormone hepcidin, whose synthesis we found to be stimulated by blood-stage parasites in a density-dependent manner. We mathematically modeled this phenomenon and show how density-dependent protection against liver-stage malaria can shape the epidemiological patterns of age-related risk and the complexity of malaria infections seen in young children. The interaction between these two Plasmodium stages and host iron metabolism has relevance for the global efforts to reduce malaria transmission and for evaluation of iron supplementation programs in malaria-endemic regions."

https://openalex.org/W2038690518,"In zebrafish, angiogenic sprouts from the apposed dorsal aorta and vein emanate in opposite directions. Whereas growth from the dorsal aorta is modulated by VEGF signalling, BMP is shown to be a vein-specific angiogenic cue for vascular network formation during development. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, is critical to most physiological processes and many pathological conditions. During zebrafish development, angiogenesis expands the axial vessels into a complex vascular network that is necessary for efficient oxygen delivery. Although the dorsal aorta and the axial vein are spatially juxtaposed, the initial angiogenic sprouts from these vessels extend in opposite directions, indicating that distinct cues may regulate angiogenesis of the axial vessels. We found that angiogenic sprouts from the dorsal aorta are dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegf-A) signalling, and do not respond to bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signals. In contrast, sprouts from the axial vein are regulated by Bmp signalling independently of Vegf-A signals, indicating that Bmp is a vein-specific angiogenic cue during early vascular development. Our results support a paradigm whereby different signals regulate distinct programmes of sprouting angiogenesis from the axial vein and dorsal aorta, and indicate that signalling heterogeneity contributes to the complexity of vascular networks."

https://openalex.org/W2047026162,"The cyclical protrusion and retraction of the leading edge is a hallmark of many migrating cells involved in processes such as development, inflammation and tumorigenesis. The molecular identity of the signalling mechanisms that control these cycles has remained unknown. Here, we used live-cell imaging of biosensors to monitor spontaneous morphodynamic and signalling activities, and employed correlative image analysis to examine the role of cyclic-AMP-activated protein kinase A (PKA) in protrusion regulation. PKA activity at the leading edge is closely synchronized with rapid protrusion and with the activity of RhoA. Ensuing PKA phosphorylation of RhoA and the resulting increased interaction between RhoA and RhoGDI (Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor) establish a negative feedback mechanism that controls the cycling of RhoA activity at the leading edge. Thus, cooperation between PKA, RhoA and RhoGDI forms a pacemaker that governs the morphodynamic behaviour of migrating cells. Live-cell imaging of the spatiotemporal kinetics of PKA activation during cell migration reveals that PKA regulates the protrusion and retraction cycle of the leading edge. Protrusion formation correlates with RhoA and PKA activation. PKA subsequently phosphorylates RhoA to increase its interaction with RhoGDI and terminate RhoA activity at the leading edge."

We found the homeodomain protein Skn-1a (Pou2f3) to be expressed in sweet, umami and bitter taste cells. Skn-1a-deficient mice lacked electrophysiological and behavioral responses to sweet, umami and bitter tastes, as a result of a complete absence of sweet, umami and bitter cells and the concomitant expansion of sour cells. Skn-1a is critical for generating and balancing the diverse composition of taste cells."
https://openalex.org/W1985004569,"Johnson and colleagues investigate spiking activity in developing inner hair cells (IHCs), showing that apical IHCs fire spontaneous action potentials in a burst-like pattern, whereas basal IHCs fire randomly. The burst-like firing of apical IHCs depends on acetylcholine. Extracellular ATP affects the resting potential of IHCs by activating SK2 channels. Spontaneous action potential activity is crucial for mammalian sensory system development. In the auditory system, patterned firing activity has been observed in immature spiral ganglion and brain-stem neurons and is likely to depend on cochlear inner hair cell (IHC) action potentials. It remains uncertain whether spiking activity is intrinsic to developing IHCs and whether it shows patterning. We found that action potentials were intrinsically generated by immature IHCs of altricial rodents and that apical IHCs showed bursting activity as opposed to more sustained firing in basal cells. We show that the efferent neurotransmitter acetylcholine fine-tunes the IHC's resting membrane potential (Vm), and as such is crucial for the bursting pattern in apical cells. Endogenous extracellular ATP also contributes to the Vm of apical and basal IHCs by triggering small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK2) channels. We propose that the difference in firing pattern along the cochlea instructs the tonotopic differentiation of IHCs and auditory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2105463481,"We developed a tissue-engineered vascular graft composed of biodegradable scaffold seeded with autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMCs) that is currently in clinical trial and developed analogous mouse models to study mechanisms of neovessel formation. We previously reported that seeded human BMMCs were rapidly lost after implantation into immunodeficient mice as host macrophages invaded the graft. As a consequence, the resulting neovessel was entirely of host cell origin. Here, we investigate the source of neotissue cells in syngeneic BMMC-seeded grafts, implanted into immunocompetent mouse recipients. We again find that seeded BMMCs are lost, declining to 0.02% at 14 d, concomitant with host macrophage invasion. In addition, we demonstrate using sex-mismatched chimeric hosts that bone marrow is not a significant source of endothelial or smooth muscle cells that comprise the neovessel. Furthermore, using composite grafts formed from seeded scaffold anastomosed to sex-mismatched natural vessel segments, we demonstrate that the adjacent vessel wall is the principal source of these endothelial and smooth muscle cells, forming 93% of proximal neotissue. These findings have important implications regarding fundamental mechanisms underlying neotissue formation; in this setting, the tissue-engineered construct functions by mobilizing the body's innate healing capabilities to “regenerate” neotissue from preexisting committed tissue cells.— Hibino, N., Villalona, G., Pietris, N., Duncan, D.

https://openalex.org/W2107655594,"Chemerin is an adipocyte-secreted protein that regulates adipogenesis and the metabolic function of mature adipocytes via activation of chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1). Herein we report the interaction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and chemerin in the context of adipogenesis. Knockdown of chemerin or CMKLR1 expression or antibody neutralization of secreted chemerin protein arrested adipogenic clonal expansion of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) by inducing a loss of G2/M cyclins (cyclin A2/B2) but not the G1/S cyclin D2. Forced expression of PPARγ in BMSCs did not completely rescue this loss of clonal expansion and adipogenesis following chemerin or CMKLR1 knockdown. However, forced expression and/or activation of PPARγ in BMSCs as well as non-adipogenic cell types such as NIH-3T3 embryonic fibroblasts and MCA38 colon carcinoma cells significantly induced chemerin expression and secretion. Sequence analysis revealed a putative PPARγ response element (PPRE) sequence within the chemerin promoter. This PPRE was able to confer PPARγ responsiveness on a heterologous promoter, and mutation of this sequence abolished activation of the chemerin promoter by PPARγ. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed the direct association of PPARγ with this PPRE. Treatment of mice with rosiglitazone elevated chemerin mRNA levels in adipose tissue and bone marrow coincident with an increase in circulating chemerin levels.

https://openalex.org/W1972798567,"Large gaps in basement membrane occur at sites of cell invasion and tissue remodelling in development and cancer. Though never followed directly in vivo, basement membrane dissolution or reduced synthesis have been postulated to create these gaps. Using landmark photobleaching and optical highlighting of laminin and type IV collagen, we find that a new mechanism, basement membrane sliding, underlies basement membrane gap enlargement during uterine-vulval attachment in Caenorhabditis elegans. Laser ablation and mutant analysis reveal that the invaginating vulval cells promote basement membrane movement. Further, an RNA interference and expression screen identifies the integrin INA-1/PAT-3 and VAB-19, homologue of the tumour suppressor Kank, as regulators of basement membrane opening. Both concentrate within vulval cells at the basement membrane gap boundary and halt expansion of the shifting basement membrane. Basement membrane sliding followed by targeted adhesion represents a new mechanism for creating precise basement membrane breaches that can be used by cells to break down compartment boundaries."

We focused on consanguineous Turkish families with a single affected member with complex bilateral occipital cortical gyration abnormalities. By using whole-exome sequencing, we initially identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion in LAMC3, the laminin γ3 gene, leading to an immediate premature termination codon. In two other affected individuals with nearly identical phenotypes, we identified a homozygous nonsense mutation and a compound heterozygous mutation. In human but not mouse fetal brain, LAMC3 is enriched in postmitotic cortical plate neurons, localizing primarily to the somatodendritic compartment. LAMC3 expression peaks between late gestation and late infancy, paralleling the expression of molecules that are important in dendritogenesis and synapse formation. The discovery of the molecular basis of this unusual occipital malformation furthers our understanding of the complex biology underlying the formation of cortical gyrations."
https://openalex.org/W1963872465,"Genetic evidence has implicated both Mdm2 and MdmX as essential in negative regulation of p53. However, the exact role of MdmX in this Mdm2-dependent protein degradation is not well understood. Most, if not all, previous Mdm2 studies used GST-Mdm2 fusion proteins in the in vitro assays. Here, we show that the p53 polyubiquitination activity of GST-Mdm2 is conferred by the GST tag and non-GST-tagged Mdm2 only catalyzes monoubiquitination of p53 even at extremely high concentrations. We further demonstrate that MdmX is a potent activator of Mdm2, facilitating dose-dependent p53 polyubiquitination. This activation process requires the RING domains of both MdmX and Mdm2 proteins. The polyubiquitination activity of Mdm2/MdmX is Mdm2-dependent. Unlike Mdm2 or MdmX overexpression alone, co-overexpression of MdmX and Mdm2 consistently triggered p53 degradation in cells. Moreover, cellular polyubiquitination of p53 was only observable in the cytoplasm where both Mdm2 and MdmX are readily detectable. Importantly, RNAi knockdown of MdmX increased levels of endogenous p53 accompanied by reduced p53 polyubiquitination. In conclusion, our work has resolved a major confusion in the field derived from using GST-Mdm2 and demonstrated that MdmX is the cellular activator that converts Mdm2 from a monoubiquitination E3 ligase to a polyubiquitination E3 ligase toward p53. Together, our findings provide a biochemical basis for the requirement of both Mdm2 and MdmX in the dynamic regulation of p53 stability."
https://openalex.org/W2035803015,"Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease that profoundly affects energy homeostasis. The disease involves failure at several levels and subsystems and is characterized by insulin resistance in target cells and tissues (i.e. by impaired intracellular insulin signaling). We have previously used an iterative experimental-theoretical approach to unravel the early insulin signaling events in primary human adipocytes. That study, like most insulin signaling studies, is based on in vitro experimental examination of cells, and the in vivo relevance of such studies for human beings has not been systematically examined. Herein, we develop a hierarchical model of the adipose tissue, which links intracellular insulin control of glucose transport in human primary adipocytes with whole-body glucose homeostasis. An iterative approach between experiments and minimal modeling allowed us to conclude that it is not possible to scale up the experimentally determined glucose uptake by the isolated adipocytes to match the glucose uptake profile of the adipose tissue in vivo. However, a model that additionally includes insulin effects on blood flow in the adipose tissue and GLUT4 translocation due to cell handling can explain all data, but neither of these additions is sufficient independently. We also extend the minimal model to include hierarchical dynamic links to more detailed models (both to our own models and to those by others), which act as submodules that can be turned on or off. The resulting multilevel hierarchical model can merge detailed results on different subsystems into a coherent understanding of whole-body glucose homeostasis. This hierarchical modeling can potentially create bridges between other experimental model systems and the in vivo human situation and offers a framework for systematic evaluation of the physiological relevance of in vitro obtained molecular/cellular experimental data."

B. anthracis SCWP is a polymer with the repeating structure [→6)-α-GlcNAc-(1→4)-β-ManNAc-(1→4)-β-GlcNAc-(1→]n, where α-GlcNAc is substituted with α-Gal and β-Gal at O3 and O4, respectively, and the β-GlcNAc is substituted with α-Gal at O3 (21Choudhury B.

The position of the ketal-pyruvate modification on the SCWP is not known. B. anthracis can form S-layers from both extractable antigen 1 (EA1) and surface array protein (Sap) by tethering the SLH domains of these polypeptides to pyruvylated SCWP (20Kern J. Ryan C. Faull K.

C-terminal to the SLH domains, S-layer proteins encode crystallization domains, sequences predicted to enable subunit-subunit interactions within the S-layer (22Mesnage S. Tosi-Couture E. Mock M. Gounon P. Fouet A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24Couture-Tosi E. Delacroix H. Mignot T. Mesnage S. Chami M. Fouet A. Mosser G. J.

Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A simple model for S-layer assembly is that secreted subunits are recruited to the edge of an extant S-layer network via enthalpy-driven interactions between crystallization domains and are then tethered to the SCWP via the SLH domains (11Mesnage S. Fontaine T. Mignot T. Delepierre M. Mock M. Fouet A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This model matches growth of the S-layer(s) with increases in the avidity of these networks for the cell wall. In this manner, bacilli assemble an S-layer on top of their peptidoglycan and thread PDGA capsule between S-layer protein subunits (26Mesnage S. Tosi-Couture E. Gounon P. Mock M. Fouet A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 52-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Richter S. Anderson V.J. Garufi G. Lu L. Budzik J.M. Joachimiak A. He C. Schneewind O. Missiakas D. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 404-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of S-layer assembly, we determined here the three-dimensional structure of the SLH domains of Sap by x-ray crystallography and further explored the mechanism of binding to the SCWP.DISCUSSIONBinding of SLH domains to pyruvylated secondary cell wall carbohydrates is thought to be an ancestral mechanism for the anchoring of S-layer proteins to the envelope of bacteria (41Cava F. De Pedro M.A. Schwarz H. Henne A. Berenguer J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). B. anthracis elaborates S-layers from two secreted polypeptides with N-terminal SLH domains, Sap and EA1 (22Mesnage S. Tosi-Couture E. Mock M. Gounon P. Fouet A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 42Etienne-Toumelin I. Sirard J.C. Duflot E. Mock M. Fouet A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 614-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SLH domains of Sap and EA1 bind to pyruvylated SCWP, a carbohydrate that is tethered via peptidoglycan linkage units to the murein sacculus of this microbe (20Kern J. Ryan C. Faull K. Schneewind O. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 401: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Sap and EA1 are synthesized by bacilli in great abundance and form two-dimensional para-crystalline arrays on solid surfaces, a feature that is encrypted in their large C-terminal crystallization domains (25Candela T. Mignot T. Hagnerelle X. Haustant M. Fouet A. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Twenty-two B. anthracis S-layer-associated proteins (BSLs) also harbor N-terminal SLH domains (19Kern J.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 504-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Unlike Sap and EA1, BSLs are minor components of the envelope that use their SLH domains to engage SCWPs but do not form para-crystalline arrays (19Kern J.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 504-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Kern J. Ryan C. Faull K. Schneewind O. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 401: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One of the S-layer associated proteins, BslA, promotes the adhesion of bacilli to host tissues and is required for the pathogenesis of anthrax disease (7Kern J.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 75: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Kern J.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 504-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The S-layer protein BslK binds to hemin, thereby contributing to an iron-uptake pathway that retrieves heme from hemoglobin for subsequent transport across the many layers of the B. anthracis envelope (6Tarlovsky Y. Fabian M. Solomaha E. Honsa E. Olson J.S. Maresso A.W. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 3503-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 43Maresso A.W. Garufi G. Schneewind O. PLoS pathogens. 2008; 4: e1000132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The AmiA protein contains three tandem SLH domains and is a peptidoglycan hydrolase (44Mesnage S. Fouet A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The molecular function of other S-layer proteins is not yet known, however, a set of eight, including AmiA, are putative hydrolases, which may act to shape the peptidoglycan layer of bacilli.Here we used x-ray crystallography to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the SLH domain of Sap, whose overall shape resembles that of a three-prong spindle. Molecular modeling experiments suggest that the SLH domains of other proteins assume a similar structure. Further, the inter-prong grooves of this domain can accommodate both linear and branched carbohydrates, i.e. the secondary cell wall polysaccharides that are known to function as the docking platform for the assembly of S-layers. Our experiments identify conserved residues in the SLH domains of Sap and other S-layer proteins of bacilli (Phe34, Asp36, Trp42, and Arg72) and we show that two of these, Asp36 and Arg72, contribute to their interaction with SCWP.The SCWP of B. anthracis is a polymer with the repeating structure [→6)-α-GlcNAc-(1→4)-β-ManNAc-(1→4)-β-GlcNAc-(1→]n, where α-GlcNAc is substituted α-Gal and β-Gal at O3 and O4, respectively, and the β-GlcNAc is substituted with α-Gal at O3 (21Choudhury B.

CsaB is thought to generate pyruvyl-ketal modifications of SCWP, which are a pre-requisite for S-layer assembly (11Mesnage S. Fontaine T. Mignot T. Delepierre M. Mock M. Fouet A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The pyruvyl-ketal introduces a strong negative charge modification into the polysaccharide that promotes binding of the SLH domains in S-layer proteins to the bacterial envelope (20Kern J. Ryan C. Faull K. Schneewind O. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 401: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We surmise that some of the conserved positively charged residues in the inter-prong grooves enable S-layer protein binding to the pyruvyl-ketal of SCWP (20Kern J. Ryan C. Faull K. Schneewind O. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 401: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Cholera toxin represents another secreted bacterial polypeptide that binds to carbohydrates, specifically the GM1 glycosphingolipid of host cell membranes (45van Heyningen W.E. Carpenter C.C. Pierce N.F. Greenough 3rd, W.B. J. Infect. Dis. 1971; 124: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cholera toxin B assembles into a pentameric ring structure (46Zhang R.G. Westbrook M.L. Westbrook E.M. Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Maulik P.R. Reed R.A. Shipley G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and docks onto the host cell receptor in a manner whereby subunit interfaces capture the glycosphingolipid ligand (47Merritt E.A. Sarfaty S. van den Akker F. L'Hoir C. Martial J.A. Hol W.G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Choleragenoid, the toxin B subunit alone, is used as a vaccine antigen to elicit protective antibodies that prevent association of toxin with GM1 receptor. A similar strategy may be plausible to prevent S-layer assembly, and this may provide protection against B. anthracis or other infectious agents that also use S-layer proteins for the pathogenesis of their associated diseases (16Leoff C. Saile E. Rauvolfova J. Quinn C.P. Hoffmaster A.R. Zhong W. Mehta A.S. Boons G.J. Carlson R.W. Kannenberg E.L. Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).

Most organisms that elaborate S-layers do so by abundantly producing and secreting a single protein species (3Sleytr U.B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 20: 5-12Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Whether an organism produces an S-layer as a component of its envelope structure is assessed by electron microscopy of the cell surface (4Houwink A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1953; 10: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this manner, species from nearly every branch of the Bacteria and Archaea have been discovered to produce S-layers (2Engelhardt H. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 160: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Proteins within S-layers fulfill variable functions in that they act either as a scaffold or enzyme in the bacterial envelope (5Houwink A.L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1956; 15: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), promote nutrient diffusion or transport (6Tarlovsky Y. Fabian M. Solomaha E. Honsa E. Olson J.S. Maresso A.W. J.

Microbiol. 2010; 75: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Most, but not all, S-layer proteins of bacteria share three tandem ∼55 amino acid repeats of the Surface Layer Homology (SLH) domain (8Fujino T.

Secreted proteins encoding three tandem SLH domains are tethered to the bacterial envelope by non-covalent interactions between the SLH domains and a secondary cell wall carbohydrate (11Mesnage S. Fontaine T. Mignot T. Delepierre M. Mock M. Fouet A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). SLH domains are remarkable for being both necessary and sufficient for the incorporation of chimeric proteins into S-layers (12Mesnage S. Tosi-Couture E. Fouet A. Mol.

The position of the ketal-pyruvate modification on the SCWP is not known. B. anthracis can form S-layers from both extractable antigen 1 (EA1) and surface array protein (Sap) by tethering the SLH domains of these polypeptides to pyruvylated SCWP (20Kern J. Ryan C. Faull K.

C-terminal to the SLH domains, S-layer proteins encode crystallization domains, sequences predicted to enable subunit-subunit interactions within the S-layer (22Mesnage S. Tosi-Couture E. Mock M.

A simple model for S-layer assembly is that secreted subunits are recruited to the edge of an extant S-layer network via enthalpy-driven interactions between crystallization domains and are then tethered to the SCWP via the SLH domains (11Mesnage S. Fontaine T. Mignot T. Delepierre M. Mock M. Fouet A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This model matches growth of the S-layer(s) with increases in the avidity of these networks for the cell wall. In this manner, bacilli assemble an S-layer on top of their peptidoglycan and thread PDGA capsule between S-layer protein subunits (26Mesnage S. Tosi-Couture E. Gounon P. Mock M. Fouet A. J.

To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of S-layer assembly, we determined here the three-dimensional structure of the SLH domains of Sap by x-ray crystallography and further explored the mechanism of binding to the SCWP. DISCUSSIONBinding of SLH domains to pyruvylated secondary cell wall carbohydrates is thought to be an ancestral mechanism for the anchoring of S-layer proteins to the envelope of bacteria (41Cava F. De Pedro M.A. Schwarz H. Henne A. Berenguer J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). B. anthracis elaborates S-layers from two secreted polypeptides with N-terminal SLH domains, Sap and EA1 (22Mesnage S. Tosi-Couture E. Mock M. Gounon P. Fouet A. Mol.

The SLH domains of Sap and EA1 bind to pyruvylated SCWP, a carbohydrate that is tethered via peptidoglycan linkage units to the murein sacculus of this microbe (20Kern J. Ryan C. Faull K. Schneewind O. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 401: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Sap and EA1 are synthesized by bacilli in great abundance and form two-dimensional para-crystalline arrays on solid surfaces, a feature that is encrypted in their large C-terminal crystallization domains (25Candela T. Mignot T. Hagnerelle X. Haustant M. Fouet A. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).

Unlike Sap and EA1, BSLs are minor components of the envelope that use their SLH domains to engage SCWPs but do not form para-crystalline arrays (19Kern J.W. Schneewind O. Mol.

One of the S-layer associated proteins, BslA, promotes the adhesion of bacilli to host tissues and is required for the pathogenesis of anthrax disease (7Kern J.W. Schneewind O. Mol.

The S-layer protein BslK binds to hemin, thereby contributing to an iron-uptake pathway that retrieves heme from hemoglobin for subsequent transport across the many layers of the B. anthracis envelope (6Tarlovsky Y.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The molecular function of other S-layer proteins is not yet known, however, a set of eight, including AmiA, are putative hydrolases, which may act to shape the peptidoglycan layer of bacilli.Here we used x-ray crystallography to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the SLH domain of Sap, whose overall shape resembles that of a three-prong spindle. Molecular modeling experiments suggest that the SLH domains of other proteins assume a similar structure. Further, the inter-prong grooves of this domain can accommodate both linear and branched carbohydrates, i.e. the secondary cell wall polysaccharides that are known to function as the docking platform for the assembly of S-layers. Our experiments identify conserved residues in the SLH domains of Sap and other S-layer proteins of bacilli (Phe34, Asp36, Trp42, and Arg72) and we show that two of these, Asp36 and Arg72, contribute to their interaction with SCWP.The SCWP of B. anthracis is a polymer with the repeating structure [→6)-α-GlcNAc-(1→4)-β-ManNAc-(1→4)-β-GlcNAc-(1→]n, where α-GlcNAc is substituted α-Gal and β-Gal at O3 and O4, respectively, and the β-GlcNAc is substituted with α-Gal at O3 (21Choudhury B.

https://openalex.org/W2167805484,"The transmembrane metalloprotease aminopeptidase-N (APN)/CD13 is overexpressed in various solid and hematological malignancies in humans, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is thought to influence tumor progression. Here, we investigated the contribution of APN/CD13 to the regulation of growth and survival processes in AML cells in vitro. Anti-CD13 monoclonal antibodies MY7 and SJ1D1 (which do not inhibit APN activity) and WM15 (an APN-blocking antibody) inhibited the growth of the AML cell line U937 and induced apoptosis, as evidenced by cell accumulation in the sub-G1 phase, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine externalization. Isotype-matched IgG1 and the APN/CD13 enzymatic inhibitors bestatin and 2' ,3-dinitroflavone-8-acetic acid, were ineffective. Internalization of CD13-MY7 complex into cells was followed by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 down-regulation, Bax up-regulation, caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP-1. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and the caspase-9- and caspase-8-specific inhibitors significantly attenuated apoptosis. CD13 ligation also induced apoptosis and PARP-1 cleavage in primary AML blasts, whereas normal blood cells were not affected. Overall, these data provide new evidence that CD13 can serve as a target for inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis in AML (independently of its APN activity). These findings may have implications for tumor biology and treatment.—Piedfer, M., Dauzonne, D., Tang, R., N'Guyen, J., Billard, C., Bauvois, B.

Another study reported that proliferation-induced lymphocyte-associated receptor (PILAR) (also named KACL/CLEC2A) is a second ligand of human CD161 (7Huarte E. Cubillos-Ruiz J.R. Nesbeth Y.C.

Recently, in addition to the CD161-LLT1 recognition, various interactions among KLR family members were reported, such as those between NKp80 and AICL and between NKp65 and PILAR (KACL) (8Spreu J.

NKp80 binds to AICL with low affinity (Kd ∼4 μm), whereas NKp65 binds to PILAR (KACL) with high affinity (Kd ∼0.01 μm). However, their molecular recognition modes have remained elusive. Here, we have determined the biophysical characteristics of the CD161-LLT1 interaction, including the kinetic and thermodynamic properties, by a surface plasmon resonance analysis. Based on a broad mutagenesis study, we identified the binding sites for both LLT1 and CD161 as the membrane distal areas, which are also utilized for ligand binding by other KLR members (CD94-NKG2-MHCI and KLRG1-E-cadherin (11Li Y.

Immunity. 2009; 31: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)), and revealed the first binding topology template for interactions among KLR family members. The DNA fragment encoding the extracellular domain (amino acid residues Leu71–Val191) of human LLT1 was amplified from the cDNA (code number EHS1001-437530, Open Biosystems). The amplified fragment was cloned into the expression vector pET-22b(+) (Novagen), to create the plasmid pET22bLLT1. The DNA fragment encoding the extracellular domain (amino acid residues Gly90–Ser225) of human CD161 was amplified from human lymphocyte-derived cDNA. The fragment was cloned into a derivative of the expression vector pCA7 (12Takeda M. Ohno S. Seki F. Nakatsu Y. Tahara M. Yanagi Y. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14346-14354Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), to create the plasmid pCA7CD161. This vector contains the signal sequence (upstream of the protein-coding sequence) derived from the pHLsec vector (13Aricescu A.R. Assenberg R. Bill R.M. Busso D. Chang V.T. Davis S.J. Dubrovsky A.

Tarboureich N. Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Jones E.Y. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1114-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The biotin ligase (BirA) recognition sequence (GSLHHILDAQKMVWNHR) was inserted between the signal sequence and Gly90 of the CD161 sequence for the SPR analysis. The expression plasmid pET22bLLT1 was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. The cells were cultured in LB medium with 100 mg/liter ampicillin (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at 310 K. When the A600 reached 0.6, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Nacalai Tesque) was added for induction, at a final concentration of 1 mm. The recombinant LLT1 protein was expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies. After 4 h of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The inclusion bodies were isolated from the cell pellet by sonication and were washed repeatedly with Triton wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100). The purified LLT1 inclusion bodies were solubilized in denaturant buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 6 m guanidine HCl). The solubilized protein solution was slowly diluted by the addition of ice-cold refolding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1 m l-arginine, 3.73 mm cystamine, 6.73 mm cysteamine) to a final protein concentration of 2 μm. After 72 h at 277 K, the refolded protein solution was concentrated with a VIVAFLOW50 system (Sartorius). The LLT1 protein was purified by size exclusion chromatography, using a Superdex-75 column (GE Healthcare). The expression plasmid pCA7CD161 was transiently transfected, using polyethyleneimine, into 90% confluent HEK293T cells. The cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma), supplemented with 10% FCS (Nichirei Bioscience), l-glutamine, and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). The DMEM medium was substituted with serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) medium immediately after transfection. The culture supernatant was harvested 72 h after transfection. The supernatant was concentrated and replaced with Tris buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), using an AmiconUltra filter (nominal molecular weight limit of 10,000; Millipore Corp.). The CD161 was biotinylated with the BirA enzyme. After biotinylation, the buffer of the reaction mixture was replaced with HBS-EP (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20). The mutagenesis of C163S and H176C of LLT1 was performed using a KOD Plus mutagenesis kit (Toyobo) with pET22bLLT1 as the template, to produce pET22bLLT1C163S and pET22bLLT1H176C, respectively. In addition, H176C-based mutagenesis (Y165A, N167A, K169E, R175E, R180E, and K181E) were performed, using pET22bLLT1H176C as the template. All LLT1 mutants were prepared in the same manner as the wild type. Similarly, CD161 mutageneses (E162R, E179R, E179A, R181E, D183R, K185E, K185A, E186R, Y198A, E200R, E200A, Y201A, and E205R) were performed using pCA7CD161. All CD161 mutants were prepared in the same manner as the wild type. SPR experiments were performed using a BIAcore3000 (GE Healthcare). The biotinylated CD161 and control protein (biotinylated BSA) were immobilized on research grade CM5 chips (GE Healthcare), covalently coupled with streptavidin. The purified LLT1 proteins were buffer-substituted with HBS-EP and injected over the immobilized CD161, at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The binding response at each concentration was calculated by subtracting the equilibrium response, measured in the control flow cell, from the response in each sample flow cell. The data were analyzed using BIAevaluation software, version 4.1, and ORIGIN software, version 7. Affinity constants (Kd) were derived by nonlinear curve fitting of the standard Langmuir binding isotherm. For kinetics, the LLT1 was injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The global fitting analysis using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model was simultaneously performed with the raw data for the association and dissociation phases at different concentrations of the LLT1 protein. Fitting was performed using the BIA evaluation software, version 4.1. Equilibrium analyses of LLT1 were performed at five temperature points (283.15, 288.15, 293.15, 298.15, and 303.15 K). The standard state Gibbs energy change upon binding was obtained from Equation 1, ΔG=RTInKdEq. 1 where Kd is the dissociation constant, expressed in units of mol/liter, and R is the gas constant. The ΔG values of each data set were plotted against the temperatures and were fitted with the nonlinear van't Hoff equation (Equation 2), ΔG=ΔH-TΔS+ΔCp(T-298.15)-ΔCpTIn(T/298.15)Eq. 2 where ΔH and ΔS are the binding enthalpy and entropy at 298.15 K, respectively, and ΔCp is the heat capacity, which is assumed to be temperature-independent. CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO model J-805 CD spectrometer. Far-UV CD measurements were performed with a 20 μm concentration of each protein in HBS-EP buffer, using a 1-mm cell and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Spectra were accumulated four times. The extracellular domain of human LLT1 receptor was expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies and was refolded in vitro by a dilution method. The refolded LLT1 migrated as a monomer and was purified by size exclusion chromatography, and the final product exhibited high purity (Fig. 1A). The wild type LLT1 tended to aggregate. We compared the amino acid sequence of the extracellular region of LLT1 with those of other C-type lectin family members, by a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search. Human CD69 (hCD69), whose crystal structure was determined previously, shares 40% identity with the extracellular region of LLT1 (Fig. 2, A and C). The crystal structure of hCD69 revealed that its C-type lectin-like domain has three disulfide bonds. The Cys163 and His176 residues of LLT1 are equivalent to the Cys173 and Cys186 residues of hCD69, respectively. His176 cannot form the disulfide bond with Cys163, and thus Cys163 is a free cysteine. We expected that this might destabilize the protein and thus introduced the H176C mutation, to allow disulfide bond formation with Cys163. As another option, we substituted Cys163 with serine, to eliminate the free cysteine residue. The C163S and H176C mutants were both expressed and refolded by the same method as that used for the wild type. The size exclusion chromatography profiles and the CD spectra of these mutants were essentially the same as those of the wild type (supplemental Fig. S1). The stability of the C163S mutant was not improved, and the protein still tended to precipitate; however, the H176C mutant was stable enough for use in further biophysical experiments.FIGURE 2Amino acid sequence alignment and structure of CTLDs.

However, using HEK293T cells, the extracellular region of CD161 with the C-terminal biotinylation tag could be expressed transiently, as a soluble protein (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). The secreted CD161 was biotinylated with the BirA enzyme and was specifically immobilized on the streptavidin-coupled sensor chip for the SPR analysis. To analyze the molecular interaction between CD161 and LLT1, we performed an SPR analysis, using the above mentioned recombinant proteins. Soluble LLT1 proteins were injected over sensor surfaces to which biotinylated CD161 or biotinylated BSA (as a negative control) had been immobilized. The affinity constants of LLT1 binding to CD161 were determined by an equilibrium binding analysis. The response derived from the negative control was subtracted from each response derived from the CD161 protein. Fig. 1B shows the conventional plots of these binding data. CD161 bound the wild type, C163S, and H176C LLT1 proteins with similar affinities, and the respective dissociation constants (Kd) were 53, 52, and 48 μm at 298.15 K. We confirmed that the CD161 binding to the immobilized LLT1 in the inverted orientation also shows similar binding characteristics with weak affinity and fast kinetics (data not shown); however, the soluble CD161 was prone to aggregation, and thus the precise binding parameters could not be determined. The equilibrium binding data for CD161 binding with the wild type and C163S and H176C mutants of LLT1 indicated fast kinetics (supplemental Fig. S2). Both the wild type and C163S LLT1 proteins were unstable and tended to aggregate, making it difficult to obtain precise association and dissociation rates. On the other hand, the H176C mutant exhibited much higher solubility and stability than the others. Therefore, the H176C LLT1 mutant was used as the standard template for further analyses, including kinetics, thermodynamics, and mutagenesis studies (hereafter, the H176C LLT1 protein is referred to simply as the “LLT1 protein”). The detailed kinetic parameters of the CD161-LLT1 interaction were determined by global fitting of the monoexponential rate equations, derived from the simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model, to the binding responses. Fig. 1C illustrates the reasonable fitting with small residual errors (bottom panel) to the data for LLT1 binding, which yielded typical association (kon = 1.1 ± 0.1 × 105 m−1 s−1) and fast dissociation (koff = 5.3 ± 0.55 s−1) kinetics similar to those of other cell-cell recognition receptors (Table 1 and supplemental Table SI). The kinetically derived Kd and that determined by equilibrium binding were essentially the same, providing further evidence that these kinetic parameters are correct.TABLE 1Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between LLT1 and CD161 at 25 °CImmobilizedAnalyteKineticsaThe values are means ± range of two experiments.Kd, eqbKd, eq values were obtained from the equilibrium analysis.kon (× 105)koffKd, kincKd, kin values were obtained from global fitting.μmm−1 s−1s−1μmCD161Wild type LLT152.6C163S LLT151.8H176C LLT148.21.1 ± 0.15.3 ± 0.5548.5 ± 7.5ThermodynamicsdThe values are means ± S.E. of three experiments.ΔGΔH−TΔSΔCpkcal/molkcal/mol/KCD161H176C LLT1−5.9 ± 0.02−3.2 ± 0.13−2.7 ± 0.11−0.41 ± 0.01a The values are means ± range of two experiments.b Kd, eq values were obtained from the equilibrium analysis.c Kd, kin values were obtained from global fitting.d The values are means ± S.E. of three experiments. Open table in a new tab The non-linear van't Hoff analysis (Equation 2) was performed to determine the thermodynamic parameters. The binding affinities of the CD161-LLT1 interaction were determined at five temperatures, from 283.15 to 303.15 K. Reasonable fitting of the non-linear van't Hoff equation to the data produced the proper thermodynamic parameters (Fig. 1D). The binding of LLT1 to CD161 was characterized by favorable entropic and enthalpic changes at 298.15 K (Table 1 and Fig. 1E), in contrast to the TCR-MHC interactions (14Boniface J.J. Reich Z.

In addition, the TCR-MHC interaction exhibited slow kinetics. This characteristic is believed to be caused by the adjustment of the flexible ligand binding site (“induced fit”) and/or the trapping of water molecules at the binding interface. The CD161-LLT1 interaction exhibited a moderate ΔCp of ∼0.41 kcal mol−1 K−1. Taken together, the binding properties of the CD161-LLT1 interaction are characterized by entropically and enthalpically driven binding, a small ΔCp, and fast kinetics (20Stites W.E. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), indicating that only small conformational changes may be required for binding. This is similar to other low affinity interactions of cell-cell recognition molecules, including the KIR2DL3-HLA-Cw7 (21Maenaka K. Juji T. Nakayama T. Wyer J.R. Gao G.F. Maenaka T. Zaccai N.R.

To identify the CD161 binding site on LLT1, a wide range of LLT1 mutants were prepared (see “Experimental Procedures”) and used for the SPR analysis. LLT1 and CD161 are quite similar to the other KLRs (whereas LLT1 displays 40% amino acid identity to hCD69, CD161 displays 30% to murine Dectin-1 (mDectin-1)) (Fig. 2). The typical structure of a KLR, as depicted by KLRG1 in Fig. 3A, reveals a conventional C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) fold, comprising two α-helices (α1 and α2) and two antiparallel β-sheets (β0-β1-β5-β1′ and β2′-β2-β3-β4-β2″). Although the ligands for the KLRs are different (for MHC, Ly49 (24Dam J. Guan R. Natarajan K. Dimasi N. Chlewicki L.K. Kranz D.M. Schuck P. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. Nat.

Immunity. 2009; 31: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)), they utilize their membrane-distal head region for ligand binding (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3). Based on the crystal structures of hCD69 (for LLT1) and mDectin-1 (for CD161), we designed mutations in the putative ligand binding regions to identify the interaction sites (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3B). Six LLT1 mutants (Y165A, N167A, K169E, R175E, R180E, and K181E) were properly refolded (supplemental Fig. S1), and the SPR analysis showed that all of the mutants exhibited reduced or undetectable CD161 binding (Fig. 3C). Notably, the K169E, R175E, R180E, and K181E mutations completely disrupted the CD161 binding. The Y165A and N167A mutations of LLT1 had moderate effects on the interaction, resulting in a 4–5-fold decrease in the interaction affinity. In another orientation, to clarify the LLT1 binding site on CD161, 13 CD161 mutants (E162R, E179R, E179A, R181E, D183R, K185E, K185A, E186R, Y198A, E200R, E200A, Y201A, and E205R) were expressed and biotinylated, using the same method as for the wild type (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3B). We examined the conformations of the CD161 proteins using a mouse anti-human CD161 monoclonal antibody (mAb) B199.2 (Abcam), which only recognizes the conformational epitope of CD161 (26Bennett I.M. Zatsepina O. Zamai L. Azzoni L. Mikheeva T. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1845-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Wild type CD161 and all of the mutants were recognized by mAb B199.2 (supplemental Fig. S4), indicating that they are all properly folded. The SPR analysis revealed that, although the E179R, K185E, and E200R mutations had no substantial impact on LLT1 binding, the alanine mutations of these three residues disrupted the LLT1 binding. The R181E and E186R mutations of CD161 had modest effects on binding, resulting in a 2–3-fold decrease in the affinity. The E162R, D183R, Y198A, Y201A, and E205R mutations of CD161 had detrimental effects on binding (Fig. 3C). We performed SPR binding analyses of combinations between the LLT1 and CD161 mutants to identify the mutation combination(s) restoring the binding activity and thus to provide the putative binding pair(s). Although almost all of the LLT1 mutations were unable to bind to the CD161 mutants, the K169E mutation restored the binding to the CD161 E205R mutant (Fig. 4A and Table 2). This strongly suggests that Lys169 of LLT1 directly interacts with Glu205 of CD161. Y198A and Y201A CD161 mutants abolished binding to all LLT1 mutants, and E162R and D183R CD161 mutants displayed little affinity to the wild type LLT1 and no binding to the other mutants. On the other hand, R175E, R180E, and K181E mutants rendered LLT1 unable to bind to all of the CD161 mutants. These residues showing the most significant effects are located close together and a bit far from the Glu205(CD161)-Lys169(LLT1) binding partners. The same strategy has been employed to determine binding orientations, by identifying the effects of charge swap mutations on the typical low affinity binding often observed in cell-cell recognition events (e.g. CD2-CD48 (27van der Merwe P.A. McNamee P.N. Davies E.A. Barclay A.N. Davis S.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 74-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and TCR-MHC complexes (28Jorgensen J.L. Esser U. Fazekas de St Groth B. Reay P.A. Davis M.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar)). Together with the present study, the results suggest that amino acid substitutions in these low affinity interactions are relatively tolerated. Therefore, the charge swap mutation strategy would be useful for determining the binding orientation in cell-cell recognition receptors.TABLE 2Binding affinities of LLT1 mutants for immobilized CD161 mutants at 25 °CCD161KdWT LLT1Y165AN167AK169ER175ER180EK181EμmWild type48240180NBaNB, no detectable binding.NBNBNBE162R310NBNBNBNBNBNBE179R34150120300NBNBNBE179A393NBNBNBNBNBNBR181E100210140NBNBNBNBD183R390NBNBNBNBNBNBK185E55170140310NBNBNBK185A236180149318NBNBNBE186R150NBNBNBNBNBNBY198ANBNBNBNBNBNBNBE200R45NBNBNBNBNBNBE200ANBNBNBNBNBNBNBY201ANBNBNBNBNBNBNBE205R370NBNB26NBNBNBa NB, no detectable binding. Open table in a new tab Considering the above results together with the electrostatic and hydrophilic/hydrophobic complementation, we constructed a feasible model of the CD161-LLT1 complex, using the hCD69 and mDectin-1 structures as templates. Both CD161 and LLT1 utilize similar membrane-distal head regions, from the β3 strand (Tyr165) to the β5 strand (Lys181) of LLT1 and from the β2-β3 loop (Glu162) to the β4-β5 loop (Glu205) of CD161, for binding, and thus the complex model resembles a symmetrical dimer (Fig. 4B). This complex structure supports the previous report that PILAR (KACL) cannot bind to CD161 (8Spreu J. Kuttruff S. Stejfova V. Dennehy K.M. Schittek B. Steinle A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We further investigated the binding modes of other KLR-KLR interactions, such as NKp80-AICL and NKp65-PILAR. Notably, the putative binding sites (especially the β3 to β4-β5 loop regions) of the CD161-LLT1 complex model were relatively conserved, in either the CD161 relatives (CD161/NKp65/NKP80) or the LLT1 relatives (LLT1/PILAR/AICL) (Figs. 2, A and B, and 4C). This strongly suggests that the KLR-KLR recognition involves a common binding mode. On the other hand, the amino acid differences, including the binding pair residues, Val224(NKp80)-Asp129(AICL) and Thr188(NKp65)-Asp152(PILAR), corresponding to Glu205(CD161)-Lys169(LLT1) (Fig. 4, B and C), would contribute to discrete ligand specificities. We constructed the CD161 dimer-LLT1 dimer complex model structure without any disruption of the proposed interaction topology, as shown in supplemental Fig. S5. If the dimer-dimer interaction occurred on the cell-cell interface, then this would probably show an avidity effect to enhance the binding activity. In this report, we showed that CD161 binds LLT1 with low affinity, fast kinetics, and entropically and enthalpically driven thermodynamics with a small heat capacity, which are typical features for interactions mediating cell-cell recognition. Furthermore, we revealed a new recognition mode between KLR family members. As in the other KLRs, CD161 and LLT1 both utilize similar membrane-distal head β-sheet and loop regions for binding. The binding pair residues, revealed by the mutation combinations, suggested a plausible CD161-LLT1 complex model, which is the first template model for the interactions between KLR family members, such as NKp65-PILAR and NKp80-AICL, that explains their binding specificities."

AID deaminates C to U in B cells in variable (V) and switch (S) regions of immunoglobulin genes that are undergoing active transcription. Deaminations in the V region are responsible for initiating somatic hypermutation, and those in the S region initiate class switch recombination (1Peled J.U. Kuang F.L. Iglesias-Ussel M.D. Roa S.

These regulatory processes are multifaceted with poorly defined basic properties. How is AID targeted to the V and S regions, for example? What are its principal partnering proteins and regulatory elements? Why does AID fail to target concurrently transcribed non-V and non-S regions? Or if AID were to attack other transcribed regions, do these undergo efficient base excision and mismatch repair (1Peled J.U. Kuang F.L. Iglesias-Ussel M.D. Roa S. Kalis S.L. Goodman M.F.

In light of the uncertainties of how AID functions in complex biological systems, as an initial step it is both essential and timely to study the behavior of AID in the simplest cases, when it acts on naked ssDNA and on actively transcribed dsDNA. It is timely because AID is the subject of numerous recent studies, and enzymes that scan ssDNA are poorly understood compared with those that scan dsDNA. It is essential because a fundamental knowledge of how AID scans DNA in the absence of putative binding proteins, e.g. RNA exosome proteins or Spt5 (18Basu U. Meng F.L. Keim C. Grinstein V.

Here, we have taken an approach that detects processive AID-catalyzed C deaminations occurring at large numbers of targets, including combinations of hot, cold, and neutral motifs on the same ssDNA substrate. We enumerate the distribution of deaminations along individual ssDNA molecules, with each substrate acted on by a single AID molecule. The deaminated motifs occur as isolated singletons and as clusters of various lengths and spaces between clusters. We have determined how neighboring motifs alter C deamination patterns and probabilities and have formulated a random walk model to analyze the statistical properties of AID-catalyzed deamination. The model is indispensable in dissecting scanning and specifically how individual mutations along with mutational clusters are likely to arise while AID moves along the DNA and to determine deamination efficiencies and motion distances based on a model fit to the data. Uracil DNA glycosylase and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylases that scan dsDNA to find and excise rare aberrant bases are catalytically efficient (23Blainey P.C. van Oijen A.M. Banerjee A.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10791-10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast, when scanning ssDNA, AID encounters many C deamination motifs, while leaving many of these untouched. We suggest that a catalytically inefficient enzyme is well suited for generating antibody diversity. Oligonucleotides containing various AID C deamination trinucleotide motifs and their complementary strands were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 3400 DNA/RNA synthesizer, purified, and 5′-end phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Affymetrix Corp.). Double-stranded DNA cassettes, containing a 5′-TTAA overhang, were formed by annealing each oligonucleotide with its complementary strand at a 1:1 molar ratio. M13mp2 phage DNA constructs, with either two or three cassettes, were constructed after several ligation steps. First, the dsDNA cassette with 30 alternating AAC and CAG motifs was ligated into a unique EcoRI site of M13mp2 phage DNA in a lacZα mutational reporter gene creating a construct with a single inserted cassette (AAC AGC)15. In the next ligation, dsDNA cassettes containing either 30 alternating AAC and GTC motifs, 30 alternating AAC and GAC motifs, or AAC and AGC motifs with an irregular composition were inserted into a newly formed EcoRI site on the right-hand side of the (AAC AGC)15 cassettes. The construct containing two cassettes with single AGC motifs (AGC32-AGC24) was constructed by a similar procedure. The recombinant M13 phage DNAs were used to prepare gap substrates located within an ssDNA region containing the inserted cassettes flanked by the lacZα sequence (270 nt on the 5′-side and 95 nt on the 3′-side) as described previously (14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 424: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The construct (AAC AGC)15-(AAC GTC)15 containing a 24-nt dsDNA region (see Fig. 3d) was formed by annealing a complementary 24-nt oligonucleotide with the gapped DNA at 3:1 molar ratio. The constructs for transcription-dependent deamination were constructed by replacing 18 nt (positions −89 to −72) upstream of lacZα with the T7 promoter sequence using a Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs). Wild type GST-tagged AID protein was expressed in baculovirus Sf9-infected insect cells and purified as described previously (15Bransteitter R. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51612-51621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Purified GST-tagged AID was dialyzed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol and stored at −70 °C. Time course reactions for AID-catalyzed deaminations of C to U were performed as follows. GST-tagged AID (300 ng) was preactivated by incubation with 300 ng of RNase A (Sigma) (30Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA in a total volume of 90 μl for 2 min at 37 °C. The deamination reactions were initiated by transferring the entire enzyme mixture into a pre-warmed tube containing 3 μg of a gapped DNA substrate in 90 μl of a buffer solution containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. In deamination experiments performed in the presence of salt, 150 mm NaCl was included in the reaction. Following incubations at 37 °C for 15, 30, and 45 s and 1, 2, and 5 min, 30-μl aliquots were withdrawn and quenched by a double extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The DNA products at each time point were transfected into uracil glycosylase-deficient (ung−) E. coli cells and plated on α-complementation host cells in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside as described previously (14Pham P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51612-51621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). T7 RNA polymerase transcription-dependent AID deamination was measured using a covalently closed circular dsDNA M13mp substrate containing the inserted CAG32-CAG24 cassettes with an upstream T7 promoter. In a typical reaction (30 μl volume), dsDNA substrate (50 ng) was incubated with T7 RNA polymerase (1 μl), AID (300 ng), and RNase A (300 ng) in a reaction buffer containing HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.5), dithiothreitol (1 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), and rNTPs (250 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by extracting twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The DNA reaction products were transfected into ung− E. coli competent cells and plated on α-complementation host cells. The occurrence of C deaminations within the inserted cassettes create stop codon(s) within the lacZα reading frame giving rise to clear mutant M13 plaques. Mutant M13 phage DNA was isolated, and the inserted cassettes and the lacZα portion on the 3′-side of the cassettes were sequenced. C→U deaminations were detected as C→T transition mutations. We have written a computer program to simulate the various models. We tested these models and their parameter values via the parametric bootstrap. For each set of parameter values for each model, and for each number of mutations per clone between 2 and 10, we separately simulated 10,000 independent clones. We then calculated the likelihood of a clone from the data set by comparing the statistics for this clone to the statistics for those simulations with the same number of mutations per clone. For the distance between mutations statistics, we assumed the distances were independent. To calculate the likelihood of a clone, we measured the distances between mutations in this clone, found the fraction of times each distance was found in the simulations (for one particular model and set of parameter values these fractions are shown in Table 2), and multiplied these fractions together. The calculation was different for the mutation cluster size statistic (we did not use the fractions in Table 1), because clusters were not independent, e.g. if there are two mutations per clone and one mutation is a singleton then the other mutation has to be a singleton too. For this statistic, we computed the unordered set of cluster sizes found in the clone and counted the fraction of simulations that have this same set. To calculate the likelihood of the entire data set, we multiplied the likelihoods for each of the clones. To test whether these data were consistent with both the model and the parameter values, we independently simulated the same number of clones with the same number of mutations per clone as in the actual data set. We then calculated the likelihood of this simulated data set. We repeated this process many times to generate a distribution of simulated likelihoods and compared the likelihood of the actual data to this distribution. We repeated the entire process for different parameter values and for different models.TABLE 2Distance between mutated motifs in clones with 2–10 mutations in the combined (AAC AGC)15 cassettesMutations/cloneDistribution of distance between mutated motifs (%)012345–1011–1516–2021–292Data (209)aNumbers in parentheses are the number of sequenced clones.2.411.05.79.14.827.819.112.47.72SimulatedbSimulated refers to the modified random walk model (see text) with the following parameters: AID-catalyzed deamination efficiency in AAC motif = 3%; average slide distance obtained from geometric distribution = 30 nt (10 motifs).8.59.06.77.96.126.316.211.67.73Data (113)8.88.85.39.38.431.420.45.81.83Simulated11.511.49.19.06.927.914.57.02.74Data (64)14.614.66.88.96.331.816.11.00.04Simulated13.814.510.410.77.527.111.33.90.85Data (55)15.917.79.512.76.425.910.51.40.05Simulated17.317.011.411.67.824.88.02.00.26Data (37)15.120.58.611.416.223.83.80.50.06Simulated20.318.812.811.68.022.15.40.90.07Data (27)16.723.513.68.67.427.82.50.00.07Simulated23.420.813.312.07.818.93.50.40.08Data (19)21.821.811.312.012.020.30.80.00.08Simulated26.522.714.011.87.115.62.10.10.09Data (16)25.827.312.59.45.519.50.00.00.09Simulated29.524.214.411.46.712.71.20.00.010Data (12)30.625.912.013.95.612.00.00.00.010Simulated32.925.114.210.96.010.20.60.00.0a Numbers in parentheses are the number of sequenced clones.b Simulated refers to the modified random walk model (see text) with the following parameters: AID-catalyzed deamination efficiency in AAC motif = 3%; average slide distance obtained from geometric distribution = 30 nt (10 motifs).

Our objective was to explore the properties of a stochastic scanning mechanism in which C deaminations either may or may not occur when a motif is encountered by AID and to determine motif deamination efficiencies per encounter. What was required was an ssDNA substrate containing a defined series of detectable target motifs and a mathematical model to analyze the stochastic nature of the scanning and deamination events. We have synthesized a series of ssDNA substrates containing combinations of WRC hot motifs and non-WRC motifs inserted as in-frame cassettes embedded within a lacZ reporter gene (Fig. 1). The conversion of C→U in any of these motifs generated a stop codon in lacZα, causing a lacZ+ → lacZ− mutation, which results in a colorless M13 mutant phage plaque. We considered two hot motifs AAC and AGC, the latter one we call hot′, one cold motif GTC, and one neutral (i.e. neither WRC nor SYC) GAC motif. To ensure that virtually all mutated cassettes were acted on by no more than a single AID molecule, AID and ssDNA concentrations were chosen so that colorless (mutant)/blue (wild type) plaque ratios were always less than about 2%, as prescribed by Poisson statistics (14Pham P. Bransteitter R. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2003; 424: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 15Bransteitter R. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51612-51621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the AGC32-AGC24 construct (Fig. 1a), the number of mutations/clone occurring as a function of length of exposure to AID shows that there are three or fewer mutations for short (15 s) incubations with AID, with about 75% of the clones containing one mutation (Fig. 2a). A 30-s exposure results in about 60–65% of the clones having 1 mutation, 15 to 20% with 2 mutations, about 10% with 3 mutations, and about 5% with ≥5 mutations (Fig. 2a). At longer incubations with AID, there is an increase in the clones with more mutations and a decrease in clones with fewer mutations, and at 5 min, about 65% of the clones contain ≥5 mutations (Fig. 2a). Similar results are obtained for another construct (AAC AGC)15-(AAC GAC)15-(AAC GAC)15 (Fig. 2a). There is a linear increase in mutations with time for both constructs, with an average rate of about 1 mutation per 46 s to 1 mutation per 63 s (Fig. 2b). The concomitant increase in multiple mutations/clone at the expense of fewer mutations/clone was further evidence that AID acts processively; otherwise, a more rapid dissociation of AID in bulk solution, enabling it to gain access to new ssDNA substrates, would result in a persisting higher percentage of clones with fewer mutations. These slow average rates at which deaminations accumulate suggest that AID is spending most of the time either immobile or much more likely moving along the ssDNA backbone, although only occasionally in a catalytically competent conformation suitable for C deamination. There are often numerous mutations appearing in the same clone suggesting that AID is actively mobile on the DNA (Fig. 3c). To deduce how AID scans ssDNA, we have combined the data from the left-hand cassettes of three constructs composed of alternating AAC hot and AGC hot′ motifs (Fig. 1, b–d), containing a total of >1100 sequenced DNA clones. About half the clones have a single mutation and about half contain from 2 to 10 mutations, with a small number of additional clones containing >10 mutations. The mutation spectrum obtained by pooling data from clones containing exactly one mutation shows that the C deaminations occur in an approximately spatially uniform manner along the ssDNA, with every motif undergoing deamination (Fig. 3a). The AAC motif has a deamination frequency that is consistently ∼1.8-fold higher than the AGC motif. When clones with 2–10 mutations are combined with clones with 1 mutation, we find that these deaminations are also uniform, and the deamination frequency of the AAC motif is 1.8-fold higher than the AGC motif (Fig. 3b). Favored deamination of AAC over AGC occurs at 14/15 motif sites, the sole exception occurring at the junction between the alternating hot spot motifs and the 9-nt spacer sequence (Fig. 3, a and b). The mutational patterns were determined by sequencing every DNA clone. Representative clones are shown in Fig. 3c, where the symbol T indicates that a mutation, i.e. deamination has taken place at that motif, and the symbol “.” denotes that no deamination has occurred. In Fig. 3c, red represents AAC hot motifs, and orange represents the AGC hot′ motifs. The data show that some mutations are isolated, and others are clustered (Fig. 3c). We define a cluster as a series of mutated motifs where the separation between the mutated motifs is one nonmutated motif or less. A singleton is defined as an isolated cluster of exactly one mutated motif. For example, in the 3–10 number of mutations grouping, the first three example clones each contain one singleton and one cluster of size 2 (Fig. 3c). Other clones in this 3–10 mutation group contain a cluster as large as size 6, along with smaller sized clusters and singletons. Our definition of cluster is intuitively reasonable. The definition depends on the arbitrary separation distance of no more than one nonmutated motif. However, our subsequent statistic of the distance between mutations is not arbitrary. The distribution of mutation clusters is shown in Table 1. The data are separated into nine rows labeled “Data,” where each row corresponds to the total number of mutations per clone (2–10), with the number of clones shown in parentheses. Clones with more mutations are likely to have bigger clusters. For example, for clones with two mutations, about 93% of the mutations are singletons and 7% are clusters of size 2. As the number of mutations per clone increases, the fraction of singletons decreases; for clones with 10 mutations, about 49% of the clusters are singletons, 25% doublets, 12% triplets, and up to 3% as clusters having six deaminated AAC/AGC motifs. The rows labeled “Simulated” contain the fractions of clusters predicted by a stochastic model (modified random walk model) that will be described below. The distribution of distances between deaminated motifs is contained in Table 2. In Table 2 we do not use the arbitrary threshold of one to define a cluster, rather we count the exact distance between mutations. For example, in Fig. 3c in the 3–10 number of mutations grouping, the first clone has three mutations and therefore two spaces between mutations, one of length seven and one of length zero. Clone 11, in the 3–10 number of mutations grouping, has nine mutations with eight spaces, one of length six, one of length seven, two of length two, and four of length zero. As in Table 1, the data are separated into rows based on"

The function of all Hh family members is regulated at the levels of morphogen multimerization on the surface of producing cells, multimer release, multimer diffusion to target cells, and signal reception.

However, a precise mechanistic understanding of these interactions is still lacking. In this work, we characterized ionic HS interactions of multimeric Sonic hedgehog (called ShhNp) as well as mutant forms lacking one or more CW residues. We found that deletion of all five CW residues as well as site-directed mutagenesis of CW residues Lys33, Arg35, and Lys39 (mouse nomenclature) abolished HS binding. In contrast, CW residues Arg34 and Lys38 did not contribute to HS binding. Analysis and validation of Shh crystal lattice contacts provided an explanation for this finding. We demonstrate that CW residues Arg34 and Lys38 make contact with an acidic groove on the adjacent molecule in the multimer, suggesting a new function of these residues in ShhNp multimerization rather than HS binding.

HS is produced by most cell types in vertebrates and invertebrates. HS biosynthesis (as well as synthesis of heparin, a highly sulfated form of HS produced in connective tissue type mast cells) occurs in the Golgi compartment on proteoglycan core proteins (19Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Exts synthesize the (GlcA1,4GlcNAc1,4)n carbohydrate backbone, which is subsequently modified by N-deacetylase/sulfotransferases, O-sulfotransferases, and a GlcA-C5 epimerase. This process results in the generation of specific sulfated protein binding sites (summarized in Ref. 20Gandhi N.S. Mancera R.L. Chem. Biol. Drug. Des. 2008; 72: 455-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In this work, we compared HS interactions of physiologically relevant multimeric, wild-type, and CW mutant ShhNp with HS interactions of monomeric CW mutant and wild-type forms of ShhN. To this end, we conducted FPLC affinity chromatography employing coupled mouse embryo-derived HS and the various soluble forms of ShhNp and ShhN. We describe that HS elution profiles of multimeric CW mutants differ strikingly from those of the corresponding monomers, indicating that different CW amino acids participate in HS binding of the monomeric and multimeric morphogen. Indeed, we show that two positively charged CW residues that contribute to HS binding of the monomer interact with negatively charged pockets on adjacent molecules in the multimer. These findings shed new light on functional implications of ShhNp multimerization and provide mechanistic and structural insight into biologically relevant ShhNp-HS interactions. Shh constructs were generated from murine cDNA (NM 009170) by PCR. Secreted, lipidated ShhNp (nucleotides 1–1314, corresponding to amino acids 1–438) was generated in Bosc23 cells (a human 293T derivative, an embryonic kidney cell line routinely used for the expression of lipidated ShhNp (6Zeng X. Goetz J.A. Suber L.M. Scott Jr., W.J. Schreiner C.M. Robbins D.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar)), and secreted, unlipidated ShhN (nucleotides 1–594, corresponding to amino acids 1–198 of murine Shh) was generated in Bosc23 cells and in Escherichia coli. PCR products were ligated into pGEM (Promega), sequenced, and subsequently released and religated into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for the expression of secreted, lipidated 19-kDa ShhNp in Bosc23 cells; into pcDNA3.1/myc-HisC (Invitrogen) for the expression of secreted, C-terminally hexahistidine tagged 28-kDa ShhNHis6 (the large size due to the presence of a c-Myc and intervening cloning sequence) in Bosc23 cells; into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) for expression of N-terminally glutathione S-transferase-tagged 50-kDa GST-ShhN in E. coli; and into pWIZ-SEAP (Gene Therapy Systems) for the expression of secreted, N-terminally alkaline phosphatase-tagged 90-kDa secreted alkaline phosphatase (sAP)-ShhN in Bosc23 cells. Primer sequences for cloning and site-directed mutagenesis and an overview of the various proteins expressed are presented in supplemental Fig. 1. The biological activity of all recombinant proteins was confirmed by Shh-dependent alkaline phosphatase induction in C3H10T1/2 cells and firefly luciferase induction in Light 2 cells using the methods described below. Bosc23 cells were cultured in DMEM (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding secreted ShhN, ShhNp, or sAP-ShhN using PolyFect (Qiagen). Cells were grown for 36 h, washed with PBS, and incubated in DMEM or serum-free DMEM for various time periods. The serum-free supernatant was then TCA-precipitated, or proteins were enriched by heparin-agarose pull-down. Proteins were resolved by 15% reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Polyclonal anti-ShhN (goat IgG; R&D Systems) and polyclonal anti-CW (Cell Signaling Solutions) were used for primary detection. Visualization was performed after incubation with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (detecting anti-ShhN) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (detecting anti-CW) followed by chemiluminescent detection (Pierce). Quantification of Western blotted protein was conducted by ImageJ. Gel filtration analysis was performed by FPLC (Äkta Protein Purifier (Amersham Biosciences)) using a Superdex200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS at 4 °C. Eluted fractions were TCA-precipitated, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. To determine heparin binding properties of ShhN and ShhNp, the supernatant of transfected Bosc23 cells was subjected to heparin affinity chromatography (Äkta Protein Purifier) using heparin-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Proteins were applied to the columns in the absence of salt, and bound material was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 1.5 m in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0). Fractions were precipitated, and eluted proteins were detected immunohistochemically. Shh and ShhNp binding to embryonic tissue HS coupled to NHS-activated Sepharose columns was conducted according to the same protocol. Cleared supernatants of transfected cells, containing the various morphogens, were subjected to automated Äkta affinity purification using a linear salt gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) for protein elution. sAP-tagged morphogens eluted from HS columns were mixed with 0.1 m glycine buffer, pH 10.4, and directly visualized upon the addition of p-nitrophenolphosphate (Sigma) (Roche Applied Science). sAP quantification was conducted at 405 nm in a spectrophotometer. Embryos were digested overnight with 2 mg/ml Pronase in 320 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) at 40 °C, diluted 1:3 in water, and applied to 2.5 ml of DEAE-Sephacel columns. Glycosaminoglycans were applied to PD-10 (Sephadex G25) columns (Amersham Biosciences). Glycosaminoglycans were lyophilized, Chondroitinase ABC-digested overnight, purified on DEAE as described above, applied to PD-10 columns, and again lyophilized. Via the peptides attached to the HS chains, samples were coupled to NHS-activated Sepharose columns according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). For disaccharide analysis, 10-μg glycosaminoglycan samples were digested using heparin lyases I, II, and III (1.5 milliunits of each in 100-μl reactions) (IBEX, Montreal, Canada) at 37 °C for 1 h, and the resulting disaccharides were separated from undigested material using a 3-kDa spin column (Centricon, Bedford, MA). Compositional disaccharide analysis of cell-derived HS or HS derived from embryos was then carried out by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) (21Lawrence R. Olson S.K. Steele R.E. Wang L. Warrior R. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33674-33684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). HS samples were also quantified by this method and/or by carbazole reaction. For immunohistochemical detection, control slides were heparinase I–III-digested (IBEX) (50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 μg of BSA/ml, pH 7.0) overnight at 37 °C to prove specificity. sAP-ShhN and mutant forms generated by site-directed mutagenesis were cloned into pWIZ (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA), expressed in Bosc23 cells, and secreted into the medium. Heparin affinity purification was employed to test for HS binding of the fusion protein, showing elution at 0.9 m salt and thus strong HS interaction. sAP-ShhN-containing medium was adjusted to 0.6 m NaCl to increase binding specificity and was applied to 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed C3H10T1/2 osteoblast precursor cells and frozen embryo sections overnight, followed by three washing steps with PBS. sAP-ShhN bound to HS was directly visualized upon the addition of NBT-BCIP (Roche Applied Science). Assays for Hh pathway activation in Shh-LIGHT2 cells, a clonal NIH 3T3 cell line stably incorporating Gli-dependent firefly luciferase and constitutive Renilla luciferase reporters, were conducted as described (22Taipale J.

Differentiation of C3H10T1/2 osteoblast precursor cells was also used to determine Shh and ShhNp biological activity. 40 h post-transfection, media of ShhNp and mock-transfected BOSC23 cells were harvested. Proteins were first immunoblotted to check for protein release before being used in the subsequent assays. Conditioned media were sterile filtered, mixed with DMEM containing 2× FCS and antibiotics, and applied to C3H10T1/2 cells in 15-mm plates. To some samples, 2.5 μm cyclopamine, a specific inhibitor of Shh signaling, was added. Cells were lysed 5 days after induction (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity was measured at 405 nm after the addition of 120 mm p-nitrophenolphosphate (Sigma) in 0.1 m glycine buffer, pH 10.4. Background differentiation in the absence of exogenous Shh was also quantified. Assays were performed in triplicate. The crystal structure of human Shh (Protein Data Bank entry 3M1N) (23Pepinsky R.B. Rayhorn P. Day E.S. Dergay A. Williams K.P. Galdes A. Taylor F.R. Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Garber E.A. J. Biol.

Crystal contacts were calculated employing CryCo (available on the World Wide Web). Sequence alignment of Shh N-terminal peptides with various corresponding N termini of vertebrate and invertebrate Hh family members shows that the CW sequence (amino acids 33–39 in the mouse Shh nomenclature; BBBXXBB, where B represents basic amino acid residues) (17Rubin J.B. Choi Y. Segal R.A. Development. 2002; 129: 2223-2232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is highly conserved and follows a block of conserved residues required for N-terminal acylation (25Buglino J.A. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22076-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Morphogen-HSPG ionic interactions are mediated by binding of positively charged amino acid residues lysine and arginine to sulfated, negatively charged motifs expressed on the HS chains. The three-dimensional structure of human ShhN (Protein Data Bank entry 3M1N) revealed that the N-terminal peptide extended 30 Å away from the globular domain of the protein (23Pepinsky R.B. Rayhorn P. Day E.S. Dergay A. Williams K.P. Galdes A. Taylor F.R. Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Garber E.A. J. Biol.

BioEssays. 2002; 24: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and that CW residues Arg33 and Lys37 (human nomenclature; corresponding to residues Arg34 and Lys38 in the mouse) were located on one side of the extended peptide, whereas Lys32, Arg34, and Lys38 (corresponding to Lys33, Arg35, and Lys39 in the mouse) were located on the other side (Fig. 1B). We thus hypothesized that HS binding of the morphogen would be unlikely to depend equally on all five CW residues. Supporting this idea, N-terminal ShhNp peptides were demonstrated to contribute to morphogen multimerization as well (27Goetz J.A. Singh S. Suber L.M. Kull F.J. Robbins D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4087-4093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To us, this suggested that monomeric ShhN and multimeric ShhNp may bind to HS differently because some CW residues may contribute to ShhNp protein-protein interactions in the multimer rather than bind to HS. To test this possibility, we generated various monomeric and multimeric mutant forms of murine Shh (supplemental Fig. 1): ShhNΔCW/ShhNpΔCW lacking all CW residues (Lys33–Lys39), ShhN5xA/ShhNp5xA via site-directed mutagenesis of all five basic CW residues into alanine residues, ShhNR34A/K38A/ShhNpR34A/K38A upon site-directed mutagenesis of residues Arg34 and Lys38 into alanines (16Chan J.A. Balasubramanian S. Witt R.M. Nazemi K.J. Choi Y. Pazyra-Murphy M.F. Walsh C.O. Thompson M. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and ShhNK33E/R34L/ShhNpK33E/R34L upon site-directed mutagenesis of residues Lys33 and Arg34 into glutamic acid and leucine, respectively. First, to confirm that CW mutagenesis did not impair the ability of the mutant proteins to multimerize, we analyzed recombinant murine full-length Shh cDNA, resulting in ShhNp, and the monomer control ShhN by gel filtration (Fig. 2A). Gel filtration analysis of media following 2 days of protein expression showed that ShhN was exclusively released in monomeric form into solution, as expected. In contrast, ShhNp formed multimers exceeding 600 kDa and a second fraction around 300 kDa, consistent with previous reports (28Feng J. White B. Tyurina O.V. Guner B. Larson T. Lee H.Y. Karlstrom R.O. Kohtz J.D. Development. 2004; 131: 4357-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Despite small differences in the relative abundance of lower and higher molecular weight fractions, all ShhNp mutants multimerized effectively. We thus concluded that all ShhNp mutant forms assemble properly on the cell surface and are exclusively released in multimeric form (29Ohlig S. Farshi P. Pickhinke U. van den Boom J. Höing S. Jakushev S. Hoffmann D. Dreier D. Schöler H. Dierker T. Bordych C. Grobe K. Dev. Cell. 2011; 10.1016/j.devcel.2011.05.010PubMed Google Scholar). How does CW mutagenesis influence morphogen binding to heparin? To answer this question, we conducted heparin affinity chromatography of recombinant, mutant, and wild-type ShhNp as well as control ShhN secreted into serum-free medium. As shown in Fig. 2B, we found that all mutant and wild-type morphogens bound to heparin (eluting at 0.9–1.4 m NaCl). Mutant morphogens lacking the entire CW motif (ShhNpΔCW and ShhNp5xA) or containing a negatively charged residue (ShhNpK33E/R34L) eluted at lower salt concentrations (0.6–1.2 m NaCl); in contrast, ShhNpR34A/K38A binding to heparin was only slightly reduced if compared with the wild-type multimer (eluting at 0.9–1.3 m NaCl). The observed shifts in CW mutant elution profiles indicate that CW residues contribute to heparin binding; however, ionic interactions between heparin and all CW mutant morphogens were still strong, suggesting the presence of a separate heparin binding site. Moreover, although we initially expected stronger heparin binding of ShhNp due to the presence of an estimated 20–50 CW motifs within one multimer, we observed that monomeric ShhN eluted at higher salt concentrations compared with multivalent ShhNp (Fig. 2B). This suggests different heparin binding modes of the ShhN monomer compared with the multimeric morphogen. In order to identify functional residues within the ShhN CW motif, sAP-tagged monomeric ShhN and corresponding CW mutants were expressed in Bosc23 cells, and the medium was subjected to heparin affinity chromatography as described above. We found that all monomeric mutant morphogens also bound strongly to heparin, eluting at 0.9–1.3 m NaCl (Fig. 2C). ShhN showed the highest heparin interactions (eluting at 1–1.5 m NaCl), but ShhN5xA lacking the entire functional CW motif also eluted at 0.9–1.2 m NaCl. This again suggests the presence of a separate Shh heparin binding site. However, heparin represents an artificial substrate, because it is exclusively produced in connective tissue type mast cells and is not known to interact with Shh in vivo. Thus, we next tested Shh binding to physiologically relevant forms of HS, such as mouse embryonic HS. To this end, embryonic day 14 (E14) embryo sections were incubated with equal amounts of recombinant mutant and wild-type ShhN linked to an sAP tag. Sections were washed, and sAP activity on slides was determined as a readout for the ability of the morphogens to bind HS (Fig. 2D) (16Chan J.A. Balasubramanian S. Witt R.M. Nazemi K.J. Choi Y. Pazyra-Murphy M.F. Walsh C.O. Thompson M. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Slide incubation with sAP-ShhN yielded a strong signal; in contrast, incubation with sAP alone, HS digestion with heparinase I–III prior to sAP-ShhN incubation, or sAP-ShhN incubation in the presence of 1 m NaCl did not yield detectable sAP activity. This demonstrated specific sAP-ShhN binding to HS. Notably, none of the CW mutant monomeric morphogens bound to HS. This demonstrated that, in contrast to heparin binding, HS binding of ShhN is absolutely dependent on the CW motif, consistent with a previous report (16Chan J.A. Balasubramanian S. Witt R.M. Nazemi K.J. Choi Y. Pazyra-Murphy M.F. Walsh C.O. Thompson M. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, because morphogens lacking the entire CW motif or just specific residues all failed to bind HS, our data suggest that HS binding depends on total positive charge of the CW motif. This assumption is backed by a report describing high affinity binding of Drosophila HhN to heparin, as determined by surface plasmon resonance, but undetectable binding to HS (18Zhang F. McLellan J.S. Ayala A.M. Leahy D.J. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3933-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), consistent with the presence of only three basic CW residues (HhN, GRHRARN; murine ShhN, KRRHPKK (17Rubin J.B. Choi Y. Segal R.A. Development. 2002; 129: 2223-2232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). We next tested the interaction of mutant and wild-type sAP-ShhN with various forms of HS by FPLC affinity chromatography. To this end, HS was isolated from E13, E14, and E18 C57/Bl6 mouse embryos and coupled to HiTrap columns. We first established that sAP-Fgf8 and sAP-VEGF elution profiles from all three columns were comparable (supplemental Fig. 2), confirming efficient HS coupling to all three columns. We also confirmed that E18 HS elution profiles of ShhN and N-terminally sAP-tagged sAP-ShhN were comparable (supplemental Fig. 2). Next, equal amounts of wild-type and mutant sAP-ShhN (upon normalization of sAP activity in the input) were applied to each column. sAP activity in the flow-through was also monitored to confirm saturation of ShhN binding sites prior to elution. We detected multiple sAP-ShhN elution peaks from E13, E14, and E18 HS columns, suggesting weak and strong ionic ShhN interactions with HS. Consistent with lower overall HS sulfation if compared with heparin, ShhN eluted from HS columns at salt concentrations ranging from 0.53 to almost 1 m NaCl (Fig. 3, A–C). Weak and strong ionic ShhN interactions with different HS samples were variable, consistent with the observed variation in HS sulfation during development (7Dierker T. Dreier R. Migone M. Hamer S. Grobe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32562-32571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Table 1). We hypothesized that one possible explanation for the observed strong ionic interactions (0.9–1 m NaCl) would be the presence of “heparin-like,” highly sulfated domains on HS; if correct, we expected that CW mutant forms would also elute from HS columns at ∼0.9–1 m salt concentration because of their observed strong interaction with heparin. However, we found elution of only little sAP-ShhNR34A/K38A and sAP-ShhNK33E/R34L at low salt concentrations and no binding of sAP-ShhN5xA and sAP-ShhNΔCW to embryonic HS (Fig. 3, A–C) despite comparable sAP-activity in the input and flow-through. This finding shows that the separate heparin binding site does not contribute to the observed strong HS interactions of ShhN.TABLE 1HS sulfation during developmentE13 HSE14 HSE18 HS%%%D0A050.349.1548D0S02121.317D0A665.76.3D0S65.145.455.3D2S08.711.35.7D2S6 (trisulfated)5.126.616.5D2S6 (monosulfated)272723.3D2S6 (disulfated)13.8416.7511SO3−/disaccharide0.70.80.95 Open table in a new tab We tested next whether HS binding of the monomeric morphogen was required for Shh-dependent differentiation of C3H10T1/2 osteoblast precursor cells into AP-producing osteoblasts (30Nakamura T.

D4 is also an enzymatically active uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG). The presence of an active repair protein as an essential component of the polymerase holoenzyme is a unique feature of the replication machinery. We have shown previously that the A20-UDG complex has a stoichiometry of ∼1:1, and our data suggest that A20 serves as a bridge between polymerase and UDG. Here we show that conserved hydrophobic residues in the N' terminus of A20 are important for its binding to UDG. Our data argue against the assembly of D4 into higher order multimers, suggesting that the processivity factor does not form a toroidal ring around the DNA. Instead, we hypothesize that the intrinsic, processive DNA scanning activity of UDG tethers the holoenzyme to the DNA template. The inclusion of UDG as an essential holoenzyme component suggests that replication and base excision repair may be coupled. Here we show that the DNA polymerase can utilize dUTP as a substrate in vitro. Moreover, uracil moieties incorporated into the nascent strand during holoenzyme-mediated DNA synthesis can be excised by the viral UDG present within this holoenzyme, leaving abasic sites. Finally, we show that the polymerase stalls upon encountering an abasic site in the template strand, indicating that, like many replicative polymerases, the poxviral holoenzyme cannot perform translesion synthesis across an abasic site."

https://openalex.org/W1981774503,"Species-specific sex pheromones released by female moths to attract conspecific male moths are synthesized de novo in the pheromone gland (PG) via the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. This pathway is regulated by a neurohormone termed pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN), a 33-amino acid peptide that originates in the subesophageal ganglion. In the silkmoth, Bombyx mori, cytoplasmic lipid droplets, which store the sex pheromone (bombykol) precursor fatty acid, accumulate in PG cells. PBAN stimulates lipolysis of the stored lipid droplet triacylglycerols (TAGs) and releases the precursor for final modification. PBAN exerts its physiological function via the PG cell-surface PBAN receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that belongs to the neuromedin U receptor family. The PBAN receptor-mediated signal is transmitted via a canonical store-operated channel activation pathway utilizing Gq-mediated phospholipase C activation (Hull, J. J., Kajigaya, R., Imai, K., and Matsumoto, S. (2007) Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 71, 1993-2001; Hull, J. J., Lee, J. M., Kajigaya, R., and Matsumoto, S. (2009) J. Biol.

Little, however, is known about the molecular components regulating TAG lipolysis in PG cells. In the current study we found that PBAN signaling involves phosphorylation of an insect PAT family protein named B. mori lipid storage droplet protein-1 (BmLsd1) and that BmLsd1 plays an essential role in the TAG lipolysis associated with bombykol production. Unlike mammalian PAT family perilipins, however, BmLsd1 activation is dependent on phosphorylation by B. mori Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II rather than protein kinase A."
https://openalex.org/W1982235219,"Normal penile erection is under the control of multiple factors and signaling pathways. Although adenosine signaling is implicated in normal and abnormal penile erection, the exact role and the underlying mechanism for adenosine signaling in penile physiology remain elusive. Here we report that shear stress leads to increased adenosine release from endothelial cells. Subsequently, we determined that ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) is a key enzyme required for the production of elevated adenosine from ATP released by shear-stressed endothelial cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that shear stress-mediated elevated adenosine functions through the adenosine A2B receptor (A2BR) to activate the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade and subsequent increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation. These in vitro studies led us to discover further that adenosine was induced during sustained penile erection and contributes to PI3K/AKT activation and subsequent eNOS phosphorylation via A2BR signaling in intact animal. Finally, we demonstrate that lowering adenosine in wild-type mice or genetic deletion of A2BR in mutant mice significantly attenuated PI3K/AKT activation, eNOS phosphorylation, and subsequent impaired penile erection featured with the reduction of ratio of maximal intracavernosal pressure to systemic arterial pressure from 0.49 ± 0.03 to 0.41 ± 0.05 and 0.38 ± 0.04, respectively (both P<0.05). Overall, using biochemical, cellular, genetic, and physiological approaches, our findings reveal that adenosine is a novel molecule signaling via A2BR activation, contributing to penile erection via PI3K/AKT-dependent eNOS activation.

https://openalex.org/W2000349011,"The inability of epithelial cells from the cornea and other tissues to respond to LPS is reportedly due to low expression of the TLR4 co-receptor MD-2. We generated MD-2(-/-) bone marrow chimeras, and showed that MD-2 expression on non-myeloid cells was sufficient to mediate LPS-induced corneal inflammation. As IFN-γ is produced during Pseudomonas aeruginosa corneal infection, we examined the role of this cytokine on MD-2 expression by primary human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells and HCE cell lines. Exogenous IFN-γ was found to induce MD-2 mRNA, MD-2 cell surface expression, and LPS responsiveness as determined by p65 translocation to the nucleus and production of IL-6, CXCL1, and CXCL8/IL-8. Incubation with either the AG490 JAK2 inhibitor or with STAT1 siRNA blocked STAT1 phosphorylation and MD-2 transcription. Furthermore, EMSA analysis demonstrated that STAT1 binds to the MD-2 promoter, indicating that STAT1 is an MD-2 transcription factor. Together, these findings demonstrate that IFN-γ induces MD-2 expression and LPS responsiveness in HCE cells by JAK-2-dependent STAT1 activation and direct binding to the MD-2 promoter. Furthermore, given our findings on LPS-induced corneal inflammation, it is likely that IFN-γ-induced MD-2 expression by corneal epithelial cells contributes to the host response in vivo, determining the extent of tissue damage and bacterial clearance."
https://openalex.org/W2007223305,"Two processes, DNA replication and DNA damage repair, are key to maintaining genomic fidelity. The Dna2 enzyme lies at the heart of both of these processes, acting in conjunction with flap endonuclease 1 and replication protein A in DNA lagging strand replication and with BLM/Sgs1 and MRN/X in double strand break repair. In vitro, Dna2 helicase and flap endo/exonuclease activities require an unblocked 5' single-stranded DNA end to unwind or cleave DNA. In this study we characterize a Dna2 nuclease activity that does not require, and in fact can create, 5' single-stranded DNA ends. Both endonuclease and flap endo/exonuclease are abolished by the Dna2-K677R mutation, implicating the same active site in catalysis. In addition, we define a novel ATP-dependent flap endo/exonuclease activity, which is observed only in the presence of Mn(2+). The endonuclease is blocked by ATP and is thus experimentally distinguishable from the flap endo/exonuclease function. Thus, Dna2 activities resemble those of RecB and AddAB nucleases even more closely than previously appreciated. This work has important implications for understanding the mechanism of action of Dna2 in multiprotein complexes, where dissection of enzymatic activities and cofactor requirements of individual components contributing to orderly and precise execution of multistep replication/repair processes depends on detailed characterization of each individual activity."

We demonstrate that Li+ can substitute for Na+ in supporting substrate-activated anion currents, albeit with changed voltage dependence. Anion currents were recorded in glutamate, aspartate, and cysteine, and distinct time and voltage dependences were observed. For each substrate, gating was different in external Na+ or Li+. All features of voltage-dependent and substrate-specific anion channel gating can be described by a simplified nine-state model of the transport cycle in which only amino acid substrate-bound states assume high anion channel open probabilities. The kinetic scheme suggests that the substrate dependence of channel gating is exclusively caused by differences in substrate association and translocation. Moreover, the voltage dependence of anion channel gating arises predominantly from electrogenic cation binding and membrane translocation of the transporter.

For some EAAT isoforms, anion currents are much smaller than the electrogenic uptake currents.

Many experimental results support a model in which only certain carrier conformations are associated with conducting anion pores, and the anion channel cycles between conducting and non-conducting states during transitions through various conformational states of the glutamate transporter (14Bergles D.E.

This tight coupling predicts that the voltage dependence of EAAT anion currents exclusively arises from transitions between different carrier conformations and that kinetic properties of EAAT transporters might be extracted from EAAT anion currents. Indeed, all current kinetic models are based on such measurements (14Bergles D.E. Tzingounis A.V. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10153-10162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mim C. Balani P.

However, defining kinetic parameters from anion currents is only possible if all channel states are directly associated with the uptake cycle. This has been questioned by recent reports: for EAAT1 and EAAT3, Li+ was reported to support coupled transport, but not anion channel function, indicating an additional Na+-dependent conformational gating transition of EAAT anion channels beyond the uptake cycle (20Huang S.

To further probe the existence of such conformational changes, we studied the substrate dependence of EAAT4 anion channels by comparing channel gating in Na+ and Li+ as well as in glutamate, aspartate, and cysteine. We observed distinct anion channel gating for the three amino acid substrates. Our data can be described by a kinetic scheme in which the substrate dependence of EAAT4 anion channels is entirely due to differences in substrate and cation association and translocation.

Expression constructs were generated by directly linking the coding regions of monomeric yellow fluorescent protein to rat EAAT4 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Rothstein, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) via a BsrGI restriction site into an open reading frame and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−) using flanking BamHI and BsgI restriction sites. The BsrGI site was created by introduction of a silent mutation with PCR. A comparable construct encoding human EAAT1 was formed by linking human EAAT1 (kindly provided by S. Amara, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA) via an AgeI site with YFP into an open reading frame and subcloning into pcDNA3.1(+) using EcoRI and XbaI. Transient transfection of HEK293T cells using the Ca3(PO4)2 technique was performed as described previously (10Melzer N. Biela A. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Measurements with two independent recombinants and a non-fluorescent construct (22Kovermann P. Machtens J.P. Ewers D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23676-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were compared and shown to exhibit indistinguishable functional properties. Standard whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA). Borosilicate pipettes were pulled with resistances between 1.0 and 1.5 megohms. Cells were clamped to 0 mV for at least 2 s between test sweeps. Voltage errors were reduced by compensating 80–90% of series resistance by an analog procedure and excluding cells with current amplitudes higher than 12 nA. Currents were low pass-filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 50 kHz using a Bessel low pass filter and a Digidata 1322A AD/DA converter (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Bath solutions contained 140 mm (Na/Li)NO3, 20 mm l-glutamic acid/l-aspartic acid/l-cysteine, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm tetraethylammonium chloride. For titration experiments with varying amino acid concentrations, amino acids were substituted equimolarly with gluconic acid. Pipettes were filled with 115 mm (Na/K)NO3, 20 mm gluconic acid, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES. Sodium and lithium dependences were determined by equimolar substitution of external (Na/Li)NO3 with choline NO3 in the presence of 20 mm l-glutamate. In all solutions, pH was adjusted to 7.4 with N-methyl-glucamine. External and internal salt agar bridges were made from a plastic tube filled with 3 m KCl in 1.5% agar and used for electrical connection with the Ag/AgCl electrode. Data were analyzed with a combination of pClamp10 (Axon Instruments), MATLAB (version 7, MathWorks), and SigmaPlot (version 11, Jandel Scientific) programs. Current amplitudes were used without any subtraction procedure. Data are given as means ± S.E. Current-voltage relationships were constructed by plotting steady-state current amplitudes versus the membrane potential. To analyze the concentration dependence of anion currents, steady-state currents at a given test potential were measured at various substrate or cation concentrations and fitted with the Hill equation. Concentration-response data were averaged after normalization to the maximum current extrapolated from fitted Hill functions. Instantaneous current amplitudes were determined by extrapolation of mono- or biexponential fits to the initial voltage step. Relative open probabilities were calculated from instantaneous tail currents at +135 mV plotted versus the prepulse potential after normalization to the maximum tail current observed in Na+ and aspartate (22Kovermann P. Machtens J.P. Ewers D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23676-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Simulations of EAAT4 anion currents were performed with self-written programs in the MATLAB environment. Differential equations according to the model (see Fig. 5A) were numerically solved using the stiff ode15s solver as implemented in MATLAB. Parameters were estimated by fitting the model simultaneously to experimentally determined relative open probabilities, time courses of current relaxations, concentration-response curves with Na+ or Li+ as well as with glutamate, aspartate, or cysteine. Residuals were minimized with the MATLAB Genetic Algorithm Toolbox. To account for differences observed with separate substrates, distinct rates for reactions 2, 3, 4 (forward/backward), and 5 (forward) were allowed for each amino acid (see Fig. 5A). As the combination of interacting substrates and cation determine the properties of the transporters (23Menaker D. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the model assumed different rate constants with each amino acid for reaction 3 with Na+ or Li+. To compare measured relative open probabilities with simulated absolute values, we found that an open probability of ∼0.6 was the highest value the model could assume to correctly reproduce time-dependent channel gating (see Fig. 6). For the model optimization, we therefore normalized relative Po to this value. Because we could not reliably estimate every reaction rate from our measurements, Na+-dependent retranslocation rates (reaction 8) were taken from a kinetic model (14Bergles D.E. Tzingounis A.V. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10153-10162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was recently successfully used to describe EAAT4 (22Kovermann P. Machtens J.P. Ewers D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23676-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Channel gating reactions were simplified as rapid pre-equilibria and defined by specific open probabilities that account for the equilibrium distribution between each state of the transport cycle and its associated channel mode Ch. Overall channel open probabilities (Po) were calculated as sums of fractional occupancies in channel model Ch. Whole-cell anion currents (I) were then given with the published single-channel current (i) characteristics of EAAT4 (22Kovermann P. Machtens J.P. Ewers D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23676-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), an arbitrarily chosen number of transporters (n = 77,000) and the relation I(V) = N·P(V)·i(V). Relevant concentrations in all simulations were set to mimic experimental conditions. Apparent cation affinities in the presence of glutamate were calculated by fitting Hill functions to simulated concentration-response curves at various voltages (see Fig. 6, D and E).FIGURE 6Reproduction and prediction of experimental EAAT4 data.

D, simulated concentration-response curves of Na+ and Li+ in the presence of 20 mm glutamate at −170 mV.

Cells were dialyzed with Na+-based solutions to suppress coupled transport and to reduce the number of relevant states of the transport cycle involved in anion channel gating. Substitution of Cl− with NO3− increased anion currents up to 10-fold (10Melzer N. Biela A. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and resulted in EAAT4 anion currents that largely exceeded endogenous currents (10Melzer N. Biela A. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Kovermann P. Machtens J.P. Ewers D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23676-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These recording conditions thus permitted measurements of EAAT4 anion currents in isolation. Fig. 1 shows representative current recordings in Na+- or Li+-based external solutions, either prior or after application of 20 mm l-glutamate. In the absence of glutamate, anion currents exhibit comparable amplitudes with Na+ or with Li+. Application of glutamate increases current amplitudes at negative as well as at positive voltages. In the presence of external Na+ and glutamate, currents rise instantaneously upon voltage steps from 0 mV to negative as well as positive potentials and decay to steady-state levels within 30–60 ms (Fig. 1A) (22Kovermann P. Machtens J.P. Ewers D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23676-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). With external Li+, glutamate-induced currents are smaller and current relaxations following depolarization are slowed down. Exchange of Na+ by Li+ decreases steady-state current amplitudes to values between 40% (+180 mV) and 80% (−170 mV) of those observed in Na+ and l-glutamate (Fig. 1B). Our data differ from recent reports that Li+ cannot support activation of EAAT1 and EAAT3 anion currents by glutamate (20Huang S. Ryan R.M. Vandenberg R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4510-4515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this discrepancy might be that Li+ only activates EAAT anion channels in the presence of internal Na+, however this is not the case. With KNO3-based pipette solutions, EAAT4 current amplitudes were generally smaller, but glutamate-induced current increases were still detectable in the presence of external Na+ as well as in Li+ (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D gives concentration dependences of steady-state currents for Na+ and Li+ in the presence of glutamate. Because binding of cations and amino acid substrates depend on each other, glutamate was applied at a concentration of 20 mm to approximate saturation under all conditions. For Na+ as well as for Li+, concentration dependences could be well described with Hill functions. Titration with different [Na+] revealed apparent KD values of 2.1 ± 0.1 mm (at −170 mV) and 8.6 ± 0.5 mm (at +155 mV) with Hill coefficients ranging from 2.7 ± 0.2 (−170 mV) to 1.3 ± 0.1 (+155 mV) consistent with previous results (18Mim C. Balani P. Rauen T. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Kovermann P. Machtens J.P. Ewers D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23676-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Li+ affinities were 8- to 40-fold reduced with apparent KD values between 16.6 ± 1.2 (−170 mV, Hill coefficient 1.5 ± 0.1) and values > 100 mm (+155 mV). Binding of Na+ and Li+ to the transporter is promoted by negative potentials. The association of Li+ is apparently more voltage-dependent than that of Na+ (Fig. 1E). The voltage dependence of both KD values could be well described with a linear fit on a semi-logarithmic scale with a slope of 4.4 ± 0.3·10−3/mV for Li+ and 0.7 ± 0.1·10−3/mV for Na+ (Fig. 1E). As the determination of apparent KD was less accurate at positive potentials due to the restricted concentration range in our experiments with Li+, this analysis is only shown at negative potentials. To test whether activation of EAAT4 anion channels in Li+ is a unique feature of this particular isoform, we next studied EAAT1 anion currents in our experimental system (Fig. 2). In symmetrical NO3−, cells expressing EAAT1 exhibited glutamate-sensitive anion currents that differ from EAAT4 currents in their time and voltage dependence. In external glutamate, EAAT1 anion currents are inwardly rectifying (Fig. 2), in clear contrast to the outward rectification of EAAT4 currents (Fig. 1). With Li+, glutamate still activates EAAT1 anion channels (Fig. 2, A and B). However, the ability of Li+ to substitute for Na+ differs markedly from EAAT4 in its voltage dependence. At negative potentials, glutamate-induced currents in Li+ measure ∼80% of those observed in Na+ (n = 5). In contrast, glutamate was unable to increase current amplitudes in Li+ at positive potentials (Fig. 2, A and B). We next compared EAAT4 anion currents in the presence of other amino acid substrates, l-aspartate or l-cysteine, in combination with external Na+ or Li+. Applying voltage steps to cells perfused with Na+ and saturating (20 mm) l-aspartate concentrations elicited large instantaneous current amplitudes at both negative and positive potentials (Fig. 3A). In contrast to glutamate, outward currents inactivated mainly, whereas inward currents remained relatively unchanged over time. Similar time and voltage dependences were observed upon perfusion with Na+ and l-cysteine (20 mm). However, under these conditions, deactivation upon hyperpolarization was intermediate to results obtained under aspartate and glutamate conditions. Aspartate-induced anion currents were only slightly modified by Li+, whereas cysteine-elicited current amplitudes in Li+ were up to 4-fold smaller compared with Na+-containing media (Fig. 3B). In Na+-based external solutions, steady-state currents are largest in the presence of glutamate at positive potentials and in aspartate at negative potentials (Fig. 3C). With external Li+, the sequence of decreasing efficiency in initiating anion currents was aspartate > glutamate > cysteine at all potentials (Fig. 3D). Comparison of instantaneous current amplitudes at +180 mV demonstrated that aspartate and cysteine are more effective substrates than glutamate in combination with Na+ (Fig. 3E). In Li+, instantaneous current amplitudes were large with aspartate but cysteine was found to be a very poor agonist. Nevertheless, currents were always larger in the presence of substrate than in its absence. Fig. 3F shows dose-response curves of steady-state currents for glutamate, aspartate, and cysteine in the presence of Na+ or Li+. At +155 mV in Na+, these curves could be well fit with Hill functions with apparent KD values of 16.6 ± 0.8 μm (l-glutamate), 5.7 ± 0.3 μm (l-aspartate), and 256 ± 21 μm (l-cysteine) and Hill coefficients of 1.2 ± 0.1 (l-glutamate), 2.1 ± 0.1 (l-aspartate), and 0.9 ± 0.1 (l-cysteine). In Li+, these curves were shifted to KD values of 2802 ± 246 μm (l-glutamate), 400 ± 25.3 μm (l-aspartate), and > 20 mm (l-cysteine) and Hill coefficients of 1.1 ± 0.1 (l-glutamate) and 1.0 ± 0.1 (l-aspartate). To quantify the effect of different amino acid substrates on voltage-dependent gating, we calculated relative open probabilities by normalizing instantaneous tail currents at +135 mV to maximum current amplitudes with Na+/aspartate and plotted the resulting values versus the preceding voltage for various substrate conditions (Fig. 4A, inset). We recently demonstrated that this approach provides similar results as direct measurements of anion channel open probabilities via noise analysis (22Kovermann P. Machtens J.P. Ewers D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23676-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). With Na+, relative open probabilities of EAAT4 with aspartate were ∼0.3 at +180 mV but increased to 1.0 in the negative voltage range (Fig. 4A). Whereas EAAT4 acted similarly with cysteine and aspartate at positive voltages, open probabilities were significantly lower in cysteine below −50 mV. In glutamate, open probabilities were larger than in aspartate at positive potentials, but smaller at negative potentials, resulting in bell-shaped activation curves with a maximum ∼0 mV (22Kovermann P. Machtens J.P. Ewers D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23676-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the absence of any amino acid substrate, open probabilities decreased with almost linear voltage dependence from 0.2 at very negative to 0.1 at very positive potentials. Exchanging Na+ with Li+ left open probabilities with aspartate relatively unchanged (Fig. 4B). However, biphasic activation curves in the presence of glutamate were shifted to the left and reduced by ∼30%. In the presence of Li+, cysteine open probabilities were smaller than with glutamate. Moreover, a leftward shift of the voltage dependence was also observed. With Li+ alone, tail currents were similar to those with external Na+. We next tested whether all new data on substrate-dependent gating of EAAT4 anion currents obtained in our study could be satisfactorily described with a kinetic model in which all substrate-dependent gating processes are conferred by transitions within the uptake cycle. If this were the case, relative open probabilities, time courses of current relaxations, and concentration-response curves with glutamate, aspartate, and cysteine in the presence of Na+ as well as of Li+, could be fitted by a kinetic scheme that is based on the EAAT transport cycle with certain states resulting in opening of the anion channel. Our kinetic scheme (Fig. 5A) is based on the well understood transport mechanism of mammalian isoforms, in agreement with other models describing EAAT glutamate transporters (5Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 25Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 26Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O. Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Glutamate transporters can exist in two structurally distinct conformations, outward- and inward-facing (26Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O. Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Each substrate can bind to the outward-facing as well as to the inward-facing conformation. Glutamate uptake is initiated by association of three Na+, one H+, and one glutamate. Consecutively, a large portion of the transporter, the “translocation domain,” performs a substantial inward movement, resulting in the inward-facing conformation (26Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O. Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). After release of the substrates, internal cation binding permits retranslocation from the inward-facing to the outward-facing conformation. Because we used buffered solutions at only one pH in our experiments, we simplified the scheme by omitting H+ binding and lumping together several binding steps to a single reaction. Moreover, because transporter retranslocation is also possible with internal Na+ (14Bergles D.E. Tzingounis A.V. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10153-10162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we allowed internal Na+ to substitute for K+ in state TiK(Na) required for transporter retranslocation. This change does not violate the dependence of net transport on internal K+, as rate-limiting retranslocation rates with Na+ were 30- to 100-fold smaller than those in the presence of internal K+ and thus negligible. The binding order of cations in the outward-facing as well as in the inward-facing conformation was taken from a recent study by Zhang and co-workers (27Zhang Z. Tao Z. Gameiro A. Barcelona S. Braams S. Rauen T. Grewer C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18025-18030Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As in earlier reports, cation binding reactions and transporter translocation were allowed to be electrogenic (5Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Different apparent substrate affinities justified the use of separate parameter sets for substrate-binding reactions for each amino acid. Because radioactive uptake experiments with EAAT4 exhibited lower transport rates for l-aspartate than for l-glutamate (8Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), substrate translocation (R4) might also differ between substrates. As cations appeared to interact with substrates in our measurements (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4), we assumed distinct cation-binding rates (R3) to the substrate-liganded transporter for each amino acid substrate (23Menaker D. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Finally, as association of the third cation appears to be the basis of cation specificity (28"
https://openalex.org/W2013091798,"Adult hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) are maintained by highly coordinated signals in the bone marrow. The molecular mechanisms linking intracellular signaling network of HPCs with their microenvironment remain poorly defined. The Rho family GTPase Rac1/Rac2 has previously been implicated in cell functions involved in HPC maintenance, including adhesion, migration, homing, and mobilization. In the present studies we have identified R-Ras, a member of the Ras family, as a key signal mediator required for Rac1/Rac2 activation. We found that whereas Rac1 activity is up-regulated upon stem cell factor, integrin, or CXCL12 stimulation, R-Ras activity is inversely up-regulated. Expression of a constitutively active R-Ras mutant resulted in down-regulation of Rac1-activity whereas deletion of R-Ras led to an increase in Rac1/Rac2 activity and signaling. R-Ras(-/-) HPCs displayed a constitutively assembled cortical actin structure and showed increased directional migration. Rac1/Rac2 inhibition reversed the migration phenotype of R-Ras(-/-) HPCs, similar to that by expressing an R-Ras active mutant. Furthermore, R-Ras(-/-) mice showed enhanced responsiveness to G-CSF for HPC mobilization and exhibited decreased bone marrow homing. Transplantation experiments indicate that the R-Ras deficiency-induced HPC mobilization is a HPC intrinsic property. These results indicate that R-Ras is a critical regulator of Rac signaling required for HPC migration, homing, and mobilization."

We compared littermate control wild-type (WT) and HSL(-/-) mice during aging for changes in serum biochemical values, trabecular bone density using micro-computed tomography, bone histomorphometry, and characteristics of primary bone marrow cells and preosteoblasts. There is a regulated expression of HSL and genes involved in lipid metabolism in the bone marrow during aging. HSL(-/-) mice have increased serum levels of insulin and osteocalcin with decreased leptin levels. Compared with the marked adipocyte infiltration in WT bone marrow (65% by area) at 14 mo, HSL(-/-) mice have fewer (16%, P<0.05) and smaller adipocytes in bone marrow. While peak bone density is similar, HSL(-/-) mice maintain a higher bone density (bone volume/total volume 6.1%) with age than WT mice (2.6%, P<0.05). Primary osteoblasts from HSL(-/-) mice show increased growth rates and higher osteogenic potential, manifested by increased expression of Runx2 (3.5-fold, P<0.05) and osteocalcin (4-fold, P<0.05). The absence of HSL directs cells within the bone marrow toward osteoblast differentiation and favors the maintenance of bone density with aging."

https://openalex.org/W2003026526,"The neuregulins (NRGs) play important roles in animal development and homeostasis, and their deregulation has been linked to diseases such as cancer and schizophrenia. The NRGs belong to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of transmembrane growth factors. Although NRGs may be synthesized as transmembrane proteins (the pro-NRGs), some of them lack an N-terminal signal sequence, raising the question of how these pro-NRGs are directed to the plasma membrane. Here we have explored the domains of pro-NRGs that are required for their membrane anchoring, cell surface exposure, and biological activity. We show that an internal hydrophobic region acts as a membrane-anchoring domain, but other regions of pro-NRG are required for proper sorting to the plasma membrane. Using mutants that are located in different subcellular compartments, we show that only plasma membrane-exposed pro-NRG is biologically active. At this location, the pro-NRGs may act as transautocrine molecules (i.e. as membrane factors able to activate receptors present in cells that are in physical contact with the pro-NRG-producing cells (in trans) or capable of activating receptors present in the pro-NRG-producing cells (in cis))."
