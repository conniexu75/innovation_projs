The antigen of this antibody in the carcinoma cell line, a monosialoganglioside, has been isolated. Its carbohydrate structure is probably (formula: see text). This oligosaccharide is a sialyl derivative of lacto-N-fucopentaose II, a hapten of the human Lea blood group antigen. About 30 micrograms of ganglioside is obtained from 1 g of cells, wet weight. The ganglioside was detected by autoradiography in lipid extracts of some carcinomas and of meconium, but not in lipid extracts of normal adult tissues. Antigen was detected by solid phase radioimmunoassay in lipid extracts from 12 out of 21 adenocarcinomas of the colon, from 4 out of 5 gastric adenocarcinomas, and from 4 out of 7 pancreatic carcinomas. Antigen was not detected in lipid extracts from 5 esophageal carcinomas or from normal colon and gastric mucosa, pancreas, kidney, liver, and bone marrow."

https://openalex.org/W1591820793,"A whole cell extract of HeLa cells was resolved through two successive chromatographic steps using an extension of the procedure of Matsui et al. (Matsui, T., Segall, J., Weil, P. A., and Roeder, R. G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11992-11996). RNA polymerase II and three of the resulting fractions were necessary and sufficient for accurate transcription of the adenovirus major late promoter. This accurate transcription was quantitated as a function of each of the required fractions, polymerase, and DNA. A linear range of response was observed in each case. Using the linear ranges for assay, it was possible to calculate net purifications and yields for each of the required transcriptional activities after chromatography. These activities were each shown to sediment with a distinct peak on sucrose gradients. The effects of variations in salt concentration, magnesium concentration, temperature, and reaction time were determined. High resolution analysis of runoff transcripts showed that the reconstituted system initiated transcription precisely at the adenovirus major late and early region IV promoters."

This selective inhibitory effect of Rhodamine-123 on some carcinomas is unusual since known anticancer drugs, such as arabinosyl cytosine and methotrexate, have not been shown to exhibit such selectivity in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1593562377,"Progesterone receptor from an oviduct tissue mince incubated with (32P)orthophosphate was purified using affinity chromatography, gel filtration, and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. Two receptor peaks were eluted from the DEAE column. Peak I contained one major protein band with a molecular weight of 90,000 and a 32P band at 90,000. Peak II also had a major 90,000-dalton protein band and a 32P band at the same position. In addition, peak II contained a major protein band at 104,000 daltons and a 32P band which appeared to be slightly larger. Peaks I and II from chickens injected with (32P)orthophosphate showed the same pattern of labeling. The 90,000-molecular weight proteins from peaks I and II and the 32P-labeled component of II with Mr greater than 104,000 all contained phosphoserine. On two-dimensional gels, the 90,000-dalton proteins from peaks I and II were indistinguishable. Both contained labeled phosphate. Two-dimensional gels separated the 104,000-dalton peptide from the slightly larger 32P-labeled protein which traveled close to it on a one-dimensional gel. The relationships of the 104,000-dalton protein and this phosphoprotein to the progesterone receptor are not known. The 90,000-dalton receptor form common to both peaks is a phosphoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W1503405267,"The studies presented herein were designed to determine the source(s) of cholesterol used for steroid biosynthesis in a clonal strain of cultured Leydig tumor cells (designated MA-10). Our results show that, when the cells are placed in medium devoid of extracellular cholesterol and acutely stimulated with human choriogonadotropin, most of the cholesterol used for steroid biosynthesis is derived from intracellular stores. Upon prolonged stimulation, when the intracellular stores are depleted, the cells meet the enhanced demand for cholesterol by increasing de novo synthesis. The presence of low density lipoprotein has little or no effect on the amount of steroid synthesized during acute stimulation, but it enhances the amount of steroid produced during prolonged stimulation by directly providing cholesterol substrate to the cells."

The purified proteins were compared by several techniques: (i) electrophoresis in non-denaturing conditions (pyrophosphate buffer), (ii) one- and two-dimensional analysis after proteolytic cleavage, (iii) immunological blotting after electrophoretic purification, and (iv) competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibodies specific to each of the two major isoenzymes of adult rat heart (V1 and V3 according to the terminology of Hoh et al. (Hoh, J. F. Y., McGrath, P. A., and Hale, P. T. (1978) J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 10, 1053-1076) were used for the immunological studies. The heavy chains of the ventricular myosin isoenzymes of fetuses (V3F) were indistinguishable from those of the V3H isoenzyme present in hypophysectomized adults; both proteins differed from the V1 isoform of young animals. The light chains of V3F, V3H, and V1 were the same, except that V3F contained in addition a small amount of the embryonic light chain (Whalen, R. G., and Sell, S. M. (1980) Nature 286, 731-733). These results strongly suggest that adaptation of the adult rat heart to the hormonal deficiencies of hypophysectomy is mediated by the synthesis of the same myosin heavy chain form which is predominant in fetal hearts."

https://openalex.org/W1556673174,"Mitochondrial creatine kinase was first proposed to act as a functional component in respiratory control in 1966 (Bessman, S. P., and Fonyo, A. (1966) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 22, 597-602). Since that time, evidence has accumulated to support the theory of a creatine-phosphorylcreatine shuttle mechanism involved in supplying energy for aerobic muscle contraction (Bessman, S. P., and Geiger, P. J. (1981) Science 211, 448-452). To demonstrate directly the interaction between mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and that of creatine phosphate synthesis, we have studied the labeling of adenine nucleotides and creatine phosphate with [33P]H3PO4 or [gamma-32P]ATP over a range of adenine nucleotide concentrations incubated with rabbit cardiac and rat skeletal muscle mitochondria. An apparent direct mitochondrial ATP contribution to creatine phosphate synthesis was observed that varied inversely with the total adenine nucleotide present in the reaction system. This reaction of de novo synthesized ATP with creatine phosphokinase prior to equilibration with the total ATP pool was observed regardless of the entry point of electrons from oxidizable substrate into the electron transport chain. This special relation was not observed for added yeast hexokinase in forming glucose 6-phosphate. Mitochondria could not synthesize creatine phosphate in the presence of atractyloside, thus underscoring the requirement for adenine nucleotide translocase-linked transport of ATP prior to reaction with the bound creatine phosphokinase. These studies show that there is coupling or compartmentation of ATP synthesis and transport with creatine phosphate formation in heart and skeletal muscle mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1520002853,"We have developed an in vitro system in which RNA polymerase I accurately transcribes Xenopus ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Cloned Xenopus laevis ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is incubated in a homogenate of manually isolated Xenopus borealis oocyte nuclei. The resultant RNA is analyzed by an S1 nuclease mapping procedure specific for the initiation region of X. laevis rRNA. We show that transcription initiates in vitro on the cloned X. laevis rDNA at the in vivo initiation site. In addition, the dinucleotide ApG significantly stimulates transcription in vitro by acting as a sequence-specific primer. The ApG stimulation is dependent on the template concentration and independent of the ribonucleoside triphosphate levels suggesting that the primer circumvents or augments an initiation-specific factor. We have also investigated transcription of Xenopus rDNA in a mouse cell extract. This heterologous extract can catalyze accurate initiation at a low level. However, under different ionic conditions, this extract transcribes X. laevis rDNA approximately 100-fold more efficiently, but synthesis initiates 4 nucleotides upstream from the in vivo initiation site. There is strong sequence conservation between this start site, the in vivo X. laevis start site, and the in vivo mouse start site suggesting that these sequences are important in RNA polymerase I initiation and that species specificity for RNA polymerase I transcription may not be as great as suggested earlier."

Evidence on breast-feeding patterns in low-income countries from nationally representative World Fertility Surveys and secondary sources shows that in all but a few such countries most children are breast-fed for at least a few months. The limited evidence available on trends seems to indicate a decline in the duration of breast-feeding, but in most of Asia and Africa breast-feeding is almost universal during at least the first 6 months. Earlier weaning is common in Latin America."
https://openalex.org/W1585115655,"The enzymatic degradation of 2,4-decadienoyl-CoA, an assumed metabolite of linoleic acid, was studied in vitro. 2-trans,4-trans-Decadienoyl-CoA, a metabolite of unsaturated fatty acids with trans double bonds, was readily degraded by a beta-oxidation system reconstituted from purified enzymes, as well as by rat heart mitochondria. In contrast, a mixture of 2-cis,4-cis-decadienoyl-CoA and 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoyl-CoA, the latter of which is assumed to be a metabolite of linoleic acid, was acted upon neither by the reconstituted beta-oxidation system nor by the beta-oxidation system present in rat heart mitochondria. However, all three 2,4-decadienoyl-CoA isomers were rapidly reduced by the NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase of rat heart mitochondria. Based on these observations, we conclude that 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoyl-CoA, a metabolite of linoleic acid, is not directly degraded via the beta-oxidation cycle, but instead is reduced by the NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase to 3-decenoyl-CoA which is further degraded via the beta-oxidation pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1568377212,"In order to define further the nature of the apparent close interaction between mitochondrial creatine phosphokinase and oxidative phosphorylation (Erickson-Viitanen, S., Viitanen, P., Geiger, P. J., Yang, W. C. T., and Bessman, S. P. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14395-14404), rabbit heart and rat skeletal muscle mitochondria prepared by gentle mechanical homogenization were compared with preparations isolated after tryptic digestion of tissues, a method which has been reported to yield superior mitochondria (Reichert, M., Schaller, H., Kung, W., and Gerber, G. (1978) Acta Biol. Med. Germ. 37, 1167-1176). The ability of de novo synthesized and exported mitochondrial ATP to interact with creatine phosphokinase prior to total mixing of the ATP pool, which we consider to be evidence of compartmentation, could not be demonstrated with mitochondria prepared via the trypsin procedure. Mitochondria from rabbit cardiac muscle treated with digitonin synthesized ATP and creatine phosphate, but failed to show apparent compartmentation of creatine phosphokinase. Km values for ATP were compared for four conditions: 1) respiring, digitonin-treated rabbit heart mitochondria, 2) atractyloside-inhibited, digitonin-treated rabbit heart mitochondria supplied with a pyruvate kinase-phosphoenolpyruvate regenerating system, 3) respiring rabbit heart mitochondria, 4) atractyloside-inhibited rabbit heart mitochondria supplied with an ATP regenerating system. The observed Km values for ATP for conditions 1, 2, and 3 were similar but lower than that for condition 4. These findings suggest that an outer membrane diffusion barrier influences or controls mitochondrial creatine phosphokinase compartmentation."

https://openalex.org/W1488432283,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in combination with an independent inhibition step, was established to quantitate two components of the proteoglycan aggregate, namely link protein and hyaluronate-binding region, at concentrations below 100 ng/ml. The presence of other components of the aggregate in the samples to be tested influenced quantitation in a specific manner. The apparent antigenicity of link protein increased 2-5 times when either purified proteoglycan monomer, purified hyaluronate-binding region, or purified hyaluronate (macromolecular or oligomers) were present in the link protein samples. These findings are interpreted as showing different states of conformation or degree of association of the link protein with other components of aggregate in solution. In separate experiments, a 2-4-fold increase in the apparent antigenicity of purified hyaluronate-binding region was observed when hyaluronate molecules with at least 20 disaccharides were present in the samples. Co-incubation of the hyaluronate-binding region or proteoglycan monomer with either purified link protein or with smaller hyaluronate oligomers did not change its antigenicity in the assay. However, when hyaluronate oligomers with 8 disaccharides were included in a mixture of macromolecular hyaluronate with hyaluronate-binding region, the increase in apparent antigenicity was blocked. The results illustrate the inherent difficulties in using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the quantitation of link protein or proteoglycan monomers in samples where these macromolecules can associate with themselves or other components of proteoglycan aggregates."

https://openalex.org/W1580711597,"A proteolipid that binds inorganic phosphate with high affinity and specificity has been extracted from rabbit kidney brush-border membranes. This proteolipid has been partially purified by chromatography on LH-20. The molecular weight of the proteolipid is approximately 3000 as determined by urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. This proteolipid can bind and transport phosphate into an organic phase. The K0.5 for phosphate binding is 8 microM with a Hill coefficient of 1.92. Arsenate inhibits phosphate binding in a competitive manner with a KI of 27.5 microM. The aminoreactive reagent 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene inhibits phosphate binding to the proteolipid. Similarly, 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene inhibited Na+-driven Pi uptake in renal brush-border membrane vesicles. In contrast to the mitochondrial phosphate binder, this proteolipid is not inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents. We suggest that this molecular species is a likely candidate for involvement in phosphate uptake in the renal tubule."

https://openalex.org/W1528766128,"An endoribonuclease which cleaves only single-stranded RNA has been purified from nucleoli of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The molecular weight of the ribonuclease is 50,000 to 52,000 as estimated from sedimentation in glycerol density gradients and by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. The endoribonuclease requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ (0.2 mM) for optimum activity. Monovalent cations including K+, Na+, and NH+4 are inhibitory. The ribonuclease gave an apparent Km for single-stranded RNA of 30 microM. Using ribohomopolymers, we found that the enzyme could digest single-stranded, poly(C), poly(U), and poly(A) equally well, but would not degrade duplex poly(C) . poly(I) or poly(A) . poly(U). The lack of base specificity was further demonstrated using RNA sequence analysis of partial digest products of yeast 5.8 S RNA. The ribonuclease activity is sensitive to EDTA and N-ethylmaleimide, but is not inhibited by human placental RNase inhibitor. The enzyme makes endonucleolytic cleavages which generate 5'-phosphate-terminated oligonucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1632815792,"A new fluorescent methotrexate analogue (PT430) was synthesized as a reported ligand for dihydrofolate reductase. The analogue was prepared by attachment of lysine in place of the glutamate side chain of methotrexate and conjugation to fluorescein isothiocyanate via the epsilon-amino group of lysine. Spectrophotometric enzyme inhibition assays showed PT430 to be about one-tenth as potent as methotrexate against either Lactobacillus casei or L1210 mouse leukemia enzyme; competitive radioligand binding assays using tritiated methotrexate gave similar results. In assays of L1210 cell proliferation in culture, on the other hand, PT430 was 100-fold less toxic than methotrexate. In dilute solution, the fluorescence intensity of PT430 was 5-fold lower than that of equimolar fluorescein and diminished with decreasing pH. On complexation with dihydrofolate reductase, however, fluorescence intensity was enhanced 3- to 5-fold depending on the pH. Measurement of fluorescence increase with added ligand provided data for the determination of the stoichiometric ratio, dissociation constant, and extent of fluorescence enhancement. Specificity of PT430 for methotrexate binding sites was indicated by the observation of decreased fluorescence uptake in PT430-treated L1210 cells in the presence of methotrexate. Fluorescence uptake occurred faster, and to a greater extent, in methotrexate-resistant dihydrofolate reductase overproducing L1210/R6 cells than in the methotrexate-sensitive parent line. Therefore, PT430 may be used as a flow cytometry probe to detect methotrexate resistance based on dihydrofolate reductase overproduction."

https://openalex.org/W2010933909,"Vernier acuity shows that the human visual system can interpolate the relative position of a feature with astonishing precision, of the order of a fraction of the distance between neighbouring photoreceptors in the fovea. The remarkable properties of this interpolation process have been the subject of many recent studies1–9. A major question that is still unanswered is whether the process is parallel—operating automatically at all times over a large part of the visual field—or serial—operating selectively at isolated locations only when judgments in the hyperacuity range are required (as in a forced choice task). Successful fusion of random-line stereograms having breaks in the vernier acuity range has been previously interpreted10 to suggest that the interpolation process underlying hyperacuity is parallel and preliminary to stereomatching. Here we demonstrate with computer experiments that vernier cues are not needed to solve the stereomatching problem posed by these stereograms, and we provide psychophysical evidence that human stereopsis probably does not use vernier cues alone to achieve fusion of these random-line stereograms."
https://openalex.org/W1508434536,"A new and previously unrecognized enzyme activity folate oligoglutamate:amino acid transpeptidase (folate transpeptidase), was detected in rat liver extracts. This activity involves the exchange of the terminal gamma-glutamyl residue (where PteGlu represents pteroylglutamic acid) of H4PteGlu-gamma-Glu, PteGlu-gamma-Glu, or p-aminobenzoyl-Glu-gamma-Glu for an amino acid such as [14C]glutamic acid, [14C]methionine, [14C]glutamine, or [14C]glycine. In the case of substrates PteGlu2 and [14C]Glu, the product is PteGlu-gamma-[14C]Glu. The enzyme responsible for catalyzing this activity was purified 39,000-fold by precipitation of inactive protein, fractionation on anionic and molecular sieve columns, and chromatography on diaminohexane-Sepharose. The enzyme functions maximally at pH 7.9, shows an absolute requirement for sulfhydryl reductants, and appears to have a molecular weight of 65,000. The function of folate transpeptidase is not known. A second, though much weaker, enzyme activity, tetrahydrofolic acid:amino acid ligase (folate ligase), co-purified with folate transpeptidase through all steps. Folate transpeptidase and the associated folate ligase activity were separated from folate polyglutamate synthetase during the initial steps of the purification procedure."
