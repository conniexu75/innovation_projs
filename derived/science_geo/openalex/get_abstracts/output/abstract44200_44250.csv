https://openalex.org/W2054592480,"An expression system was developed that allows the production of a completely functional antigen-binding fragment of an antibody in Escherichia coli. The variable domains of the phosphorylcholine-binding antibody McPC603 were secreted together into the periplasmic space, where protein folding as well as heterodimer association occurred correctly. Thus, the assembly pathway for the Fv fragment in E. coli is similar to that of a whole antibody in the eukaryotic cell. The Fv fragment of McPC603 was purified to homogeneity with an antigen-affinity column in a single step. The correct processing of both signal sequences was confirmed by amino-terminal protein sequencing. The functionality of the recombinant Fv fragment was demonstrated by equilibrium dialysis. These experiments showed that the affinity constant of the Fv fragment is identical to that of the native antibody McPC603, that there is one binding site for phosphorylcholine in the Fv fragment, and that there is no inactive protein in the preparation. This expression system should facilitate future protein engineering experiments on antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W2018107765,"A chimeric mouse-human Fab protein that binds specifically to the human carcinoma cell line C3347 has been expressed and secreted from Escherichia coli. This molecule, which contains functionally assembled kappa and Fd proteins, binds as effectively to sites on the surface of C3347 cells as Fab fragments prepared proteolytically from whole chimeric or mouse antibody. The production in Escherichia coli of foreign heterodimeric protein reagents, such as Fab, should prove useful in the management of human disease."
https://openalex.org/W1531531679,"Histatins 1, 3, and 5 from human parotid secretion were isolated by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-2 and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The complete amino acid sequences of histatins determined by automated Edman degradation of the proteins, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and tryptic peptides, are as follows: (Sequence: see text). Histatins 1, 3, and 5 contain 38, 32, and 24 amino acid residues, have molecular weights of 4929, 4063, and 3037, respectively, and contain 7 residues of histidine. Histatin 1 contains 1 mol of phosphate/mol of protein; histatins 3 and 5 lack phosphate. With the exception of Glu (residue 4) and Arg (residue 11) in histatin 1, the first 22 amino acid residues of all three histatins are identical, and the carboxyl-terminal 7 residues of histatins 1 and 3 are also identical. The sequence, -Glu-Phe-Pro-Phe-Tyr-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Gly- (residues 23-29), in histatin 1 is absent in histatin 3; and the sequence, -Gly-Tyr-Arg- (residues 23-25), in histatin 3 is absent in histatin 1. The complete sequence of histatin 5 is contained within the amino terminal 24 residues of histatin 3. The structural data suggest that histatins 1 and 3 are derived from different structural genes, whereas histatin 5 is a proteolytic product of histatin 3. All three histatins exhibit the ability to kill the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans."

https://openalex.org/W1990387345,"Polypeptide sequences required for function of the cell-binding domain of human fibronectin were analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis. Site-specific deletion of the putative recognition sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser or an Asp-to-Glu mutation decreased the adhesive activity of fibronectin fusion proteins expressed in E. coli by greater than or equal to 97%. A second functional site over 0.5 kb away was identified by deletion mutagenesis. These mutants also showed a greater than or equal to 96% loss of activity, indicating cooperativity between sites. The two classes of mutant protein displayed synergism of activity in a trans complementation assay. Effective actin microfilament bundle organization was also dependent on the combined function of both sites. Thus, fibroblast adhesion and intracellular response to the fibronectin cell-binding domain involve two synergistic sites, each of major quantitative importance."

https://openalex.org/W1998309975,"Stable myogenic cell lines have been derived at a high frequency by transfection of a cloned multipotential mouse embryo cell line, C3H 10T1/2, with cloned human DNA linked to a selectable neomycin resistance gene. The myogenic phenotype remains linked to neomycin resistance during secondary transfections. Although proliferative in growth conditions, these cell lines maintain the ability to differentiate and express muscle-specific proteins. We conclude that there is a simple genetic basis for myogenic determination and that a single gene, myd, converts 10T1/2 cells to a myoblast lineage. Southern blot analysis demonstrates nonidentity of myd and the MyoD1 gene. Northern blot analysis shows that myd-transfected myogenic lineages express MyoD1 mRNA while parental 10T1/2 cells do not. These results suggest that a dependent regulatory gene pathway mediates myogenic determination and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2018228515,"Intragenic mutations were isolated that suppressed the dominant-lethal phenotype of the YPT1ile121 mutant gene in a temperature-dependent fashion. Among different amino acid substitutions resulting from single point mutations, two, Ala161----Val (A161V) and Met165----Ile (M165I), restored the function of the YPT1ile121 mutant protein. Mutants expressing the YPT1ile121/val161 allele (ypt1ts) only, grew normally at temperatures up to 30 degrees C but were arrested at 37 degrees C. At the restrictive temperature, ypt1ts mutants accumulated ER membranes, small vesicles, and unprocessed invertase, and they exhibited cytoskeletal defects and an enhanced 45Ca2+ uptake. Similar alterations were seen in YPT1-depleted cells. The ypt1ts mutant cells could be rescued from growth arrest by increasing extracellular Ca2+, and, even at the permissive temperature, they displayed increased trifluoperazine sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2156932941,"We present restriction maps for chromosomes 1 and 2 of six cloned lines of P. falciparum. These delineate the locations of eight genetic markers, including genes for five antigens. In parasites from diverse areas, chromosome structure is conserved in central regions but is polymorphic both in length and sequence near the telomeres. The telomeres and adjacent sequences comprise a conserved structure at the ends of most P. falciparum chromosomes. However, the subtelomeric zones are polymorphic and coincide with the locations of a repetitive element (rep20). Deletions of rep20 generate clones of P. falciparum that lack rep20 on one or both ends of chromosomes 1 or 2, and larger deletions remove telomere-proximal genes as well. The chromosome length polymorphisms can therefore be largely explained by recombination within these blocks of repeats, a mechanism that is also important in the generation of diversity in genes for repetitive antigens of P. falciparum."
https://openalex.org/W1515935760,"We report our experimental results supporting the hypothesis that a specific metal-chelating peptide (CP) on the NH2 terminus of a protein can be used to purify that protein using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). The potential utility of this approach resides with recombinant proteins since the nucleotide sequence that codes for the protein can be extended to include codons for the chelating peptide and thereby generate the gene for a chimeric CP-protein that can be cloned, expressed, and affinity-purified with immobilized metal ions. The chelating peptide purification handle could then be removed chemically or enzymatically after purification has been achieved to generate a protein with the natural amino acid sequence. The feasibility of using a chelating peptide as a purification handle has been demonstrated using a leuteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog, 2-10 LHRH, which contains the previously identified chelating peptide, His-Trp, on the NH2 terminus. 2-10 LHRH had a high affinity for a Ni(II) IMAC column due to the NH2-terminal dipeptide sequence His-Trp, forming a coordination complex with Ni(II), whereas the controls, 3-10 LHRH and 4-10 LHRH, lacking the CP sequence, did not bind. Furthermore, 2-10 LHRH could be purified from a mixture of histidine-containing peptides on a Ni(II) IMAC column in one step. His-Trp proinsulin was used as a model of a recombinant CP-protein. The S-sulfonates of His-Trp-proinsulin and proinsulin were isolated from Escherichia coli engineered to overproduce these proteins as trpLE' fusion proteins. His-Trp-proinsulin(SSO3-)6 had a higher affinity for immobilized Ni(II) than proinsulin (SSO3-)6. Both proteins were eluted by decreasing the pH or by introducing a displacing ligand into the buffer. Ni(II) eluted from the column with much higher concentrations of displacing ligand than the proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1585945783,"Mechanism-based glycosidase inhibitors are of considerable use in studies of enzyme mechanism, in studies of glycoprotein processing, and possibly therapeutically in control of sugar uptake. This paper describes a new general approach to mechanism-based inactivation of glycosidases which involves trapping a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate. This is achieved by use of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glycosyl fluorides, for which the rate of hydrolysis of the fluoroglycosyl enzyme intermediate is extremely slow, resulting in accumulation of the intermediate. Eleven different glycosidases were tested with their corresponding 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glycosyl fluorides. Eight of the eleven were inactivated, four of them according to pseudo first-order kinetics and four according to a more complex kinetic scheme. The specificity of these inhibitors was investigated by assaying for inhibition of one enzyme with four different 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glycosyl fluorides. Large differences in inactivation rate were observed which paralleled previously observed substrate specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1883093314,"The three-dimensional structure of the subtilisin from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BAS) has been refined to 1.8 A using the amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA coding sequence. The structure is essentially the same as the previously reported structures of subtilisin BPN' (Wright, C.S., Alden, R.A., and Kraut, J. (1969) Nature 221, 235-242) and Novo (Drenth, J., Hol, W. G. J., Jansonius, J. N., and Koekoek, R. (1972) Eur. J. Biochem. 26, 177-181) determined in different crystal forms, at 2.5 and 2.8 A resolution, respectively. The largest differences in the three crystallographic models are seen in regions where the amino acid sequence used in the fit to the electron density maps of BPN' and Novo differs from the gene sequence of BAS (Wells, J. A., Ferrari, E., Henner, D. J., Estell, D. A., and Chen, E. Y. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 7911-7925). The refined BAS model shows new features of cation binding, hydrogen bonding, and internal solvent structure. The refined BAS model has served as a basis for the analysis of stereochemical factors involved in the peroxide inactivation of the enzyme. Methionine 222, which is adjacent to the catalytic Ser221, is quantitatively oxidized to the sulfoxide by hydrogen peroxide as had been previously shown for the related Bacillus licheniformis enzyme (Stauffer, C. E., and Etson, D. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 5333-5338). In addition to this site of modification, we observe partial to full oxidation of two of the four remaining methionines. The oxidation of the methionines does not correlate well with their solvent accessibility calculated from the x-ray structure coordinates; in addition, only one of the two possible stereoisomers of methionine sulfoxide is formed. We also detect hydrogen peroxide-induced modification of the hydroxyl groups of two tyrosines. Modeling suggests that most of the observed effect of oxidation on the enzyme's catalytic efficiency can be attributed to unfavorable interactions at the oxyanion binding site between the sulfoxide group at 222 and the carbonyl oxygen of the scissile peptide bond of the bound substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1531641239,"Abstract The vast majority of nuclease activity in yeast mitochondria is due to a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 38,000. The enzyme is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and requires non-ionic detergents for solubilization and activity. A combination of heparin-agarose and Cibacron blue-agarose chromatography was employed to purify the nuclease to approximately 90% homogeneity. The purified enzyme shows multiple activities: 1) RNase activity on single-stranded, but not double-stranded RNA, 2) endonuclease activity on single- and double-stranded DNA, and 3) a 5'-exonuclease activity on double-stranded DNA. Digestion products with DNA contain 5'-phosphorylated termini. Antibody raised against an analogous enzyme purified from Neurospora crassa (Chow, T. Y. K., and Fraser, M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 12010-12018) inhibits and immunoprecipitates the yeast enzyme. This antibody inhibits 90-95% of all nuclease activity present in solubilized mitochondria, indicating that the purified nuclease accounts for the bulk of mitochondrial nucleolytic activity. Analysis of a mutant strain in which the gene for the nuclease has been disrupted supports this conclusion and shows that all detectable DNase activity and most nonspecific RNase activity in the mitochondria is due to this single enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2156661367,"Substructure of chicken gizzard smooth muscle alpha-actinin molecule was deduced by domainal mapping of the proteolytic fragments with alpha-chymotrypsin. There were three chymotryptic cleavage sites (Sites I, II, and III, from the amino terminus). Cleavage at Site I generated two fragments, i.e. an NH2-terminal 36-kDa fragment and a COOH-terminal 70-kDa fragment. The 70-kDa fragment generated either a 55-kDa fragment by cleavage at Site II or a 65-kDa fragment by cleavage at Site III. Purified NH2-terminal 36-kDa fragment bound to F-actin, whereas the 55-kDa fragment formed a dimeric molecule. Circular dichroism and electron microscopic experiments demonstrated that the alpha-helical content of the 55-kDa fragment was 14% higher than that of native gizzard alpha-actinin, coinciding with the apparently rod-shaped configuration of this fragment. A 110-kDa product was generated from two 55-kDa fragments in a cross-linking study with the zero-length cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Two cross-linkable sites in the 55-kDa, A- and B-site, were shown to be involved in this reaction. Further, it was demonstrated by using N-(7-dimethylamino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl)maleimide labeling and immunoblotting analyses that the A-site on one 55-kDa fragment was cross-linked to the B-site on the other. These results suggest that smooth muscle alpha-actinin formed an antiparallel dimeric molecule in which the 55-kDa fragments connected the two actin-binding domains composed of the 36-kDa fragments."
https://openalex.org/W1484231629,"Acid trehalase was purified from the yeast suc2 deletion mutant. After hydrophobic interaction chromatography, the enzyme could be purified to a single band or peak by a further step of either polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, or isoelectric focusing. An apparent molecular mass of 218,000 Da was calculated from gel filtration. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate suggested a molecular mass of 216,000 Da. Endoglycosidase H digestion of the purified enzyme resulted after sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis in one distinct band at 41,000 Da, representing the mannose-free protein moiety of acid trehalase. The carbohydrate content of the enzyme was 86%. Amino acid analysis indicated 354 residues/molecule of enzyme including 9 cysteine moieties and only 1 methionine. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was estimated by gel electrofocusing to be approximately 4.7. The catalytic activity showed a maximum at pH 4.5. The activity of the enzyme was not inhibited by 10 mM each of HgCl2, EDTA, iodoacetic acid, phenanthrolinium chloride or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. There was no activation by divalent metal ions. The acid trehalase exhibited an apparent Km for trehalose of 4.7 +/- 0.1 mM and a Vmax of 99 mumol of trehalose min-1 X mg-1 at 37 degrees C and pH 4.5. The acid trehalase is located in the vacuoles. The rabbit antiserum raised against acid trehalase exhibited strong cross-reaction with purified invertase. These cross-reactions were removed by affinity chromatography using invertase coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. Precipitation of acid trehalase activity was observed with the purified antiserum."
https://openalex.org/W2021381209,"Immunization with a 41-kilodalton blood stage antigen (p41) of Plasmodium falciparum induces immunity to malaria in monkeys. However, antigenic polymorphism and repetitive amino acids commonly found in protective antigens complicate vaccine development. The gene encoding p41 has now been cloned and analyzed. Sequencing and hybridization studies revealed that the gene structure is highly conserved in 14 parasite isolates from three continents. This finding and the lack of repetitive amino acids in the translated DNA sequence may indicate that p41 has an essential function. In this study the protein was found to be 60 percent homologous to the key glycolytic enzyme aldolase from vertebrates, and the affinity-purified p41 protein from parasites showed aldolase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1481874491,"A native photosystem I (PS I) complex and a PS I core complex depleted of antenna subunits has been isolated from the uniformly 14C-labeled aquatic higher plant, Lemna. These complexes have been analyzed for their subunit stoichiometry by quantitative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis methods. The results for both preparations indicate that one copy of each high molecular mass subunit is present per PS I complex and that a single copy of most low molecular mass subunits is also present. These results suggest that iron-sulfur center X, an early PS I electron acceptor proposed to bind to the high molecular mass subunits, contains a single [4Fe-4S] cluster which is bound to a dimeric structure of high molecular mass subunits, each providing 2 cysteine residues to coordinate this cluster."
https://openalex.org/W1564359944,The local structures of the metal sites in copper metallothionein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been investigated by x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the copper and sulfur K edges. Analysis of the EXAFS (extended x-ray absorption fine structure) data indicates that each copper is trigonally coordinated to sulfur at a distance of 2.23 A. Cu-Cu interactions at 2.7 and 3.9 A have also been tentatively identified. Sulfur K edge data are compatible with cysteinyl thiolates bridging each of the eight Cu(I) ions. The data support a model for the copper cluster in yeast metallothionein consisting of a Cu8S12 core. EXAFS data on two specifically engineered carboxyl-terminal truncated mutants reveal that the copper coordination in the mutants is similar to that observed in the wild-type protein.
https://openalex.org/W1620546484,"Polyclonal antibodies to dystrophin (the protein product of the human Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene) were used to identify and characterize dystrophin in isolated triads from rabbit skeletal muscle. Anti-dystrophin antibodies recognize an approximately 400,000-Da protein in isolated triads or heavy microsomes from skeletal muscle. Treatment of heavy microsomes with buffers containing high salt or EDTA to remove peripheral or extrinsic membrane proteins does not remove dystrophin; however, treatment of intact triads with trypsin shows that dystrophin is extremely sensitive to mild proteolytic digestion. Isolation of junctional complexes from skeletal muscle triads indicates that dystrophin is tightly associated with the triadic junction. Fractionation of the triadic junction into junctional transverse tubular membranes and junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes has shown that dystrophin is enriched in junctional transverse tubular membranes. Thus, our results suggest that dystrophin is a component of the triad junction which is exposed to the cytoplasm and embedded in or attached to the transverse tubular membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1490183435,"Oryzacystatin, a proteinaceous cysteine proteinase inhibitor (cystatin) in rice, is comprised of 102 residues (Met1-Ala102) (Abe, K., Emori, Y., Kondo, H., Suzuki, K., and Arai, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16793-16797). We constructed an expression plasmid containing a full length oryzacystatin cDNA at the multi-cloning site of pUC18 and produced a lacZ'-oryzacystatin fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The partially purified expressed protein efficiently inhibits papain activity assayed using N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-2-naphthylamide as a substrate. We also constructed expression plasmids lacking the 5'- and 3'-regions of cDNAs that encode NH2- and COOH-terminally truncated oryzacystatins. An N-truncated oryzacystatin lacking Gly5 and retaining Gln53-Val54-Val55-Ala56-Gly57 inhibited papain as efficiently as the full length oryzacystatin, although both Gly5 and Gln53-Gly57 (oryzacystatin numbering) are conserved among members of most cystatin superfamilies. However, another N-truncated oryzacystatin lacking the NH2-terminal 38 residues was almost completely inactive. On the other hand, a COOH-terminally truncated oryzacystatin lacking the COOH-terminal 11 residues possesses potent papain-inhibitory activity, whereas another COOH-terminally truncated oryzacystatin lacking 35 residues shows much less inhibitory activity, although it retains the two well conserved features Gly5 and Gln53-Gly57. These results indicate that the NH2-terminal 21 residues containing Gly5 and the COOH-terminal 11 residues are not essential, suggesting that a portion of the polypeptide segment containing Gln53-Gly57 is necessary for oryzacystatin to elicite its papain-inhibitory activity efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W2069404582,"A central hypothesis in transplantation biology is that resident leukocytes expressing class II histocompatibility antigens may determine the immunogenicity of an organ. By means of a novel method to deplete the kidney of resident leukocytes, essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), this hypothesis was tested in an intact, vascular organ. Kidneys subjected to EFAD and thus depleted of resident Ia-positive macrophages survived and functioned when transplanted across a major histocompatibility antigen barrier in the absence of immunosuppression of the recipient. Control allografts were rejected promptly. Allografts from donors subjected to EFAD normalized their lipid composition and were repopulated with host macrophages by 5 days. Administration of Ia-positive cells at the time of transplantation established that the resident leukocyte depletion induced by EFAD was responsible for the protective effect. These observations may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying tissue immunogenicity and the population of normal tissues with resident leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W54021026,"Linoleate metabolism via the cyclooxygenase pathway enhances the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells in serum-free culture in the presence of epidermal growth factor and insulin (Bandyopadhyay, G.K., Imagawa, W., Wallace, D., and Nandi, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2750-2756). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can fully substitute for linoleic acid provided endogenous hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs, lipoxygenase metabolites) are available. The PGE2 effect is partial if lipoxygenase activity is inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Any combination of two HETEs out of three tested (5-, 12-, and 15-HETEs) stimulates growth synergistically with PGE2; and together (i.e. PGE2 + HETEs), they completely substitute for linoleate. In the absence of PGE2, maximal stimulation cannot be attained with HETEs. Exogenous 5-HETE, compared with 12- or 15-HETE, is preferentially incorporated by the mammary epithelial cells, and about 25-30% of it is retained esterified in phospholipids. The cellular level of nonesterified, free HETE is low. Radioimmunoassay revealed that the concentrations of 12- and 15-HETEs in the culture media (with or without added linoleate) were always higher than that of 5-HETE. Both intra- and extracellular free HETEs are rapidly metabolized by the cells. Since these cells are capable of producing eicosanoids from linoleate, periodic supplementation of the cultures with linoleate allows maintenance of higher HETE and PGE2 levels. Thus, it appears that not only are HETEs short-lived in the cell cultures, but cells handle 5-HETE differently than 12- and 15-HETEs. Whatever may be the pathways of interaction, synergism between HETEs and PGE2 seems to explain how linoleate stimulates the growth of mammary epithelial cells in the presence of epidermal growth factor and insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1576200545,"Bryostatin 1 (Bryo), a macrocyclic lactone, stimulates some but not all of the biologic effects which are induced by phorbol esters (PEs). In vitro, it competes with PEs for binding to whole cells and activates the calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, PK-C. To examine whether Bryo, like PEs, is able to stimulate the nonadherent growth of cells, we used the mouse epidermal cell line JB6, which is stimulated by PEs to grow in soft agar. Like PEs, Bryo stimulates both the adherent and nonadherent growth of these cells, but Bryo (0.001-1 microM) is less active than equivalent concentrations of PEs. To attempt to explain the biologic differences between these two agents, we examined the modulation of PK-C by both PEs and Bryo. In a phosphotransferase assay using partially purified PK-C from JB6 cells, Bryo (1-0.001 microM) stimulated less phosphorylation of histone substrate than did PMA. Also, when whole cells were treated with equal concentrations of Bryo or PMA, Bryo stimulated a decreased loss of PK-C from the cytosol. Using purified isozymes of PK-C from rat brain, Bryo demonstrated identical competition to PMA for binding to forms alpha and gamma but decreased binding to form beta. Hydroxylapatite chromatography of JB6 cytosol demonstrated that these cells contain largely peak 2, or beta-PK-C. Although Bryo more weakly activates PK-C from JB6 cells, prolonged exposure of JB6 cells to either 1.0 or 0.01 microM Bryo caused a more rapid loss of immunologically detectable PK-C than did similar concentrations of PEs. We conclude that Bryo is capable of stimulating both the nonadherent and the adherent growth of JB6 cells in a similar fashion to phorbol esters. The differences in biologic effects of Bryo and PMA may be partially explained by Bryo's modulation of PK-C."
https://openalex.org/W1595653370,"The regulation of the protein kinase activity responsible for the phosphorylation of the light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII) 27-kDa polypeptide involved in the State I-State II transitions in Acetabularia thylakoids was investigated. The LHCII kinase of isolated thylakoids retains its activity in absence of light-driven electron flow or reductants added in the dark. However, the kinase is reversibly inactivated by addition of oxidants in vitro or by far red (710 nm) light in vivo. Inhibitors of the quinol oxidase site of the cytochrome b6.f complex inactivate the LHCII kinase in the dark, and also in the light, or in presence of duroquinol when the plastoquinone pool is reduced. Inhibitors of the quinone reductase site of the b6.f complex have practically no effect in the dark and stimulate the kinase activity in the light. Based on these data and on our previous report, showing specific loss of LHCII kinase activity in a Lemna mutant lacking the cytochrome b6.f complex (Gal, A., Shahak, Y., Schuster, G., and Ohad, I. (1987) FEBS Lett. 221, 205-210), we propose that the activity of the LHCII kinase is regulated by the redox state of a cytochrome b6.f complex component(s) which responds to the balance of electron flow from photosystem II via the plastoquinone pool to photosystem I."
https://openalex.org/W1499598577,"An alkaline phosphatase signal sequence optimized for formation of a hydrophobic alpha-helix functions very efficiently in the transport process. This mutant contained a core region comprised of 9 consecutive leucine residues (Kendall, D. A., Bock, S. C., and Kaiser, E. T. (1986) Nature 321, 706-708). We have now constructed a second mutant containing a decaisoleucine core region. Isoleucine was chosen because it is an isomer of leucine with comparable hydrophobicity but in synthetic peptides isoleucine favors beta-sheet formation. Surprisingly, this mutant precursor was also processed efficiently, and mature alkaline phosphatase was correctly targeted to the Escherichia coli periplasm. Since the effective length of a beta-strand is extended relative to an alpha-helix, conformational differences should be mirrored by the relative effectiveness of shortened polyisoleucine and polyleucine core regions. However, analysis of two additional mutants containing truncated segments of either polyleucine or polyisoleucine did not reveal any differences and both accumulate as precursors. We conclude that these mutants do not adopt critically different structures. This comparative analysis was facilitated by construction of a new plasmid, CASS3. This plasmid contains unique restriction sites flanking the DNA region coding for the signal sequence hydrophobic core segment. Consequently, the wild type core-encoding region can be readily replaced with synthetic oligonucleotides coding for new structural units and multiple amino acid substitutions can be made without the need for step-wise mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1510646666,"Abstract A mutant of Escherichia coli thymidylate synthase (F3-TS), resulting from the replacement of a tyrosine for a cysteine 50 amino acids from the amino-terminal end, has been purified to homogeneity and found to contain less than 0.2% of the activity of the native enzyme (thyA-TS). Although this protein formed a ternary complex with 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, like the native enzyme, the extent of complex formation was significantly impaired as determined by equilibrium dialysis and circular dichroism. Thus, unlike the native enzyme, where 2 mol of FdUMP were present in each mole of ternary complex, F3-TS contained less than 1 mol of FdUMP/mol of ternary complex. Similarly, the binding of dUMP by F3-TS was greatly diminished relative to thyA-TS, but its binding as well as that of FdUMP could be improved by the presence of either the folate substrate or a tight binding folate analogue, 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate (PDDF). However, despite the fact that PDDF enhanced the binding of FdUMP and dUMP to F3-TS, the binding of PDDF to the mutant enzyme was also greatly impaired. This contrasts with the native enzyme, which, under the same conditions, bound about 2 mol of PDDF/mol of enzyme in the presence or absence of either FdUMP or dUMP. Circular dichroism analyses with PDDF in the presence of dUMP or FdUMP yielded analogous results, but the effects were less dramatic than those obtained by equilibrium dialysis. Evidence in support of a structural difference between thyA-TS and F3-TS was obtained by demonstrating that the latter protein was 15-fold slower in forming a ternary complex with dUMP and PDDF than the former and that the mutant enzyme was less stable than the native enzyme."

Insulin treatment of the isolated alpha beta heterodimeric complex was observed to induce the complete reassociation to an alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric state when analyzed by nondenaturing Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration chromatography. Nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 125I-insulin affinity cross-linked and 32P-autophosphorylated alpha beta heterodimers demonstrated that the insulin-dependent reassociation to the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric state occurred both covalently and noncovalently under these conditions. Comparison by reducing and nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the insulin-dependent covalent reassociation to an alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric complex was due to the formation of a disulfide linkage(s) between the alpha beta heterodimers. beta subunit autophosphorylation of the control alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric insulin receptor preparation was maximally stimulated within 5 min of insulin preincubation and occurred exclusively in the Mr = 400,000 alpha 2 beta 2 complex. Similarly, maximal insulin-stimulated beta subunit autophosphorylation of the alpha beta heterodimeric preparation occurred within 5 min of insulin pretreatment in the Mr = 210,000 alpha beta complex. However, 4 h of insulin pretreatment of the alpha beta heterodimer preparation induced the formation (6-fold) of a covalent 32P-labeled alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric complex. Maximal stimulation of substrate phosphorylation for the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric complex was also observed to occur within 5 min of insulin treatment, whereas maximal insulin-stimulated substrate phosphorylation of the alpha beta heterodimeric complex required greater than 4 h. These data demonstrate that (i) insulin treatment can induce the reassociation of the alpha beta heterodimeric complex into a covalent alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric state, and (ii) insulin-dependent protein kinase activation of the alpha beta heterodimeric insulin receptor correlates with the covalent reassociation into a disulfide-linked alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric complex."
https://openalex.org/W1535731757,"The capacities of three synthetic sequences to adopt left-handed helices were evaluated in recombinant plasmids. The sequences consisted of very short runs of (CG)n (n = 2-4) interspersed with runs of alternating A.T base pairs and/or with regions of non-alternating base pairs. The plasmids were studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to determine the natures of the conformational transitions and their free energies of formation. These results coupled with analyses with chemical (diethyl pyrocarbonate, osmium tetroxide, and bromoacetaldehyde) and enzymatic (S1 nuclease, T7 gene 3 product, and MHhaI) probes indicated that the entire sequence was adopting a left-handed helix in each case. In one of these sequences, Z-DNA formation necessitated the retention of the anti conformation of one of the guanines in a region of non-alternation. In a sequence which contains out-of-phase regions of alternation, our results indicate the formation of a separate left-handed helix in the central (CG)2 region, thus forming two Z-Z junctions. In summary, we conclude that only very short regions of alternating CG are necessary to effect the B to Z transition and that this conformational change can be transmitted through non-alternating regions. A set of empirical rules governing the characteristics of the B to Z transition and the types of left-handed helices in supercoiled plasmids was derived from studies on a systematic series of 17 plasmids."

https://openalex.org/W1543305182,"Abstract Transcription of the gene for phosphoribosyl-anthranilate isomerase (TRP1) from the TRP1 promoter is initiated only approximately half as frequently as, for example, from the TRP3 promoter, but TRP1 mRNA is approximately twice as stable as TRP3 mRNA. Therefore, the steady state amount of TRP1 mRNA in yeast cells, grown without amino acid limitation, is similar to the steady-state amount of TRP3 mRNA. The protein concentration of both enzymes in yeast cells is about the same, but the basal specific enzyme activity in permeabilized cells of the TRP1 gene product N-(5'-phosphoribosyl-1)-anthranilate isomerase is about 2-3 times higher than that of any of the other TRP enzymes. According to the kinetic parameters of the purified isomerase protein, the enzyme is more active than, for example, the purified TRP3 enzyme indoleglycerol-phosphate synthase. It is suggested that the TRP1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae might be the result of a rearrangement event, separating the N-(5'-phosphoribosyl-1)-anthranilate isomerase domain from the indoleglycerol-phosphate synthase domain and putting the catalytically more active isomerase domain behind a weak and nonregulated constitutive promoter."

https://openalex.org/W1495442795,"A truncated form of the yeast mitochondrial 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) synthase was constructed by deletion of the first 75 amino acid residues of its precursor form. This truncated ALA synthase which lost its entire presequence and 40 residues of the mature part possesses a new amino terminus quite different from a typical mitochondrial presequence. This modified protein expressed in vivo is found entirely located within mitochondria. Although it was now unable to reach the matrix space, it was internalized as shown by its resistance to protease in isolated mitochondria. Pulse-chase radiolabeling in the presence of an uncoupler suggests that a membrane potential is not required for the targeting of this truncated ALA synthase. Thus, the amino-terminal signal, if indispensable as a matrix targeting signal, could be replaced by an internal sequence or a particular folding for recognition by the import machinery."

https://openalex.org/W1593911162,"A novel deoxyribonuclease, exonuclease V, has been purified approximately 30,000-fold from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Exonuclease V is localized in the nucleus. The nuclease degrades single-stranded, but not double-stranded, DNA from the 5'-end. The products of exonuclease action are dinucleotides, except the 3'-terminal tri- and tetranucleotides which are not degraded. Studies with synthetic oligo- and polynucleotides with specified sequence elements showed that exonuclease V cleaves off dinucleotides as primary digestion products. Thus, the polymers (pT)9pA(pT)n and (pT)10pA(pT)n yielded pTpA and pApT as digestion products, respectively. Removal of the 5'-terminal phosphate from the DNA substrate results in reduced binding of the enzyme to the substrate. In addition, the initial hydrolytic cut by exonuclease V on the dephosphorylated substrate produces a mixture of dinucleoside monophosphates and trinucleoside diphosphates. The enzyme is processive in action."
