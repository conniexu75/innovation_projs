Here we use synthetic peptides in “active” (e.g. phosphorylated) and “control” (e.g. non-phosphorylated) forms as baits in affinity pull-down experiments to determine such interactions by quantitative proteomics. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture distinguishes specific binders directly by the isotope ratios determined by mass spectrometry (Blagoev, B., Kratchmarova, I., Ong, S.-E., Nielsen, M., Foster, L. J., and Mann, M. (2003) Nat. Biotechnol. 21, 315–318). A tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide of the epidermal growth factor receptor specifically retrieved the Src homology domain (SH) 2- and SH3 domain-containing adapter protein Grb2. A proline-rich sequence of Son of Sevenless also specifically bound Grb2, demonstrating that the screen maintains specificity with low affinity interactions. The proline-rich Sos peptide retrieved only SH3 domain containing proteins as specific binding partners. Two of these, Pacsin 3 and Sorting Nexin 9, were confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Our data are consistent with a change in the role of Sos from Ras-dependent signaling to actin remodeling/endocytic signaling events by a proline-SH3 domain switch.

Important protein-protein interactions in cell signaling are frequently mediated by short, unstructured sequences, which specifically interact with peptide binding domains (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Typical examples are the binding of tyrosyl-phosphorylated peptides to proteins containing Src homology domain 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology domain 2; SH3, Src homology domain 3; 12C6-Arg, 12C6 or “normal” arginine; 13C6-Arg, 13C6-arginine; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; Grb2, growth factor-associated protein 2; LeuD3, l-leucine-5,5,5-d3; Pacsin, protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons; SILAC, stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture; Snx9, Sorting nexin 9; Sos, Son of Sevenless; MS, mass spectrometry. or phosphotyrosyl binding domain (2Bradshaw J.M.

Peptides with certain proline motifs constitutively bind to proteins containing Src homology domain 3 (SH3) at lower affinities (4Mayer B.J. J.

Despite the central importance of motif-dependent interactions in cell signaling, there are few methods to identify peptide-binding partners. Phage display (6Kay B.K. Kasanov J. Yamabhai M. Methods. 2001; 24: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), array technologies (7Espejo A. Cote J. Bednarek A. Richard S. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and peptide libraries (8Elia A.E.H. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 299: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) are powerful strategies to learn about general features of optimal peptide sequences binding to a given domain or protein. Information from these experiments has in turn been helpful in the development of bioinformatic algorithms to predict occurrence of these sequences in proteins (9Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). However, these methods cannot efficiently identify specific in vivo interaction partners of a given modified peptide sequence. The yeast two-hybrid system (10Legrain P. Selig L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) has been successfully applied to large scale protein-protein interaction mapping (11Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadmodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but it is not well suited to determine the interaction partners of short and modified peptide sequences. In addition, the yeast two-hybrid system is a heterologous system for studying interactions of mammalian or plant proteins. The most straightforward method for determining interaction partners of a peptide is to use it as bait in affinity pull-down experiments followed by direct detection of binding proteins. General use of this approach has been limited by two factors. First, the affinity of a given binding domain to the peptide bait is often weak and can further be reduced because the peptide bait is used outside of the context of the whole protein. Second, binding partners of interest in signal transduction are typically of low abundance. Thus, small amounts of protein binding specifically to the bait are masked by more abundant but nonspecific binders to both the peptides and the matrix employed in the pull-down. This has often prevented unbiased methods, such as peptide sequencing, to be employed for the identification of interacting proteins, and synthetic peptides are usually only employed in the verification of postulated protein-protein interactions by competitive disruption of binding. Recently our group described a proteomic method to detect signaling complexes formed upon cell stimulation (14Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Ong S.-E. Nielsen M. Foster L.J. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (15Ong S.-E. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Kristensen D.B. Steen H. Pandey A. Mann M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 376-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar, 16Ong S.-E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), all the proteins in one protein population were metabolically labeled with a heavy isotope- form of arginine (13C6-Arg, leading to a difference of six mass units). In this way, two forms of each arginine-containing peptide are measured in subsequent mass spectrometric experiments. The two forms differ only in their mass and can therefore be used to directly quantify the ratio of the proteins from one population in relation to the other. By using the SH2 domain of Grb2 as an affinity probe, tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor and associated proteins were purified from labeled, stimulated cells and non-labeled, non-stimulated cells. After trypsin digestion of eluted proteins, arginine-containing peptides were observed as light (the normal 12C6 form of arginine) and heavy (13C6-arginine) forms in mass spectra. One-to-one ratios between the isotope forms indicated proteins unaffected by EGF stimulation, whereas ratios greater than 1 indicated proteins recruited to the signaling complex upon EGF stimulation. A related quantitative proteomics strategy has independently been described (17Ranish J.A. Yi E.C. Leslie D.M. Purvine S.O. Goodlett D.R. Eng J. Aebersold R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), where isotope-coded affinity tag technology (18Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 7: 994-999Crossref Scopus (4350) Google Scholar) was used to distinguish two cellular states, leading to the identification of specific members of the yeast polymerase II complex in a large background of nonspecific proteins. Our previous work allowed characterization of multiprotein complexes formed as a result of cell stimulation. Here we employ the principle of SILAC in affinity pull-down experiments for a different purpose: the determination of the interaction partners of short unstructured and potentially modified amino acid sequences, which requires a completely different strategy. We find that synthetic peptides can efficiently be used as baits in such experiments. In contrast to the previous approach, the current screen is designed to primarily reveal direct binders, rather than multiprotein complexes. Furthermore, cloning and expression of domains, or prior knowledge of the signaling events leading to the interaction, are not required, making it more easily adaptable to a large scale approach. The strategy was validated in a classical part of growth factor signaling, namely in the interactions of the adapter protein Grb2. Its role in EGF signaling is to bring the guanine exchange factor Sos to the activated receptor, so that Sos can initiate signaling through Ras at the plasma membrane. We selected a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide of EGFR, which is known to bind the SH2 domain of Grb2, and a proline-rich motif-containing peptide of Sos1 and Sos2 that is known to bind the SH3 domains of Grb2. Both proline-rich Sos peptides retrieved only proteins containing SH3 domains as specific binding partners, demonstrating exquisite specificity in the affinity pull-downs from whole cell lysates. Two of the identified proteins binding to the proline-rich Sos peptide represent novel interactions and were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. These proteins, Pacsin3 and Snx9, also have potential roles in growth factor signaling. Metabolic Labeling in Cell Culture—Human HeLa cells were grown in arginine-deficient Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. One cell population was supplemented with normal isotopic abundance l-arginine (Sigma) and the other with 99% isotopic abundance 13C6-arginine (Aldrich) as described (16Ong S.-E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Each population was grown for at least five population doublings. Four plates (14 cm) of each cell population were used per experiment. In some experiments, l-leucine-3,3,3-d3 (Aldrich) and Leu were used for metabolic stable isotope labeling in leucine-deficient Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (15Ong S.-E. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Kristensen D.B. Steen H. Pandey A. Mann M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 376-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis and Pull-downs—Biotinylated peptides were synthesized on a solid-phase peptide synthesizer using amide resin (Intavis, Germany). Peptides were designed as 15-mers bearing an N-terminal biotin on the tetrapeptide linker SGSG (19Ward C.W. Gough K.H. Rashke M. Wan S.S. Tribbick G. Wang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5603-5609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Biotinylation was done using biotinyloxysuccimide (Novabiochem) or sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce), the latter allowing reductive cleavage of the 15-mer from the biotin group. The identity and purity of the synthesized peptides were confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis. Peptides were synthesized as pairs as “active” and “control” forms. For affinity pull-downs, 30 nmol of immobilized peptide was added to ∼6 mg of cell lysate. Under such conditions, sub-picomole amounts of specific binding proteins were detected during mass spectrometric analysis, indicating a 1000-fold excess of bait molecules over endogenous binding proteins. Thus, no competition for binding sites is expected. Immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) were loaded with biotinylated peptide prior to incubation with cell lysates. Cells were lysed in 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, protease inhibitors (Complete Tablets, Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate as phosphatase inhibitor. Equal amount of protein was incubated with the respective immobilized peptides at 4 °C for 6 h. After extensive washes, bound proteins were eluted from the immobilized peptides by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Alternatively, the bait peptide with its bound proteins was cleaved off the beads by using 50 mm dithiothreitol. Eluates from the active and control bait peptide pull-downs were combined for further analysis. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were lysed in 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (Complete Tablets, Roche Applied Science) and incubated at 4 °C with a rabbit antibody against Sos isoforms (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein A-Sepharose beads were added after 4 h and incubated for additional 4 h. After extensive washes, co-precipitated proteins were eluted in sample buffer for SDS-gel electrophoresis. Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry, Data Base Searching, and Quantitation—Combined eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (15% w/v). After silver staining, the entire lane was excised in up to six equally spaced slices and digested enzymatically with trypsin prior to LC-MS analysis. Tryptic peptide mixtures were then desalted (20Rappsilber J. Ishihama Y. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar) and loaded onto reversed phase analytical columns for liquid chromatography (21Ishihama Y. Rappsilber J. Andersen J.S. Mann M. J. Chromatogr. A. 2002; 979: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Peptides were eluted from the analytical column by a multistep linear gradient running from 5 to 60% acetonitrile in 60 min and sprayed directly into the orifice of a QSTAR-Pulsar quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (ABI-Sciex). Proteins were identified by high mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) by information-dependent acquisition of fragmentation spectra of doubly, triply, or quadruply charged peptides. Acquired spectra were then searched against the human International Protein Index Data base (www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI) by using the Mascot algorithm (22Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J.C. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6776) Google Scholar) with search parameters as described (23Foster L.J. de Hoog C. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). All protein identifications were manually verified against the raw mass spectrometric data by using in-house software. For quantitation, ratios between the centroids of the MS peaks of “heavy” and “light” forms of the peptide were calculated and averaged over consecutive MS cycles for the duration of the respective MS peaks in the total ion chromatogram (16Ong S.-E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Heavy and light forms of peptides co-elute for 13C-based labels, and the quantification is based on the average of a number of independently determined ratios for each peptide as the peak elutes from the chromatography column. Labeled and non-labeled peptide pairs were identified by their charge state and mass difference, for example doubly charged peptide pairs were identified through a difference in mass-to-charge ratio of 3. In-house developed software allowed automation of the extraction of corresponding MS peaks. Each ratio was subsequently calculated from the extracted ion chromatograms after manually verifying that the MS spectra containing the respective peaks were at a sufficient level above background and separated from the interfering peaks of other peptides. Ratios obtained from different peptides identifying the same protein were averaged. A final standard deviation for protein ratios was calculated from the ratios of the individual peptides or, when the identification was based on a single peptide, from the ratios obtained from the different mass spectra of this peptide pair. We have employed custom-made software for our instrument. However, the quantification task is very similar to those encountered in the popular isotope-coded affinity tag method (18Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 7: 994-999Crossref Scopus (4350) Google Scholar) or other quantitative proteomics schemes. Our peptide hit verification, and quantitation software has been made open-source at Sourceforge (sourceforge.net). Furthermore, whereas SILAC has certain advantages in this screen, it would also be possible to perform it with other quantitative proteomic approaches, for which software is already available. The Proteomic Peptide-Protein Interaction Screen—First, two cell populations were metabolically labeled with normal arginine (12C6-Arg) and arginine in which the carbon atoms were replaced by the stable 13C isotope of carbon (13C6-Arg) (Fig. 1). HeLa cells were adapted to the medium for a minimum of five cell doublings to ensure complete labeling of even long lived proteins. This “SILAC” labeling (15Ong S.-E. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Kristensen D.B. Steen H. Pandey A. Mann M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 376-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar, 16Ong S.-E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) makes arginine-containing peptides distinguishable between the two populations without introducing any other chemical or biological differences. In particular, both forms of each peptide are detected with equal efficiency by the mass spectrometer so that the measured ratio between the two peptides accurately reflects the ratio of the proteins in the two populations. Cell lysates from the 12C6-Arg-labeled and the 13C6-Arg-labeled cells were employed in affinity purification using synthetic peptides, representing the non-phosphorylated and the phosphorylated form of a peptide, respectively. The unphosphorylated peptide was exposed to the 12C6-Arg-encoded cell lysate, and the phosphorylated peptide was exposed to the 13C6-Arg-encoded lysate. Lysates were then mixed and analyzed together (Fig. 1). Background proteins (for example, ribosomal proteins binding to the beads to which the peptides are attached) are present in equal amounts in both pull-down experiments. Upon analysis by mass spectrometry, peptides from such proteins will appear in the two forms with equal abundance. If a protein binds specifically to the phosphopeptide and not to the non-phosphorylated peptide, then it will only be represented in the 13C6-labeled cell lysate. Consequently, in this case we will observe only the higher molecular weight form of the peptide. More generally, if a protein binds specifically but not exclusively to one of the two forms of the bait, then this will lead to a ratio between the pair of peaks that is related to the specificity of the binding to one form over the other. Although the above discussion assumes phosphorylation, any other modifications that can be synthesized can be investigated for protein binding as well. Interactions of unmodified peptides can, furthermore, be studied by using mutated peptides as the control. Phosphopeptide of EGFR as Bait—For pull-down experiments according to the strategy outlined in Fig. 1, a bait peptide was chosen flanking tyrosine 1068 of EGFR, which is known to bind the adapter protein Grb2 upon auto-phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue (19Ward C.W.

The peptide biotinSS-SGSGLPVPEpYINQSV, containing a cleavable biotin (biotinSS) for coupling to streptavidin-coated beads and a spacer SGSG (19Ward C.W. Gough K.H. Rashke M. Wan S.S. Tribbick G. Wang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5603-5609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), was synthesized in the phosphotyrosine (pY) and tyrosine form. Lysates of 13C6-Arg-labeled HeLa cells were incubated with the phosphorylated peptide, whereas lysates of normal amino acid-containing HeLa cells (12C6-Arg-labeled) were incubated with the unphosphorylated control peptide. Eluted proteins were combined, digested to peptides, and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phosphotyrosine 1068 peptide bait removed Grb2 from the cell lysate (Fig. 2) indicating a sufficient excess of bait peptide. Out of 148 proteins identified, only Grb2 displayed pairs of tryptic peptides with a significant ratio as expected for those proteins specifically binding to the phosphopeptide (Table I). In fact, only the 13C6-labeled forms of the Grb2 peptides were detected above noise levels (Fig. 3A), indicating a ratio of more than 10 between labeled and unlabeled forms. In contrast, nonspecifically binding proteins, such as ribosomal proteins, were detected in labeled and unlabeled forms with ratios close to unity. In addition, they were present in amounts that led to 10-fold higher ion currents during mass spectrometry (Fig. 3B). This suggests that it would have been very difficult to identify the low abundant specific binder in a conventional affinity pull-down experiment through staining of proteins after gel electrophoresis. To confirm the result, a separate experiment was performed using deuterated leucine instead of arginine for metabolic labeling, and again, Grb2 was detected as the only specific binder (Table I).Table IProteins identified in peptide affinity pull-downs using either a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide of EGFR or a proline-rich motif of Sos1 and Sos2. Ratios are displayed as 13C6 to 12C6 for the pull-down experiment and as 12C6 to 13C6 for the crossover experiments.

Accession numbers refer to Swiss-Prot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To eliminate any potential variability in the binding of background proteins, “crossover” experiments were performed according to the strategy described in Fig. 1. In these experiments, the active peptide is incubated with the cell lysate of the light amino acid containing proteins, whereas the control peptide is incubated with the heavy amino acid containing proteins. Therefore, proteins that specifically bind to the bait should have 13C6 to 12C6 ratios equal to the 12C6 to 13C6 ratios in the crossover experiment (Fig. 3C). There were only 19 such proteins because most of the background proteins were identified only in one of the two experiments. Grb2 was detected with a ratio of greater than 10 in both cases and is therefore confirmed as a specific binder to the phosphopeptide. Some other proteins had large ratios in one but not the other experiment. In particular, cytoskeletal proteins show these variations, possibly due to these proteins being particularly susceptible to minor variations in lysis conditions. We have found that the requirement for significant, compatible ratios in the crossover experiment is a stringent criterion for specific binding and removed background proteins in all cases. Specificity of phosphotyrosine binding to SH2 domains is mainly determined by the amino acids immediately C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine, and it is known that exchange of the amino acid in the +2 position of the EGFR peptide used here is sufficient to abolish binding (26Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). As a further test for the specificity of our peptide-protein binding assay, we synthesized a peptide where the +2 residue was mutated to an alanine (biotinSS-SGSGLPVPEpYIAQSV). This single amino acid change led to the complete absence of Grb2 in the list of identified proteins, and none of the identified proteins had an isotopic ratio indicative of a specific binder (Fig. 3D). We cannot exclude that other specific binding proteins exist that were present at amounts below detection limits. However, the fact that Grb2 was quantified in multiple experiments (Table I), with several different peptides and with a signal-to-noise ratio of more than 10 to 1, argues that such proteins would have had to be present at much lower abundance than Grb2. Proline-rich Peptides of Sos1 and Sos2 as Bait—In addition to its SH2 domain, Grb2 has two SH3 domains that can bind proline-rich regions of the Ras guanine exchange factor Sos. In a second experiment, the specificity of the peptide-protein screen for lower affinity interactions was tested by using one of the four proline-rich motifs of the two isoforms Sos1 and Sos2. The peptides representing amino acids 1150–1158 of Sos1 (biotinSS-SGSGVPPPVPPRRR) and amino acids 1146–1154 of Sos2 (biotinSS-SGSGIPPPLPPRKK) contain the classical polyproline type II motif PXΦPXR (Φ indicates hydrophobic residue) for SH3 domain recognition (27Vidal M. Montiel J.-L. Cussac D. Cornielle F. Duchesne M. Parker F. Tocqué B. Roques B.-P. Garbay C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5343-5348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both peptides bind Grb2 with an affinity of about 4 μm, which is ∼6-fold weaker than the interaction of the SH2 domain of Grb2 with the phosphotyrosine peptide used above (25Chook Y.M. Gish G.D.

Both proline-rich peptides specifically enriched a small number of proteins out of more than 100 identified proteins.

It is also an opportunistic pathogen able to cause serious infections in immunocompromised hosts. As such, it is exposed to xenobiotics including solvents, heavy metals, and antimicrobials. We studied the response of P. aeruginosa upon exposure to heavy metals or antibiotics to investigate whether common regulatory mechanisms govern resistance to both types of compounds. We showed that sublethal zinc concentrations induced resistance to zinc, cadmium, and cobalt, while lethal zinc concentrations selected mutants constitutively resistant to these heavy metals. Both zinc-induced and stable zinc-resistant strains were also resistant to the carbapenem antibiotic imipenem. On the other hand, only 20% of clones selected on imipenem were also resistant to zinc. Heavy metal resistance in the mutants could be correlated by quantitative real time PCR with increased expression of the heavy metal efflux pump CzcCBA and its cognate two-component regulator genes czcR-czcS. Western blot analysis revealed reduced expression of the basic amino acid and carbapenem-specific OprD porin in all imipenem-resistant mutants. Sequencing of the czcR-czcS DNA region in eight independent zinc- and imipenem-resistant mutants revealed the presence of the same V194L mutation in the CzcS sensor protein. Overexpression in a susceptible wild type strain of the mutated CzsS protein, but not of the wild type form, resulted in decreased oprD and increased czcC expression. We further show that zinc is released from latex urinary catheters into urine in amounts sufficient to induce carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa, possibly compromising treatment of urinary tract infections by this class of antibiotics.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium thriving in environments polluted with organic matter. It is also an opportunistic pathogen frequently encountered in the hospital, causing morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised and cystic fibrosis patients (1Rosenfeld M. Ramsey B.W. Gibson R.L. Curr. Opin. Pulm. Med. 2003; 9: 492-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa is characterized by an intrinsically high level of resistance to xenobiotics including antimicrobial agents, solvents, and heavy metals (2Wang C.L. Michels P.C. Dawson S.C. Kitisakkul S. Baross J.A. Keasling J.D. Clark D.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 4075-4078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can be accounted for by a combination of its low outer membrane permeability and the presence of multiple efflux pumps (3Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). These pumps belong to the resistance, nodulation, cell division (RND) 1The abbreviations used are: RND, resistance, nodulation, cell division; TYG, tryptone-yeast extract-glucose; MTC, maximal tolerable concentration; qRT-PCR, quantitative real time PCR; LUC, latex urinary catheter. transporter family, present in many Gram-negative bacteria (4Saier M.H. Tam R. Reizer A. Reizer J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To extrude substrates from the cytoplasm across the two membranes, these systems are composed of a proton antiporter located in the cytoplasmic membrane, a membrane fusion protein spanning the periplasmic space, and an outer membrane protein (5Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5853-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Members of the RND family, namely the Mex pumps, have recently gained increasing interest. In particular, the constitutively expressed MexAB-OprM (6Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 7Li X.-Z. Nikaido H. Poole K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1948-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and the inducible MexXY (8Ramos-Aires J. Köhler T. Nikaido H. Plésiat P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2624-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) efflux pumps endow the PAO1 reference strain and other clinical isolates (9Ziha-Zarifi I. Llanes C. Köhler T. Pechere J.C. Plésiat P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 43: 287-291Crossref Google Scholar) with a natural resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents. Proton-driven RND type efflux pumps conferring heavy metal resistance have been described in Ralstonia metallidurans (for a recent review, see Ref. 10Mergeay M. Monchy S. Vallaeys T. Auquier V. Benotmane A. Bertin P. Taghavi S. Dunn J. van der Lelie D. Wattiez R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 385-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and include the Cnr system (nickel/cobalt) (11Liesegang H. Lemke K. Siddiqui R.A. Schlegel H.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 767-778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Ncc system (nickel/cobalt/cadmium) (12Schmidt T. Schlegel H.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7045-7054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Czc system (cobalt/zinc/cadmium) (13Mergeay M. Nies D. Schlegel H.G. Gerits J. Charles P. Van Gijsegem F. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 328-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nies D. Mergeay M. Friedrich B. Schlegel H.G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4865-4868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In P. aeruginosa, an RND type efflux pump called CzrCBA was recently described in an environmental isolate where it contributes to the intrinsic resistance to zinc and cadmium (15Hassan M.T. van der Lelie D. Springael D. Romling U. Ahmed N. Mergeay M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cross-resistance between heavy metal and antibiotic pumps has not been reported so far. In the few cases where associations have been observed they were either plasmid-mediated (16Marques A.M. Congregado F. Simon-Pujol D.M. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1979; 47: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or resulted from uncharacterized multiple resistance mechanisms (17Filali B.K. Taoufik J. Zeroual Y. Dzairi F.Z. Talbi M. Blaghen M. Curr. Microbiol. 2000; 41: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18de Vicente A. Aviles M. Codina J.C. Borrego J.J. Romero P. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1990; 68: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In P. aeruginosa, the question of heavy metal and antibiotic resistance is of particular concern since this organism is a possible candidate for bioremediation processes where selection of antibiotic resistance upon heavy metal exposure is undesirable. On the other hand, zinc was found to be released from urinary catheters resulting in antibiotic resistance (19de Haan K.E. Woroniecka U.D. Boxma H. de Groot C.J. van den Hamer C.J. Burns. 1990; 16: 393-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 20Conejo M.C. Garcia I. Martinez-Martinez L. Picabea L. Pascual A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2313-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore the possibility of cross-resistance selection by either heavy metals or antibiotics is of concern for both environmental and clinical issues. In the present study, we addressed this question by exposing the P. aeruginosa reference strain PAO1 to either zinc or to the antibiotic imipenem. Surprisingly exposure to zinc selected strains that were resistant to both heavy metals (zinc, cadmium, and cobalt) and to the carbapenem antibiotic imipenem. Analysis of the underlying mechanism revealed a co-regulation between carbapenem influx and heavy metal efflux. A single amino acid change located in the two-component sensor protein CzcS, regulating heavy metal efflux pump expression, was found to be responsible for the observed cross-resistance in P. aeruginosa. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Strain BdB4 was isolated from soil of a heavy metal-contaminated site (zinc and lead) near Geneva (Bois de Bay) by successive subculturing in tryptone-yeast extract-glucose (TYG) medium (21Mergeay M. Gerits J. Houba C. C. R. Seances Soc. Biol. Fil. 1978; 172: 575-579PubMed Google Scholar) provided with increasing ZnCl2 concentrations (10–35 mm; dose increase, 5 mm). Strain BdB4 was confirmed as P. aeruginosa using an API20NE gallery (Biomérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). Luria-Bertani (LB) (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and TYG medium were used as rich media. Some experiments were performed in liquid mineral medium (13Mergeay M. Nies D. Schlegel H.G. Gerits J. Charles P. Van Gijsegem F. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 328-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose and 50 mm sodium Hepes, pH 7.0, instead of Tris buffer. The phosphate content (0.64 mm) of this Hepes-buffered minimal medium minimized the interference of phosphate with heavy metals. Cultures were grown at 37 °C on a rotary shaker in 200-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 25 ml of minimal medium.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrainsRelevant characteristicsaZnR, CdR, and CoR, resistance to zinc, cadmium, and cobalt, respectively; IPMR, resistance to imipenem; WT, wild type.Reference or sourcePT5PAO1 wild typeLaboratory collectionPT364PT5 oprD::ΩTc57Epp S.F.

Open table in a new tab Isolation of Spontaneous Mutants Resistant to Heavy Metals or Imipenem—For selection of zinc-resistant mutants, PT5 was inoculated at a final concentration of about 2 × 107 cells/ml in 5 ml of liquid TYG medium in test tubes that were incubated for 5 days at 30 °C. The medium was supplemented with 15 (maximal tolerable concentration (MTC)), 20, 25, or 30 mm ZnCl2. From each condition, clones were isolated on TYG medium by serial dilutions. 50 clones were tested for zinc resistance after growth for 48 h at 30 °C on TYG plates containing 20 mm ZnCl2. 16 independent clones were then tested for antibiotic resistance and tolerance to other heavy metals. PT5 was also inoculated on Mueller-Hinton agar plates and exposed to imipenem-impregnated disks (10 μg, Biomérieux). After overnight incubation at 37 °C, 42 imipenem-resistant clones appearing inside the inhibition zone were picked, streaked on TYG medium, and tested for zinc resistance. Resistant mutants were then tested for tolerance to other metals (cadmium, cobalt, copper, and nickel) and antibiotics (imipenem, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, tetracycline, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and polymyxin B). Determination of Heavy Metal and Antibiotic Resistance—The MTCs of heavy metals were determined on solidified TYG medium containing different concentrations of heavy metal salts. The MTCs were scored in 10 × 10 × 2-cm Sterilin plates (Bibby Sterilin Ltd., Stone, Staffs, UK) provided with 25 compartments. 2-ml of medium were poured into each compartment, plates were air-dried, and subdivisions were inoculated with 10 μl of an overnight culture. The MTC is defined as the highest metal concentration at which growth was still observed after 48 h of incubation at 30 °C. Resistance to antibiotics was determined by the Kirby-Bauer method on Mueller-Hinton agar plates using antibiotic-impregnated disks (Biomérieux). An overnight culture grown at 37 °C in TYG medium was diluted 1:500 in 0.9% NaCl, and 2 ml of the suspension were spread on Mueller-Hinton agar plates. The plate was air-dried, and antibiotic disks were applied. After 1 h of diffusion at room temperature, plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Inhibition zones were measured and compared with those of the reference strain PT5. Killing Curves in Presence of Zinc—PT5 was grown for 48 h at 37 °C in phosphate-deficient (0.1 mm) minimal medium to increase bioavailability of heavy metals. Cultures were performed in the absence (uninduced control cells) or in the presence of 1 mm ZnCl2 (metal-induced cells). Treated cultures were found to exhibit a lag phase of about 24 h followed by a period of active growth. Both cultures were then diluted 1:200 in fresh medium containing either no zinc or a lethal zinc concentration of 5 mm. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking (150 rpm) for 5 h. Kinetics of killing of uninduced versus metal-induced cells was then followed. At defined intervals, samples were removed, diluted in TYG medium, and plated on the same medium for viable counts. DNA Manipulations—Standard techniques were used for DNA manipulation (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The gene encoding the CzcR protein was amplified by PCR from PT5 genomic DNA (Pfu DNA polymerase, Promega) with primers czcR-F and czcR-R (see below). The 900-bp product was cloned into the SmaI site of vector pMMB66EH (23Furste J.P. Pansegrau W. Frank R. Blocker H. Scholz P. Bagdasarian M. Lanka E. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 48: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) under the tac promoter, yielding plasmid pRWT. The czcS gene from PT5 and PT1105 was amplified by PCR using primers S58 (5′-cggaattcgcggcgtcggctacgtcc) and S59 (5′-cgggatcctgcggcgagtaccggctgtggc) containing an EcoRI and a HindIII site, respectively. The 1,600-bp product was EcoRI/HindIII-digested and cloned into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of pMMB66EH under the tac promoter, yielding plasmids pSWT and pSV194L, respectively. Correct orientation of the genes was verified by sequencing. Plasmids were electroporated into P. aeruginosa strain PT5 (24Smith A.W. Iglewski B.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 1710509Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To delete the czcA gene from strain PT5, a 600-bp PCR fragment corresponding to the 5′-end of czcA was generated with primers 48 (5′-cccaagcttcgaacgcatcatccaattcg) and 49 (5′-gcttcttcggatccggggcg) and ligated to an 800-bp PCR fragment containing the 3′-end of czcA generated with primers 50 (5′-cgggatcctgttcgagggcgaccgcc) and 51 (5′-gctctagatccagcgatagagcaccggc). The gentamicin resistance cassette from plasmid pPS858 (25Hoang T.T. Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kutchma A.J. Schweizer H.P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar) was inserted between the two parts in the BamHI site. This construct was cloned as a PCR fragment into the HindIII-cleaved plasmid pEX18Ap (25Hoang T.T. Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kutchma A.J. Schweizer H.P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). After transfer and homologous recombination into strain PT5, excision of the gentamicin cassette was performed as described previously (25Hoang T.T. Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kutchma A.J. Schweizer H.P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). The resulting strain PT1173 carries a 1,700-bp deletion inside the czcA gene as verified by PCR. Sequencing of czcRS—The DNA region from position 2,843,235 to 2,845,974 on the PAO1 chromosome (26Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. Hickey M.J. Brinkman F.S. Hufnagle W.O.

Nature. 2000; 406: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar) including the promoter region of czcR-czcC and the czcR-czcS operon were amplified using four different sets of primers: proczcC-F (5′-ccaggcagagtcccatcagtagc) and proczcC-R (5′-tggtgcaggtagtcggcagtctt), czcR-F (5′-aggcaacgcccgaaatgtaactt) and czcR-R (5′-ccagcttcaattgcaggttttcc), czcS1-F (5′-tctcgctgatctgggacatgaa) and czcS1-R (5′-gggatgcggtaggagagatcctg), and czcS2-F (5′-gcctgctcgacggtttcct) and czcS2-R (5′-ctgttcctcgccggtttctg). DNA sequencing was performed on double-stranded DNA templates obtained from genomic DNA by PCR amplification. Sequencing reactions were performed by the core facility of the Medical School of the University of Geneva using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) capillary sequencing machine (model 3100). Western Blot Analysis—An overnight preculture of P. aeruginosa grown in minimal medium was diluted 100-fold in the same medium and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 1. Total protein was solubilized by resuspending a bacterial pellet in 1× SDS gel loading buffer. Samples were boiled 5 min and centrifuged 10 min in a microcentrifuge to remove bacterial debris. A duplicate sample was used for protein quantification with the Lowry method (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on NaOH-solubilized extracts (28Hanson R.S. Philipps J.A. Gerhardt P. Murray R.G.E. Costilow R.N. Nester E.W. Wood W.A. Krieg N.R. Briggs Philipps G. Manual of Methods for General Bacteriology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1981: 328-364Google Scholar). 10 μg of total protein were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated with anti-OprD, anti-OprF, or anti-Hsp70 antibodies and revealed by chemiluminescence. All antibody incubations and washes were performed in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) supplemented with 5% powdered milk. Real Time PCR Analysis—For RNA isolation, strains were cultured in 5 ml of minimal glucose medium described above or in LB medium and grown at 37 °C to midexponential growth phase. 0.25 ml of this culture, corresponding to 5 × 108 cells, was added to 0.5 ml of RNeasy Protect bacteria solution (Qiagen, Hildesheim, Germany), and total RNA was isolated with RNeasy columns according to the instructions of the supplier. Residual DNA was eliminated by DNase treatment using 20 units of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega). After removal of DNase by phenol/chloroform extraction, RNA was precipitated, and the pellet resuspended in 30 μl of RNase-free H2O. For cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers (Promega) and Improm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the supplier’s instructions. Reverse transcriptase was inactivated by incubation at 70 °C for 15 min, and the obtained cDNAs were stored at –20 °C until use. The following primer sequences for the PCR amplification of cDNA were designed using the Primer3 program 2See www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi.: czcR-1 (5′-gtcatcacccggacgcagatcat) and czcR-2 (5′-gtagccgacgccgcgaatggtat), czcS-1 (5′-tacgcagctctcgcagttctcc) and czcS-2 (5′-tgtccacctgcaccaggaacagc), czcC-1 (5′-ggtcagcatcggcagcaagtacg) and czcC-2 (5′-ggtcgtaggcctgtaccgcttcg), and rpsL-3 (5′-gcaactatcaaccagctggtg) and rpsL-5 (5′-gctgtgctcttgcaggttgtg). A RotorGene real time PCR machine (model RG3000, software version 4.6.67) was used for the quantification of cDNA. PCRs were performed using a Sybr Green Quantitect kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the specifications of the supplier. To check for residual contaminating genomic DNA, control reactions without reverse transcriptase were analyzed in the real time PCR apparatus using the rpsL primer set. No amplification signal above the non-template control was detected indicating that the RNA samples were free of contaminating DNA. The cDNA samples were diluted 10-fold, and 3 μl of this dilution served as the template in the PCRs that were performed in duplicate for each gene and sample. To correct for differences in the amount of starting material, the ribosomal rpsL gene was chosen as a reference gene. Results are presented as ratios of gene expression between the target gene (target) and the reference gene (rpsL), which were obtained according to the following equation: ratio = (Etarget gene)ΔCttarget(PT5 – test strain)/(ErpsL)ΔCt rpsL(PT5 – test strain) (29Pfaffl M.W. Horgan G.W. Dempfle L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where E is the real time PCR efficiency for a given gene and Ct the crossing point of the amplification curve with the threshold. An effect on gene transcription was considered significant when the corresponding ratios were ≥2.0 or ≤0.5. Growth in Latex Urinary Catheters—Filter-sterilized urine (0.45-μm Nalgene 150-ml filters) obtained from healthy volunteers was inoculated with PT5 at a concentration of about 5 × 106 bacteria/ml and introduced into latex urinary catheters (Silkolatex Rüsch Gold, Rüsch, Kamunting, Malaysia). Catheters were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in 13-cm Petri dishes. Cell densities reached 1.5 × 109 bacteria/ml. Control PT5 bacteria unexposed to latex catheters were grown in urine in test tubes at 37 °C. To assay for the MTC of zinc, PT5 cells grown in urine were centrifuged and resuspended in the same volume of TYG medium before inoculation. Zinc concentrations in urine incubated in latex urinary catheters were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Philips-Pye-Unicam SP9). Urine was diluted 1:400 in Milli-Q water before measurements. Characterization of the CzcCBA Heavy Metal Efflux Pump from PAO1—An efflux pump of the RND transporter family, called CzrCBA, was recently shown to produce tolerance to cadmium and zinc in the P. aeruginosa strain CMG103 isolated from a metal-polluted river in Pakistan (15Hassan M.T. van der Lelie D. Springael D. Romling U. Ahmed N. Mergeay M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A highly similar efflux pump, annotated as CzcCBA, 3See www.pseudomonas.com. is present on the completely sequenced genome of the P. aeruginosa reference strain PAO1 (26Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. Hickey M.J. Brinkman F.S. Hufnagle W.O. Kowalik D.J. Lagrou M. Garber R.L. Goltry L. Tolentino E. Westbrock-Wadman S. Yuan Y. Brody L.L. Coulter S.N. Folger K.R.

Sequence alignment between the czrCBA genes from strain CMG103 (15Hassan M.T. van der Lelie D. Springael D. Romling U. Ahmed N. Mergeay M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and the czcCBA genes in the PAO1 genome (26Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. Hickey M.J.

Wong G.K. Wu Z. Paulsen I.T. Nature. 2000; 406: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar) revealed a >99% amino acid identity between the CzrA and CzcA efflux pump proteins. However, sequence variations were present in the N termini of the outer membrane proteins CzrC (CMG103) and CzcC (PAO1). Furthermore the membrane fusion protein CzrB from strain CMG103 lacks a stretch of 31 amino acids present in CzcB from PAO1. This 31-amino acid stretch is present in the CzcB protein from R. metallidurans and is 70% identical to that of PAO1 (data not shown). To analyze the contribution of the CzcCBA system to heavy metal resistance, we inactivated by homologous recombination the efflux pump gene, annotated as czcA (PA2520) in our PAO1 strain called PT5 (Table I). The resulting mutant, termed PT1173, was indeed more susceptible than its parent to zinc and cadmium as well as to cobalt (Table II). A similar increase in susceptibility to these three heavy metals was observed in strain CMG103-13 containing a transposon insertion in the czrCBA region of strain CMG103 (15Hassan M.T. van der Lelie D. Springael D. Romling U. Ahmed N. Mergeay M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). With respect to the hypersusceptibility of the czcA deletion mutant PT1173 to zinc, cadmium, and cobalt, we decided to comply with the current annotation of the PAO1 genome 3See www.pseudomonas.com. and adopted the designation CzcCBA for this heavy metal efflux pump.Table IIHeavy metal and antibiotic susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa wild type PT5 and derivatives and environmental isolate BdB4StrainsSelectionMTCsZones of inhibitionZincCadmiumCobaltCopperNickelIPMCIPmmmmPT5NA1562-3632532PT1173 (ΔczcA)NA521-2NDND2730PT5 + zincaInduced overnight at 37 °C (2 mm zinc or 0.4 mm cadmium).NA30836314bSelective pressure maintained in the Mueller-Hinton agar test plate (0.5 mm zinc, 0.1 mm cadmium).31bSelective pressure maintained in the Mueller-Hinton agar test plate (0.5 mm zinc, 0.1 mm cadmium).PT5 + cadmiumaInduced overnight at 37 °C (2 mm zinc or 0.4 mm cadmium).NA30836313bSelective pressure maintained in the Mueller-Hinton agar test plate (0.5 mm zinc, 0.1 mm cadmium).35bSelective pressure maintained in the Mueller-Hinton agar test plate (0.5 mm zinc, 0.1 mm cadmium).PT1102IPM1562-3631332PT1105IPM2583631434PT1108Zinc2583631434PT364NA1562-3631033BdB4NA156-82422528BdB4-3Zinc30104421032a Induced overnight at 37 °C (2 mm zinc or 0.4 mm cadmium).b Selective pressure maintained in the Mueller-Hinton agar test plate (0.5 mm zinc, 0.1 mm cadmium). Open table in a new tab To further characterize the CzcCBA pump, we tested its inducibility by heavy metals. Without induction, the PT5 wild type strain reached a MTC of 15, 6, and 2–3 mm for zinc, cadmium, and cobalt, respectively (Table II). After preculturing PT5 in the presence of zinc (1 mm) or cadmium (0.4 mm) the MTCs increased to 30, 8, and 3 mm for zinc, cadmium, and cobalt, respectively (Table II). MTCs of copper and nickel were not affected. A killing rate experiment showed that uninduced PT5 cells were killed after 3 h in the presence of 5 mm ZnCl2, while about 50% of cells, preincubated in the presence of 1 mm ZnCl2, stayed viable after 5 h of incubation (Fig. 1). Therefore, the induced cells are strongly protected by the CzcCBA efflux pump against a challenge with lethal heavy metal concentrations. Selection of Mutants Resistant to Either Zinc or Imipenem—We attempted to select stable, heavy metal-resistant mutants from our wild type strain. We therefore exposed PT5 to elevated zinc concentrations (20–25 mm). Sixteen independent clones displayed resistance to zinc, cadmium, and cobalt with MTCs comparable to those of the induced PT5 strain (data not shown). This resistance phenotype was stable even after several passages in the absence of zinc. Since the CzcCBA pump belongs to the RND transporter family that also includes all the Mex multidrug efflux pumps, we tested the susceptibilities of the 16 zinc-selected mutants to various antibiotics (see “Experimental Procedures”). Surprisingly all the tested mutants displayed increased imipenem resistance, while susceptibility to the other antibiotics was unaffected (data not shown). One zinc- and imipenem-resistant mutant, called PT1108, was selected for further experiments (Table II). To investigate a possible link between heavy metal and carbapenem resistance, the reciprocal experiment was performed by exposing strain PT5 to imipenem. Spontaneous mutants appearing after 24 h in the inhibition zone around the imipenem disk were picked, and their resistance profiles were analyzed. Two groups of mutants were identified. Members of the first group were resistant only to imipenem (24 of 30 mutants), while those of the second group were resistant to both heavy metals (zinc, cadmium, and c"
https://openalex.org/W2007687005,"Bim, a ""BH3-only"" protein, is expressed de novo following withdrawal of serum survival factors and promotes cell death. We have shown previously that activation of the ERK1/2 pathway promotes phosphorylation of Bim(EL), targeting it for degradation via the proteasome. However, the nature of the kinase responsible for Bim(EL) phosphorylation remained unclear. We now show that Bim(EL) is phosphorylated on at least three sites in response to activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. By using the peptidylprolyl isomerase, Pin1, as a probe for proline-directed phosphorylation, we show that ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of Bim(EL) occurs at (S/T)P motifs. ERK1/2 phosphorylates Bim(EL), but not Bim(S) or Bim(L), in vitro, and mutation of Ser(65) to alanine blocks the phosphorylation of Bim(EL) by ERK1/2 in vitro and in vivo and prevents the degradation of the protein following activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. We also find that ERK1/2, but not JNK, can physically associate with GST-Bim(EL), but not GST-Bim(L) or GST-Bim(S), in vitro. ERK1/2 also binds to full-length Bim(EL) in vivo, and we have localized a potential ERK1/2 ""docking domain"" lying within a 27-amino acid stretch of the Bim(EL) protein. Our findings provide new insights into the post-translational regulation of Bim(EL) and the role of the ERK1/2 pathway in cell survival signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1974895889,"Melanoma differentiation associated gene-5 (mda-5) was identified by subtraction hybridization as a novel upregulated gene in HO-1 human melanoma cells induced to terminally differentiate by treatment with IFN-beta+MEZ. Considering its unique structure, consisting of a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and an RNA helicase domain, it was hypothesized that mda-5 contributes to apoptosis occurring during terminal differentiation. We have currently examined the expression pattern of mda-5 in normal tissues, during induction of terminal differentiation and after treatment with type I IFNs. In addition, we have defined its genomic structure and chromosomal location. IFN-beta, a type I IFN, induces mda-5 expression in a biphasic and dose-dependent manner. Based on its temporal kinetics of induction and lack of requirement for prior protein synthesis mda-5 is an early type I IFN-responsive gene. The level of mda-5 mRNA is in low abundance in normal tissues, whereas expression is induced in a spectrum of normal and cancer cells by IFN-beta. Expression of mda-5 by means of a replication incompetent adenovirus, Ad.mda-5, induces apoptosis in HO-1 cells as confirmed by morphologic, biochemical and molecular assays. Additionally, the combination of Ad.mda-5+MEZ further augments apoptosis as observed in Ad.null or uninfected HO-1 cells induced to terminally differentiate by treatment with IFN-beta+MEZ. The mda-5 gene is located on human chromosome 2q24 and consists of 16 exons, without pseudogenes, and is conserved in the mouse genome. Present data documents that mda-5 is a novel type I IFN-inducible gene, which may contribute to apoptosis induction during terminal differentiation and during IFN treatment. The conserved genomic and protein structure of mda-5 in human and mouse will permit analysis of the evolution and developmental aspects of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W1973934517,"The biochemical changes consequent to respiratory chain inhibition and their relationship to cell death in Leishmania spp. remain elusive. Inhibitors of respiratory chain complexes I, II, and III were able to induce apoptotic death of the bloodstream form of Leishmania donovani. Complex I inhibition resulted in mitochondrial hyperpolarization that was preceded by increased superoxide production. Limitation of electron transport by thenoyltrifluoroacetone and antimycin A, inhibitors of complexes II and III, respectively, resulted in dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential that was sensitive to cyclosporin A, a blocker of mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Further studies conducted with thenoyltrifluoroacetone showed maximal generation of hydrogen peroxide with a moderate elevation of superoxide levels. Complex III inhibition provoked superoxide generation only. Interference with complex II but not complexes I and III increased intracellular Ca2+. A tight link between Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species was demonstrated by antioxidant-induced diminution of the Ca2+ increase. However, chelation of extracellular Ca2+ could not abrogate the early increase of reactive oxygen species, providing evidence that Ca2+ elevation was downstream to reactive oxygen species generation. Ca2+ influx occurred through nonselective cation and L-type channels and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger-like pathways. Antioxidants such as glutathione and Ca2+ channel blockers reduced apoptotic death. This study provides a new possibility that concurrent inhibition of respiratory chain complex II with pentamidine administration increases cytotoxicity of the drug. This increased cytotoxicity was connected to a 4-fold elevation in intracellular Ca2+ that was pooled only from intracellular sources.

Recently, the study of apoptosis in the unicellular organisms has attracted considerable attention, and the most extensively studied group is the Leishmania spp., the causative agents of various forms of leishmaniasis. Leishmania spp. have a digenic life cycle residing as flagellated extracellular promastigotes in the gut of the insect vector and as bloodstream promastigotes in the mammalian host where they infect macrophages and transform into nonflagellated amastigotes (10Chang K.P. Dwyer D.M. Science. 1976; 193: 678-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Many features of metazoan apoptosis are expressed when apoptotic death induced by diverse stimuli occurs in Leishmania spp. (3Arnoult D. Akarid K. Grodet A. Petit P.X. Estaquier J. Ameisen J.C.

Among the most important regulators of metazoan apoptosis are the mitochondria because signals generated by various death-promoting agents converge at some point on mitochondria and trigger release of proapoptotic factors (11Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lemasters J.J. Am. J.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Our earlier studies with Leishmania donovani promastigotes have clearly indicated the involvement of the single mitochondrion of the parasite in precipitating oxidative stress-induced apoptosis through a Ca2+-mediated mechanism (8Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 9Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25120-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The importance of functioning of the single mitochondrion in Leishmania spp. is very vital compared with organisms with numerous mitochondria because the presence of multiple mitochondria ensures compensation for the injured ones; however, for organisms with a single mitochondrion, no such choice exists, and survival depends on proper functioning of a single organelle. A primary component supporting mitochondrial function is the successful operation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This chain transfers electrons to oxygen from a reduced substrate thus sustaining ATP synthesis and is also one of the most important sites of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species, [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(and 6-)chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; DAF-FM, 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate; ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential; FFA, flufenamic acid; FIU, fluorescence intensity units; fluo-3AM, fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide; OxyBURST Green H2HFF-BSA, bovine serum albumin coupled to dihydro-2′,4,5,6,7,7′-hexafluorofluorescein; PI, propidium iodide; PTP, permeability transition pore; rhod-2AM, rhod-2 acetoxymethyl ester; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. production under physiological conditions (14Kroemer G.

Nature. 1999; 399: 411-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the consequences of respiratory chain inhibition in metazoans have been examined, the effects of respiratory chain dysfunction in Leishmania spp. still remain elusive. Rotenone, a potent inhibitor of mammalian electron transport chain complex I, shows no inhibition of electron transport in Leishmania spp., whereas cyanide, a complex IV inhibitor, partially inhibits electron transport (16Datta G. Bera T. Indian J. Med. Res. 2000; 112: 15-20PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the above report, oxygen uptake in Leishmania is known to be sensitive to rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), antimycin A, myxothiazol, cyanide, and azide (17Bermudez R. Dagger F. D'Aquino J.A. Benaim G. Dawidowicz K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In metazoans, inhibition of respiratory chain complexes is linked to cellular apoptosis (18Li N. Ragheb K. Lawler G. Sturgis J. Rajwa B. Melendez J.A. Robinson J.P. J. Biol.

Lett. 2002; 333: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The complex II inhibitor TTFA suppresses superoxide production but has not been linked to the process of apoptosis (25Dvorakova K. Waltmire C.N. Payne C.M. Tome M.E. Briehl M.M. Dorr R.T. Blood. 2001; 97: 3544-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When transfer of electrons from complex III to IV is stopped by antimycin A, dissipation of ΔΨm occurs in BSC-40 and HeLa G cell lines (26Kalbacova M. Vrbacky M. Drahota Z. Melkova Z. Cytometry. 2003; 52A: 110-116Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and apoptosis is induced in HL-60 cells (22King M.A. Radicchi-Mastroianni M.A. Cytometry. 2002; 49: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Antimycin A is also known to generate ROS in T cells before apoptotic death (27Dumont A. Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ueffing M. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Other kinetoplastid parasites such as Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi are reported to have a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain that is essential for survival and growth, although the effects of respiratory chain inhibition are not clear (28Njogu R.M. Whittaker C.J. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1980; 1: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Certain anti-leishmanial drugs such as the aromatic diamidine pentamidine accumulate in the mitochondria (29Croft S.L. Brazil R.P. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1982; 76: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and exclusion of the drug from the organelle is linked to drug resistance in the parasite (30Basselin M. Lawrence F. Robert-Gero M. Parasitol. Res. 1997; 83: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which this drug exerts its cytotoxic action and the relationship if any to the respiratory chain are not known. The idea that a fully functional respiratory chain favors cell survival and association of the mitochondria to apoptosis prompted us to examine the consequences of inhibition of respiratory chain components on cell death in L. donovani and decipher the mechanisms associated with such death. In addition, we wanted to investigate the relationship between pentamidine cytotoxicity and the functioning of the respiratory chain. This study provides a new possibility that concurrent inhibition of respiratory chain complex II with pentamidine administration increases cytotoxicity of the drug. Importantly, it lends credence to the suggestion that Leishmania mitochondria respond differently to inhibition of respiratory chain complexes compared with higher eukaryotes in terms of changes in ΔΨm, types of ROS generated, and the consequent ionic variations leading to cell death. Apoptosis detection system was procured from Promega (Madison, WI). JC-1, fluo-3AM, CM-H2DCFDA, OxyBURST Green H2HFF-BSA, rhod-2AM, DAF-FM, Vybrant apoptosis assay, and the ATP assay kit were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rotenone, antimycin A, TTFA, pentamidine, EGTA, GSH, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Promastigotes of L. donovani UR6 strain were cultured as described previously (8Mukherjee S.B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25120-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cultures were grown on agar slants containing 1% glucose, 5.2% brain heart infusion agar extract, and rabbit blood (6% v/v) at 25 °C with gentamycin at a final concentration of 1-1.5 mg/ml. For experimental purposes, cells were recovered from 3-day-old blood agar slants, centrifuged, and resuspended in medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum to achieve a culture density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Treatments—Cells were incubated with rotenone, the complex I inhibitor (range tested 50-200 μm), TTFA, the complex II inhibitor (range tested 250-1,000 μm), antimycin A, inhibitor of complex III (range tested, 0.025-0.1 μm), and the anti-leishmanial drug pentamidine (range tested, 150-250 μm) at 25 °C for varying periods of time; cells were processed for various biochemical assays. Cyclosporin A was used at a dose of 10 μm to preincubate cells for 1 h before exposure to the inhibitors. GSH and sodium formate were used at concentrations of 10 mm and 1 mm, respectively, and were preincubated with the cells for 1 h before cell treatments. Similarly, in Ca2+-related studies, Ca2+ channel blockers benzamil (50 μm), flufenamic acid (FFA, 240 μm), nifedipine (10 μm), and verapamil (20 μm) were used for blocking Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, nonselective cation channels, and voltage gated L-type Ca2+ channels, respectively. The Ca2+ chelator EGTA was used at a concentration of 3 mm. All Ca2+ channel blockers and the chelator were preincubated for 30 min with the cells before treatment with the complex inhibitors and pentamidine. Annexin-V Labeling—Annexin-V labeling was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions using a Vybrant apoptosis assay kit. Briefly, cells after the respective treatments were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer and suspended in annexin-V binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 700 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). Annexin-V conjugated to Alexa-Fluor and propidium iodide (PI) (10 μg/ml) were incubated with the cells for 15 min. Subsequently, cells were washed and resuspended in annexin-V binding buffer. Labeled cells were detected with the help of a E-600 Nikon fluorescence microscope using a 510-560 nm excitation filter block for red fluorescence of PI and a 440-480 nm filter block for green fluorescent Alexa-Fluor. The cells were analyzed on the basis of four groups: healthy, early apoptotic, late apoptotic and necrotic cells. Cells that did not stain for either annexin-V or PI were considered as healthy, those staining for annexin-V only were taken as apoptotic, those staining for PI as well as annexin-V were taken as late apoptotic because entry of PI indicates plasma membrane disruption and those staining with only PI, and no annexin-V were taken as necrotic cells. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase Enzyme -mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)—Detection of DNA fragmentation was carried out using a TUNEL assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (8Mukherjee S.B.

Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and postfixation permeabilization was carried out with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation with buffer containing nucleotide mix (50 μm fluorescein-12-dUTP, 100 μm dATP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) for 1 h at 37 °C. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-labeled cells were detected with the help of an E-600 Nikon fluorescence microscope. Agarose Gel DNA Analysis—Isolation of DNA from treated and untreated promastigotes and electrophoresis on agarose gel were carried out as described previously (8Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G.

Cells (106) from different experimental groups were run on an EPICS Elite ESP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) equipped with a 15-mV, 488 nm air-cooled argon ion laser. The optimized instrument parameters were as follows: for forward scatter, voltage 100 mV, gain 30; for side scatter, voltage 400 mV, gain 30; for fluorescence 1 (Alexa-Fluor), voltage 1,200 mV, mode log; and fluorescence 3 (PI), voltage 1,100 mV, mode log. Cells were isolated from fragments by gating on the forward and side scatter signals, and then promastigotes were detected and analyzed according to their relative fluorescence intensities compared with unstained promastigotes. Analyses were performed on 50,000 gated events, and numeric data were processed using WinMDI shareware. Data for annexin-Alexa-Fluor/PI were denoted as density plots, whereas for TUNEL and PI staining data have been depicted as histograms. All plots are representative of three experiments. To monitor the level of ROS, several ROS-specific dyes that could distinguish among the different species were used. The cell-permeant probe CM-H2DCFDA was used to detect H2O2 as described previously (8Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol.

CM-H2DCFDA is a nonpolar compound that readily diffuses into cells, where it is hydrolyzed to the nonfluorescent derivative dichlorodihydrofluorescein and trapped within the cells. In the presence of a proper oxidant, dichlorodihydrofluorescein is oxidized to the highly fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescein. Briefly, 107 cells were suspended in medium 199 and incubated with 2 μg/ml CM-H2DCFDA for 15 min in the dark, subsequently, treatments were carried out, and fluorescence was monitored as described previously (8Mukherjee S.B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25120-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For superoxide anion detection, OxyBURST reagent was used following the protocol described by the manufacturer. Briefly, 107 cells were loaded with 10 μg/ml OxyBURST Green H2HFF-BSA at 37 °C for 2 min, which was followed by different treatments. Relative fluorescence was monitored for both CM-H2DCFDA and OxyBURST at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm over a period of 1 h. Nitric oxide detection was carried out as described previously (9Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25120-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Typically, 107 cells were loaded with the fluorescence probe DAF-FM (1 μm) for 30 min, washed, and inhibitors were added following which NO generation was monitored at an excitation of 485 nm and emission at 520 nm. For each experiment, fluorometric measurements were performed in triplicate and expressed as fluorescence intensity units (FIU). All measurements were carried out in a FluostarOptima spectrofluorometer (BMG Technologies, Offenburg, Germany). Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured using JC-1 probe as described previously (8Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 9Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25120-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). JC-1 is a cationic mitochondrial vital dye that is lipophilic and becomes concentrated in the mitochondria in proportion to the membrane potential; more dye accumulates in mitochondria with greater ΔΨm and ATP generating capacity. Therefore, the fluorescence of JC-1 can be considered as an indicator of relative mitochondrial energy state. The dye exists as a monomer at low concentrations (emission, 530 nm, green fluorescence) but at higher concentrations forms J aggregates (emission, 590 nm, red fluorescence). Briefly, cells were labeled for 10 min with 10 μm JC-1 at 37 °C, washed, resuspended in medium, and base-line fluorescence was measured. Subsequently, the complex inhibitors were added, and the changes in fluorescence were monitored at two different wavelengths as mentioned above. The ratio of the reading at 590 nm to the reading at 530 nm (590:530 ratio) was considered as the relative ΔΨm value. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were monitored with the fluorescent probe fluo-3AM as described previously (8Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 9Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25120-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded for 30 min at 25 °C with 5 μm fluo-3AM containing 1 μm pluronic acid F-127 for proper dispersal and 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, an organic anion transport inhibitor to inhibit the leakage of the fluo-3 dye. Just before use, cells were washed with medium to remove nonhydrolyzed fluo-3AM. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C at an excitation of 488 nm and emission of 522 nm. To convert fluorescence values into absolute [Ca2+]i, calibration was performed at the end of each experiment. [Ca2+]i was calculated using the equation, [Ca2+]i=Kd((F-Fmin)/(Fmax-F))(Eq. 1) where Kd is the dissociation constant of the Ca2+-fluo-3 complex (400 nm), and F represents the fluorescence intensity of the cells. Fmax represents the maximum fluorescence (obtained by treating cells with 10 μm calcium ionophore A23187), and Fmin corresponds to the minimum fluorescence (obtained from ionophore-treated cells in the presence of 3 mm EGTA). Fluorescence intensities were expressed as the increase in fluorescence with respect to base-line fluorescence intensity before stimulation. For separate measurement of mitochondrial Ca2+ signals, freshly isolated cells were loaded at 4 °C for 1 h with 5 μm rhod-2AM, containing 1 μm pluronic acid F-127 for proper dispersal (31Opuni K. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21549-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone (32Szalai G. Csordas G. Hantash B.M. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15305-15313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) to prevent leakage, centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 × g and resuspended in media for incubation at 25 °C for 30 min to allow hydrolysis of rhod-2AM trapped in mitochondria. Rhod-2 fluorescence was measured at an excitation of 530 nm and emission of 576 nm. ATP was measured by a bioluminescence assay using an ATP determination kit as described previously (8Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the luciferase requirement for ATP in producing light (emission maximum ∼ 560 nm at pH 7.8). Briefly, cells (∼1 × 106) after different treatments were resuspended in reaction buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm luciferin, and 12.5 μg/ml luciferase and mixed gently, after which readings were taken in a FluostarOptima multilabel detection system. ATP standard curves were run in all experiments with different concentrations of ATP, calculations were made against the curve, and cellular ATP levels were expressed as nmol/106 cells. Cellular GSH levels were measured in different treatment groups with the fluorescence probe o-phthalaldehyde as described previously (8Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). O-Phthalaldehyde-derived fluorescence was measured at 365 nm excitation and 430 nm emission. GSH standard curves were run in parallel to all experiments with different concentrations of GSH; calculations were made against the curve, and cellular GSH levels were expressed as nmol/107 cells. Paired comparisons were conducted using a paired t test, and all data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Differences were considered significant at a 0.05 level of confidence. Inhibition of Respiratory Chain Complexes I, II, and III Induces Changes in ΔΨm—Respiratory chain complexes are located in the mitochondria and drive the maintenance of ΔΨm through protons generated during electron transfer. Therefore, it is expected that any interference with electron transport would influence ΔΨm. To arrive at a dose that would interfere with ΔΨm, a dose response with three different inhibitors of respiratory chain complexes I, II, and III was carried out. Rotenone, the complex I inhibitor (range tested 50-200 μm), at a dose of 100 μm was able to induce mitochondrial hyperpolarization that was reflected in the increase of ΔΨm values within the first 30 min (Fig. 1A, b) compared with controls (Fig. 1A, a), and values at 1 min (Fig. 1A, b). In contrast, TTFA, the complex II inhibitor (range tested 250 μm-1 mm), at a dose of 500 μm and antimycin A (range tested, 0.025-0.1 μm), inhibitor of complex III, at a dose of 0.05 μm, induced a dissipation of ΔΨm values within 20-60 min (Fig. 1A, c and d). The selection of the above doses for further experiments from the ranges tested was based on the ability of a given dose to induce alterations in ΔΨm sufficiently. One of the changes associated with ΔΨm dissipation in some cell systems is the opening of the mitochondrial megachannel or permeability transition pore (PTP) (13Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We preincubated cells with cyclosporin A, a blocker of the PTP (33Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), before exposure to respiratory chain inhibitors to see whether cyclosporin A-sensitive channels were operative during ΔΨm dissipation. Interestingly, cyclosporin A could not prevent the hyperpolarization induced by rotenone (Fig. 1B, b) but could prevent the dissipation of ΔΨm induced by TTFA and antimycin A (Fig. 1B, c and d). The above observations clearly establish that interference with respiratory chain function in L. donovani leads to alterations in promastigote ΔΨm. In addition, evidence shows that cyclosporin A-sensitive channels are operative when respiratory chains II and III are inhibited. Respiratory Chain Inhibition Results in a Loss of Cell Viability, and Cell Loss Occurs through Apoptosis—Changes in ΔΨm have been originally postulated to be early, obligate events in the apoptotic signaling pathway (34Zamzami N.

The Rho GTPases, RhoA and Rac1, have been shown previously to activate PIP5K and to bind PIP5K. Three type I PIP5K isoforms (Iα,Iβ, and Iγ) have been identified; however, it is unclear whether these isoforms are differentially or even sequentially regulated by Rho GTPases. Here we show that RhoA and Rac1, as well as Cdc42, but not the Ras-like GTPases, RalA and Rap1A, markedly stimulate PIP2 synthesis by all three PIP5K isoforms expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, both in vitro and in vivo. RhoA-stimulated PIP2 synthesis by the PIP5K isoforms was mediated by the RhoA effector, Rho-kinase. Stimulation of PIP5K isoforms by Rac1 and Cdc42 was apparently independent of and additive with RhoA- and Rho-kinase, as shown by studies with C3 transferase and Rho-kinase mutants. RhoA, and to a lesser extent Rac1, but not Cdc42, interacted in a nucleotide-independent form with all three PIP5K isoforms. Binding of PIP5K isoforms to GTP-bound, but not GDP-bound, RhoA could be displaced by Rho-kinase, suggesting a direct and constitutive PIP5K-Rho GTPase binding, which, however, does not trigger PIP5K activation. In summary, our findings indicate that synthesis of PIP2 by the three PIP5K isoforms is controlled by RhoA, acting via Rho-kinase, as well as Rac1 and Cdc42, implicating that regulation of PIP2 synthesis has a central position in signaling by these three Rho GTPases.

This astonishing variety of functions demands the cellular level of PIP2 and, hence, the lipid kinases involved in its synthesis, to be detailed and distinctly regulated. A critical role in PIP2 synthesis takes type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K), which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the D-5 position of the inositol ring, committing the final step in PIP2 synthesis in vivo (13Stephens L.R.

In line with this function, overexpression of type I PIP5K isoforms was shown to modulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics and to induce stress fibers (15Shibasaki Y. Ishihara H. Kizuki N. Asano T. Oka Y.

Type I PIP5Ks are now clearly distinguished from type II PIP kinases, which actually phosphorylate phosphoinositides at the D-4 position (20Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C.

Theoretically, type II isozymes might contribute to PIP2 synthesis by phosphorylating PI5P, but the importance of this alternative pathway in vivo is not yet clarified. Three isoforms of type I PIP5K have been identified, designated Iα, Iβ, and Iγ, with molecular masses of 68 kDa (Iα and Iβ) and 90 kDa (Iγ), respectively (22Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N.

The differential regulation and/or subcellular localization of the PIP5K isoforms obviously could represent a mechanism for cells to coordinate their PIP2 production. Indeed, PIP5K-Iα was found to specifically localize to membrane ruffles (25Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Wojtasiak M.L. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

Wang Y.J. Yamamoto M. Yin H. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Small GTPases of the Rho family are key regulators of cytoskeletal organization (29Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A.

Both studies do agree in the observation that the binding of PIP5K is independent of the nucleotide-binding state (GDP or GTP) of the Rho GTPases. In the present study, we have examined the interaction of type I PIP5K isoforms with Rho GTPases. We find that, upon expression in HEK-293 cells, all three type I PIP5K isoforms are positively regulated by RhoA and Rac1, but also by Cdc42, resulting in enhanced cellular PIP2 levels. The stimulation of PIP5K isoforms by RhoA is entirely mediated by Rho-kinase, whereas the effects of Rac1 and Cdc42 are largely independent of the RhoA/Rho-kinase relay. In addition, we show that all three type I PIP5K isoforms physically associate with RhoA and Rac1, but not with Cdc42.

Briefly, cells subcultured in poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm dishes were extracted on ice with 0.5 m trichloroacetic acid for 20 min to remove soluble inositol phosphates. The remaining membrane lipids were extracted with acidified chloroform/methanol, and PIP2 was hydrolyzed to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) with 1 m KOH at 100 °C for 15 min. After neutralization on Dowex-50 columns, the samples were assayed for IP3 by the displacement of [3H]IP3 from bovine adrenal cortical IP3-binding protein (48Chilvers E.R. Batty I.H. Challiss R.A.J.

Preparation and Nucleotide Loading of GST Fusion Proteins—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, and RB were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as described (49Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm glutathione. Alternatively, native proteins were obtained by cleaving the fusion constructs with thrombin (10 U) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The beads were recovered by centrifugation and used as the respective control GST beads. Thrombin was inactivated by treatment with p-aminobenzamidine beads. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford method, and the preparations were analyzed for their homogeneity by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.

Binding of PIP5K to GST-Rho GTPase Fusion Proteins—Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 40,000 × g. Aliquots of the supernatants (typically 500 μg of protein) were incubated with GST or GST fusion proteins bound to Sepharose beads (20 μg of protein) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The beads were centrifuged at 5,000 × g and rapidly washed three times with Buffer B and once with kinase buffer. The beads were assayed for PIP5K activity or incubated in Laemmli buffer for 10 min at 95 °C, followed by separation of the released proteins by SDS-PAGE (10%). The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, which were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h.

Immunoprecipitation—Clarified cell lysates (1.0 mg of protein) were incubated with antibodies (1 μg) to RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 or with non-immune IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), coupled to protein A-Agarose (20 μl) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the precipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer. The precipitated proteins were washed with kinase buffer and assayed for PIP5K activity or analyzed by immunoblotting (SDS-PAGE on 15% acrylamide gels) with the respective anti-GTPase antibodies. Phosphorylation of MLC—Beads were incubated in 50 μl of protein kinase buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) with 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/assay) and 2 μg of MLC for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of concentrated Laemmli buffer and heating for 10 min at 95 °C.

Stimulation of Type I PIP5K Isoforms by RhoA- and Rho-kinase—Previously, we have shown that RhoA and its effector, Rho-kinase, enhance the synthesis of PIP2 by stimulating the activity of PIP5K (37Oude Weernink P.A. Schulte P. Guo Y. Wetzel J. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Haverland S. Voss M. Schmidt M. Mayr G.W. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol.

We now separately examined the individual type I PIP5K isoforms for their responsiveness to RhoA- and Rho-kinase. For this, PIP5K-Iα, PIP5K-Iβ, and PIP5K-Iγ were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, and PIP5K activity was determined in whole cell lysates, using PI4P and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates. Transfection of all three PIP5K isoforms manifested in a dose-dependent, robust, and specific increase in [32P]PIP2 synthesis (Fig. 1). Synthesis of [32P]PIP from cellular or exogenous (not shown) PI was only marginally affected by expression of the PIP5K isoforms. The identity of the produced PIP2 was confirmed to be exclusively phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by high performance liquid chromatography after deacylation (not shown). Cells transfected with equal amounts of cDNA encoding the catalytically inactive PIP5K-Iα A138 did not exhibit increased lipid kinase activity (Fig. 1). The strong increases in PIP2 synthesis confirmed the biological activity of the constructs and enabled us to study the regulation of the individual isoforms in a cellular context. To examine whether the isoforms are regulated by Rho, cells were transfected with the PIP5K isoforms, together with RhoA or C3 transferase. Overexpression of RhoA resulted in a marked, up to 8-fold increase in the kinase activity of all three isoforms (see below), whereas inhibition of endogenous Rho by expression of C3 transferase reduced the synthesis of [32P]PIP2 by 20–30% (data not shown). To screen the responsiveness of the PIP5K isoforms to Rho-kinase, cells were co-transfected with the catalytic domain of Rho-kinase (Rho-kinase-CAT) (36Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), and the lysates were assayed for PIP5K activity. Stimulation of endogenous PIP5K activity by Rho-kinase (∼1.4-fold) was strongly potentiated in cells overexpressing the PIP5K isoforms (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation of PI was not affected by the co-expression of PIP5K isoforms with Rho-kinase-CAT. All three isoforms were stimulated by Rho-kinase, but [32P]PIP2 synthesis was elevated the strongest in cells expressing PIP5K-Iβ (∼40-fold), as compared with PIP5K-Iα (∼6-fold) or PIP5K-Iγ (∼8-fold) (Fig. 2B, left panel). No potentiation of [32P]PIP2 synthesis by Rho-kinase was seen in cells transfected with PIP5K-Iα A138. Very similar effects were obtained when wild-type Rho-kinase was co-transfected with PIP5K isoforms instead of Rho-kinase-CAT (not shown). The increase in PIP5K activity by Rho-kinase was reflected in elevated in vivo PIP2 levels in the transfected cells. Expression of Rho-kinase-CAT caused an increase in cellular PIP2 by 40–90% in cells overexpressing PIP5K-Iα, PIP5K-Iβ, and PIP5K-Iγ, but again, had no effect in cells expressing PIP5K-Iα A138 (Fig. 2B, right panel).Fig. 2Stimulation of type I PIP5K isoforms by Rho-kinase.A, HEK-293 cells were transfected with 30 μg of vector (Con), PIP5K-Iα, PIP5K-Iβ, or PIP5K-Iγ, together with 40 μg of pEF (-) or Rho-kinase-CAT (+). After 48 h, the cell lysates (50 μg) were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and either PI or PI4P, and the production of [32P]PIP (upper panel) and [32P]PIP2 (lower panel) was determined. B, cells were transfected with PIP5K-Iα, PIP5K-Iβ, PIP5K-Iγ, or PIP5K-Iα A138, together with 40 μg of pEF (empty vector) or with 40 μg of Rho-kinase-CAT. After 48 h, the cells were assayed for PIP5K activity (left panel) or cellular PIP2 mass (right panel). PIP5K activities in cell lysates are expressed as -fold stimulation compared with control (without Rho-kinase-CAT) and are mean ± S.E. of three experiments. PIP2 masses are mean ± S.D. for triplicate determinations and representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stimulation of PIP5K Isoforms by Rac1 and Cdc42—We then investigated the regulation of PIP5K isoforms by Rac1 and Cdc42. Similar to RhoA, overexpression of Rac1 and Cdc42 enhanced in vitro PIP5K activity (Fig. 3A). Stimulation of endogenous PIP5K by the Rho GTPases amounted to 50–80% (Fig. 3A, upper panel). The effect was strongly potentiated in cells co-transfected with PIP5K-Iα, PIP5K-Iβ, and PIP5K-Iγ, indicating that all three isoforms respond to the three Rho GTPases (Fig. 3A, lower panels). Stimulation of PIP5K activity was also seen in cells transfected with constitutively active mutants of the Rho GTPases (not shown), whereas expression of the inactive mutants, RhoA N19, Rac1 N17, and Cdc42 N17, had no effect (Fig. 3B, upper panel). In contrast to the Rho GTPases, overexpression of the Ras-related GTPases, RalA and Rap1A, did not increase the synthesis of [32P]PIP2 (Fig. 3B, lower panel). We next examined whether, similar to RhoA- and Rho-kinase, Rac1 and Cdc42 affect the cellular level of PIP2. Transfection of cells with PIP5K-Iα and increasing amounts of either"
https://openalex.org/W1968176555,"<i>bcl-2</i> mRNA contains an AU-rich element (ARE) that functions in regulating <i>bcl-2</i> stability. Our earlier studies indicated that taxol- or okadaic acid-induced <i>bcl-2</i> mRNA destabilization in HL-60 cells is associated with decreased binding of <i>trans</i>-acting factors to the ARE. To identify factors that play a role in the regulation of <i>bcl-2</i> mRNA stability, <i>bcl-2</i> ARE-binding proteins were purified from HL-60 cells. Three polypeptides of 100, 70, and 32 kDa were isolated from a <i>bcl-2</i> ARE affinity matrix. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy analysis identified these proteins as full-length nucleolin and proteolytic fragments of nucleolin. RNA gel shifts assays indicated that recombinant nucleolin (residues 284–707) binds specifically to <i>bcl-2</i> ARE RNA. In addition, recombinant nucleolin decreases the rate of decay of mRNA in HL-60 cell extracts in an ARE-dependent manner. Taxol or okadaic acid treatment of HL-60 cells results in proteolysis of nucleolin in a similar time frame as drug-induced <i>bcl-2</i> mRNA down-regulation. These findings suggest that nucleolin functions as a <i>bcl-2</i>-stabilizing factor and that taxol and okadaic acid treatment induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells through a process that involves down-regulation of nucleolin and destabilization of <i>bcl-2</i> mRNA."

Each of the subunits consists of a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD) and a hydrophilic, highly conserved cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), which couples the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocation of peptides across the ER membrane. Based on hydrophobicity analysis and sequence alignments with members of the ABC-B subfamily, 10 and 9 TMs have been predicted for human TAP1 and TAP2, respectively (18Tampé R. Urlinger S.

The ER-luminal domain of US6 inhibits peptide translocation by specifically blocking ATP binding to TAP (26Kyritsis C. Gorbulev S. Hutschenreiter S. Pawlitschko K. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol.

Our results demonstrate for the first time that a 6 + 6-TM core domain is sufficient for assembly of a functional TAP transporter, which can be specifically blocked by viral proteins. Strikingly, the N-terminal domains are found to be essential for recruitment of tapasin, the central component of the peptide-loading complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Expression of TAP Constructs and Tapasin—To generate human TAP1-(Δ2–132) (mini7, 7 TMs remaining), TAP1-(Δ2–166) (mini6, 6 TMs remaining), TAP2-(Δ2–89) (mini7), and TAP2-(Δ2–122) (mini6), the vectors p46TAP1wt and p46TAP2wt (28Heintke S.

Recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the Bac-to-Bac® Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). Cloning and expression of the wt TAP1 and TAP2 constructs were performed as described (29Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Microsome Preparation—Insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9)) were grown in Sf900II medium (Invitrogen) following standard procedures. Infection with recombinant baculovirus and preparation of microsomes were performed as described (29Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R.

For single infections a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 3, for co-infections a m.o.i. of 3 for the TAP constructs, and an m.o.i. of 30 for tapasin were used. The TAP content in microsome preparations was determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using TAP1-(mAb 148.3) and TAP2 (mAb 435.3)-specific antibodies (29Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S.

Relative amounts of TAP1 and TAP2 were quantified after luminescence imaging (Lumi-Imager F1™, Roche Applied Science).Peptide Binding—Microsomes (50 μg of total protein) were mixed with different concentrations (10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 2000 nm) of radiolabeled peptide (RRYQKSTEL) in the absence and presence of a 400-fold molar excess of non-labeled peptide in 50 μl of AP buffer (5 mm MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0) and incubated for 15 min on ice. Non-bound peptides were removed by washing the microsomes with 200 μl of AP buffer using a vacuum manifold. The amount of radioactivity bound to the microsomes was quantified by γ-counting and corrected for the signal obtained in the presence of non-labeled peptide. All experiments were performed as triplicates. Radiolabeling of peptides was performed as described (31Chen M. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29686-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Peptide Transport—Microsomes (50 μg of total protein) were mixed with radiolabeled peptide (1 μm, RRYQNSTEL), ATP (3 mm), or ADP (3 mm) in 50 μl of AP buffer and incubated for 3 min at 32 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 500 μl of cold AP buffer supplemented with 10 mm EDTA. After centrifugation, the microsomes were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. Glycosylated peptides were bound to 60 μl of concanavalin A-Sepharose (50% (v/v)) for 16 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, radioactivity associated with the concanavalin A beads was quantified by γ-counting. For TAP-specific inhibition, the active domain of ICP47-(3–34) was used as described previously (32Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed as triplicates.Immunoprecipitation—50 μl of microsomes (250 μg of total protein) were solubilized in 50 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2% (w/v) digitonin (Calbiochem), pH 7.5) for 30 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with 100 μl of mAb 148.3 hybridoma supernatant. 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% slurry) in lysis buffer was added and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) digitonin, pH 7.5). Proteins were eluted in sample buffer (10 min at 65 °C) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a tapasin-specific monoclonal antibody (rat mAb 1E2) or a TAP1-specific polyclonal antibody.ATP-Agarose Binding Assays—The ATP binding activity of TAP was analyzed based on published procedures (33Knittler M.R. Alberts P. Deverson E.V. Howard J.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 999-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of US6 on TAP was analyzed as described previously (26Kyritsis C. Gorbulev S. Hutschenreiter S. Pawlitschko K. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48031-48039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In brief, His-tagged US6-(Δ147–183) was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography from inclusion bodies, and refolded as described previously (26Kyritsis C. Gorbulev S. Hutschenreiter S. Pawlitschko K. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48031-48039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Digitonin-solubilized TAP was incubated with ATP-agarose in the presence and absence of US6. Bound protein was eluted with MgATP (10 mm) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the TAP1-specific monoclonal antibody 148.3. To analyze tapasin binding to TAP, 200 μl of microsomes (1 mg of total protein) were solubilized in 200 μl of solubilization buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.75 mm MnCl2, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) digitonin, pH 7.4) for 15 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 20 mg of ATP-agarose in 1 ml of solubilization buffer were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The ATP-agarose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer (solubilization buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) digitonin). Proteins were eluted in 200 μl of washing buffer containing 10 mm MgATP for 5 min on ice and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.RESULTSEach TMD of the transporter subunits TAP1 and TAP2 can be subdivided into a core domain of six predicted TMs (conserved architecture of the ABC-B family) and an N-terminal region of four or three TMs (19Abele R. Tampé R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To investigate the function of these N-terminal domains, we generated truncation variants with seven (mini7TAP; TAP1-(Δ2–132), TAP2-(Δ2–89)) and six remaining TMs (mini6TAP; TAP1-(Δ2–166), TAP2-(Δ2–122)) within TAP1 and TAP2. Mini6TAP corresponds to a 6 + 6-TM core complex (Fig. 1A). The TAP constructs were expressed in Sf9 insect cells as shown by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting with antibodies specific for TAP1 or TAP2 (Fig. 1B). Mini7TAP1 displays the same electrophoretic mobility as a degradation product observed for wt TAP1 (65 kDa).To analyze peptide recognition of all TAP constructs, saturation binding experiments were performed with isolated microsomes and radiolabeled peptide (RRYQKSTEL). All TAP constructs had similar peptide binding constants as wt TAP (wt TAP, KD = 213 ± 21 nm; mini7TAP, 240 ± 56 nm; mini6TAP, 170 ± 47 nm), demonstrating that the peptide-binding pocket was fully maintained in the 6 + 6-TM core complex (Fig. 2). In addition, real time binding kinetics with fluorescein-labeled peptides showed that peptide association and dissociation rates at mini6 and mini7TAP constructs did not differ from wt TAP (data not shown).Fig. 2Peptide binding to the core TAP complex. Peptide binding to the TAP complex. After addition of radiolabeled peptide (RRYQKSTEL) and subsequent washing, bound peptides were quantified by γ-counting. The peptide binding curves were fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The peptide dissociation constants KD were 213 ± 21 nm for wt TAP (A), 240 ± 56 nm for mini7TAP (B), and 170 ± 47 nm for mini6TAP (C). For peptide binding, equal amounts of TAP were used in triplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then examined the transport function of the TAP variants by in vitro peptide translocation assays with radiolabeled peptide (RRYQNSTEL, single letter code; the N-glycosylation targeting sequence is underlined) as described previously (34Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hämmerling G.J. Science. 1993; 261: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent peptide transport activities were found for all TAP constructs (Fig. 3, A–C). Because TAP1 or TAP2 alone is non-functional (29Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 35Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Pilley E.S. Blake N. Powis S.J. Immunology. 2002; 106: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the results demonstrate formation of functional heterodimers. The increased transport activity of mini6TAP can be explained by a higher stability of the core TAP complex (mini6TAP) compared with wt TAP as analyzed by time-dependent loss of the peptide binding capacity of TAP (data not shown). In the presence of the non-labeled high affinity peptide (RRYQKSTEL, 400-fold molar excess), the transport activity of all TAP constructs was reduced to background level. Furthermore, all TAP constructs remained sensitive to inhibition by the TAP-specific viral inhibitor ICP47. In conclusion, the peptide-binding pocket and the overall structure required for peptide transport are preserved in the core TAP complex. We next examined the inhibitory effect of the human cytomegaloviral protein US6 on ATP binding of the full-length and the core TAP complex. Interestingly, wild type and mini6TAP have the same nucleotide binding activities as demonstrated by ATP-agarose binding (Fig. 3D). However, wt TAP and mini6TAP lost their ability to bind ATP in the presence of US6. Similar results were observed for mini7TAP (data not shown). On the basis of these data we conclude that the N-terminal domains of TAP1 and TAP2 are not essential for US6 binding and specific inhibition of peptide translocation by US6.Fig. 3Peptide transport and viral inhibition of the core TAP complex. A–C, peptide transport into microsomes. Radiolabeled peptide (RRYQNSTEL) was used as substrate in the presence of ATP (3 mm), apyrase (40 units/ml), ADP (3 mm), non-labeled competitor peptide (RRYQKSTEL, 400-fold molar excess plus 3 mm ATP), or the TAP-specific viral inhibitor ICP47 (250-fold molar excess plus 3 mm ATP). Transported peptides were quantified by γ-counting. For peptide transport equal amounts of TAP were used in triplicate experiments. D, digitonin-solubilized TAP (wt TAP or mini-6TAP) was incubated with ATP-agarose in the presence and absence of 20 μm of US6-(Δ147–183). After three washing steps, specifically bound protein was eluted by MgATP (10 mm) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a TAP1-specific antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we investigated the importance of the N-terminal domains of TAP for recruitment of tapasin, a key component of the peptide-loading complex. First, co-expression of tapasin and TAP (wt TAP, mini7TAP, or mini6TAP) in microsomes was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). Due to post-translational modification (36Turnquist H.R. Vargas S.E. Reber A.J. McIlhaney M.M. Li S. Wang P. Sanderson S.D. Gubler B. van Endert P. Solheim J.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4443-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), two protein species (46/48 kDa) were detected with the tapasin-specific antibody. In the range of error, co-expression of tapasin and TAP did not affect peptide transport into isolated microsomes (data not shown). Most recently, it was reported that tapasin stabilizes TAP as analyzed by the steady-state expression level of TAP in wild type and tapasin-deficient murine cells (11Garbi N. Tiwari N. Momburg F. Hämmerling G.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, as shown previously, this effect is compensated by the much stronger expression of TAP in insect cells (12Raghuraman G. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41786-41794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For interaction studies, TAP was immunoprecipitated from digitonin-solubilized microsomes, and immunocomplexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with tapasin- and TAP1-specific antibodies (Fig. 4B). Although the expression level for the TAP variants was even higher than for wt TAP, interaction of tapasin with mini6 and mini7TAP could not be detected. However, Full-length TAP showed strong tapasin binding in accordance with published data (2Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampé R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 3Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). As a control, tapasin was not immunoprecipitated by a TAP-specific antibody in the absence of TAP.Fig. 4Tapasin binding to TAP. A, co-expression of tapasin and TAP (wt TAP, mini7TAP or mini6TAP) in microsomes of insect and Raji cells was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using TAP1-, TAP2-, and tapasin-specific antibodies. Equivalents of microsomal protein were loaded on the gel. B, TAP-tapasin complexes were co-immunoprecipitated from digitonin-solubilized microsomes and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a tapasin-(upper panel) or a TAP1-specific antibody (lower panel). Microsomes expressing tapasin but not TAP were used as control. S, solubilized fraction; IP, immune precipitate. C, after digitonin solubilization, TAP was captured with ATP-agarose. After three washing steps, protein complexes were specifically eluted with MgATP (10 mm) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with tapasin-specific antibodies. Equal amounts of wt, mini7, and mini6 TAP were eluted (data not shown). Microsomes expressing tapasin but not TAP were used as control. S, solubilized fraction; W, wash; E, eluted fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In an alternative approach, TAP complexes were captured by specific binding to ATP-agarose. Specifically bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 4C). Mini6, mini7, and wt TAP showed the same ATP binding activity (see above). Again, tapasin was found associated only with wt TAP, but not with mini7 or mini6TAP, demonstrating that the N-terminal domains of TAP1 and TAP2 are essential for tapasin binding. Tapasin alone did not bind to the ATP-agarose beads.DISCUSSIONAs a common architecture, ABC transporters share two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), which couple ATP hydrolysis to substrate transport. Most ABC transporters comprise six transmembrane segments (TMs). However, extra N-terminal extensions can be found. For example, the N-terminal domain (TMD0) of the sulfonylurea receptor, which is associated with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy, recruits the potassium channel subunit KIR6.2 (37Babenko A.P.

The mutations in WNK1 are large deletions in the first intron that increase its expression up to 5-fold. The WNK4 mutations are missense mutations located in regions near the two coiled-coil domains that are highly conserved among the four WNKs (8Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodeme S. Choate K.A. Ishikawa K.

Recently, WNK4 has been shown to inhibit the activity of the sodium chloride cotransporter by reducing its membrane expression (11Wilson F.H. Kahle K.T. Sabath E. Lalioti M.D. Rapson A.K. Hoover R.S.

This inhibition was reported to be dependent on the catalytic activity of WNK4, and the disease-causing mutation Q562E has less inhibitory effect. WNK1, on the other hand, was found to have no effect on sodium chloride cotransporter activity on its own. However, WNK1 relieved sodium chloride cotransporter inhibition by WNK4 (12Yang C.L.

These new findings provide a potential mechanism for regulation of blood pressure by WNKs and suggest an explanation for the finding that loss of WNK regulation causes hypertension. MAP kinase (MAPK) cascades are involved in many signal transduction pathways including those regulating cell cycle, transcription, apoptosis, and proliferation (13Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F.

There are several MAPK pathways in mammals. One of them, the ERK5 MAPK pathway, contains MEK5 (MAP2K) and MEKK2/3 (MAP3K) as its upstream regulators (15Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

In the present study, we demonstrate that overexpression of WNK1 in HEK293 cells causes activation of ERK5 but not ERK2. The activation is blocked by the MEK5 inhibitor U0126 and is dependent on MEKK2/3. Furthermore, WNK1 is required for activation of ERK5 by EGF.

Lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100 or Nonidet P-40 was used, except for coimmunoprecipitation experiments, in which case detergent was omitted. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% l-glutamine at 37 °C under 10% CO2. For RNA interference experiments, HeLa cells were grown in 6-well plates to 30% confluence on the day of transfection.

After 72 h, the cells were deprived of serum for 4 h before treatment. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—For immunoblotting, proteins from the cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransference to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with the indicated antibodies and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with the respective antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with either 1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) (for the kinase assay) or 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2 (for coimmunoprecipitation). In Vitro Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were performed as described by Xu et al. (35Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Most kinase reactions were in buffer containing 50 μm ATP; reactions with FLAG-MEKK3 included 10 μm ATP. To examine phosphorylation of FLAG-MEKK2/3 (kinase-dead) phosphorylation by His6-WNK1-(198–491), FLAG-MEKK2/3 (kinase-dead) proteins immunoprecipitated from cell lysates were preincubated in 1× kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C prior to addition of His6-WNK1-(198–491) and ATP. Overexpression of WNK1 Activates ERK5 in HEK293 Cells— We reported previously that overexpression of WNK1-(1–555) did not activate cotransfected MAPKs in HEK293 cells (3Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we identified an autoinhibitory domain in WNK1 located between residues 491 and 555 (9Xu B. Min X. Stippec S. Lee B.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48456-48462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because WNK1-(1–491) had much higher catalytic activity than WNK1-(1–555) in vitro, we thought it was necessary to examine the more active form, WNK1-(1–491), for its possible effects on the activities of MAPKs. Thus, HA-tagged ERK2 or ERK5 was transfected into HEK293 cells along with either the vector or Myc-tagged WNK1-(1–491). Remarkably, ERK5 activity assayed using its substrate GST·MEF2C was increased significantly by WNK1-(1–491) compared with the vector control (Fig. 1A). In contrast, ERK2 activity was not affected by WNK1-(1–491) when assayed with myelin basic protein (Fig. 1B). Enhanced ERK5 autophosphorylation is another indicator of its activation state. As shown in Fig. 1C, WNK1-(1–491) increased ERK5 autophosphorylation as well as its activity toward GST·MEF2C. Activation of ERK5 was greater with wild type WNK1; a kinase defective mutant, WNK1-(1–491) K233M, did not stimulate ERK5 autophosphorylation or activity toward GST·MEF2C as well, although a small increase in ERK5 autophosphorylation was detected (Fig. 1C). We also found that expression of full-length WNK1 activated ERK5 (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that WNK1 might act as an upstream kinase in the ERK5 MAPK pathway. Activation of ERK5 by WNK1 Requires MEK5 Activity—We next examined whether activation of ERK5 by WNK1 required the known MEK in the ERK5 pathway, MEK5. To address this question, we first used kinase-dead mutants (KM) of the two MEK5 isoforms, α and β. MEK5α K195M fully blocked activation of ERK5 by WNK1 (Fig. 2A). Both ERK5 autophosphorylation and activity toward GST·MEF2C were reduced to the control value. Unexpectedly, MEK5β K106M had no effect in the same experiment. In addition, we utilized the pharmacological compound U0126, which specifically inhibits the activities of MEK1, MEK2, and MEK5 but not other MAP2Ks (30Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). At 10 μm, U0126 efficiently blocked the activation of ERK5 by WNK1 in transfected cells treated for 1 h prior to harvest (Fig. 2B). These findings indicate that MEK5 activity is crucial for activation of ERK5 by WNK1. Activation of ERK5 by WNK1 Is Dependent on MEKK2 and MEKK3—MEKK2 and MEKK3, the two known MAP3Ks in the ERK5 MAPK pathway, interact with MEK5 and activate the MEK5-ERK5 cascade (18Chao T.H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Kato Y. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36035-36038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Sun W. Kesavan K. Schaefer B.C. Garrington T.P. Ware M. Johnson N.L. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To determine whether WNK1 acts upstream or downstream of MEKK2/3 in the ERK5 pathway, we examined the effects of dominant negative mutants of MEKK2/3 on ERK5 activation by WNK1. MEKK3 K391M prevented ERK5 activation by WNK1 (Fig. 3A). Both ERK5 autophosphorylation and activity toward GST·MEF2C decreased to basal levels if the MEKK3 K391M mutant was coexpressed. Similar results were also observed for MEKK2 K385M (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, a kinase-dead form of a MAP3K not known to be involved in the ERK5 pathway, TAO2-(1–993) D169A, did not affect the activation of ERK5 by WNK1 (Fig. 3B). Likewise, kinase-dead mutants of the MAP4K PAK1 and the MAP3K MEKK1 also failed to block ERK5 activation by WNK1 (data not shown). These data suggest that WNK1 most likely acts upstream of MEKK2 and MEKK3 in the ERK5 pathway. Endogenous WNK1 Coimmunoprecipitates with MEKK2 and MEKK3—Because dominant negative mutants of MEKK2 and MEKK3 could block ERK5 activation by WNK1, we tested whether WNK1 and MEKK2/3 might exist in a complex in cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged WNK1-(1–491) and HA-tagged MEKK3. WNK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc, and the precipitates were blotted with anti-HA. HA-MEKK3 was readily detected in the precipitates from lysates containing both WNK1 and MEKK3, but not from those containing only MEKK3 (Fig. 4A). The converse also revealed an association: MEKK3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, and the precipitates were blotted with anti-Myc. Again, Myc-WNK1 was only detected in the precipitates from lysates containing both MEKK3 and WNK1 and not from those containing only WNK1 (Fig. 4B). To address the question of whether MEKK2 might also coimmunoprecipitate with WNK1-(1–491), HEK293 cells were transfected with either the vector or FLAG-tagged MEKK2/3 along with Myc-WNK1-(1–491). MEKK2/3 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and the precipitates were blotted with anti-Myc antibody to detect the presence of WNK1. MEKK2, like MEKK3, pulled down WNK1-(1–491) (Fig. 4C). The catalytic activities of MEKK2/3 were not required because the kinase-dead mutants also coimmunoprecipitated with WNK1 (Fig. 4C). Next we wanted to examine whether the endogenous WNK1 could coimmunoprecipitate with MEKK2/3. HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged MEKK2 or MEKK3. Endogenous WNK1 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with the Q256 antibody, and the precipitates were blotted with anti-FLAG. As a control, the preimmune serum of Q256 was also used for immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 4D, WNK1 immunoprecipitates contained significant amounts of MEKK2/3. Neither the preimmune serum nor a control antibody Y691 (anti-ERK1/2) pulled down comparable amounts of MEKK2. These results support the conclusion that MEKK2/3 and WNK1 are associated in cells. WNK1 Phosphorylates the N Terminus of MEKK2 and MEKK3 in Vitro—Because WNK1 lies upstream of MEKK2/3 and they can exist in a complex in cells, we reasoned that MEKK2 and MEKK3 might be direct substrates of WNK1. To test this possibility, we used FLAG-tagged MEKK2/3 (KM) proteins immunoprecipitated from 293 cells as in vitro substrates for His-WNK1-(198–491). As shown in Fig. 5A, both MEKK2 and MEKK3 were phosphorylated by WNK1. We also expressed GST fusion proteins of MEKK2 and MEKK3 in bacteria to test as WNK1 substrates. N-terminal and C-terminal (KM) fragments of the two MAP3Ks were expressed, and in both cases, the N-terminal fragment, but not the C-terminal fragment, was phosphorylated by recombinant WNK1 (Fig. 5B) and also by endogenous WNK1 immunoprecipitated from cells treated with NaCl (Fig. 5C). These results are consistent with the idea that WNK1 is a MAP4K in the ERK5 pathway. However, the phosphorylation of MEKK2/3 by WNK1 does not appear to directly alter their catalytic activities because preincubation of MEKK2/3 with WNK1 in the presence of ATP neither increased nor decreased their kinase activities (data not shown). Overexpression of WNK1 Activates Cotransfected MEKK3 in HEK293 Cells—To test whether WNK1 could affect the activity of MEKK3 in cells, we transfected 293 cells with either vector control or Myc-tagged WNK1-(1–491) along with FLAG-tagged MEKK3. MEKK3 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and assayed using His6-MEK6 K82M as the substrate. Overexpression of WNK1-(1–491) increased the autophosphorylation of MEKK3 as well as its activity toward His6-MEK6 K82M (Fig. 5D), showing that coexpression with WNK1 in cells stimulates MEKK3 activity. Interestingly, this activation is independent of the catalytic activity of WNK1, because a kinasedefective mutant of WNK1 also activated cotransfected MEKK3 to a similar extent (data not shown). WNK1 Is Required for Activation of ERK5 by EGF in HeLa Cells—We have presented evidence that overexpression of WNK1 is sufficient to activate the ERK5 MAPK pathway. However, whether WNK1 is required for ERK5 activation under any physiological circumstances is still unknown. Growth factors such as EGF and stress stimuli are well documented activators of ERK5. Therefore, we tested whether WNK1 is required for ERK5 activation by EGF using RNA interference to knock down expression of endogenous WNK1 in HeLa cells. ERK5 activation by many agents including EGF leads to a decrease in its electrophoretic motility on gels (Fig. 6A), providing a simple assessment of its activity. We successfully reduced expression of endogenous WNK1 as shown in Fig. 6B. ERK5 activation by 1 ng/ml EGF was partially reduced by suppression of WNK1 expression, suggesting that WNK1 is required for ERK5 activation by EGF under these circumstances. With higher concentrations of EGF, the requirement for WNK1 became less pronounced (data not shown). Since it was first cloned and characterized three years ago, the atypical protein kinase WNK1 has attracted considerable interest primarily because it has been linked to the regulation of blood pressure (3Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 8Wilson F.H.

Jeunemaitre X. Lifton R.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Although progress was made in the last 2 years in defining how WNK1 is regulated and in suggesting an effect of WNK1 on ion channels, the biochemical pathways regulated by WNK1 remain unknown. Here we provide evidence that WNK1 can activate the MAPK ERK5 through MEKK2/3. The following observations suggest that WNK1 is a MAP4K in the ERK5 pathway: 1) its activation of ERK5 can be blocked by kinase-dead mutants of MEKK2/3; 2) WNK1 interacts with MEKK2/3 in cells; 3) WNK1 phosphorylates MEKK2/3 in vitro; and 4) coexpression of WNK1 with MEKK3 activates it in cells. Nevertheless, in vitro experiments suggest that phosphorylation of MEKK2/3 by WNK1 apparently does not directly activate them. In cells, WNK1 activated MEKK3; however, WNK1 kinase activity was not required, because a kinase-dead mutant of WNK1 had the same stimulatory effect as the wild type protein. One possible explanation comes from the observation that WNK1 exists as a tetramer (9Xu B. Min X. Stippec S. Lee B.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48456-48462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The kinase-dead protein may interact with endogenous wild type WNK1, promoting activation of the MAP3Ks. Alternatively, protein-protein interactions could change the conformation of MEKK3 or its ability to form complexes. In contrast, activation of ERK5 by wild type WNK1 is greater than activation by kinase-dead WNK1. These apparently contradictory findings may be reconciled if WNK1 contributes two events toward ERK5 activation: stimulation of the MAP3K by a noncatalytic mechanism coupled with assembly of an ERK5 activation complex that requires phosphorylation of the MAP3K or some other component in the complex. If so, phosphorylation of MEKK2/3 by WNK1 may be important for transmitting the activation signal to ERK5 even though it is not required for activation of MEKK2/3. Interestingly, our data suggest a role for only one of two isoforms of MEK5 in activation of ERK5 by WNK1. MEK5α has an additional 89 residues at its N terminus compared with MEK5β due to alternative splicing, whereas MEK5β appears to be more widely expressed (16English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The inactive form of MEK5α was a very effective inhibitor, whereas the comparable mutant of MEK5β was not. A recent study has suggested that wild type MEK5β can act as a dominant negative to block ERK5 activation by EGF or by a constitutively active form of MEK5α (36Cameron S.J. Abe J.I. Malik S. Che W. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1506-1512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying this discrepancy are not known. Significantly, we have demonstrated that WNK1 is required for ERK5 activation by EGF. We also found a partial requirement for WNK1 in the activation of ERK5 by H2O2 (data not shown). In contrast, WNK1 was not required for activation of ERK5 by either sorbitol or NaCl (data not shown). Surprisingly, there is a poor correlation of the requirement for WNK1 in ERK5 activation by these agents and the sensitivity of WNK1 itself to be activated by them. NaCl and sorbitol are significantly stronger WNK1 activators than H2O2, and we have thus far failed to reveal activation of WNK1 by EGF. Thus, the potential involvement of WNK1 in a pathway may not be obvious based on changes in its kinase activity alone. These results indicate that WNK1 participates in ERK5 activation by a subset of physiological ERK5 regulators. There are four WNK homologs in mammals that share a high degree of identity within their kinase domains but significantly lower identity outside the kinase domains (4Verissimo F. Jordan P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5562-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 8Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodeme S. Choate K.A. Ishikawa K. Nelson-Williams C. Desitter I. Gunel M. Milford D.V. Lipkin G.W.

A recent study suggests that WNK1 and WNK4 might have opposite effects on channel regulation (12Yang C.L. Angell J. Mitchell R. Ellison D.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, it will be important to determine whether any of the other WNK family members also activate ERK5. Currently, we are testing WNK2 and WNK4 for their effects on the ERK5 pathway. In summary, we demonstrated in this study that WNK1 activates the ERK5 MAPK pathway through MEKK2/3. The identification of potential WNK1 substrates other than myelin basic protein provides a starting point to map biochemical pathways that WNK1 regulates. Future studies should shed more light on the important roles WNK1 plays in various cellular processes including ion transport.

This process is topologically equivalent to membrane invagination during multivesicular body formation and to the budding of enveloped viruses. Vacuoles are lysosomal compartments of yeasts. Vacuolar membrane invagination can be reconstituted in vitro with purified yeast vacuoles, serving as a model system for budding of vesicles into the lumen of an organelle. Using this in vitro system, we defined different reaction states. We identified inhibitors of microautophagy in vitro and used them as tools for kinetic analysis. This allowed us to characterize four biochemically distinguishable steps of the reaction. We propose that these correspond to sequential stages of vacuole invagination and vesicle scission. Formation of vacuolar invaginations was slow and temperature-dependent, whereas the final scission of the vesicle from a preformed invagination was fast and proceeded even on ice. Our observations suggest that the formation of invaginations rather than the scission of vesicles is the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction.

The lysosome is a major lytic compartment in eukaryotic cells (1Knop M. Schiffer H.H. Rupp S. Wolf D.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 990-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Substrates are delivered to its lumen by several pathways: via endocytosis, via direct transport across the lysosomal membrane, and via autophagy (2Dunn Jr., W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 3Khalfan W.A. Klionsky D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 4Noda T. Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 231-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Autophagy, defined as nonselective uptake and degradation of cytoplasm in the lysosome, can occur either as macro- or as microautophagy. In macroautophagy, nascent autophagosomes engulf parts of the cytoplasm and subsequently fuse with the lysosome. During microautophagy, vesicles bud into the lysosomal lumen by direct invagination of the boundary membrane, resulting in degradation of both cytoplasmic components and lysosomal membrane. Microautophagy can lead to the degradation of soluble components or to the selective uptake of entire organelles, as exemplified by peroxisome degradation (micropexophagy). In order to distinguish these two forms, which we presume to follow different mechanisms, we refer to the microautophagic uptake of soluble components as type I and to that of organelles as type II. Vacuoles are the lysosomal compartment of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Tubular invaginations leading to type I microautophagy have been observed both in living yeast cells and in isolated vacuoles (5Müller O. Sattler T. Flötenmeyer M. Schwarz H. Plattner H. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These membrane tubules are induced upon starvation. They are dynamic and often branched structures showing a sharp kink of the vacuolar membrane at the site of invagination. Since the lumen of the tubules is continuous with the cytoplasm, budding of vesicles from the tip of the tubules results in unilamellar autophagic bodies containing cytosol, destined for degradation by vacuolar hydrolases. Because of a lateral heterogeneity along the autophagic tubes, with a high density of transmembrane particles at the base and a smooth zone at the tip where budding occurs, the autophagic bodies reaching the vacuolar lumen are largely devoid of transmembrane particles. The process of type I vacuole invagination and vesicle formation can be reconstituted in vitro using purified yeast vacuoles (6Sattler T. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Solute uptake can be quantified using luciferase as a reporter enzyme. Luciferase uptake depends on ATP, salt concentration, temperature, and cytosol. Cytosolic extracts prepared from starved cells stimulate luciferase uptake by isolated vacuoles with an activity 2-fold higher than that of extracts from nonstarved cells. Cytosolic extracts from starved atg mutants support the in vitro reaction to a similar extent as extracts from nonstarved wild type cells. This observation suggests that Atg proteins may be involved in regulation of type I microautophagy but not in the uptake reaction itself. Microautophagy does not depend on known factors for vacuole fusion and vesicle trafficking, such as Sec17p/α-SNAP; Sec18p/NSF; or the SNAREs Vam3p, Vam7p, or Nyv1p. Scission of the invaginated membrane hence occurs via a mechanism distinct from homotypic vacuole fusion. Pioneering genetic screens have identified many genes required for macroautophagy (3Khalfan W.A. Klionsky D.J. Curr. Opin.

They have shed light on the mechanisms underlying these important protein degradation pathways. However, mutants selectively defective in microautophagy of soluble cytosolic components have not been identified so far. No method for the selective quantitation of type I microautophagy in living cells is available other than morphological observation of vacuolar membrane invaginations (5Müller O. Sattler T. Flötenmeyer M. Schwarz H. Plattner H. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Sattler T. Mayer A. J.

In order to further characterize microautophagic vesicle formation, we used a cell-free system that reconstitutes type I vacuole invagination, and we performed time course experiments to dissect the reaction into four steps. Chemicals—Nystatin, amphotericin, FCCP, and valinomycin were purchased from Sigma. Nocodazol, colchicine, rapamycin, K252a, and aristolochic acid were purchased from Alexis (Gruenberg, Germany). GTPγS 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; FCCP, carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PS, PIPES/sorbitol; GDPβS, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate. was purchased from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were analytical grade. Drugs were suspended as 50× or 100× stock solution in Me2SO and stored at –20 °C. Nystatin stock solutions were renewed after 1 week of storage. Yeast culture, cytosol preparation, and vacuole preparation were performed as described previously (6Sattler T. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For storage of vacuoles, protease inhibitors (0.2 mm pefabloc SC, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm o-phenanthroline, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) and glycerol (10% (w/v) from a 50% stock) were added to a fresh vacuole suspension. The suspension was frozen as little nuggets in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for a maximum of 3 weeks. In Vitro Microautophagy Assay—A standard reaction had a volume of 50 μl and was composed of vacuoles (0.2 mg/ml, strain DBY5734 (6Sattler T. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), either freshly prepared or thawed from a –80 °C stock), 3 mg/ml cytosol from starved K91–1A cells (6Sattler T. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), 105 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 80 mm disodium creatine phosphate, 175 units/ml creatine kinase, 17 μg/ml luciferase, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm pefabloc SC, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm o-phenanthrolin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 200 mm sorbitol, 10 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8. This mixture was incubated for 1 h at 27 °C. For measuring luciferase uptake, the samples were chilled on ice, diluted with 300 μl of 150 mm KCl in PS buffer (200 mm sorbitol, 10 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8), and centrifuged (6800 × g, 4 min, fixed angle table top centrifuge), and the pellet was washed once more with 150 mm KCl in PS buffer and resuspended in 50 μl 150 mm KCl in PS buffer. Proteinase K was added (0.3 mg/ml from 10× stock) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Digestion was stopped by adding 50 μl 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 mm KCl in PS buffer. Luciferase activity was determined using an assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany); 25 μl of sample were mixed with 25 μl of lysis buffer and 25 μl of substrate A (containing ATP). 25 μl of substrate B (1 mm luciferin) were added directly before counting light emission in a microplate luminometer (LB 96 V, Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined in a 25-μl aliquot as described previously (6Sattler T. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Uptake activity was calculated as the quotient of luciferase activity over alkaline phosphatase activity ((counts/s)/(ΔA405/min)) and referred to an uninhibited standard reaction (60 min, 27 °C), which was set to 100%. In some experiments, horseradish peroxidase (40 μg/ml) was used instead of luciferase. For activity determination, a 25-μl sample (vacuoles after washing and proteinase K digestion, in PS buffer plus 1% Triton X-100) was mixed in an opaque 96-well microtiter plate with 25 μl of substrate (5 mm luminol, 10 mm H2O2, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, freshly prepared) and 25 μl of cosubstrate (200 μm luciferin, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5). Luminescence was measured in a microplate luminometer (LB 96 V, Berthold Technologies), and background activity (vacuoles without horseradish peroxidase) was subtracted. Uptake activity was calculated as described above. Thin Section Electron Microscopy—Yeast cells were cryofixed using a propane jet freezing device (JFD 030, Bal-Tec, Balzers AG) and freeze-substituted in 0.5% uranyl acetate in ethanol at –90 °C for 35 h, at –60 °C for 4 h, and –50 °C for 2 h in a freeze-substitution unit (FSU 010; Bal-Tec, Balzers AG). After washing with ethanol at –35 °C, the samples were infiltrated with Lowicryl HM20 and UV-polymerized at –35 °C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate were viewed in a Philips CM 10 electron microscope. One of the most important approaches to explore complex biochemical processes is kinetic analysis. A dissection into distinguishable reaction phases can serve to ascribe the interactions of relevant components and their dynamic changes to defined steps of the overall process and greatly facilitates the formulation of hypotheses on the molecular mechanism. Therefore, the identification of intermediates has always been an important and fruitful part in the analysis of complex biochemical reactions. In order to better understand vacuolar membrane invagination we sought to identify distinct reaction stages for this process. Since proteins and lipids involved in vacuolar membrane invagination are not yet known, we attempted to generate tools for kinetic analysis by identifying low molecular weight inhibitors. Such pharmacological approaches (“chemical genetics”) have proven useful to dissect complex physiological phenomena (34Stockwell B.R. Nat. Rev. Gen. 2000; 1: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). If, as for vacuoles, sufficient quantities can be prepared, relevant target proteins for the inhibitors can even be identified by direct fractionation of the membrane on affinity matrices or by cross-linking approaches (35Peters C.

In a pilot study, we screened 46 commercially available low molecular weight substances for inhibitory activity in the previously described (6Sattler T. Mayer A. J.

Type I microautophagy in vitro is strongly stimulated by the addition of cytosol (6Sattler T. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In reactions lacking cytosol, uptake persisted, albeit only with 20% of the activity of the control samples. Under these conditions, none of the agents listed in Table I impaired uptake any more (Fig. 1b). Uptake in the absence of cytosol was still ATP-dependent, indicating that the signal measured had been generated by an energy-dependent process. Since the action of all inhibitors tested required cytosol, these substances might prevent binding of cytosolic factors to the vacuolar membrane. The absence of effects of microtubule-directed drugs such as nocodazole and colchicine is notable, since vacuoles are very large organelles and occupy up to a third of the total cell volume. Our favored hypothesis on vacuolar membrane invagination had been that long filaments, such as microtubules, might push toward the vacuolar lumen, deforming the vacuolar boundary membrane. This hypothesis appeared particularly attractive, since microtubules are very dynamic structures in yeast, growing and shrinking vigorously in the course of the cell cycle. Furthermore, they can be close to the vacuolar membrane (41Carminati J.L. Stearns T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Microtubule-destabilizing agents did not inhibit vacuole invagination in vitro (Fig. 2a), even at concentrations high enough to suppress growth of intact cells by disassembly of the spindle (42Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshinori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). 2A. Mayer, unpublished observation. This suggested that vacuolar membrane invagination can occur independently of microtubules. Electron microscopic analysis of starved yeast cells (Fig. 2b) supported this conclusion. Cytoplasmic microtubules in yeast are organized exclusively by the spindle pole body. They emanate directly from this structure and are generally very short (43Botstein D. Amberg D. Mulholland J. Huffaker T. Adams A. Drubin D. Stearns T. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1997: 1-90Google Scholar). If cytoplasmic microtubules initiated vacuolar invaginations, the spindle pole bodies should be close to the site of invagination. However, microautophagic membrane invaginations could be observed on parts of the vacuolar membrane not facing the nucleus and the spindle pole body. Hence, vacuolar invaginations can obviously develop without the aid of microtubules. Using the pharmacological inhibitors identified (Table I), we could now attempt a kinetic analysis of type I microautophagy. In order to test whether the inhibitors affected different stages of vacuolar invagination, a standard uptake reaction was started. Inhibitors were added at different time points (Fig. 3), and the reaction was continued until the end of a standard incubation period. Agents influencing very early steps of type I microautophagy would be ineffective if added late during the reaction, whereas agents acting on late events of microautophagy would be active throughout the reaction. As a control, samples were transferred to ice, a treatment that blocks many processes depending on membrane or protein dynamics (44Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 45Baker D. Schekman R. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Inhibitors could be grouped into two categories according to their kinetic properties. Inhibition curves of FCCP/valinomycin, rapamycin, and K252a developed almost in parallel to each other, crossing the ice curve at 35 min and keeping their inhibitory potential throughout the incubation (Fig. 3, a, c, and e). We designate these as late acting (class B) inhibitors. In contrast, the reaction had become largely resistant to class A inhibitors (GTPγS, nystatin, and aristolochic acid) after 30 min, resulting in a curve convex toward the top (Fig. 3, b, d, and f). The ice curve showed a very shallow slope during the first 30 min but a steep rise between 30 and 45 min, indicating that most of the luciferase uptake had taken place during this relatively short period of time. Inhibition by transfer on ice became ineffective late during the reaction because, after 45 min, class B inhibitors (FCCP/valinomycin, rapamycin, and K252a) still blocked further luciferase uptake efficiently, but transfer on ice did not. The kinetics shown thus define three reaction states: 1) GTPγS-, nystatin-, and aristolochic acid-sensitive; 2) cold-sensitive; 3) FCCP/valinomycin-, rapamycin-, and K252a-sensitive. In order to exclude the possibility that the inhibitors had damaged the vacuoles nonspecifically, we tested whether an inhibitory block could be reversed by removal of the inhibitor. Two-step reactions were performed. During a first 30-min incubation, inhibitors were present in a complete microautophagy reaction. The agents were then removed by sedimenting the vacuoles, discarding the supernatant, and resuspending the membranes in fresh medium. Aliquots of these samples were either set on ice or incubated at 27 °C in the presence or absence of an inhibitor. This second incubation was stopped after 60 min, and luciferase uptake was determined in all samples (Fig. 4). During the first incubation without inhibitor at 27 °C, only about 20% of the total signal was generated, consistent with the very shallow slope of the ice curve during this period of time (Fig. 3). All inhibitors were reversible by reisolating and washing the membranes, except nystatin (Fig. 4g). The yellow nystatin partitions into membranes (46Bolard J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 257-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and is retained by vacuoles even after reisolation, as evident from the intense staining of the organelles after nystatin treatment (not shown). Uptake was almost completely abolished if the same inhibitors as in the first incubation were added to the second stage (bar 2). This indicates that the membranes had not passed the initial block during reisolation and resuspension. Vacuoles lost about half of their uptake potential if the first incubation was performed either on ice or in the presence of inhibitor (Fig. 4, compare panel b and panels a and c–h) (i.e. under all conditions that prevented uptake). The reason for this effect is unclear. It is possible that the addition of ATP and cytosol renders accessory vacuolar components more labile and prone to inactivation if the reaction cannot proceed. Next, we tested whether there would be stable reaction intermediates. If such intermediates existed, the reaction step leading to these intermediates should be essentially irreversible. Then it should be possible to accumulate these intermediates in the presence of late acting (class B) in"

In this study, the molecular effects of NO on the toll-like receptor signaling pathway were determined using interleukin-12 (IL-12) as an immunologically relevant target gene. The principal conclusion of these experiments is that NO inhibits IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) activity and attenuates the molecular interaction between tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 and IRAK. As a consequence, the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-12 p40 mRNA expression, protein production, and promoter activity in murine macrophages, dendritic cells, and the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Splenocytes from inducible nitric-oxide synthase-deficient mice demonstrate markedly increased IL-12 p40 protein and mRNA expression compared with wild type splenocytes. The inhibitory action of NO on IL-12 p40 is independent of the cytokine IL-10. The effects of NO can be directly attributed to inhibition of NF-κB activation through IRAK-dependent pathways. Accordingly, SNAP strongly reduces LPS-induced NF-κB DNA binding to the p40 promoter and inhibits LPS-induced IκB phosphorylation. Similarly, NO attenuates IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation. These experiments provide another example of how an innate immune molecule may have a profound effect on adaptive immunity.

IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine, composed of a 35-kDa (p35) subunit and a 40-kDa (p40) subunit, and plays a central role in the induction of a Th1 immune response.

IL-12 p40 mRNA is exclusively detected in cells that produce bioactive p70 and is strongly induced by intracellular bacteria and bacterial products (1Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). For these reasons, studies of IL-12 transcriptional regulation have focused on the p40 gene. A cisacting element from -132 to -122 with respect to the transcription start site in the murine p40 promoter binds Rel family members and is important for the induction of promoter activity by bacterial products (8Murphy T.L.

Although expression of IL-12 p40 is a proximal event in the development of a Th1 immune response, the induction and, importantly, the inhibition of IL-12 gene expression are still not fully understood. Nitric oxide (NO) regulates a wide range of biological activities in the nervous, vascular, and immune systems (11Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nathan C.F. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 13Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). In activated macrophages, NO and its metabolites mediate a number of host defense functions that include anti-microbial and tumoricidal activity. Macrophages produce NO from l-arginine after activation of the inducible form of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS). iNOS has been identified in a wide variety of cell types, and its expression can be activated by many immune stimuli (14Bogdan C. Nat. Immun. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref Scopus (2559) Google Scholar). Due to its anti-microbial effects, NO is an important molecule of the innate immune system. Its role in regulating adaptive immune responses is less clear. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine whether NO may affect adaptive immune responses through a direct effect on IL-12 production by macrophages and dendritic cells. We demonstrate that NO suppresses IL-12 p40 protein production, mRNA expression, and promoter activity in murine macrophages and dendritic cells. Splenocytes derived from iNOS-deficient mice produce increased IL-12 p40 protein and mRNA compared with wild type mice of the same strain. Down-regulation of IL-12 by NO is independent of the effects of IL-10. NO inhibits TLR and IL-1 receptor-dependent signal transduction through inhibition of IRAK activity and consequent attenuation of the molecular interaction between TRAF6 and IRAK. Accordingly, NO inhibits NF-κB DNA binding to the p40 promoter. These experiments suggest a role for NO in the regulation of Th1-type immunity through inhibition of IRAK activity, NF-κB, and consequently IL-12. Plasmid Constructs—IL-12 p40 promoter fragments were inserted into the luciferase reporter vector pGL2B (Promega) as described previously (9Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T.

Cells Lines and Reagents—The human embryonic kidney 293T and the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell lines (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella enteriditis was purchased from Sigma. S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and NG-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate salt (NMMA) were obtained from Calbiochem. Antibodies against IκB, phospho-IκB, β-actin, MyD88, TRAF6, p38 MAP kinase, and HA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. An IRAK antibody that detects IRAK1 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. GM-CSF, IL-1β, and IFN-γ were purchased from PeproTech. Isolation of Bone Marrow-derived Dendritic Cells and Macrophages and Splenocytes—C57BL/6 and IL-10-deficient (C57BL/6 background) (The Jackson Laboratories), and iNOS-deficient (C57BL/6 background) (from Anthony Bauer) mice raised and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions were used to obtain splenocytes, macrophage, and dendritic cells at 7–10 weeks of age. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and macrophages were cultured from C57BL/6 mice as described previously (16Inaba K. Inaba M. Romani N. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Steinman R.M. J.

At day 0, BM cells were seeded at 2 × 106 per 100-mm dish in 10 ml of culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), l-glutamine, and 10% heated-inactivated fetal bovine serum) containing recombinant murine (rm) GM-CSF (20 ng/ml). At day 3, another 10 ml of culture medium containing rmGM-CSF (20 ng/ml) were added to the plates. At days 6 and 8, half of the culture supernatant was collected and centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of fresh culture medium containing rmGM-CSF. At day 10, cells were either used experimentally or cultured 4 more days to further reduce granulocyte contamination. At day 10, non-adherent cells were utilized to represent the dendritic cell population. For bone marrow-derived macrophage preparations, BM cells were incubated with rmGM-CSF (20 ng/ml) for 1 week, and adherent cells were collected. Spleens were harvested and minced between two glass slides. Spleen cells were passed through a 40-μm nylon cell strainer into a 50-ml conical tube and spun at 1500 rpm for 5 min. RBCs were lysed by using 0.8% ammonium chloride. The cell pellet was washed twice. Spleen cells were seeded in 96-well plates, and the supernatants were used for assessing cytokine secretion. RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). Nitrite Determination—Nitrite concentration in culture, a measurement of NO synthesis, was assayed by a standard Griess reaction adapted to microplates, as described previously (36Xiong H. Kawamura I. Nishibori T. Mitsuyama M. Cell Immunol. 1996; 172: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Griess reagent was prepared by mixing equal volumes of sulfanilamide (1.5% in 5% H3PO4) and naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.1% in H2O). A volume of 100 μl of reagent was mixed with 100 μl of supernatant and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Absorbance of the chromophore formed was measured at 540 nm in an automated microplate reader. Nitrite was quantitated using NaNO2 as a standard, and results were expressed as μm nitrite. Transfection—RAW 267.4 cells were transiently transfected using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen) by the described protocol with modifications. For each transfection, 2.5 μg of plasmid was mixed with 100 μl of DMEM (without serum and antibiotics) and 10 μl of Superfect. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then 600 μl of DMEM complete medium was added and immediately placed onto cells in 6-well plates. After incubation for 3–4 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and split equally into 2 wells. One well was activated with LPS (5 μg/ml) 24 h later. Twelve to eighteen hours after activation, cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). For luciferase activity analysis, 20 μl of cell extract was used. Cells were co-transfected with a constitutively active HSP promoter-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid to normalize each experiment for transfection efficiency, as described previously (9Plevy S.E.

EMSA probes were made by annealing equal amounts of single-stranded oligonucleotides with 5′-GATC overhangs (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc). 200 ng of annealed probe was labeled with [α-32P]dGTP and [α-32P]dCTP by Klenow enzyme. Labeled probes were purified with Nuctrap purification columns (Roche Applied Science). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (18Zhu C. Gagnidze K. Gemberling J.H. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18519-18528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), using 105 cpm probe and 5 μg of nuclear extracts per reaction. Supershift experiments were performed as described previously (9Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) by using 2 μl of antibodies to c-Rel, NF-κB p50, and NF-κB p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA-binding complexes were separated by 5% polyacrylamide/Tris glycine/EDTA gel run at 4 °C for 4 h at 150 V. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-AR 5 film at -80 °C in the presence of an intensifying screen. IL-12 ELISA—Macrophages, dendritic cells, and splenocytes were activated with LPS (5 μg/ml) plus IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. IL-12 p40 protein in supernatants was measured by an IL-12 ELISA system (R & D Systems). Western Immunoblots—Protein extracts and pre-stained molecular weight markers were denatured in Laemmli’s buffer (10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 65 mm Tris) at 90 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After protein transfer, membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST (Triton-containing Tris-buffered saline). The membranes were then incubated with anti-HA, anti-MyD88, anti-IRAK, or anti-TRAF6 (1:2000) antibodies for 1–2 h. After extensive washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit/anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (1:1000) diluted with blocking solution. Immunoreactivity was then visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL kit, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Co-immunoprecipitation—RAW 264.7 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 15 min on ice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 280 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors. Cells lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. Lysates were incubated with 2 μg of MyD88 or TRAF6 antibodies in the presence of 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G-agarose overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After three washings with lysis buffer, precipitated complexes were solubilized by boiling in SDS buffer, fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western immunoblotting was performed using HA, IRAK, MyD88, and TRAF6 antibodies. RNase Protection Assay—Twenty μg of total RNA from primary cells or RAW 264.7 cells were analyzed by multiprobe RNase protection assay using the cytokine template set mCK-2b (Pharmingen). Riboprobes were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase and hybridized with RNA at 56 °C for 16 h. The samples were digested with RNase, purified by phenol-chloroform, and resolved by 6% denaturing PAGE. Real Time RT-PCR—Fluorophore-labeled LUX primers (19Nazarenko I. Lowe B. Darfler M. Ikonomi P. Schuster D. Rashtchian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30 (e37): 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and their unlabeled counterparts were purchased from Invitrogen. LUX primers were designed utilizing a software program (LUX Designer) (www.invitrogen.com/lux). LUX primers were designed to produce amplicons ranging in size between 69 and 145 bp. Primer pairs for IL-12 p40 and GAPDH were selected to span an intron. The primer sequences for IL-12 p40 are LUX, 5′-GAACTTGTCAAAGGCTTCATCTGCAAGTTC, and its unlabeled counterpart, 5′-GGAAGCACGGCAGCAGA-ATA, and for GAPDH are LUX, 5′-GACATACAGGCCGGTGCTGAGTATGTC and its unlabeled counterpart, 5′-GCGGAGATGATGACCCGTTT. Total RNA (1 μg) isolated from spleen cells was reverse-transcribed (20-μl reactions), and cDNA was used for fluorogenic primer PCR. Plots of fluorescence versus PCR cycle were generated by the ABI PRISM 7700 SDS software. The cycle thresholds (CT), the cycle where the fluorescence rises above background (10 times the standard deviation of the background fluorescence), were between 15 and 35 cycles. Each 25-μl PCR mix contained 4 μl of cDNA, 1 μl of each gene-specific primer, and 12.5 μl of 2× Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) (containing 60 units/ml Platinum TaqDNA polymerase, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 100 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 400 μm dGTP, 400 μm dATP, 400 μm dCTP, 800 μm dUTP, 40 units/ml uracil DNA-glycolase, and stabilizers), 1 μl of 1× ROX reference dye, and 5.5 μl diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 2 min, and then cycled (45 times) at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Reactions were conducted in a 96-well spectrofluorometric thermal cycler (ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector System, Applied Biosystems). Fluorescence was monitored during every PCR cycle at the annealing or extension step and during the post-PCR temperature ramp. Quantification of IL-12 p40 mRNA was performed as a relative fold increase in transcript level with respect to unstimulated cells (3Gubler U. Chua A.O. Schoenhaut D.S. Dwyer C.M. McComas W. Motyka R. Nabavi N. Wolitzky A.G. Quinn P.M. Familletti P.C. Gately M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4143-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In this method, the amount of target is calculated based on the difference (ΔΔCT) between the average CT of each time point and the average CT of the unstimulated cells. Before subtraction, both CT values are normalized by subtracting the average CT of the endogenous reference gene, GAPDH, from each. The CT values for each set of replicates lay within 2 CTs of one another. In Vitro Kinase Assays—RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with SNAP (0.5 mm) for 2 h and activated with LPS for 10, 30, and 60 min. Cell lysates were prepared as described above. Endogenous p38 MAP kinase or IRAK were immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total cell extract using p38 or IRAK antibodies, respectively. After washing, immunoprecipitated p38 or IRAK were incubated in kinase buffer containing myelin basic protein (MBP) (p38 and IRAK) with [γ-32P]ATP for 45 min. Supernatants were added to SDS-loading buffer, boiled, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Once completed, gels were processed and membranes exposed to Kodak AR5 film at -80 °C in the presence of intensifying screen. NO Inhibits IL-12 mRNA Expression and Protein Release in Primary Murine Macrophages, Dendritic Cells, and a Macrophage Cell Line—To determine whether NO affects IL-12 expression, murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, bone marrow-derived macrophages, and the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 were pretreated with the NO donor SNAP. Additionally, the NO inhibitor NMMA was used in these experiments. Cells were subsequently activated with IFN-γ plus LPS for 4 (mRNA expression) or 24 h (protein determination). RNase protection assay was performed for the detection of IL-12 mRNA expression, whereas supernatants were collected for IL-12 p40 protein release (ELISA). SNAP inhibits both IL-12 p40 and p35 mRNA expression in primary murine macrophages and dendritic cells (Fig. 1A, upper and middle panel, respectively). In RAW 264.7 cells, SNAP inhibits IL-12 p40 mRNA expression (Fig. 1A, lower panel). IL-12 p35 mRNA is barely detectable in activated RAW 264.7 cells, so effects of NO are difficult to assess (data not shown). Furthermore, SNAP inhibits IL-12 p40 protein release from bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 1B) and dendritic cells (Fig. 1C), as well as RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). To study the effects of endogenous NO on IL-12, splenocytes were obtained from iNOS-deficient mice and IL-12 p40 protein and mRNA expression compared with splenocytes obtained from wild type mice of the same strain. Cells were activated with LPS and/or IFN-γ for 4 (mRNA expression) or 24 h (protein determination). In this experiment, IL-12 p40 mRNA accumulation was assayed by real time RT-PCR. Consistent with a previous study (20Huang F.P. Niedbala W. Wei X.Q. Xu D. Feng G.J. Robinson J.H. Lam C. Liew F.Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 4062-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), compared with wild type cells (Fig. 2A), iNOS-deficient cells demonstrate enhanced IL-12 p40 protein production particularly following activation with IFN-γ plus LPS. LPS and IFN-γ plus LPS IL-12 p40 mRNA expression were also markedly enhanced in iNOS-deficient splenocytes (Fig. 2B). Measurements of nitrite accumulation in supernatants confirm that activated iNOS-deficient splenocytes produce undetectable levels of endogenous NO (data not shown). This result suggests that endogenously produced NO may suppress LPS- and IFN-γ plus LPS-induced IL-12 p40 mRNA expression and protein release. Down-regulation of IL-12 Expression by NO Is Independent of IL-10 —IL-10 is a potent inhibitor of IL-12 gene expression and protein production (21Aste-Amezaga M. Ma X. Sartori A. Trinchieri G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5936-5944PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that down-regulation of IL-12 expression by NO is mediated through induction of IL-10. To address this question, bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from IL-10-deficient mice. SNAP significantly attenuates IL-12 protein release from IL-10-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3), suggesting that this inhibition is independent of IL-10. Furthermore, in IFN-γ plus LPS-activated wild type murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, SNAP inhibits IL-10 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner, although there are no significant changes in other cytokine mRNA levels (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-18; data not shown). Therefore, down-regulation of LPS-induced IL-12 p40 expression by NO occurs independently of IL-10 production. NO Inhibits LPS-induced IL-12 p40 Promoter Activity—To study molecular mechanisms for inhibition of IL-12 p40 gene expression by NO, IL-12 p40 promoter activity was determined in RAW 264.7 cells. RAW 264.7 cells transfected with an IL-12 p40 promoter construct (-355 to +55, with respect to the transcription start site) or a deleted promoter construct that lacks the previously characterized NF-κB site (8Murphy T.L. Cleveland M.G. Kulesza P. Magram J. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (-101 to +55) were pretreated with SNAP or NMMA for 2 h prior to LPS activation. SNAP inhibits LPS-induced IL-12 p40 promoter activity using reporter plasmids that both contain (-355 to +55) and lack the NF-κB site (-101 to +55). Therefore, SNAP inhibits IL-12 p40 promoter activity (Fig. 4) and may act through mechanisms that both involve and are independent of NF-κB. NO Inhibits NF-κB DNA Binding Activity—A critical cisacting element from -132 to -122 with respect to the transcription start site in the murine p40 promoter binds Rel family members and is important for the induction of promoter activity by bacterial products (8Murphy T.L. Cleveland M.G. Kulesza P. Magram J. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell.

A. 2000; 97: 12705-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Therefore, whether NO inhibits DNA binding of NF-κB to this site on the IL-12 p40 promoter was addressed. EMSAs were performed using oligonucleotide probes specific for the NF-κB element in the IL-12 p40 promoter. Using nuclear extracts from RAW 264.7 cells, SNAP reduces LPS-induced NF-κB DNA binding (Fig. 5A) in a dose-dependent manner. As a control, NO was demonstrated to have no effect on AP-1 DNA binding to the p40 promoter (data not shown). As described previously (9Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), the NF-κB family members c-Rel, p50, and p65 bind to the IL-12 p40 promoter (Fig. 5B). NO inhibits the lower EMSA complex, composed mainly of p50, as well as the upper complex that includes c-Rel and p65, suggesting that DNA binding of multiple NF-κB family members is attenuated (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that NF-κB is a key transcription factor target mediating NO inhibition of IL-12 p40 promoter activity and gene expression. NO Inhibits NF-κB Reporter Activity and IκB Phosphorylation—The toll-like receptor (TLR) family of pattern recognition receptors mediates inflammatory gene expression in macrophages and dendritic cells in response to a wide range of microbial determinants including LPS (22Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). NF-κB is the best described transcription factor target of the TLR signaling pathway. As NO abrogates LPS-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity, it may directly inhibit the TLR signal transduction pathway. A multimerized NF-κB DNA-binding element luciferase-reporter was transfected into RAW 264.7 cells. In cells pretreated with SNAP prior to activation with LPS, NF-κB reporter activity is strongly reduced (Fig. 6A). To confirm that the TLR signal transduction pathway is modulated by NO, IL-1-mediated signal transduction, which shares common downstream targets including NF-κB, was next studied. An NF-κB luciferase reporter was transfected into the human embryonal kidney 293T cell line, and the cells were activated with IL-1β in the presence of SNAP or NMMA. SNAP dose-dependently inhibits NF-κB reporter activity induced by IL-1β (Fig. 6B). Next, TLR2 was expressed in 293T cells, as described previously (15Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R.

Because this infiltration seems to play a key role in the subsequent mesangial matrix expansion, we tested the response of cultures of rat mesangial cells (RMCs) for monocyte adhesion in response to hyperglycemia. Increasing the medium glucose concentration from 5.6 mm (normal) to 25.6 mm (hyperglycemic) significantly increased hyaluronan in the cell matrix, with a concurrent 3- to 4-fold increase in adhesion of U937 monocytic leukemic cells to cultures of near confluent RMCs. These responses were attributed directly to the high glucose concentration and not to increased extracellular osmolality. The monocytes primarily bind directly to hyaluronan-based structures in vitro. Abnormal deposits of hyaluronan were found in glomeruli of kidney sections from diabetic rats 1 week after streptozotocin treatment, often with closely associated monocytes/macrophages, suggesting that similar structures are relevant in vivo. The monocyte adhesion response to high glucose concentration required growth stimulation of RMCs by serum and activation of protein kinase C, and was inhibited by prior passage of the RMCs in the presence of heparin. These results suggest that the response may be cell growth state and protein kinase C-dependent. When incubated with the viral mimetic, poly I:C, in the presence of normal glucose, heparin-passaged RMCs still increased cell-associated hyaluronan and exhibited hyaluronan-mediated adhesion of monocytes, indicating that the two stimuli, high glucose and viral mimetic, induce the production of the hyaluronan structures that promote monocyte adhesion by distinctly different intracellular signaling mechanisms.

Transplant. 2001; 16: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying glomerular infiltration by monocytes and macrophages are still unclear. The interaction of monocytes with mesangial cells in culture has been studied previously using U937 cells, a monocytic leukemic cell line that is a widely accepted model for monocyte adhesion (7Mené P. Caenazzo C. Pugliese F. Cinotti G.A. D’Angelo A. Garbisa S. Gambaro G. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2001; 16: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 8Mené P. Pugliese F. Cinotti G.A. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 417-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and mesangial cell cultures incubated in media with high glucose concentrations bind more U937 cells (7Mené P. Caenazzo C. Pugliese F. Cinotti G.A. D’Angelo A. Garbisa S. Gambaro G. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2001; 16: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Generally, the interactions between monocytes and resident cells involve: (i) monocyte cell surface proteins, including CD44, β-2 leukocyte integrins (LFA-1, CR3, and p150/95), the β-1 integrin VLA-4, and l-selectin, and (ii) their ligands, such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, on resident cells (9Mené P.

Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 1626-1640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that monocytes preferentially bind, by means of a mechanism that involves CD44, to hyaluronan cable-like structures synthesized by smooth muscle cells isolated from human intestinal mucosa, after they have been treated with a virus or with the viral mimetic, poly I:C (a synthetic double-stranded RNA) (11de la Motte C.A.

Drazba J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Strong S.A. Am. J. Path. 2003; 163: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This indicates that structures based on hyaluronan can mediate the adhesion of monocytes to resident cells. Previous studies have shown increased hyaluronan content in glomeruli isolated from diabetic animals (13Dunlop M.E. Clark S. Mahadevan P. Muggli E. Larkins R.G. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 40-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and in mesangial cells cultured in medium with a high glucose concentration (14Mahadevan P. Larkins R.G. Fraser J.R. Fosang A.J. Dunlop M.E. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Exposure to high glucose concentrations also increases hyaluronan synthesis in renal proximal tubular cells (15Jones S. Jones S. Phillips A.O. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 1739-1749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), in renal interstitial fibroblasts (16Takeda M. Babazono T. Nitta K. Iwamoto Y. Metabolism. 2001; 50: 789-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and in vascular smooth muscle cells (17Erikstrup C. Pedersen L.M. Heickendorff L. Ledet T. Rasmussen L.M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 145: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), all of which are involved in normal kidney physiology. Experiments described in this report indicate that: (i) cultures of rat mesangial cells (RMCs) exposed to high glucose concentrations can produce hyaluronan structures that promote monocyte adhesion; (ii) this process depends on the growth state and protein kinase C (PKC) activation of the RMCs; (iii) hyaluronan deposits, often with closely associated monocytes/macrophages, are apparent in 1-week diabetic rat glomeruli; and (iv) RMCs passaged in the presence of heparin lose their ability to produce the adhesive hyaluronan structures in response to high glucose concentrations but continue to do so when incubated with the viral mimetic, poly I:C, in medium with normal glucose concentration. These results support the hypothesis that hyaluronan structures in the mesangial ECM, produced in response to hyperglycemia, bind to specific receptors on the monocyte surface, thereby promoting monocyte and macrophage adhesion to mesangial matrix in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy. Establishment of RMC Cultures and Induction of Diabetes in Rats— RMC cultures were established from isolated glomeruli and characterized as described previously (18Simonson M.S. Dunn M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Templeton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21764-21770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RMCs were used between passages 5 and 15 when they still contract in response to angiotensin II and endothelin, and they exhibit growth suppression in the presence of heparin (1 μg/ml), which are additional characteristics of mesangial cells (20Hegele R.G. Behar M. Katz A. Silverman M. Clin. Invest. Med. 1989; 12: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mené P. Simonson M.S. Dunn M.J. Physiol.

RMCs were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and passaged at confluence by trypsinization for 5 min with a solution of 0.025% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA. To render cells quiescent (22Wang A. Fan M.Y. Templeton D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), cultures at ∼40% confluence (∼2 × 104 cells/cm2) were washed with RPMI 1640 medium and placed in fresh medium containing 0.4% FBS for 48–72 h (yielding 70–80% confluent cultures). To prepare the heparin-pretreated cells, the RMCs were cultured for three or five passages in the presence of 10 μg/ml heparin (23Templeton D.M. Zhao Y. Fan M.Y. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). U937 cells were cultured in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS and passaged at a 1:5 ratio (∼2 × 105 cells/ml) every 48 h (11de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Yen-Lieberman B.

Diabetes was induced in ∼175-g male Sprague-Dawley rats using tail vein injections of 55 mg/kg streptozotocin (5Young B.A. Johnson R.J. Alpers C.E. Eng E. Gordon K. Floege J. Couser W.G. Seidel K.

All animals were fed standard laboratory diet. Blood was collected by tail-bleeding at day 3 after injection, and the blood glucose concentration was determined by using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) analyses to confirm the onset of diabetes. After 1 week, the kidneys were collected from both control and diabetic rats and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight for subsequent processing and sectioning for histological analyses (Histology Core Facility, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cleveland Clinic Foundation). Immunohistochemistry—Thin sections of paraffin-embedded kidneys and methanol-fixed RMC cultures on coverslips were stained for hyaluronan with a hyaluronan-binding protein (HABP) (Seikagaku America), for nuclei with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and in the sections, for monocytes/macrophages with anti-rat ED1 antibody, as described previously (5Young B.A. Johnson R.J.

After washing gently three times with cold medium, U937 monocytes (1 ml, 5 × 106 cells/ml) were added to the cultures and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The cultures were then washed by placing 1 ml of cold medium gently onto the cultures, followed by rocking 3–5 times and aspirating from the side. The adhesion was done at 4 °C as previously described in detail (27DiCorleto P.E. de la Motte C.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 75: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The low temperature is necessary to prevent further metabolic responses of the monocytes. This method is routinely used for leukocyte adhesion assays. After washing, the cell cultures were imaged by microscopy with a Polaroid digital camera (7Mené P. Caenazzo C. Pugliese F. Cinotti G.A. D’Angelo A. Garbisa S. Gambaro G. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2001; 16: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and the numbers of monocytes per culture were counted using Metamorph software. Each culture was equally divided into four regions, and a culture area for imaging was randomly picked in each region. Bovine testicular hyaluronidase treatments (15 min, 37 °C at 200 units/ml) of RMCs before monocyte incubation were used to determine the extent of the hyaluronan-mediated adhesion.

Hyaluronidase and Chondroitinase ABC Digestion—Samples were incubated with streptococcal hyaluronidase (50 milliunit/ml) and chondroitinase ABC at 2 units/ml in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, overnight at 37 °C to generate disaccharides from hyaluronan and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate. The reaction was terminated by heating the samples at >95 °C for 3–5 min. FACE Analysis of Reducing Saccharides—Sample digests were dried by centrifugal evaporation in microtubes and then subjected to reductive amination with 2-aminoacridone as described previously (28Calabro A.

Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, the samples were each mixed with glycerol to 20%; 5-μl aliquots were then subjected to electrophoresis on Mono-Composition gels with Mono Running buffer (Glyko). Running conditions were 500 V at 4 °C in a cold room for 1 h. Gels were imaged on an Ultra Lum transilluminator (365 nm). Images were captured and analyzed by using a Quantix cooled charge-coupled device camera from Roper Scientific/Photometrics and the Gel-Pro Analyzer program version 3.0 (Media Cybernetics), respectively. Glucose-induced Hyaluronan Synthesis in RMCs—When pre-confluent RMC cultures were incubated in 0.4% serum for 48 h, ∼75% of the starved cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase, as shown previously by using flow cytometry, and ∼72% subsequently progress to S-phase by 18 h after serum stimulation (31Wang A. Templeton D.M. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 437-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, after 48 h of serum-starvation, quiescent RMCs re-enter the cell cycle with good synchrony upon stimulation. Triplicate cultures of quiescent, near-confluent, and serum-starved RMC cultures were incubated for 72 h with 10% FBS in the presence of different concentrations of glucose, or in 5.6 mm glucose with 20 mm mannitol as an osmotic control. The hyaluronan contents of the cell layers were assessed by FACE analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Quantitation of the hyaluronan disaccharide in FACE gels such as that shown in Fig. 1 indicates that glucose treatment causes a statistically significant increase in hyaluronan content in the cell layers for the 20.6 and 25.6 mm glucose cultures and a trend for an increase between 5.6 and 15.6 mm glucose cultures. Further, the synthesized hyaluronan induced by high (25.6 mm) glucose was formed into large cable-like structures in RMC cell layers (Fig. 2, C and D), reminiscent of the hyaluronan structures observed previously that mediate monocyte adhesion to poly I:C-treated smooth muscle cell cultures (11de la Motte C.A.

These structures were not present in RMC cultures incubated in normal glucose with or without mannitol as an osmotic control (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2Confocal microscopic analysis of hyaluronan structures in RMC cultures.

Mannitol (20 mm) with 5.6 mm glucose was used as an osmotic control (B). Hyaluronan was stained with HABP (green), and nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). There are large hyaluronan structures in the cultures treated with high glucose (panels A–C, ×40; panel D, ×63).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of Glucose Concentration on Monocyte Adhesion to Rat Mesangial Cells—In the experiment in Fig. 3, near-confluent and serum-starved RMC cultures were incubated for 72 h in medium with 10% FBS and normal (5.6 mm) or high (25.6 mm) glucose concentration or in 5.6 mm glucose with 20 mm mannitol. Monocyte adhesion was then assayed using the U937 monocytic leukemia cell line, as described previously (11de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Yen-Lieberman B. Strong S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30747-30755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Monocyte adhesion to RMCs incubated with 25.6 mm glucose (Fig. 3B) was dramatically increased compared with RMCs treated with 5.6 mm glucose (Fig. 3A) or with 20 mm mannitol in 5.6 mm glucose as an osmotic control (Fig. 3C). The presence of serum is also necessary as RMCs cultured in high glucose with limiting serum (0.5%) showed monocyte adhesion similar to the 5.6 mm glucose cultures (data not shown). The role of hyaluronan in the adhesion process was underscored by treatment of RMCs incubated with high glucose with testicular hyaluronidase before assessing monocyte adhesion (Fig. 3D), in which case monocyte adhesion was greatly diminished. At a higher magnification (Fig. 4A, arrow), the adhesive monocytes in the RMCs incubated with high glucose were often arrayed in bead-like strands that appear similar to the patterns observed for monocyte adhesion to hyaluronan cable structures synthesized by colon smooth muscle cells in response to viral stimuli (11de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Yen-Lieberman B. Strong S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30747-30755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C.

Confocal microscopic analysis of high glucose-treated cultures stained for hyaluronan (green) and nuclei (blue) (Fig. 4, B and C) show these configurations more clearly. In each case, the monocyte nuclei (Fig. 4, arrowheads) are closely arrayed to hyaluronan adhesive structures. In separate experiments, we have shown that glomeruli isolated from diabetic rats 1 week after treatment with streptozotocin have 2–3 times as much hyaluronan as glomeruli from control rats using the FACE procedures. 2M. Lauer, V. C. Hascall, A. Wang, unpublished data. This result would be coincident with the influx of monocytes/macrophages into the diabetic glomeruli (5Young B.A. Johnson R.J. Alpers C.E. Eng E. Gordon K. Floege J. Couser W.G. Seidel K. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 935-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows kidney tissue sections from both 1-week control and diabetic rats stained for hyaluronan (green) and monocytes/macrophages (red). They clearly demonstrate an abnormal accumulation of hyaluronan in the glomeruli of diabetic rats (compare Fig. 4D with E and F), with glomerular infiltrated monocytes/macrophages often embedded in this hyaluronan-enriched matrix (Fig. 4F, arrowheads). These results suggest that a causal link exists between glomerular hyaluronan accumulation and monocyte/macrophage infiltration, and that the hyaluronan structures may mediate monocyte adhesion and activation in diabetic nephropathy. Quantitation of Monocyte Adhesion—Triplicate serum-starved, near-confluent RMC cultures were incubated for 72 h with different concentrations of glucose (5.6–25.6 mm) in 10% FBS and then assessed for monocyte adhesion. The numbers of monocytes per unit area were then determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 5). Monocyte adhesion increased with exposure to increasing amounts of glucose, with statistical significance at concentrations of 15.6 mm and above. At 25.6 mm, there were more than 3 times as many adherent monocytes as observed with 5.6 mm glucose, and ∼75% of the difference was lost when RMC cultures exposed to 25.6 mm glucose were pretreated with hyaluronidase. Further, there is a correlation between increased hyaluronan content and increased adhesion of monocytes. The mannitol osmolarity control showed no difference from the normal (5.6 mm) glucose cultures. Further, pretreatment of RMC cultures exposed to normal (5.6 mm) glucose with hyaluronidase did not significantly alter the number of adherent monocytes (data not shown). Interestingly, the amount of hyaluronan in the cell layer of the RMC culture exposed to normal (5.6 mm) glucose was about half that of the 20.6 and 25.6 mm glucose cultures (Fig. 1), yet hyaluronan-mediated adhesion in the 5.6 mm glucose cultures was negligible. Thus, monocytes adhering to RMC cultures treated with normal glucose concentration did so by a mechanism independent of hyaluronan, possibly by means of a VCAM-1/VLA-4 mechanism (11de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Yen-Lieberman B. Strong S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30747-30755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The hyaluronan-based monocyte adhesion response described above occurs when quiescent preconfluent RMCs are stimulated to enter a mitotic cycle by replenishing serum, but in the presence of a high glucose concentration. In contrast, when confluent RMC cultures were treated identically, the number of adherent monocytes in cultures treated with 25.6 mm glucose did not increase significantly beyond the number adhering to preconfluent cultures in response to 5.6 mm glucose (Fig. 5C). This result suggests that the response is likely to be cell growth state dependent. Effects of Heparin on Glucose-induced Monocyte Adhesion to RMCs—Diabetic nephropathy in animal models is ameliorated when the animals are treated with heparin or heparan sulfate in vivo (32Gambaro G. Cavazzana A.O. Luzi P. Piccoli A. Borsatti A. Crepaldi G. Marchi E. Venturini A.P. Baggio B. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 33Gambaro G.

Therefore, two different isolates of RMCs were passaged either 3 or 5 times in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml heparin. Near-confluent RMC cultures were then prepared and exposed to 25.6 mm glucose in the presence of 10% serum and in the absence of heparin. In both isolates, RMCs passaged without heparin showed increased hyaluronan and adhesion of monocytes in response to high glucose treatment (Figs. 6 and 7, CON), as described above (Figs. 3 and 5). Conversely, RMCs passaged in the presence of heparin no longer responded to the high glucose treatment, neither in increased hyaluronan production in the cell layer nor in increased monocyte adhesion (Figs. 6 and 7). However, these heparin-passaged RMCs still increased cell-associated hyaluronan and exhibited hyaluronan-mediated monocyte adhesion when incubated with the viral mimetic, poly I:C, in the presence of normal (5.6 mm) glucose (Figs. 6 and 7). RMCs passaged without heparin also produced hyaluronan and promoted monocyte adhesion when exposed to poly I:C in the same conditions (data not shown). These results indicate that: (i) RMCs undergo phenotypic changes that make them unresponsive to high glucose when passaged in the presence of heparin; and (ii) there are two completely different mechanisms (high glucose and viral stimulus) for inducing the production of the hyaluronan structures that promote monocyte adhesion.Fig. 7Analysis of monocyte adhesion to heparin-pretreated mesangial cells. A and B, RMCs were cultured for three (data shown) or five (data not shown) passages in the presence of 10 μg/ml heparin and then plated in the absence of heparin and in the presence of normal (5.6 mm, A) or high (25.6 mm, B) glucose for the monocyte adhesion assay. C, in some cultures in 5.6 mm glucose, ∼15 μg/ml of poly I:C was added in the last 24 h of incubation. The heparin pre-treatment inhibited high glucose-induced monocyte adhesion (B) but did not affect the poly I:C-induced monocyte adhesion in normal glucose concentration (C). The cell cultures were imaged by microscopy with a Polaroid digital camera, and the numbers of monocytes per culture area were counted using Metamorph software (D). RMC control cultures passaged without heparin (CON) still responded to the high glucose.

A possible function for the transmembrane regions in integrin signaling has been proposed from structural and computational data. We have analyzed the capacity of the integrin α2, αIIb, α4, β1, β3, and β7 transmembrane domains to form homodimers and/or heterodimers. Our data suggest that the integrin transmembrane helices can help to stabilize heterodimeric integrins but that the interactions do not specifically associate particular pairs of α and β subunits; rather, the α/β subunit interaction constrains the extramembranous domains, facilitating signal transduction by a promiscuous transmembrane helix-helix association.

Integrins are eukaryotic cell surface receptors consisting of heterodimers of α and β subunits. Each subunit contains a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane (TM) 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; WT, wild type. -spanning helix, and a small cytoplasmic domain (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Carman C.V.

In humans, eight different α chains interact with at least 16 different β subunits to form no fewer than 22 different α/β heterodimers with different functions (4Hemler M. Kreis T. Vale R. Extracellular Matrix, Anchor, and Adhesion Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999: 196-212Google Scholar). By spanning the membrane, the α/β heterodimeric integrins form a dynamic linkage between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space, transducing signals across the cell membrane to mediate cell growth, differentiation, gene expression, motility, and apoptosis (5Watt F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3919-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Some of the functions are not fulfilled by the heterodimeric integrins alone but by larger complexes formed on the cell membrane by the interaction of integrins with other membrane-anchored receptors (6Porter J.C. Hogg N. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 390-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Inside-out signal transduction via integrins, in which cytoplasmic events are communicated to the outside, is believed to be mediated by a rearrangement of the α and β subunits relative to each other and by separation of the cytoplasmic integrin domains (1Carman C.V.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14461-14474Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which alters the affinity of the integrins for extracellular ligands.The high-resolution structure of the soluble extracellular domain of the αV/β3 integrin reveals that its 12 domains are assembled in one “head” and two “tail” regions (9Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Although the structure shows an extensive interface region of the two domains within the head region, the two tails were shown to be associated as a single stalk in the membrane proximal region. A three-dimensional model of the human αIIb/β3 integrin derived from electron cryomicroscopy and single particle analysis shows a cylindrical transmembrane density ∼30 Å long connecting the small cytoplasmic domains to the extracellular part (10Adair B.D. Yeager M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14059-14064Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The shape of the rods suggests a parallel crossed α-helical structure of the two TM helices, which seem to associate in the membrane. NMR measurements show a direct association of the cytoplasmic domains (11Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T. Plow E. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and it was shown that the membrane proximal residues of the cytoplasmic β3 integrin domain form an α-helix (12Ulmer T.S. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7498-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This α-helical structure is most likely the extension of an α-helical transmembrane domain, because the amino acids located N-terminal to this stretch are highly hydrophobic. A multiple sequence alignment of the predicted TM-spanning regions of various integrin sequences reveals that a GXXXG-like motif can be found in this region (13Gottschalk K.E. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Kessler H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The GXXXG motif was previously found to be important for the dimerization of GpA (14Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 15Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M.

Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and selection of a library of random TM sequences for homodimerization showed that the GXXXG motif is sufficient for strong helix-helix interactions and that it provides a more general framework for the formation of homodimers (17Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Additionally, a statistical analysis of a data base containing over 13,000 TM sequences showed that the GXXXG motif is highly overrepresented in TM domains (18Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), supporting the importance of the GXXXG motif in transmembrane helix-helix interactions. The study also showed that other combinations of small residues (Gly, Ala, Ser) are overrepresented. For the homodimerization of the ErbB receptor family, combinations of small residues other than the GXXXG motif can also mediate TM helix-helix interactions (19Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C.

Yeager M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar suggested that the GXXXG-like motif is involved in stabilization of the integrin TM helix interactions. Though it was shown that the interaction of the α and β subunits of the αIIb/β3 integrin is driven by the large extracellular domain (21Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the dimerization efficiency is lower if the intracellular and TM domains are missing (22Frachet P. Duperray A. Delachanal E. Marguerie G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The membrane proximal parts of the individual subunits of the αIIb/β3 integrin interact and can inactivate the integrin (23Lu C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). NMR analysis of the interaction of the small cytoplasmic domains failed to show any interaction (12Ulmer T.S. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7498-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and a study of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane part of the αIIb/β3 integrin demonstrated only homooligomerization of the subunits rather than the formation of hetero-oligomers (24Li R. Babu C.R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12462-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These results are in contrast to a variety of data on the whole proteins showing interaction of at least the cytosolic, membrane proximal parts of the integrins, and it was argued that the missing observation of hetero-oligomers was caused by the experimental conditions used (13Gottschalk K.E. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Kessler H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Using Förster resonance energy transfer measurements with αL and β2 proteins fused to cyan or yellow fluorescent proteins, respectively, it was shown that the cytoplasmic domains of integrins get separated during transmembrane signaling (7Kim M.

Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), and large-scale rearrangements of the purified extracellular domains of integrin α and β subunits associated with integrin activation were additionally shown by NMR and electron microscopic studies (25Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 26Takagi J. Beglova N. Yalamanchili P. Blacklow S.C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).In this study we examine the possible role of the integrin TM domains in the formation and stabilization of the α/β heterodimeric integrin structure. The integrin TM segments were determined to consist of about 30 residues (27Armulik A. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37030-37034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and structural data show a parallel crossed α-helical structure of the two TM helices within the membrane (10Adair B.D. Yeager M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14059-14064Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To elucidate the possible function of the TM core residues, and especially the GXXXG-like motif, that are most likely involved in the formation or stabilization of oligomeric integrins, we concentrated on a hydrophobic stretch of 16–17 amino acids not involving membrane integral residues localized at the ends of the TM helices and thus probably not involved in interaction. The TM core domains of the α2, αIIb, α4, β1, β3, and β7 integrins were expressed as chimeric proteins, and their capacity to form homooligomers as well as α2/β1, αIIb/β3, α4/β1, and α4/β7 heterooligomers was measured using the GALLEX assay (28Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3105-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We show that most TM domains homo-oligomerize to some extent and that they all form hetero-oligomers, although the strength of the hetero interaction is weak when compared with the interaction of the GpA TM domain. Introduction of single point mutations in the GXXXG-like motif of the α4/β7 integrin destabilized the oligomeric structures, so this motif is most likely involved in the stabilization of heterodimeric integrins. Our data together with recently published results indicate that the TM domains have a function in stabilizing the transmembrane region in the low affinity and/or intermediate affinity state of integrins (1Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The observation that most TM domains also homo-oligomerize argues against a function of the TM domains as the sole mediators of specific α/β interactions.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of GALLEX Chimera and β-Galactosidase Assay—The construction of the plasmids pBLM100 and pALM148 and of the chimera of GpA has been described (28Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3105-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To create the chimeras for the integrin TM regions, synthetic oligonucleotide cassettes encoding for the integrin TM domains were ligated into the SpeI/SacI restriction-digested plasmids.To measure homo-association, plasmids containing GALLEX chimeras were transformed in Escherichia coli SU101. For the measurement of hetero-association, the plasmids were transformed in E. coli SU202 (29Dmitrova M. Younes-Cauet G. Oertel-Buchheit P. Porte D. Schnarr M. Granger-Schnarr M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in the presence of antibiotics and 0.01 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight and diluted in the same medium to A600 = 0.1 the next morning. Cells were harvested at A600 = 0.6, and β-galactosidase activity was measured as described in Ref. 30Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar.Whole cell lysates were used to estimate expression levels of chimeras. Chimeric proteins were detected by Western analysis using anti-LexA-antibodies (Invitrogen), and blots were developed using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.Membrane insertion of the chimeric proteins was tested by NaOH extraction of lysozyme-treated cells (31Chen H. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14115-14122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To test for the orientation of the chimera in the E. coli membrane, plasmids were transformed into E. coli NT326 cells, which are malE-deficient, and grown on M9 medium with maltose as the only carbon source. Only if the MalE domain of the chimeric proteins is located in the periplasm are the cells able to complement for the absence of endogenous MalE and the topology is established.RESULTSHomo-association of Integrin TM Helices—The GALLEX system measures the oligomerization of given TM helices by the repression of a reporter gene (lacZ) activity in the E. coli strains SU101 or SU202 (Fig. 1). In SU101 the wt promoter/operator region of the lexA gene controls the expression of the lacZ reporter gene; if two TM helices form a homo-oligomer the dimeric DNA-binding domain can bind to the promoter region and repress the reporter gene activity (28Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3105-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 29Dmitrova M. Younes-Cauet G. Oertel-Buchheit P. Porte D. Schnarr M. Granger-Schnarr M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Incorporation of the chimeric proteins into the E. coli membrane was tested by NaOH extraction; the orientation of the chimera in the membrane was tested by a complementation assay as described under “Materials and Methods” and in Ref. 28Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3105-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar (results not shown).To test the ability of the α2, αIIb, α4, β1, β3, and β7 TM domains to form homo-oligomers, synthetic oligonucleotide cassettes encoding the hydrophobic core regions of integrin TM helices (Fig. 2A) were cloned into the plasmid pBLM (28Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3105-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and homo-oligomerization was measured using the GALLEX system (28Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3105-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As internal standards, the homodimerization capacity of GpA wt and the disruptive G83I mutation was also measured. The TM domain of the wt GpA forms a strong homodimer as shown in many studies (15Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 16Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 272: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and the introduction of the G83I mutation strongly disrupts this dimer (14Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 15Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). We used the GpA wt and G83I mutant to set the repression scale, with wt set as “strong interaction” and G83I as “weak interaction.”Fig. 2Homo-association of integrin TM domains. A, the sequences of the integrin TM domains used for the GALLEX measurements are shown. The sequences are numbered 1 to 17. Polar amino acids at the ends of the putative TM sequences were replaced by unpolar residues, indicated by light letters. B, the capacity of the integrin α2, αIIb, α4, β1, and β3, β7 integrin TM domains to form homooligomers was measured using the GALLEX system (28Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3105-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As internal standards the capacity of the wt and G83I mutated GpA TM domains to form homodimers was measured. The relative association capacity of each TM domain was determined by measuring the β-galactosidase activities of three independent clones; the activities are shown relative to GpA wt. The expression level of the chimeric proteins was checked by Western analysis using anti-LexA-antibodies (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results shown in Fig. 2B demonstrate that the integrin α2, αIIb, α4, and β1 TM domains have only a slight tendency to form homo-oligomers when compared with the GpA TM domain, with a homodimerization capacity only slightly higher than for GpA G83I. The integrin β3 TM domain forms only very weakly associating oligomers, whereas the integrin β7 TM domain interacts with itself as strongly as GpA wt.Heterodimerization of Integrin TM Helices—Most available data have indicated that integrins form α/β heterodimeric complexes, an inference strongly supported by the recently published structure of the αIIb/β3 integrin (10Adair B.D. Yeager M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14059-14064Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is known that the extracellular domains alone can hetero-associate (22Frachet P. Duperray A. Delachanal E. Marguerie G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, although the extracellular domains of α and β subunits are able to form a heterodimer, this is accomplished with a lower efficiency in the absence of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains compared with the full-length proteins (22Frachet P. Duperray A. Delachanal E. Marguerie G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).To determine the capacity of two different TM helices to form hetero-oligomers, the two chimeric proteins are expressed from the two different plasmids, pBLM100 and pALM148, that encode wt and mutated LexA DNA-binding domains, respectively (28Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3105-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the E. coli reporter strain SU202, only a dimeric LexA DNA-binding domain, comprising one wt and one mutated LexA domain, can efficiently repress the reporter gene activity (29Dmitrova M. Younes-Cauet G. Oertel-Buchheit P. Porte D. Schnarr M. Granger-Schnarr M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Using the GALLEX approach, we tested the TM domains for the ability to form α2/β1, αIIb/β3, α4/β1, and α4/β7 heterooligomers, respectively. For any pair of integrin TM helices, two measurements were carried out: one with the α TM domain expressed from pBLM100 and the β TM domain from pALM148, and in the complementary experiment the individual TM domains were each expressed as chimera from the opposite plasmid.The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the integrin TM domains of all tested combinations form hetero-oligomers, although the interactions are not as strong as the GpA wt homodimerization. The capacity of the integrin α/β pairs to hetero-associate is somewhat higher than the weak homodimerization capacity of the GpA G83I mutant.Fig. 3A, heterodimerization of the α2/β1, αIIb/β3, α4/β1, and α4/β7 hetero-oligomers. Bars represent the S.D. of three independent measurements. The association capacities are shown relative to the strain expressing GpA wt from both plasmids. Integrin sequences shown below the black bar are expressed from pALM148, the ones above the bar are expressed from pBLM100. B, expression level of the chimera in each strain was tested by Western analysis using anti-LexA antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sequence Analysis of Human Integrins—A recent sequence alignment of integrin sequences from a variety of organisms revealed that a GXXXG-like motif is conserved in most integrin TM domains (13Gottschalk K.E. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Kessler H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A sequence alignment of the human integrin sequences in shown in Fig. 4. The alignment shows that in most cases a motif can be found that consists of one small residue (Gly, Ser, Ala), three variant amino acids, and one other small residue.Fig. 4A, sequence alignment of human integrin α and β subunits. The TM regions are aligned using the program Clustal X (44Thompson J. Gibson T. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35193) Google Scholar) with default settings. The TM domains are highlighted in gray, and the possible GXXXG-like dimerization motif is indicated. B, integrin α/β subunit combinations in humans. Empty boxes represent subunit interactions that have not been examined. The exact composition of the GXXXG-like motifs is given in parentheses behind each integrin subunit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The GXXXG motif is a central component of the dimerization motif of the human GpA sequence, and it has been shown that in some cases at least one Gly residue can be replaced by another small residue (19Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although all of the human integrin α subunits and most of the β subunits contain a GXXXG-like motif at similar positions in the predicted TM regions, the integrin β4 sequence has no such motif and the β8 sequence contains a GXXXV motif.Importance of the GXXXG-like Motif for Heterodimer Formation—Because most of the integrin TM domains contain a GXXXG-like motif and it was proposed that this motif mediates the association of the two α and β subunits in a GpA-like manner (10Adair B.D. Yeager M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14059-14064Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Gottschalk K.E. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Kessler H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we tested for the significance of the small residues in mediating the interaction of the two TM domains. For this purpose the α4β7 integrin was selected because this pair forms the strongest hetero-oligomer (Fig. 3) and changes in the interaction capacity of two TM-helices after introduction of single point mutations can easily be monitored.In Fig. 5 the homo-association capacity of the wt and mutated α4 and β7 integrin TM domains is shown. In the α4 sequence, the SXXXG motif was changed to GXXXG, IXXXG, or SXXXI, respectively. In the β7 sequence the two Gly residues were mutated to Ile separately. A replacement of the Gly-83 residue in the dimerization motif of GpA by Ile was shown to be highly disruptive (15Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The exchange of the small Gly by the bulky Ile residue changes the interacting surface, resulting in only a very weak interaction of the monomers.Fig. 5Homo-association of integrin TM domains with single point mutations in the GXXXG-like motif. A, the point mutations are indicated in the sequences of the α4 and β7 integrin TM domains. B, capacity of the wt and mutated integrin TM domains to form homooligomers. As internal standards the capacity of the wt and G83I mutated GpA TM domains to form homodimers was measured. Bars represent the S.D. of three independent measurements. Oligomerization capacities are shown relative to GpA wt. The expression level of the chimeric proteins was checked by Western analysis using anti-LexA antibodies (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results show that the substitution of the Ser in the α4 sequence by both Gly or Ile leads to a decreased interaction capacity of the TM helix. Also, the mutation of the Gly residues to Ile strongly decreases the tendency of the TM helices to form homo-oligomers. The effect on the homo-oligomerization capacity after mutating the Gly residues to Ile is stronger in the integrin β7 case. The substitution of either of the two Gly by Ile leads to a strong decrease in the interaction capacity, and the effect is stronger for Gly-11 than for Gly-7.The effect of introducing the single point mutations on the hetero-oligomerization capacity of the heterodimeric α4/β7 integrin was tested in E. coli SU202. The results, shown in Fig. 6, indicate that all mutations influence the capacity of the two TM domains to associate, and the substitution of either of the two Gly residues in the integrin β7 sequence has the strongest effect on the hetero-oligomer formation. In all cases the expression level of the chimera was approximately the same as tested by Western analysis. We observed an asymmetry in the results depending on which TM domain was expressed from which plasmid. If the α4 wt and mutated sequences are expressed from the plasmid pALM148, differences can be observed that are in good agreement with the data obtained in the homo-association assay. If the β7 TM domain is expressed from the plasmid pALM148, basically no differences between the wt hetero-oligomer and the oligomers containing one mutated subunit can be observed. This kind of asymmetry was observed in other studies (28Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3105-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 33Daines D.A. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5267-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and is most likely caused by the slightly different expression levels from the two plasmids used in this study. Nonetheless, the putative interaction motifs are implicated by the preponderance of the mutation evidence.Fig. 6Heterodimerization of the α4/β7 hetero-oligomer with single point mutations.

IκBαM-mediated inhibition of constitutive NF-κB activity in human pancreatic cancer cells suppressed tumorigenesis and liver metastasis in an orthotopic nude mouse model, suggesting that constitutive NF-κB activation plays an important role in pancreatic tumor progression and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism by which NF-κB is activated in pancreatic cancer remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that an autocrine mechanism accounts for the constitutive activation of NF-κB in metastatic human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Further investigation showed that interleukin-1α was the primary cytokine secreted by these cells that activates NF-κB. Neutralization of interleukin-1α activity suppressed the constitutive activation of NF-κB and the expression of its downstream target gene, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, in metastatic pancreatic cancer cell lines. Our results demonstrate that regulation of interleukin-1α expression is primarily dependent on AP-1 activity, which is in part induced by signaling pathways that are epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent and -independent. In conclusion, our findings suggest a possible mechanism for the constitutive activation of NF-κB in metastatic human pancreatic cancer cells and a possible missing mechanistic link between inflammation and cancer.

In conclusion, our findings suggest a possible mechanism for the constitutive activation of NF-κB in metastatic human pancreatic cancer cells and a possible missing mechanistic link between inflammation and cancer. NF-κB is a family of pleiotropic transcription factors that control the expression of numerous genes involved in growth, tumorigenesis, tumor metastasis, differentiation, embryonic development, apoptosis, and inflammation (1Gilmore T.D.

Five members of mammalian NF-κB have been described: NF-κB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-κB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), c-Rel, RelA (p65), and RelB, each of which has a 300-residue-long Rel homology domain (2Li Q.

The interaction of c-Rel, RelA, and RelB with their inhibitors, the IκBs, results in inactive complexes in the cytoplasm by masking the nuclear localization signal (6Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). The inhibitor proteins IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, IκBϵ, and Bcl-3 and the Drosophila protein Cactus have been described and characterized (2Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev.

In most cell types, NF-κB proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor IκB in an inactive form (2Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev.

Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). On stimulation, IκB is phosphorylated by IκB kinase, which triggers its rapid degradation (8Baeuerle P.A.

Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Consequently NF-κB proteins are released and translocated into the nucleus where they activate the expression of target genes (1Gilmore T.D. Koedood M. Piffat K.A. White D.W.

One of the key target genes regulated by NF-κB is its inhibitor IκBα. A feedback inhibition pathway for control of IκBα gene transcription and down-regulation of transient activation of NF-κB activity has been described (11Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 12Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C.

Members of the NF-κB family are involved in the development of cancer. For instance, v-Rel, which is carried by a highly oncogenic retrovirus, causes an aggressive tumor in young birds and is able to transform avian lymphoid cells and fibroblasts (1Gilmore T.D. Koedood M. Piffat K.A. White D.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1367-1378PubMed Google Scholar, 14Moore B.E. Bose Jr., H.R. Virology. 1988; 162: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mutated c-rel oncogene also transforms cells. Many reports have demonstrated that chromosomal amplification, overexpression, and recurrent genomic rearrangement in the genes encoding c-Rel, Bcl-3, p105 (p50), and p100 (p52) have been identified in many human hematopoietic cancers and several types of solid tumor such as human non-small cell lung carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, and adenocarcinomas of breast (1Gilmore T.D.

Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar). Many tumors have acquired genetic alterations in the signaling pathways that regulate NF-κB activation. For example, defective IκBα led to constitutive nuclear NF-κB activity, which in turn conferred a growth advantage of Hodgkin's disease tumor cells (16Emmerich F. Meiser M. Hummel M. Demel G. Foss H.D. Jundt F. Mathas S. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Stein H. Dorken B. Blood. 1999; 94: 3129-3134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The elevated IκB kinase activities were also found in some of the tumor cells, suggesting that IκB kinase was activated by as yet unidentified aberrant upstream signaling cascades (16Emmerich F. Meiser M. Hummel M. Demel G. Foss H.D. Jundt F. Mathas S. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Stein H. Dorken B. Blood. 1999; 94: 3129-3134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that RelA, the p65 subunit of the NF-κB transcription factor, was constitutively activated in most pancreatic cancer tissues and human pancreatic cancer cell lines but not in normal pancreatic tissues and immortalized pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (17Wang W. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Larry L. Cleary K.R. Chiao P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dong Q.G. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Peng B. Wu T. Tsao M.S. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. McDonnell T.J. Chiao P.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6510-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Our more recent work showed that inhibition of constitutive NF-κB activity by a mutant IκBα (S32A,S36A) completely suppressed the liver metastasis of the pancreatic cancer cell line ASPC-1 and the tumorigenic phenotype of a nonmetastatic pancreatic tumor cell line, PANC-1, suggesting that constitutive RelA activity plays a key role in pancreatic cancer metastasis and tumor progression (19Fujioka S. Sclabas G.M. Schmidt C. Niu J. Frederick W.A. Dong Q.G. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Baker C. Chiao P.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1365-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20Fujioka S.

However, the mechanisms by which NF-κB transcription factors are constitutively activated in pancreatic cancer still remain to be elucidated. Several studies have shown that secretion of proinflammatory cytokines are increased in cancers (21Voronov E. Shouval D.S. Krelin Y. Cagnano E. Benharroch D. Iwakura Y. Dinarello C.A. Apte R.N. Proc.

Sachs L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3284-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; WT, wild-type; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; MAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase. and interleukin-1 (IL-1), are the potent activators of NF-κB that induce phosphorylation and rapid degradation of IκB, exposing the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB and resulting in NF-κB nuclear translocation (25Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 26Israel A. Le Bail O. Hatat D. Piette J. Kieran M. Logeat F. Wallach D. Fellous M. Kourilsky P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Some of these cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF, have been reported to be regulated by NF-κB in some cancer cell lines (27Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 28Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hiscott J. Marois J.

Blood. 1996; 87: 3410-3417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that autocrine secretion of these cytokines forms a positive feedback loop that induces the constitutive NF-κB activation. The involvement of autocrine stimulation mechanisms of these cytokines in cancer progression has been suggested (31Vale T. Ngo T.T. White M.A. Lipsky P.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 602-607PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yasumoto K. Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Murakami S. Mai M. Matsushima K. J. Biol.

For example, overexpression of IL-1 as an autocrine growth factor has been reported in a number of tumors in which activation of Raf plays an important role in transformation, suggesting that blockade of IL-1 signaling may be an approach to limiting the growth of certain tumors (31Vale T. Ngo T.T. White M.A. Lipsky P.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 602-607PubMed Google Scholar). Both exogenous IL-1α and endogenous IL-1α contribute to the transcriptional activation of NF-κB and AP-1, induce the expression of IL-8, and promote cell survival and the growth of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines in vitro (32Yasumoto K. Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Murakami S. Mai M. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22506-22511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ondrey F.G. Dong G. Sunwoo J. Chen Z. Wolf J.S.

Mukaida N. Van Waes C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1812-1820PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study also suggested that overexpression of IL-1β might confer the chemoresistance in certain pancreatic cancer cell lines through NF-κB activation (35Arlt A. Vorndamm J. Muerkoster S. Yu H. Schmidt W.E. Folsch U.R. Schafer H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 910-916PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the regulation of the expression of these inflammatory cytokines is altered is unclear. Whether the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1 activate NF-κB or the constitutive activity of NF-κB induces the overexpression of these cytokines in cancer cells is not known. To determine the mechanisms by which NF-κB is constitutively activated in metastatic pancreatic cancer cells, we sought to delineate the signaling cascades that lead to constitutive NF-κB activation. We generated a number of pancreatic cancer cell lines that express a phosphorylation-defective IκBα mutant to inhibit constitutive NF-κB activity. Our results show that overexpression of IL-1α is primarily induced by AP-1 activity, which is partially dependent on the overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in several metastatic pancreatic cancer cell lines but not in nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer cell lines. Thus, autocrine stimulation of IL-1α, but not IL-1β, induces the constitutive activation of NF-κB, which in turn induces the expression of its downstream target genes. Cell Lines and Reagents—The human pancreatic cancer cell lines ASPC-1, PANC-1, Capan-1, and CFPAC-1 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). Human pancreatic cancer cell lines MDAPanc-3 and MDAPanc-28 were established by Marsha Frazier and Douglas B. Evans (The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center) (36Frazier M.L. Fernandez E. de Llorens R. Brown N.M. Pathak S. Cleary K.R. Abbruzzese J.L. Berry K. Olive M. Le Maistre A. Evans D.B. Int. J.

Pancreas. 1990; 5: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The human pancreatic cancer cell lines ASPC-1/IκBM and MDAPanc-28/IκBM were constructed as described previously by Dong et al. (18Dong Q.G. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Peng B. Wu T. Tsao M.S. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. McDonnell T.J. Chiao P.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6510-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast (WT-MEF) cells were established in our laboratory according to the report by Beg et al. (38Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). All cell lines were grown in the original cell culture medium specified by the American Type Culture Collection and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Neutralizing IL-1α, IL-1β, TNFα, TNFβ, and IL-1 receptor type I antibodies were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). EGFR neutralizing antibody C225 was obtained from Dr. Zhen Fan (The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). The Preparation of Conditioned Medium—Human pancreatic cancer cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 48 h. The medium was then harvested and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Four milliliters of supernatant were then used as conditioned medium and added to WT-MEF cells. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The human pancreatic cancer cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 48 h. The harvested conditioned media were used to treat WT-MEFs at different intervals. Neutralizing antibodies (2 μg/ml) were used to block the corresponding cytokines. EGFR antibody C225 was used at 20 ng/ml for 48 h prior to the experiment. The nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Andrews and Faller (39Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). DNA binding assays for NF-κB proteins were performed with 15 μg of nuclear extracts as described by Chiao et al. (11Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-CTCAACAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGCCAT-3′) containing the κB site found in the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat were used as probes. The mutant κB site for human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (5′-CTCAACAGAGTTGACTTTTCGAGAGGCCAT-3′) was used for competition studies. The competition was performed with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant κB oligonucleotides. Supershift experiments were performed with anti-RelA and anti-p50 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The reactions were analyzed on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.25× Tris/borate/EDTA buffer. Western Blot Analysis—Cytoplasmic extracts were used for the detection of IκBα protein. Total protein extracts from human pancreatic cancer cell lines were isolated for the detection of IL-1α and IL-1β levels. For detection of IL-1α and IL-1β levels in conditioned medium, the conditioned medium from human pancreatic cancer cell cultures was harvested at the same ratio of medium volume to cell number and dialyzed for 24 h; 1 ml of dialyzed medium was then dried to a volume of 30 μl. The concentrated medium or 100 μg of protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA), and detected with IκBα, IL-1α, or IL-1β antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) antibody (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT), or β-actin antibody (Sigma). Subsequent Western blot analyses were carried out with Lumi-light Western blot substrate (Roche Diagnostics). Reverse Transcription-PCR and Northern Blot Analysis Total—RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The RNA was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The primers used for IL-1α were 5′-GGTAGTAGCAACCAACGGGA-3′ and 5′-TGGGTATCTCAGGCATCTCC-3′, and the primers used for IL-1β were 5′-AGCTGATGGCC CTAAACAGA-3′ and 5′-TCTTTCAACACGCAGGACAG-3′. The PCR products were 419 bp for IL-1α and 498 bp for IL-1β. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min and then 30 cycles performed at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Finally samples were extended at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products were cloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and were subsequently sequenced to confirm their identity. The IL-1α (BamHI- and EcoRV-digested) and IL-1β (EcoRI-digested) cDNAs were purified and used as the probes for Northern blot analysis. Total RNA (30 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to a Hybond nylon filter (Osmonics, Westborough, MA), and ultraviolet cross-linked. The blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled human IL-1α or IL-1β cDNA and exposed to display the results. Primer Extension and DNA Sequencing—Total RNA (25 μg) from ASPC-1 and MDAPanc-28 cells was preheated at 65 °C for 5 min and then put on ice for 5 min. After that, 200 ng of 32P-end-labeled primer (5′-GCTGT AGTTG TGTTC TGGCT GA-3′), 5 units of RNase inhibitor, 2.5 mm dNTP mixture, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of Improm-II reverse transcriptase, and 1× reverse transcription reaction buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) were added. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and then transferred to 42 °C for 1 h. The reaction products were treated with RNase H for 30 min, boiled for 5 min, chilled on ice, and analyzed in 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels with DNA sequencing reaction products of human IL-1α genomic clone using the same 32P-end-labeled primer and DNA size marker ϕX174 (32P-end-labeled). DNA sequencing was performed using a Sequenase kit (United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH). Mutagenesis of AP-1 Sites in IL-1α Promoter—IL-1α promoter was cloned by PCR. The right primer was 5′-CGCTCGAGGCTGTAGTTGTGTTCTGGCTGA-3′ (the sequence underlined is the restriction site for XhoI), and the left primer was 5′-CGGAGCTCTGGGAACCCAAAACATTCAT-3′ (the sequence underlined is the restriction site for SacI). PCR products were cloned into the pGL2 firefly luciferase vector (Promega). The mutagenesis was performed using the mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The primer used for AP1-1 (site 1) was 5′-CCAT TCCCAAACTTGTCCACTGGCTTCTGGCTGAGGCC-3′, and the primer used for AP1-2 (site 2) was 5′-CCCTCT TCAGAAAAGATGGCACATTTTCCCTC-3′ (AP-1 sites are underlined, and mutated sites are in bold letters). The mutated AP-1 sites were verified by sequencing. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Gene Analysis— IL-1α reporter gene constructs (1 μg) were cotransfected into relA-/- MEF cells with an internal control, p-TK Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK), using the lipotransfection method (FuGENE 6, Roche Diagnostics) in triplicate. The activity of both firefly and Renilla luciferase were determined 48 h after transfection using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Conditioned Medium from Metastatic Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells Induces NF-κB Activation—We previously reported that NF-κB was constitutively activated in most human pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines (17Wang W. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Larry L. Cleary K.R. Chiao P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar) and that inhibition of constitutive NF-κB activation suppresses tumorigenesis and liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer cell lines (19Fujioka S. Sclabas G.M. Schmidt C. Niu J. Frederick W.A. Dong Q.G. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Baker C. Chiao P.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1365-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20Fujioka S.

Constitutive NF-κB activity was greatly reduced in the metastatic pancreatic cancer cell lines when the fresh medium was replenished 1–2 h before the EMSA. 2J. Niu, Z. Li, B. Peng, and P. J. Chiao, unpublished observation. One possible mechanism is that the constitutive NF-κB activity was induced through autocrine stimulation. To test whether human pancreatic cancer cells secrete an inducer for NF-κB activation, we cultured the human metastatic pancreatic cancer cell lines ASPC-1 and MDAPanc-28 and the nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 in serum-free medium for 48 h and then isolated the conditioned media to stimulate WT-MEF cells at different times. Our results showed that the conditioned medium from ASPC-1 and MDAPanc-28 pancreatic cancer cell lines induced NF-κB activation in a time-dependent mode but did not increase Oct-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 1A). TNFα induced NF-κB activation in WT-MEF cells, but the conditioned medium from PANC-1 cells did not (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that metastatic but not nonmetastatic human pancreatic cancer cell lines secrete the activators of NF-κB, which may in turn induce NF-κB constitutive activity in these cells. The competition and supershift assays confirmed the specificity and identity of the κB DNA binding activity as p65(RelA)/p50 heterodimers (Fig. 1C). Conditioned medium-stimulated NF-κB activation was confirmed by the conditioned medium-induced and time-dependent degradation of IκBα (Fig. 1D). Furthermore the conditioned media from the other human metastatic pancreatic cancer cell lines, Capan-1, CFPAC-1, and MDAPanc-3, also induced NF-κB DNA binding activity in WT-MEF cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the secretion of NF-κB inducer is a common phenomenon in metastatic pancreatic cancer cells. Interleukin-1α Is the Primary Cytokine Secreted by Human Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Cell Lines—To identify which inducer is secreted by these pancreatic cancer cell lines, we first screened a panel of neutralizing antibodies of common inducers of NF-κB, including IL-1α, IL-1β, TNFα, and TNFβ, before we performed biochemical purification and identification approaches. The conditioned media from these cell lines were isolated and incubated with IL-1α, IL-1β, TNFα, and TNFβ neutralizing antibodies. Subsequently these media were used to stimulate WT-MEF cells for 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, and nuclear extracts were then isolated for EMSA. We found that the IL-1α neutralizing antibody blocked NF-κB-inducing activity in the ASPC-1- and MDAPanc-28-conditioned media, but the other neutralizing antibodies did not have much effect (Fig. 2A). Consistently IL-1α neutralizing antibody blocked the NF-κB-inducing activity from the conditioned media of other human metastatic pancreatic cancer cell lines, Capan-1, CF-PAC-1, and MDAPanc-3 (data not shown). This implies that IL-1α is the major cytokine and NF-κB-inducing activity secreted by these cells. To determine whether IL-1α autocrine stimulation induces constitutive NF-κB activity in ASPC-1 and MDAPanc-28 cells, we treated these cells directly with neutralizing antibodies against IL-1α, IL-1β, TNFα, and TNFβ for 1 h and isolated the nuclear extracts for EMSA. Anti-IL-1α neutralizing antibody completely inhibited constitutive NF-κB activity in these cells, but anti-IL-β, -TNFα, and -TNFβ neutralizing antibodies only had minimal effects on constitutive NF-κB activity (Fig. 2B). To provide further evidence of the role of IL-α in autocrine stimulation, we treated WT-MEFs and MDAPanc-28 and ASPC-1 cells with anti-IL-1 receptor type 1 antibodies for 120 min to block their IL-1 receptors. The results showed that blocking the IL-1 receptor in these cells inhibited IL-1α-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2, C and D). Together these results suggest that IL-1α is the principal cytokine that contributes to the induction of constitutive NF-κB activation in MDAPanc-28 and ASPC-1 cells. To determine the expression and secretion of IL-1α in MDAPanc-28, ASPC-1, and PANC-1 cells, we performed Northern and Western blot analyses. In MDAPanc-28 and ASPC-1 cells, high levels of IL-1α mRNA were expressed, but its expression was not detectable in PANC-1 cells (Fig. 3A). On Western blot analysis, high levels of IL-1α protein were detected in both cell extracts (50 μg) and conditioned medium from the metastatic human pancreatic cancer cell lines ASPC-1 and MDAPanc-28 but were not detected in those from PANC-1 cells (Fig. 3B). Although IL-1β mRNA was detected in these pancreatic cancer cell lines, a much higher level of IL-1β mRNA was detected in MDAPanc-28 cells than those in ASPC-1 and PANC-1 cells (Fig. 3A). The level of IL-1β protein was very low and barely detectable in ASPC-1 cells and undetectable in PANC-1 cells using 200 μg of protein extracts with the anti-IL-1β antibody, consistent with the expression patterns of IL-1β in these two cell lines detected in Northern blot analysis. However, none of the conditioned medium from these three cells had detectable IL-1β (data not shown). Much lower levels of IL-1β as compared with the level of IL-1α expressed in ASPC-1 and MDAPanc-28 is consistent with the minor reduction of constitutive NF-κB activities in anti-IL-1β neutralizing antibody completely treated conditioned media from these cells (Fig. 2B).

U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). The interaction between TRANCE and RANK is essential for osteoclastogenesis because RANK is activated by TRANCE and then associates with TNF receptor-associated family members to trigger downstream signaling (11Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia X.Z. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M.B. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar) events. OPG, on the other hand, plays an opposite role by preventing TRANCE from binding and activating RANK and thus is considered a “decoy” receptor. In this way, the interaction between TRANCE and OPG or TRANCE and RANK represents a complex network required for normal bone development, and any imbalance in the system potentially leads to bone disorders. Thus it is well recognized that this receptor complex network is an interesting drug development target for the treatment of bone disorders such as osteoporosis (12Khosla S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5050-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), and there is considerable interest in developing ways to modulate RANK functions which may prove beneficial for bone-related pathologies. To date there is no three-dimensional structural information available for the RANK receptor complex. However, it is believed that the complex should resemble that of the TNF receptor as a member of TNF superfamily. The TNF-β·TNFR1 co-crystal structure has been solved, thus facilitating rational drug design based on the receptor-ligand interaction sites coupled with rational ligand-receptor mutation studies (13Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the TNF receptor both in complexed and uncomplexed forms provides a general structural framework for understanding the atomic surfaces these receptors use to bind to their ligands (14Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17595-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Eck M.J. Ultsch M. Rinderknecht E. de Vos A.M. Sprang S.R. J. Biol.

We have proposed that the modular organization of structures of biological proteins and the identification of localized ligand-receptor interaction sites permit the rational design of smaller, peptidomimetics that can interfere with these ligand-receptor interactions (17Idriss H.T. Naismith J.H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The mimetics on their own may be therapeutically active but also can be used to guide authentic pharmaceutical designs. We have shown that a small peptide sequences derived from the TNFR1 surface which interacts with the ligand has reasonable activity in blocking the biological actions of the TNF receptor (18Takasaki W. Kajino Y. Kajino K. Murali R. Greene M.I. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 19Murali R. Greene M.I. Immunol. Res. 1998; 17: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified several critical binding sites on TRANCE and OPG based on a three-dimensional structural model of the OPG-TRANCE receptor complex. The models were developed on the basis of co-crystal structures of TNF-β·TNFR1 (13Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) and the deduced crystal structure of TRANCE (20Ito S. Wakabayashi K. Ubukata O. Hayashi S. Okada F. Hata T. J. Biol.

Invest. 2001; 108: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The putative critical contacts were then used for the design of exocyclic peptidomimetics. In general the small molecules designed from OPG appear to inhibit TRANCE binding to RANK more effectively than mimetics designed from TRANCE. Materials and Cell Cultures—A soluble form of recombinant TRANCE has been described previously (22Josien R. Li H.L. Ingulli E. Sarma S. Wong B.R. Vologodskaia M. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Recombinant human M-CSF, RANK, and OPG were obtained from PeproTECH (Rocky Hill, NJ). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Lines and Culture Systems—RAW264.7 cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Murine osteoclast precursors were from 6-8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Murine bone marrow cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 ng/ml M-CSF for 12 h in 100-mm-diameter dishes at a density of 1 × 107/dish. The nonadherent cells were then harvested and cultured with 30 ng/ml M-CSF in 100-mm dishes at the same density as before for an additional 48 h. Floating cells were removed, and attached cells were used as osteoclast precursors for generating osteoclasts (23Takami M. Kim N. Rho J. Choi Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1516-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Design of TRANCE and OPG Mimetics—Computer modeling was built using Modeler 4.0 (24Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 403-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), and further refinement and analysis were performed using INSIGHT II (Molecular Simulation, Inc., San Diego). The OPG-TRANCE structure complex was initially modeled by molecular replacement using models constructed from crystallographic coordinates, Protein Data Bank (PDB) (25Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.E. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8178) Google Scholar). The structure model of OPG was built using substructures of TNFR (1TNR), Fas (1BZI), and TRAIL (1D4V and 1D0G) receptors. Models were checked for consistency, and the ambiguous loop regions were reexamined and built using CONGEN (26Bruccoleri R.E. Haber E. Novotny J. Nature. 1988; 335: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the final consensus model the side chains involved in unfavorable interactions were adjusted manually as a side chain conformation search was carried out. The model was then optimized using energy minimization and molecular simulation calculations. The accuracy of the model was checked using Ramachandran plot (27Ramachandran G.N. Venkatachalam C.M. Biopolymers. 1968; 6: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and by profile analyses (28Zhang K.Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The binding sites involved in direct interaction between TRANCE and OPG were analyzed and used as the initial template for peptide design, as shown in Table I. The model peptides designed were constructed from their sequences and folded using CHARMM. The folded peptides were minimized to convergence with a dielectric constants set to 80. Details of the design of receptor-based peptidomimetics have been described previously (18Takasaki W. Kajino Y. Kajino K. Murali R. Greene M.I. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Murali R. Kajino K. Hasegawa A. Berezov A. Takasaki W. Ciliberto G. Savino R. Cytokine Inhibitors.

The purity and identity of peptides were confirmed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry. The peptides were cyclized by air oxidation in distilled water adjusted to pH 8.0-8.5 with (NH4)2CO3 at 0.1 mg/ml, as described previously (18Takasaki W. Kajino Y. Kajino K. Murali R. Greene M.I. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Kinetic Binding Studies by Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding experiments were carried out on BiaCORE 3000 (BiaCORE, Uppsala, Sweden) instruments at 25 °C. Recombinant TRANCE, RANK, and OPG (PeproTECH, Inc.) were immobilized to the dextran hydrogel on the sensor surface (BiaCORE CM5 sensor chip) with a surface density of 2,000 resonance units. The surface was regenerated to remove all bound analyte among binding cycles using 0.2% SDS. The apparent rate constants (kon and koff) and the equilibrium binding constant (KD) for the receptor-peptide/ligand-peptide binding interaction were estimated from the kinetic analysis of sensorgrams, using the BIA evaluation 3.0 software (BiaCORE). Immunoblotting—To evaluate the effect of the peptide on the regulation of downstream molecules of TRANCE signaling during osteoclastogenesis, RAW264.7 cells (5 × 105/well) were cultured in 6-well plates for 12 h, treated with or without the designed peptide for 2 h, and then stimulated with TRANCE at 300 ng/ml for the indicated periods. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer. Cell lysates (15-30 μg) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics, Westborough, MA), and probed with anti-phospho-IκBα, anti-IκBα, and anti-ERK2 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA). The membranes were then developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). Effect on TRANCE-induced Osteoclast Formation and Pit Formation in Vitro—To evaluate the effect of the peptide on TRANCE-mediated osteoclastogenesis, murine osteoclast precursors were cultured in 96-well plates (1 × 105/ml, 200 μl/well) for 3 days in the presence of 30 ng/ml murine CSF-1 and 300 ng/ml sTRANCE with or without treatment of designed peptides at the indicated concentration. After 3 days, the cells were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) as described previously (30Shiotani A. Takami M. Itoh K. Shibasaki Y. Sasaki T. Anat. Rec. 2002; 268: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). TRAP-positive multinucleated cells were counted as osteoclast-like multinucleated cells. For the pit formation assay, mouse osteoclast precursors (5 × 104 cells/0.2 ml/well) were placed on dentin slices (4 mm in diameter) in 96-well culture plates and cultured for 1 h with 30 ng/ml M-CSF. Dentine slices were then transferred into 48-well culture plates (Corning Glass). Cells on dentin slices were cultured in the presence of 30 ng/ml M-CSF with or without 200 ng/ml TRANCE for 4 days, in the absence or presence of peptide OP3-4 at the indicated concentration. Medium was replaced on day 3. On day 4, cells were removed from the dentin slices with cotton, and the slices were then immersed in Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma) to stain the resorption pits formed by osteoclasts. Effect on Bone Resorption in Ovariectomized (OVX) Mice—In 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice, the dorsal skin was incised, and ovaries were excised under anesthesia. The sham operation group and ovariectomy group were treated with peptide or vehicle only. An Arzet® osmotic pump (DURECT Co., Cupertino, CA) was used to deliver OP3-4 subcutaneously after the ovariectomy. The pump was used for systemic administration at a consistent rate for up to 4 weeks without repeated dosing. The pump was filled up to 200 μl for the duration (4 weeks) and delivered at the rate of 0.25 μl/h. The OVX mice were given peptide OP3-4 subcutaneously at a daily dosage of 2 mg/kg/day for 28 days. The mice were euthanized, and the tibia and femur were removed, cleaned of soft tissue, and fixed in 10% formalin. Femur were scanned by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) to examine the total bone density. Animals were maintained in accordance with guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Molecular Modeling of TRANCE Binding to OPG and Development of OPG-like Mimetics—The overall topology of OPG is similar to that of the TNFR (Fig. 1A), although the homology in the primary structure is less than 50%. The three-dimensional model of OPG was built using modular fold of the TNFR superfamily (16Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. J. Inflamm. 1995; 47: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar, 31Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of OPG was built using substructures of TNFR (1TNR), Fas (1BZI), and TRAIL (1D4V and 1D0G) receptors. The structure of OPG consists of B2-A1-B2-A1-B1-B1-A1-B1 modular folds (16Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. J. Inflamm. 1995; 47: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar, 31Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 32Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). To study the fine details of the OPG-TRANCE complex, only the N-terminal region (22-185) was considered. The crystal structure of TRAIL-DR5 (33Cha S.S. Sung B.J. Kim Y.A. Song Y.L. Kim H.J. Kim S. Lee M.S. Oh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31171-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was also used as template and used to obtain maximal receptor-ligand interaction. In the final analysis, the OPG-TRANCE complex was similar to the TRAIL-DR5 receptor complex (33Cha S.S. Sung B.J. Kim Y.A. Song Y.L. Kim H.J. Kim S. Lee M.S. Oh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31171-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Based on the structural analysis of TRANCE and OPG-TRANCE complex several contact sites have been identified in TRANCE and three sites on OPG (Fig. 1A). Sites on OPG were identified as following: TRANCE (Tyr74-His86) binds to OPG (Tyr70-Asp78); TRANCE (Ser61-Tyr68) binds to OPG(Tyr82-Glu96); and TRANCE (Tyr96-Phe103) binds to OPG (Leu113-Arg122). The sequences of the three binding sites from both ligand and receptor were then used as template for peptide design (Table I). Exocyclic peptidomimetics were created from the conformational features of the critical sites on TRANCE and OPG with the addition of aromatic residues. Cyclization of linear peptides was confirmed by 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid). Purity was evaluated by reverse-phase HPLC before and after cyclization. All of the cyclized peptides were enriched to a purity of >98% before use. The purified exocyclic peptides were soluble and used to make a stock solution at 1 mm in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Inhibition of sTRANCE-induced Osteoclast Formation in Vitro—We have designed several peptide mimetics from both OPG and TRANCE (Table I) and have screened them for biological activity. We have evaluated these mimetics at a 30 μm concentration on osteoclastogenesis in murine bone marrow cells co-cultured with TRANCE and CSF-1 (30Shiotani A. Takami M. Itoh K. Shibasaki Y. Sasaki T. Anat. Rec. 2002; 268: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Several mimetics at a 30 μm concentration caused some reduction in the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells formed. Among all 11 peptides we designed from the three critical binding sites, 8 peptides exhibited 20-60% inhibitory activity (Fig. 1B). The peptides designed from OPG (OP series) showed a greater inhibitory effect than those designed from TRANCE (OL series). These data suggest that receptor-derived mimetics block ligand binding to its receptor differently than ligand mimetics. We have regarded the receptor as a better target in structure-based design and improved it further. The peptides derived from binding site 3, from both ligands (OL3-1, OL3-2) and receptor (OP3-1, OP3-2, OP3-4), exhibited more inhibitory effects compared with other derived peptides. This observation implied that binding site 3 may be an important binding surface for the signal competence of the OPG·TRANCE complex. Similar results were obtained when we designed peptides derived from the TNFR based upon the TNF-TNFR complex, indicating that membrane proximal domains may frequently be used as a critical interaction surface between ligands and receptors in the TNF-TNFR superfamily (18Takasaki W. Kajino Y. Kajino K. Murali R. Greene M.I. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Earlier when we engineered a monoclonal antibody mimetic, AHNP, a HERCEPTIN mimetic (34Park B.W. Zhang H.T. Wu C. Berezov A. Zhang X. Dua R. Wang Q. Kao G. O'Rourke D.M. Greene M.I. Murali R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we found that residues in the exocyclic regions also play a critical role in stabilizing the conformation of amino acids within the cyclic ring. To see whether such an addition to OP3 would have any affect, we modified the sequence of OP3-1 by either removing the tail amino acid sequence of KHR as in the OP3-2 species or changing the amino acids KHR to LIR as in the OP3-4 forms. Subsequently we found that changing the residues in the exocyclic rings does affect the activity of the mimetic, indicating that the tail composed of KHR is critical for forming the binding site structure. The dissociation rate of mimetics has been shown to correlate with biological activity (35Jimi E. Akiyama S. Tsurukai T. Okahashi N. Kobayashi K. Udagawa N. Nishihara T. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 434-442PubMed Google Scholar), and thus replacing KHR with LIR at the C terminus of OP3-4 actually enhanced the interaction between ligand and receptor, and consequently OP3-4 has become the most potent mimetic designed. Kinetic Binding Ability of OP3-4—Binding of OP3-4 to TRANCE was studied using surface plasmon resonance. OP3-4 bound to immobilized TRANCE in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a). Based on the association and dissociation kinetics obtained using a 1:1 Langmuir model for simple bimolecular interactions, the binding affinity (Kd) of OP3-4 to TRANCE was 3.89 × 10-6m. The apparent association constant (kon) and disassociation constant (koff) rate constants were estimated to be 2.41 × 102m-1 s-1 and 9.37 × 10-4 s-1, respectively. The affinity of OP3-4 binding to TRANCE is 2 orders of magnitude less than the affinity TRANCE to RANK (Kd = 1.39 × 10-8m) or OPG (Kd = 1.76 × 10-8m), but the koff, which is a better indicator of biological activity (35Jimi E. Akiyama S. Tsurukai T. Okahashi N. Kobayashi K. Udagawa N. Nishihara T. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 434-442PubMed Google Scholar), is comparable. (TRANCE to RANK koff = 3.05 × 10-4 s-1 and TRANCE to OPG koff = 2.4 × 10-4 s-1, respectively), The comparable koff suggests that the peptide can form a relatively stable complex with TRANCE and, as a consequence, compete in the interaction between ligand and receptor. To see further whether OP3-4 can block or compete with TRANCE binding to RANK, OP3-4 was studied in a competition assay. In a competition assay, OP3-4 reduced TRANCE binding to immobilized RANK in a dose-dependent manner. OP3-4 at a concentration of 50 μm significantly inhibited TRANCE binding to its receptor RANK (Fig. 2b). In Vitro Analysis of OP3-4 Mimetic—The inhibitory activity of peptide OP3-4 was then examined in terms of its ability to inhibit TRANCE-induced osteoclast formation (Fig. 3). Peptide concentrations of 2 μm or more caused a dose-dependent decrease in the number of TRAP-positive (TRAP+) multinucleated cells formed (Fig. 3A). In the presence of 50 μm OP3-4, the number of TRAP+ multinucleated cells was less than 10% of the number formed in co-cultures performed without the peptide. The IC50 was 10 μm. The decrease in the number of TRAP+ cells was apparently not the result of toxicity of the peptide because there was no change in the number of osteoblasts detected by staining for alkaline phosphatase (data not shown), nor was there a cytotoxic effect of 100 μm OP3-4 on RAW264.7 murine myeloid cells (data not shown). TRANCE stimulates bone resorption by mature osteoclasts (35Jimi E. Akiyama S. Tsurukai T. Okahashi N. Kobayashi K. Udagawa N. Nishihara T. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 434-442PubMed Google Scholar, 36Burgess T.L. Qian Y. Kaufman S. Ring B.D. Van G. Capparelli C. Kelley M. Hsu H. Boyle W.J. Dunstan C.R. Hu S. Lacey D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of OP3-4 on TRANCE-induced bone resorption in vitro (Fig. 3C). Mature osteoclasts from neonatal mice were plated on dentin slices. The cells were cultured for 4 days with 200 ng/ml TRANCE alone or with 30 μm OP3-4 and TRANCE. As reported previously (35Jimi E. Akiyama S. Tsurukai T. Okahashi N. Kobayashi K. Udagawa N. Nishihara T. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 434-442PubMed Google Scholar, 36Burgess T.L. Qian Y. Kaufman S. Ring B.D. Van G.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), 200 ng/ml TRANCE stimulated bone resorption by nearly 3-fold. OP3-4 significantly blocked the increased bone resorption at 30 μm. The number of osteoclasts on the dentin slices were not changed by TRANCE alone or by OP3-4 plus TRANCE. Thus, interfering with TRANCE binding to RANK by the use of designed peptidomimetics was effective in inhibiting TRANCE-induced osteoclast formation in vitro. Down-modulation of NF-κB by OP3-4—NF-κB activation in osteoclast precursors has been implicated as a signaling pathway involved in the successful differentiation of precursors to mature osteoclasts (10Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB is controlled by an inhibitory subunit, IκB, which retains NF-κB in the cytoplasm. NF-κB activation requires the sequential activation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκB as well as consequent exposure of discreet nuclear localization signals on the NF-κB surface (37Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, TRANCE markedly induced the phosphorylation of IκB-α by 5 min, and a concurrent degradation of IκBα. In Fig. 4, OP3-4 inhibited TRANCE-stimulated NF-κB activation as measured by lack of IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation. OP3-4 thus inhibited TRANCE-induced osteoclast formation at least in part through suppressing the NF-κB pathway. Although TRANCE also activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (38Lee Z.H. Kwack K. Kim K.K. Lee S.H. Kim H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1536-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), OP3-4 did not exhibit an inhibitory or stimulatory effect on this pathway (data not shown). OP3-4 Protects Mice against Ovariectomy-associated Bone Loss—It is well known that ovariectomy results in reduced bone mineral density associated with loss of estrogen (39Sato M. Zeng G.Q. Turner C.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It was important to demonstrate that OP3-4 in vivo can protect against pathological decreases of bone density in OVX animals. The pQCT technique measu"

Several peptide library methods have been developed and widely used to study proteinprotein interactions. These approaches primarily rely on peptide or DNA sequencing to identify the peptide or consensus motif for binding and may prove too costly or difficult to accommodate high throughput applications. We report here an oriented peptide array library (OPAL) approach that should facilitate high throughput proteomic analysis of protein-protein interactions. OPAL integrates the principles of both the oriented peptide libraries and array technologies. Hundreds of pools of oriented peptide libraries are synthesized as amino acid scan arrays.

Signaling proteins are often composed of distinct protein domains or modules. Some of these serve as protein-protein interaction units, whereas others carry out enzymatic reactions (1Pawson T. Nash P. Science. 2003; 300: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the genetic codes of various organisms, including humans, has presented an increasing number of protein domain families with unknown functions. To understand how signaling proteins interact with each other and maintain the fidelity of signal transduction, it is critical to determine the specificities of these protein domains. Protein domains (such as SH2, 1The abbreviations used are: SH2/3, Src homology domain 2 or 3; OPAL, oriented peptide array library; pS, phosphoserine; pT, phosphothreonine; pY, phosphotyrosine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PKA, protein kinase A; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Kemptide, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly.1The abbreviations used are: SH2/3, Src homology domain 2 or 3; OPAL, oriented peptide array library; pS, phosphoserine; pT, phosphothreonine; pY, phosphotyrosine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PKA, protein kinase A; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Kemptide, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly. SH3, and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains) often mediate protein-protein interactions by recognizing short stretches of peptide sequences on target proteins (2Songyang Z. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3Yaffe M.B. Elia A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In the past several years, many combinatorial peptide library based approaches have been developed to analyze the binding or substrate specificities of protein domains (reviewed in Ref. 4Cabilly S. Methods in Molecular Biology: Combinatorial Peptide Library Protocols. Vol. 87. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1998: 87-97Google Scholar). These peptide libraries can be classified as either display or pool peptide libraries. The display libraries employ a variety of matrices for individual peptide presentation, including pin (5Maeji N.J. Bray A.M. Geysen H.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 134: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), phage (6Devlin J.J. Panganiban L.C. Devlin P.E.

Nature. 1991; 354: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar), DNA binding proteins (10Cull M.G. Miller J.F. Schatz P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), or ribosomes (11Mattheakis L.C. Bhatt R.R. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9022-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Following multiple rounds of affinity enrichment steps, the identities of the selected peptides can be ascertained by DNA or peptide sequencing (4Cabilly S. Methods in Molecular Biology: Combinatorial Peptide Library Protocols. Vol. 87. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1998: 87-97Google Scholar). Display peptide libraries generally require isolation and sequencing of individual peptides to decode a binding motif, which is time-consuming and costly, limiting it to low throughput applications. In contrast, the pool peptide libraries rely on the comparison of binding affinities of different pools of random peptides to obtain binding consensus motifs (12Houghten R.A. Pinilla C. Blondelle S.E. Appel J.R. Dooley C.T. Cuervo J.H. Nature. 1991; 354: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Thus, the sequences of individual bound peptides do not need to be resolved. A few years ago, we developed an oriented peptide library method to further simplify and facilitate screening (13Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). In this method, soluble pools of random peptides are oriented via a central “fixed” amino acid, which reduced the degeneracy of the library and prevented possible phase problems arisen from interacting residues being located at different positions on different peptides. Bound peptides or those modified by the protein of interest are then enriched and sequenced as a mixture to deconvolute the consensus motif in a statistical manner. The soluble oriented peptide library approach still depends on peptide sequencing, and a large amount of purified proteins (∼100 μg) are generally needed for the assay. In addition, the occasional incomplete cleavage of peptides during Edman degradation sequencing can result in a carryover of amino acids from one sequencing cycle to the next, thereby complicating the results. We report here an oriented peptide array library (OPAL) approach in which hundreds of pools of oriented peptide libraries are synthesized and arranged as scan arrays. We showed that OPAL could be used as a high throughput method to study the specificities of protein domains. GST Fusion Proteins—GST-GRB7 and GST-GRB10 fusion constructs were generated by ligating cDNA fragments encoding mouse GRB7 (amino acids 422–535) and GRB10 (amino acids 434–541) into pGEX-4T1 (14Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of expression vectors for GST-GRB2, SHC, and SHP-2 SH2 domains was reported previously (15Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo R.X. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously (13Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). Peptide Library Synthesis—The peptide libraries were synthesized on cellulose membrane using the ASP222 SPOT robot (16Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). An extra fine needle tip was used to achieve a density of ∼1600 peptides per SPOT membrane (8 ×12 cm). The estimated yield of peptide at each spot was ∼5 nmol. The following oriented peptide library arrays were synthesized for phosphorylation dependent interactions: AXXXX[pS/pT]XXXXA; AXXXX[pY]XXXXA; and AXXXXX[pS/pT][QDPF]XXXA; where X is a mixture of 19 amino acids (except Cys), pS is phosphoserine, pY is phosphotyrosine, pT is phosphothreonine, and the brackets ([/]) encase the amino acids that were preferred by the protein of interest. To generate oriented peptide library pools, each degenerated position was scanned with any of the 19 amino acids (excluding Cys). A library with the sequence AX1X1X1X1X1[S/T]X1X1X1X1A was synthesized for protein kinases, where X1 represents any amino acid but not Ser, Thr, and Cys. Ser and Thr are excluded at the degenerate X1 positions; thus, only the fixed Ser/Thr can be phosphorylated. To generate oriented peptide library pools, each degenerate position was substituted with any of the 20 amino acids. OPAL Analysis of Antibody and SH2 Domain Specificities—All steps were carried out at room temperature unless otherwise specified. The OPAL membrane was first blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h. GST fusion proteins (3 μg) were labeled with GSH-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) (0.6 μg) for 30 min and then added to the array membrane at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for 30 min (17Nollau P. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13531-13536Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The array membrane was subsequently washed three times with TBST for 10 min, and peptide spots that bound the domain of interest were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. To determine the specificities of antibodies, monoclonal antibodies MPM2 (1 μg/ml) (18Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), 3F3/2 (10 μg/ml) (19Campbell M.S. Gorbsky G.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and PY20 (1 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were first incubated with OPAL membranes for 30 min at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times with TBST for 15 min, probed with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase, and bound peptide spots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Kinase Assays—Kinase assays on membranes were performed as described (20Tegge W.J. Frank R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the OPAL membrane was blocked overnight in kinase buffer (62.5 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 20 mm MgAc2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3% bovine serum albumin). The next day, 2 μg of crude protein kinase A (Sigma) in kinase buffer containing 25 μm ATP and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added to the OPAL membrane and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. The membrane was then washed five times with 1 m NaCl and ten times with 5% phosphoric acid. 32P-labeled peptide spots were visualized and quantitated with PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). His6-Cdc15 was prepared in insect cells and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). Data Base Search—A weighed data matrix was first generated based on the OPAL analysis result. Data base search of PKA substrates was performed on Scansite (21Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The Oriented Peptide Array Library Strategy—The OPAL method involves synthesis and printing of oriented peptide libraries as spotted arrays on solid supports (Fig. 1). OPAL can be synthesized on solid phase and then cleaved to be spotted on array surfaces such as gold or glass slides. Alternatively, OPAL can be synthesized directly onto solid supports such as SPOT membranes (16Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). For example, an oriented library AXXXX[pS/pT]XXXXA was designed for proteins that recognize phosphoserine or phosphothreonine (Fig. 2A) in which pS and pT are fixed while X is random (any natural or amino acid except for Cys). Because there is no pS or pT in the random positions, pS/pT becomes the functional interaction center. The random positions are thus oriented with regard to their distance to the fixed pS/pT. The relative importance of different amino acids at any given position can then be addressed by using a scan library strategy (12Houghten R.A. Pinilla C. Blondelle S.E. Appel J.R. Dooley C.T. Cuervo J.H. Nature. 1991; 354: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 22Geysen H.M. Meloen R.H. Barteling S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3998-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). For instance, for Z in ZXXX(pS/pT)XXXX (i.e. position P – 4 N-terminal to the pS/pT), 19 pools of libraries were synthesized. Each pool had one of the 19 amino acids (except Cys) fixed at position Z and was spotted as a single spot on the array. As a result, each pool/spot can, in theory, contain a half-billion oriented peptides. A total of 152 (19 amino acids × 8 positions) pools of libraries were similarly spotted for the AXXXX[pS/pT]XXXXA library. The OPAL array essentially scans for the amino acids on the x axis and for the positions on the y axis. If a library pool at any given spot is preferred by the protein of interest, this mixture will be detected by antibody blotting and show up as a positive spot. Consequently, the specificity of a protein domain can be determined by reading the library array without complicated data manipulation.Fig. 2Preference of phospho-specific antibodies determined by OPAL. Design of the pS/pT-containing OPAL (A) and the specificities of monoclonal antibodies MPM-2 (B), 3f3/2 (C), and PY20 (D) were shown. Brackets ([/]) indicate preferred amino acids, whereas braces (/) indicate non-preferred amino acids. The pS/pT or pY oriented peptide library arrays were Western blotted with different antibodies. Blots were enlarged four times to facilitate viewing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Epitope Mapping of Phospho-specific Antibodies Using OPAL—The OPAL approach was first tested to determine the epitopes of phospho-specific antibodies such as MPM2. MPM2 has been shown to react with phosphoproteins in the M phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle (18Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). It recognizes phosphopeptides with the consensus motif [FYW][FW][FLI][pS/pT]P[ILVFM], as analyzed by the soluble oriented peptide library and expression cloning approaches (23Westendorf J.M. Rao P.N. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 24Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). We synthesized a pS/pT fixed OPAL (AXXXX[pS/pT]XXXXA, Fig. 2A) directly on SPOT membranes with a density (∼20 library pools/cm2) four times that of conventional SPOT arrays. The MPM2 antibody was incubated with this OPAL, and the MPM2-bound library spots were then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. As shown in Fig. 2B, stronger binding was observed at the P – 1 and P + 2 positions, where hydrophobic amino acids (mainly Ile, Leu, Val, and Phe) were selected. Hydrophobic amino acids were also preferred (but more weakly) by MPM2 at the P – 2 and P + 3 positions. At the P + 1 position, we found that Gly was also selected in addition to Pro, which was previously known to be there. Therefore, MPM2 prefers sequences containing the motif [FILV][pS/pT][PG][ILVF]. These findings are in good agreement with published data (23Westendorf J.M. Rao P.N. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 24Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) and indicate that the OPAL approach can be used to analyze the binding specificity of antibodies. We went on to study the epitopes of two additional phospho-specific antibodies, 3F3/2 and PY20 (Fig. 2, C and D). Monoclonal antibody 3F3/2 was originally developed against Xenopus egg extracts that had been supplemented with ATPγS (25Cyert M.S. Scherson T. Kirschner M.W. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It was later found to recognize an unknown kinetochore phospho-epitope (19Campbell M.S. Gorbsky G.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The OPAL analysis determined that 3F3/2 preferred the motif [FY]X[DE]X[pS/pT]X[DE] (Fig. 2C). This specificity is consistent with a known site recognized by 3F3/2 on human topoisomerase II (DFDEKTDDED) (26Daum J.R. Gorbsky G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30622-30629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the OPAL method can be applied to examine a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D, the monoclonal PY20 antibody recognized almost all the spots equally well except for Asp/Glu at positions P + 1 and P + 3, implying a broad specificity of this antibody. These results further validated the OPAL method. Determining the Binding Specificities of Protein Domains—A large number of both known and new domains that have been identified through the genome projects await the elucidation of their function and targets. Conventional peptide and oriented peptide library techniques have been used extensively to map the binding specificities of protein-protein interaction domains. In many cases, this has yielded novel insights into signaling interactions through data base searches for sequence motifs. In comparison, the OPAL technique holds a clear advantage over the conventional methods, as it requires no peptide sequencing or data manipulation. We decided to verify this with SH2 domains. SH2 domains are a large family of phosphotyrosine (pY)-dependent interaction modules that have been extensively studied. We started with the SH2 domain of the adaptor signaling molecule GRB2, because its specificity is known (27Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). As predicted, OPAL analysis indicated that the GRB2 SH2 domain recognized primarily Asn at the P + 2 position with little or no selectivity for residues N-terminal to the pY (Fig. 3A). Ile and Val or Leu residues were also selected at the P + 1 and P + 3 positions. This motif was determined in a single scan and is in perfect agreement with previous analyses of the GRB2 SH2 domain (13Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). We then went on to study three additional SH2 domains, namely SHP-2 C-terminal SH2 (28Freeman Jr., R.M. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11239-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 29Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), GRB7, and GRB10 (14Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). SHP-2, a phosphatase containing two SH2 domains, is an important regulator of cell proliferation and development (30Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). The N-terminal SH2 domain has been shown to select a pY[IV]X[FIV] motif (13Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar), but the preference of the C-terminal SH2 domain (CSH2) has not been systematically investigated. As shown in Fig. 3B, the SHP-2 CSH2 domain selected hydrophobic amino acids at the P + 1, P + 2, and P + 3 positions, similar to previous results (30Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our OPAL analysis showed that hydrophobic amino acids (particularly Ile, Leu, and Val) were also strongly preferred at the P – 3, P – 2, and P – 1 positions. Thus, the consensus motif for the SHP-2 CSH2 domain is [ILV][ILV][ILVFTY]pY[TILV][IL][ILVP]. This result suggests that the Ile, Leu, and Val residues flanking the phosphotyrosine may be necessary for SHP-CSH2 domain binding. It further offers an explanation for the confusion regarding the known in vivo binding sites of SHP-2, where Ile, Leu, and Val have been shown to be important for binding at either the P – 2, P + 2, or P + 3 positions (30Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). GRB7 and GRB10 are two closely related members of the GRB7 family proteins (14Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). They have been shown to interact with many receptor protein tyrosine kinases and mediate a variety of signaling activities (31Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6315-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, the specificities of their SH2 domains are largely unknown. Examination of both the GRB7 and the GRB10 SH2 domains using the phosphotyrosine OPAL revealed that both domains strongly selected Asn at the P + 2 position and preferred hydrophobic residues at the P + 3 position (Fig. 3, C and D). Therefore, the GRB7 and GRB10 SH2 domains shared the same specificity, recognizing the motif [FY]pY[ETYS]N[ILVPTYS]. It should be noted that the selection of Asn at P + 2 fits well with the known binding sites of these SH2 domains (31Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6315-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 32Thommes K. Lennartsson J. Carlberg M. Ronnstrand L. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The above studies demonstrate that OPAL is reliable at decoding protein-protein interaction domain specificities. Furthermore, it provides new insights into the function of domains with both known and unknown specificities. OPAL as a Tool to Study Substrate Specificities of Protein Kinases—The target specificities of protein kinase domains play a critical part in directing the flow of signal cascades. We therefore went on to investigate whether OPAL can be applied to the study of protein kinase specificity. For this purpose, an OPAL array with the sequence AX1X1X1X1X1[S/T]X1X1X1X1A was generated for protein Ser/Thr kinases where Ser and Thr are invariant and X1 is random (any natural or modified amino acid except for Ser, Thr, and Cys) (Fig. 4). The random position was subsequently substituted by one of the 20 natural amino acids, including Ser and Thr, and would become fixed. At any given spot, if a library pool was preferred by the kinase of interest, this mixture would be labeled in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The amount of 32P incorporation should then reflect the preference by the kinase for the fixed amino acid at this position. An added advantage of this design is the inclusion of Ser and Thr among the “scanned” amino acids, which should allow us to determine whether a kinase prefers Ser or Thr. We first examined the kinase domain specificity of PKA using the array. As shown in Fig. 4A, positions relative to Ser/Thr are indicated on the y axis. The amino acids fixed for each spot is indicated on the top x axis. At the P – 2 and P – 3 positions, Arg is preferred by PKA. At the P + 1 position, hydrophobic amino acids are generally favored by PKA, with Ile being the best favored. PKA also preferred Ser over Thr (see positions –1 to +4). These results correspond perfectly with the known specificity of PKA (RRXSI) and yield a clearer picture regarding PKA specificity than was previously obtained using the soluble oriented peptide library approach (33Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica W.H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the OPAL approach also identified novel sequence preferences of PKA. At the P + 2 site we found that PKA phosphorylated peptides with Cys and Asp 1.9- and 2.7-fold better, respectively, than those with other amino acids (e.g. Gly). To confirm this finding, several peptides that differed only at the P + 2 residue (ARRGSIGFI, ARRGSIDFI, and ARRGSICFI, with the P + 2 residue set in boldface) were synthesized based on the deduced PKA substrate specificity (Fig. 4A). Kinetic analyses demonstrated that the Kemptide-like peptide was phosphorylated by PKA with a Km of ∼23 μm (Table I). This value is similar to previously reported data using a LRRASLG peptide as the substrate (34Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Kreb E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison, substitution of P + 2 residue to Asp and Cys lowered the Km value to 8.8 and 9.1 μm, respectively, while improving the overall Kcat by 3.5- and 2-fold. These data are in good agreement with the array analysis result. Our analyses underscored, therefore, the simplicity and power of the OPAL approach to mapping the specificities of protein kinases.Table IPhosphorylation of substrate peptides by PKAPeptide sequenceKmRelative KcatμmARRGSIGFI231ARRGSIDFI8.83.5ARRGSICFI9.12 Open table in a new tab We also expanded the analysis of OPAL for determining protein kinase specificity to a kinase, budding yeast Cdc15, whose specificity had not been previously studied using conventional peptide library approaches. Cdc15 functions in the mitotic exit network (MEN) and acts directly upon another protein kinase, Dbf2, and its ortholog, Dbf20 (35Mah A.S. Jang J. Deshaies R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7325-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast to PKA, little or no selectively was observed for amino acids at the P – 5 to P – 1 positions or at the P + 1 position (Fig. 4B). However, arginine and lysine residues were strongly selected at positions P + 2, P + 3, and P + 4 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the only known targets of Cdc15 (35Mah A.S. Jang J. Deshaies R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7325-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), Thr-544 in Dbf2 and Thr-536 in Dbf20, are both compatible with the specificity determined by OPAL (TFRHR, where Thr is phosphorylated). Prediction of in Vivo Target Sites of Protein Kinases—In the era of genome-wide studies, the identification of recognition motifs should more readily allow the prediction of candidate targets. The OPAL array from Fig. 4A was quantitated using a PhosphorImager, and the data were plotted into bar graphs to compare the relative importance of amino acids at each scanned position (Fig. 5). These graphs again highlighted the requirements for Arg residues at positions P – 3 and P – 2 and hydrophobic amino acids at P + 1 for PKA substrates. Because the amount of 32P incorporation at each OPAL spot should correlate with the degree to which a given amino acid was preferred by the kinase examined, we reasoned that the relative values in Fig. 5 could be used as a Scansite matrix to search for potential in in vivo targets of PKA. Indeed, the resulting matrix successfully predicted PKA substrates in the Swiss-Prot data base (Table II). Among the top 25 candidates, 11 are known substrates of PKA, whereas other three have been shown to be regulated by the cAMP/PKA pathway. This result demonstrates that OPAL analyses can be coupled with the Scansite program to predict in vivo substrates of protein kinases.Table IIScansite-predicted PKA substrates in Swiss-ProtIDScoreProtein namePositionSequenceKnown PKA substrate10.0346Transcription factor ATF-7337TGGRRRRTVDEDPDEYes20.0388Protein phosphatase 2Cδ97RCCRRRSSVAFFAVCYes30.0415Sentrin-specific protease 3477SVDVRRRTITYFDSQ40.0432WD-repeat protein 6514VCGDRRGSVLLFPSR50.0486Na/H exchanger NHE-3555AEGERRGSLAFIRSPYes60.0489Proteoglycan protein HSPG4306LREGRRGSIQVDGEE70.0490Aurora-related kinase 339SPAMRRLTVDDFEIGYes80.04906-phosphofructo-2-kinase139TTRERRATIFNFGEQYes90.0517Ets-related protein ERM367PPYQRRGSLQLWQFLYes100.0517Ets translocation variant 1334PTYQRRGSLQLWQFLYes110.0525KIAA096177RDEKRRWTLDLESRY120.0527Tat interactive protein298NEIYRKGTISFFEID130.0538Type 1 InsP3 receptor1764RPSGRRESLTSFGNGYes140.0539Prostaglandin E2 receptor63CSAGRRSSLSLFHVL?150.0559Zinc finger protein 40778TSLSRRGSIDSPKSY160.0561TAIP-3124HSACRRFSLAEFAQE170.0563StARD7160YVYVRRYSVDQENNM?180.0565Retinal guanylyl cyclase 1724PALERRGTLAGDVFS?190.0571MAGUK p55376MPPFRRKTLVLIGAQ200.0572Hepatocyte nuclear factor 6440FMNARRRSLDKWQDEYes210.0572Conductance regulator CFTR737EPLERRLSLVPDSEQYes220.0573Receptor GPR39281SRTARRQTIIFLRLI230.0581RPTK C-ret696SSGARRPSLDSMENQYes240.0590CD43 antigen341EGSSRRPTLTTFFGR250.0591Acyltransferase GPAT110GWLARRLSYVLFIQE Open table in a new tab Perspective—Traditional SPOT and pool peptide library approaches may encounter the phasing problem. For a pentapeptide library (XXXXX), positions 1 to 5 can be scanned with any one of the 20 amino acids to make 100 (5 positions × 20 amino acids) library pools (36Dooley C.T. Houghten R.A. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In this library, if a DR motif is preferred by the protein, pool libraries such as DRXXX, XDRXX, XXDRX, or XXXDR can all be positively selected. The recognition motif will then become difficult to interpret. Similarly, screening of pool libraries employed the iterative approach, and multiple rounds of library synthesis and screening are required (12Houghten R.A. Pinilla C. Blondelle S.E. Appel J.R. Dooley C.T. Cuervo J.H. Nature. 1991; 354: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 20Tegge W.J. Frank R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar, 37Geysen H.M. Rodda S.J. Mason T.J. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). For example, sub-libraries (XXX12XXX) that contain two defined amino acids at positions 1 and 2 flanked by degenerate residues X (a mixture of 20 amino acids) are synthesized as arrays on cellulose. The best amino acids at positions 1 and 2 (B1B2) from the first round of screening are then incorporated into the next library synthesis (e.g. XXXB1B212X). In contrast, peptide arrays of OPAL are oriented via a central amino acid for interactions. This not only allows convenient data interpretation but also generates a weighed data set that can be used to search potential targets in the data base. In this report, we have demonstrated that the OPAL method is a highly efficient and informative tool for studying protein-protein interactions. Compared with conventional peptide library methods, several advantages of OPAL analysis stand out. For example, data interpretation becomes easier as the need for peptide sequencing is eliminated and the results are “read” directly from the array. The amount of proteins required for analysis is also far less than that needed for soluble oriented libraries. In particular, if peptides are printed as microarrays on glass slides, the materials used will be minimal. For analyzing protein module binding, the arrays can be reused multiple times. Furthermore, by improving synthesis conditions, we were able to synthesize a large number of arrays within a short time (>8,000 peptide pools (12–15-mer) in a week). Therefore, it should be easier to adopt OPAL for high throughput screening of binding or enzymatic specificities of protein domains in the human genome.

Disulfide bonds were introduced into the β3 integrin I-like domain to lock its β6-α7 loop and α7-helix in two distinct conformations. Soluble ligand binding, ligand mimetic mAb binding and cell adhesion studies showed that disulfide-bonded receptor αIIbβ3T329C/A347C was locked in a low affinity state, and dithiothreitol treatment restored the capability of being activated to high affinity binding; by contrast, disulfide-bonded αIIbβ3V332C/M335C was locked in a high affinity state. The results suggest that activation of the β subunit I-like domain is analogous to that of the α subunit I domain, i.e. that axial movement in the C-terminal direction of the α7-helix is linked to rearrangement of the I-like domain metal ion-dependent adhesion site into a high affinity conformation.

Integrins are large heterodimeric adhesion molecules that convey signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6950) Google Scholar, 2Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Both integrin subunits are type I transmembrane proteins with large extracellular domains. Priming of the extracellular domain for ligand binding (i.e. increasing its affinity for ligand) is initiated by moving apart the α and β subunit cytoplasmic domains and probably separation of the transmembrane domains as well (3Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Conversely, binding of ligand can also initiate cytoplasmic domain separation (3Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar); the equilibria relating conformational change and ligand binding are linked (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The low affinity integrin conformation is highly bent, with the headpiece that contains the ligand binding domains in an extensive interface with the tailpiece that contains the α and β subunit legs (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 5Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L.

After priming or ligand binding, a switchblade-like opening extends the headpiece away from the membrane (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 7Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). In extended integrins, two conformations of the headpiece are seen. The open conformation of the headpiece (Fig. 1C) is present when ligand is bound and differs from the closed conformation (Fig. 1B) in the presence of an obtuse angle between the β-subunit hybrid and I-like domains (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 8Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A. Walz T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Recently, we mutationally introduced N-glycosylation sites into the interface of the hybrid and I-like domains to stabilize the open headpiece. The wedged-open mutants exhibited constitutively high affinity for ligand and adopted an extended conformation (9Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the change in affinity at the ligand binding site in the I-like domain around its metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) 1The abbreviations used are: MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; biotin-BMCC, 1-biotinamido-4 (4′-[maleimodoethyl-cyclohexane]-carboxamido)butane; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HBS, Hepes-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. is communicated to the interface with the hybrid domain on the opposite end of the I-like domain by axial displacement in the C-terminal direction of the I-like domain α7-helix (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 8Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A. Walz T.

A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). The β-subunit I-like domain is inserted in the hybrid domain, and thus these domains have two interconnections. A piston-like movement at the I-like α7-helix connection and pivoting about the other connection would yield a swing at the I-like-hybrid domain interface approximating that seen in electron microscopy studies (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 8Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A. Walz T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). One basis for proposing this mechanism for communicating a change in affinity to the I-like domain MIDAS is that the structurally homologous I domain inserted in some integrin α subunits undergoes a similar piston-like movement of its C-terminal α7-helix, which regulates the affinity of its MIDAS for ligand (2Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). There is controversy concerning this proposed mechanism. Soaking of a ligand-mimetic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide into integrin αVβ3 crystals, in which αVβ3 was constrained in the bent conformation by lattice contacts, induced β6-α7 loop and α1-helix movements, but not α7-helix displacement (5Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). It was therefore suggested that α I and β I-like domains are activated by distinct mechanisms. Demonstration of movement of an epitope in the α1-helix was used to support the hypothesis that the mechanism of I-like domain activation differs from that of the I domain (10Mould A.P. Askari J.A.

On the other hand, conformational change at this region would not contradict C-terminal α7-helix movement, and the mutation L358A in the α7-helix of the β1 I-like domain causes activation, supporting some type of conformational change around the α7-helix upon ligand binding (11Mould A.P.

Furthermore, solution x-ray scattering studies and exposure of epitopes on the inner side of the hybrid domain in the presence of ligand (11Mould A.P. Barton S.J. Askari J.A. McEwan P.A. Buckley P.A.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Here, we directly test the hypothesis that specific rearrangements occur in the β6-α7 loop and α7-helix of β I-like domains that are structurally analogous to those that occur in α I domains and are linked to integrin activation. Disulfide bonds have previously been introduced into α I domains to constrain the β6-α7 loop and α7-helix. The αL (13Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 2002; 99: 16737-16741Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) I domains have been locked into closed, intermediate, or open conformers with low, intermediate, or high affinity for ligand, respectively. Crystal structure studies on the mutant αL I domains confirmed alterations in the β6-α7 loop corresponding to α7-helix displacements of one and two turns of helix in the intermediate and open conformations, respectively (16Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.-D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The disulfide-constrained, high affinity, open conformation of the αL I domain corresponds precisely in the critical β6-α7 loop and MIDAS loops to the open conformation of the wild-type α2 and αM I domains seen when this conformation was stabilized in crystals by ligand or ligand-like lattice contacts (18Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 19Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The studies reported here on the β I-like domain show that disulfide bonds mutationally introduced into the β6/α7 region lock integrins that lack I domains into two distinct affinity states. The data uniquely support the proposal that downward movement of the α7-helix induces I-like domain activation and demonstrate that α I and β I-like domains are activated by structurally analogous mechanisms. High Affinity I-like Domain Model—The model was built with the Segmod module (20Levitt M. J. Mol.

This corresponded to a 7-residue, 2-turn displacement of the α7-helix along its helical axis; residues 334–339 were left nontemplated. Plasmid Construction, Transient Transfection, and Immunoprecipitation—Plasmids coding for full-length human αIIb and β3 were subcloned into pEF/V5-HisA or pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) as described previously (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Mutants were made using site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and DNA sequences were confirmed before being transfected into 293T cells using calcium phosphate precipitates (21DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine as described (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A.

Lysates in 20 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (TBS), supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-β3 mAb AP3 and protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h and subjected to nonreducing SDS 7.5% PAGE and fluorography (22Huang C.

Samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with 2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin at 20 °C for 30 min or with 2 μg/ml anti-myc antibody (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 20 °C, followed by washing and 2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse-IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 30 min at 20 °C, and then detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences). BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) was exposed for about 20 s. The film was scanned using DUOSCAN 1200 (Agfa, Mortsel, Belgium), and data were saved as a tiff file. NIH Image 1.62 (NIMH, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to determine the intensity of each band within identical rectangular areas. After subtracting the intensity of mock transfectants in the same areas, the ratio of the intensity of BMCC and myc bands was determined. Two-color Ligand Binding Assay on 293T Transfectants—Binding of FITC-labeled human fibrinogen was determined as described (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Briefly, transiently transfected 293T cells in 20 mm Hepes-buffered saline (pH 7.4) (HBS) supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose and 1% BSA were incubated with 60 μg/ml fluorescein-labeled fibrinogen in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm Ca2+, or 1 mm Ca2+ plus 10 μg/ml PT25-2 mAb at 20 °C for 30 min, and then 10 μg/ml Cy3-labeled mAb AP3 was added, and cells were incubated on ice for another 30 min before being subjected to flow cytometry. Fibrinogen binding was expressed as a percentage of the mean fluorescence intensity of FITC-fibrinogen relative to that of staining with AP3 mAb. Expression and Ligand Binding Activity of αIIbβ3 on CHO-K1 Transfectants—The plasmids described above coding for αIIb and β3 were introduced into CHO-K1 cells using calcium phosphate precipitates (21DuBridge R.B.

After 2 weeks, the cells were stained with AP3 mAb and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting to obtain lines expressing the desired level of αIIbβ3. Prior to ligand binding, transfected cells were suspended in HBS supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose and 1% BSA and incubated with 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm Ca2+, or 1 mm Ca2+ plus 10 μg/ml PT25-2, with or without 5 mm DTT, at 20 °C for 30 min. Staining with fluorescein-labeled human fibrinogen and the ligand mimetic PAC-1 mAb (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) was measured as described (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Cell Adhesion to Immobilized Fibrinogen—Cell adhesion was assayed as described (23Lu C. Springer T.A. J.

Briefly, transfected CHO-K1 cells were labeled with 2′,7′-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and suspended to 106/ml in HBS supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose, 1% BSA, and either 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm Ca2+, or 5 mm DTT plus 5 mm Ca2+. Cell suspensions were incubated in wells that had been coated with different concentrations of fibrinogen followed by blocking with 1% BSA. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, unbound cells were washed off after three resuspensions with a multichannel pipette. The fluorescence of input cells and bound cells in each well was quantitated on a fluorescent concentration analyzer (Idexx, Westbrook, ME). Bound cells were expressed as a percentage of total input cells. LIBS Expression—Anti-LIBS mAbs LIBS-1, LIBS-6, and PMI-1 were kind gifts of M. H. Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). LIBS expression was measured as described (9Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing wild type or mutant αIIbβ3 in HBS supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose and 1% BSA were incubated under different conditions as indicated in the legend to Fig. 5 for 30 min at 20 °C. LIBS mAbs were added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, and cells were incubated on ice for another 30 min before staining with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and flow cytometry. Design of I-like Domains Locked in Low Affinity and High Affinity Conformations—We hypothesized that in both the unliganded and liganded αVβ3 structures (5Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 6Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), the C-terminal α7-helix of the β3 I-like domain is in a position stabilizing a closed, low affinity conformation; therefore, these structures were used to design low affinity mutants. An open, high affinity conformation was modeled assuming that the α7-helix was displaced in the C-terminal axial direction by two α-helical turns (see “Materials and Methods”). The distance between Cβ atoms of Thr329 and Ala347 in the unliganded and RGD-liganded αVβ3 structures is 4.4 and 4.9 Å, respectively, whereas it is 9.6 Å in the hypothesized high affinity model. Therefore, the mutant β3T329C/A347C was expected to form a disulfide bond in the low but not the high affinity conformation and to be stabilized in the low affinity, closed conformation (Fig. 1, D and F). On the other hand, the distance between the Cβ atoms of Val332 and Met335 in the unliganded and RGD-liganded αVβ3 structures is 10.0 and 8.3 Å, respectively, whereas it is 3.7 Å in the hypothesized high affinity model. Therefore, the mutant β3V332C/M335C was expected to form a disulfide bond in the high but not the low affinity conformation (Fig. 1, E and G) and to be stabilized in the high affinity, open conformation. Expression of Wild Type and Mutant αIIbβ3 Receptors and Formation of Disulfide Bonds—Wild type and mutant β3 subunits were co-transfected with wild type αIIb in 293T cells and subjected to immunostaining flow cytometry (Fig. 2, A and B). The wild type and mutant receptors were recognized equally well by mAb to epitopes constitutively present on the αIIb and β3 subunits, including AP3 (anti-β3), 10E5 (anti-αIIb), HA5 (anti-αIIb), and AP2 (anti-αIIbβ3 complex-specific) (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the two mutant receptors adopted a native fold on the cell surface. However, the mutant β3V332C/M335C receptor was recognized weakly by anti-β3 mAb 7E3 (Fig. 2B). The 7E3 mAb recognizes residues in the specificity-determining, β2-β3 loop near the β3 I-like MIDAS (24Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Since the single cysteine mutants β3V332C and β3M335C were recognized by 7E3 (Fig. 2B), the conformational change induced by the disulfide bond formed between V332C and M335C (see below) appears to diminish the 7E3 epitope. By contrast, mutant β3T329C/A347C was well recognized by 7E3 (data not shown) (see Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Expression and ligand binding activity of mutant αIIbβ3 integrins on CHO-K1 transfectants. A, immunofluorescent staining. Staining of specific transfectants (thick lines) is compared with mock transfectants (thin lines). B and C, soluble fibrinogen (B) and PAC-1 mAb (C) binding. Cells were incubated with ligands in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Ca2+ plus 10 μg/ml PT25-2 mAb, 5 mm Ca2+ plus 5 mm DTT, or 1 mm Ca2+ plus 10 μg/ml PT25-2 and 5 mm DTT at room temperature for 30 min. Binding was determined as described under “Materials and Methods” as mean fluorescence intensity. D, adhesion of CHO transfectants in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm DTT plus 5 mm Ca2+ to surfaces coated with fibrinogen at the indicated concentrations. Binding of fluorescently labeled transfectants was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are representative of three independent experiments, each in quadruplicate. S.D. values were on average 1.3% and always less than 4.6%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nonreducing SDS-PAGE of 35S-labeled, immunoprecipitated receptors showed that the αIIb subunits migrated similarly (Fig. 2C), whereas the mutant β3T329C/A347C subunits (Fig. 2C, lanes 6 and 7) migrated slightly faster than wild type β3 (Fig. 2C, lane 5). By contrast, all β3 single cysteine mutants migrated similarly to wild-type β3 (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–4). In general, disulfide bonds increase the mobility of proteins in SDS-PAGE, and these results suggest that the cysteines introduced into the β3T329C/A347C and β3V332C/M335C and β3V332C/M335C mutants form a disulfide bond. To confirm disulfide bond formation, free sulfhydryls were labeled with the maleimide-containing reagent, biotin-BMCC. The idea was that introducing a single cysteine should increase labeling, whereas introducing two cysteines would not increase labeling if they formed a disulfide bond. Transfectants were treated with biotin-BMCC, lysed, immunoprecipitated with AP3 mAb to αIIbβ3, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotting with avidin (Fig. 2D). The β3 subunit was fused at its C terminus to a myc tag, and blotting with a myc mAb was used as a control for β3 loading. Whereas wild-type αIIbβ3 showed almost no biotin labeling (Fig. 2D, lane 2), the αIIbβ3 single cysteine mutants V332C and M335C showed marked labeling (Fig. 2D, lanes 4 and 6). The cysteines introduced in the V332C/M335C and T329C/A347C mutants clearly formed disulfides, because labeling was at the same level as the wild type (Fig. 2D, lanes 5 and 7), whereas it would have been twice that of the single cysteine mutants if disulfides had not formed. To estimate the number of free cysteines per β3 subunit, the ratio of the intensity of avidin binding to that of anti-myc binding was determined. As an additional control, wild-type αIIbβ3 on the transfectants was treated with 5 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C. The avidin/anti-myc ratios for the wild type, wild type with DTT treatment, β3V332C, β3V332C/M335C, β3M335C, and β3T329C/A347C subunits were 0.05, 0.82, 0.20, 0.04, 0.19, and 0.04, respectively. If β3V332C is assumed to have one additional free cysteine sulfhydryl compared with wild type, then β3M335C has 1.0 additional free cysteine, β3V332C/M335C also and β3T329C/A347 have no additional free β3 cysteines, and wild type αIIbβ3 treated with DTT has 5.2 free cysteines. By contrast, there are a total of 54 cysteines in wild type β3. Ligand Binding Properties of 293T Transfectants with Disulfide-locked Receptors—Binding to soluble fibrinogen was first examined using two-color flow cytometry (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) in transiently transfected 293T cells, in which wild type αIIbβ3 basally has low affinity for ligand. Wild type αIIbβ3 bound fibrinogen when stimulated with the activating mAb PT25-2 but not basally in Ca2+ (Fig. 3A). Each of the four single cysteine mutants behaved similarly to the wild type receptor (Fig. 3A). By contrast, the putative locked closed, double cysteine mutant αIIbβ3T329C/A347C did not bind soluble fibrinogen even in the presence of PT25-2 (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the putative locked open mutant αIIb β3V332C/M335C bound soluble fibrinogen even in Ca2+, and the addition of PT25-2 mAb did not further increase binding (Fig. 3A). Constitutive binding in Ca2+ by the αIIbβ3V332C/M335C mutant was abolished by two blocking αIIb mAbs, HA5 and 10E5, but neither blocked nor further activated by the activating β3 mAb AP5 (Fig. 3B), confirming that the high affinity binding of the transfected cells was specific. Functional Properties of Mutant Receptors in CHO-K1 Transfectants—To further examine the disulfide-locked receptors, stable CHO-K1 transfectants were established, and clones were selected that expressed similar quantities of wild-type αIIbβ3T329C/A347C, αIIbβ3, and αIIbβ3V332C/M335C. The transfectants were recognized equally well by a panel of mAb to constitutively expressed αIIb, β3, and αIIbβ3 epitopes, with the exception of 7E3 mAb (Fig. 4A). Mutant αIIbβ3V332C/M335C blunted but did not completely abolish the binding of 7E3. CHO-K1 transfectants expressing the wild type receptor did not bind soluble fibrinogen or PAC-1 in Ca2+ but bound when stimulated by activating mAb PT25-2 (Fig. 4, B and C). Treatment with 5 mm DTT at 20 °C for 30 min slightly increased ligand binding to wild type αIIbβ3 in Ca2+, but this binding was much less than that seen with PT25-2 mAb with or without DTT treatment. Mutant αIIbβ3T329C/A347C did not bind fibrinogen or PAC-1 basally, and binding was not stimulatable with PT25-2. However, DTT treatment restored the ability of PT25-2 to stimulate fibrinogen and PAC-1 binding (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that the Cys329–Cys347 disulfide bond locked the I-like domain in the closed conformation, and this constraint was released by DTT treatment. By contrast, mutant αIIbβ3V332C/M335C showed high binding to soluble fibrinogen and PAC-1, and binding was not further increased by activation. DTT treatment did not reduce fibrinogen or PAC-1 binding of the αIIbβ3V332C/M335C mutant in Ca2+, probably because the Cys332–Cys335 disulfide bond was stable to reduction under nondenaturing conditions like the vast majority of the native disulfides in β3. The affinity state of disulfide-bonded mutants was further tested in cell adhesion assays on immobilized fibrinogen. High affinity is required for binding to soluble ligand or ligand mimetic mAbs. In contrast, wild type αIIbβ3 can mediate cell adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen in the absence of activation, as long as high coating concentrations above 1 μg/ml of fibrinogen are used (Fig. 4D), consistent with our previous report (9Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). DTT treatment slightly increased the avidity of the wild type receptor, as shown by a shift in the dose-response curve. In contrast, mutant αIIbβ3T329C/A347C did not adhere even at the highest coating concentration of fibrinogen, whereas DTT treatment yielded binding of αIIbβ3T329C/A347C indistinguishable from that of the DTT-treated wild type receptor, suggesting that DTT treatment could release the disulfide bond, which lock"
https://openalex.org/W2063986170,"An inwardly rectifying anion channel in malaria-infected red blood cells has been proposed to function as the “new permeation pathway” for parasite nutrient acquisition. As the channel shares several properties with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), we tested their interrelationship by whole-cell current measurements in Plasmodium falciparum-infected and uninfected red blood cells from control and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. A CFTR-like linear chloride conductance as well as a malaria parasite-induced and a shrinkage-activated endogenous inwardly rectifying chloride conductance with properties identical to the malaria-induced channel were all found to be defective in CF erythrocytes. Surprisingly, the absence of the inwardly rectifying chloride conductance in CF erythrocytes had no gross effect on in vitro parasite growth or new permeation pathway activity, supporting an argument against a close association between the Plasmodium-activated chloride channel and the new permeation pathway. The functional expression of CFTR in red blood cells opens new perspectives to exploit the erythrocyte as a readily available cell type in electrophysiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic studies of CF.

The functional expression of CFTR in red blood cells opens new perspectives to exploit the erythrocyte as a readily available cell type in electrophysiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic studies of CF. Intraerythrocytic development of malaria parasites leads to increased nutrient uptake through parasite-induced new permeation pathways (1Kirk K. Physiol.

Symp. 1999; 226: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports demonstrated that the new permeation pathways show functional characteristics of a chloride channel (1Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). More recent data suggested that a small conductance chloride channel, as measured with the on-cell patch clamp configuration, accounts for the increased uptake of nutrients into infected red blood cells and that thus this channel qualifies as a prime target for pharmacotherapy (6Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The channel exhibits voltage-dependent gating, showing higher open probability at negative membrane potential, which is visible in the whole-cell patch clamp configuration as a strong inwardly rectifying chloride current. The pharmacological profile of this channel shows a striking resemblance to that of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), 1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CF, cystic fibrosis; RT, reverse transcriptase; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; I-V, current-voltage; PKA, protein kinase A; PKI, PKA inhibitor.1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CF, cystic fibrosis; RT, reverse transcriptase; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; I-V, current-voltage; PKA, protein kinase A; PKI, PKA inhibitor. a cAMP-regulated chloride channel that is mutated in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) (7Anderson M.P.

Cell. 1992; 68: 809-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Functional expression of CFTR in red blood cells is suggested also by the failure of CF erythrocytes to perform deformation-induced and cAMP-induced ATP release (9Sprague R.S. Ellsworth M.L. Stephenson A.H. Lonigro A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1158-C1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sprague R.S. Ellsworth M.L. Stephenson A.H. Kleinhenz M.E. Lonigro A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1726-H1732PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, direct evidence in support of this concept was obtained by patch clamp measurements of whole-cell chloride currents in CF and non-CF red blood cells. The CF defect in endogenous and parasite-induced chloride conductances was exploited to evaluate the possible contribution of red blood cell chloride channels to the new permeation pathway. Moreover, the lack of functional chloride channels in CF red blood cells offered us the unique possibility to study the putative obligatory role of the Plasmodium-activated chloride current in the growth and survival of Plasmodium falciparum. RT-PCR—For RT-PCR, RNA was isolated from human erythroblasts obtained by bone marrow puncture (11Von Lindern M. Zauner W. Mellitzer G. Steinlein P. Fritsch G. Huber K. Löwenberg B. Beug H. Blood. 1999; 94: 550-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared from 2 μg of total RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For amplification of CFTR, PCR reactions were performed using platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) with primers 5′-AGGGGAAGTCACCAAAGCAGTACAGC-3′ (sense; position 402–427 in sequence NM_000492 (GenBank™/EBI accession number); exon 4) and 5′-GCGCAGAACAATGCAGAATGAGATG-3′ (antisense; position 1173–1149; exon 8). The thermocycler profile was as follows: 96 °C for 4 min followed by 11 cycles (1 min at 68 °C, 2 min at 68 °C, 1 min 45 s at 72 °C) with annealing at 68 °C, 11 cycles with annealing at 64 °C, 11 cycles with annealing at 60 °C, 17 cycles with annealing at 56 °C, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The high number of cycles was necessary due to very low amounts of CFTR mRNA. The amount of cDNA used in each reaction (1–2 μl) was normalized with respect to the amount of actin cDNA by performing PCR on serial dilutions of cDNA using primers specific for β-actin, 5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′ (antisense), under conditions similar to those used for the CFTR PCR but using a 25-cycle PCR program. Relative expression levels were compared with expression in T84 cells (which have high CFTR expression) by using dilutions (1000–100,000-fold) of cDNA from T84 cells. Although CFTR expression in erythroblasts was at least 1000-fold lower than in T84 cells, the product was detected in the majority of PCR reactions (n = 5–8 for each cDNA sample) and was always absent in a –RT control (n = 5), and the identity of the 771-bp PCR product was verified by sequencing using an ABI377 automated sequencer. Plasmodium Culture—P. falciparum strains FCR3 (Gambian origin) and NF54 (unknown origin) were cultured essentially by the method of Trager and Jensen (12Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6122) Google Scholar) in standard culture medium. Parasitemia was determined by evaluation of Giemsa-stained thin films. When needed, parasite cultures were synchronized using alanine treatment (13Braun-Breton C. Rosenberry T.L. da Silva L.P. Nature. 1988; 332: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Invasion—Nycodenz-purified mature stages-infected red blood cells at 3% hematocrit were mixed with red blood cell suspensions of various origins at a ratio of 1:100. Triplicate 5-ml cultures of each red blood cell suspension were cultivated overnight to allow reinvasion. A sample of 150 μl from each of the cultures was then transferred to a 96-well plate, and 25 μl of [3H]hypoxanthine (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Irvine, CA) in standard culture medium (1 μCi) was added to each of the wells. Cultures were incubated for another 22.5 h and harvested using a Titertek cell harvester (ICN Biomedicals Inc.), and incorporation of radiolabel was determined by liquid scintillation counting using a Top-Count NXT (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as a measure of parasite viability and invasion rate. The original 5-ml cultures were maintained for 7 days with periodic addition of fresh red blood cells and culture medium (identical treatment for all cultures), and parasitemia was regularly determined. Patch Clamp—Red blood cells were bathed in 110 mm CsCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 3.5 mm sodium gluconate, 12 mm HEPES, 8 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 10 mm dextrose. In the shrinkage experiments the bathing solution contained an additional 300 mm mannitol. The intracellular pipette solution contained 110 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na2ATP, 50 mm mannitol (pH 7.4). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Clark GC150T-10) and had a resistance of 8–12 megohms. All experiments were done with 2 mm ATP in the pipette unless stated otherwise. Where stated, G449 (10 μg/ml IgG), CF-2 (0.1 mg/ml, preincubated with G449 for 5 min at room temperature), protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor (PKI; 10 μm), or acid phosphatase (30 units/ml) was added to the pipette. Forskolin (1 μm), niflumic acid (100 μm), furosemide (100 μm), 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS; 250 μm), or glibenclamide (100 μm) was added to the bathing solution. Cell shrinkage was triggered by increasing the osmolarity of the bath by addition of 300 mm mannitol to the standard bathing solution following seal formation. In the figures, error bars indicate S.E., and the number of individuals tested is given between parentheses. Voltage steps from –120 to +120 mV were applied in 30-mV increments; holding potential was set at 0 mV. For command pulse control, data acquisition, and analysis, pCLAMP 6 software (Axon instruments Inc., Forester City, CA) was used. Isotonic Lysis—Synchronized infected cells (enriched to a parasitemia of 5–10%) from non-CF and CFTRΔPhe-508/ΔPhe-508 patients (n = 4 different persons) were bathed in an isotonic solution containing 300 mm glucose, 150 mm choline chloride, or 300 mm alanine. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and cell lysis due to the passive movement of the osmolyte into the cells was measured spectrophotometrically at 580 nm. Results are plotted as percentage compared with total lysis after 2 h of incubation in 300 mm choline chloride in the absence of inhibitors. Uninfected red blood cells did not undergo lysis in response to isosmotic choline or alanine. In case of glucose, the lytic response resulting from glucose uptake through the endogenous glucose carrier in uninfected red blood cells was subtracted. To characterize the role of the malaria-induced chloride channel activity in parasite blood stage development, we performed whole-cell patch clamp experiments with control red blood cells and red blood cells from CF patients, both uninfected and infected with P. falciparum. As a first step, to identify CFTR in red blood cells, we studied uninfected red blood cells from healthy individuals and homozygous ΔPhe-508 patients, the most common CFTR mutation in the Caucasian population. Red blood cells were freshly isolated from heparinized blood samples and were bathed at 37 °C in a 110 mm symmetrical CsCl solution. In the presence of ATP in the pipette solution, an average whole-cell chloride conductance of 873 ± 82 pS (n = 15 different individuals) was observed in red blood cells from healthy volunteers (Fig. 1A), which was virtually absent from CF red blood cells (131 ± 19 pS, n = 8 different CF (CFTRΔPhe-508/ΔPhe-508) patients) (Fig. 1B). This basal current displayed a linear I-V relationship with a reversal potential close to 0 mV (Fig. 1C) and was virtually absent when ATP was omitted from the pipette (97 ± 41 pS, n = 4 healthy individuals) (Fig. 1D). The anion permeability of this pathway, determined by the observed shift in reversal potential (6Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), showed a selectivity sequence of Br– > Cl– > I–. The current was slightly stimulated upon addition of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (1 μm) to the bath (Fig. 1D) and was inhibited by the chloride channel inhibitors niflumic acid (100 μm) and glibenclamide (100 μm) (14Kirk K. Horner H.A. Spillett D.J. Elford B.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the nonspecific chloride channel inhibitor DIDS (250 μm), as well as the new permeation pathway-inhibiting drug furosemide (100 μm) (1Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 6Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 15Kutner S. Baruch D. Ginsburg H. Cabantchik Z.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 687: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), had no influence on this basal current. Addition of PKI to the pipette, or addition of the polyclonal antibody G449, raised against the CF-2 peptide (a cloned R-domain peptide of CFTR (residues 645–835)) (16Picciotto M.R. Cohn J.A. Bertuzzi G. Greenhard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12742-12752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the cytoplasmatic side of the erythrocyte, resulted in strong inhibition, approaching the low current level seen in CF red blood cells. The latter effect was abolished by adding the CF-2 peptide as competitor (Fig. 1D), demonstrating the specificity of the inhibitory effect of the antibody. Collectively, these electrophysiological data, in particular the apparent dependence of the chloride conductance on cytoplasmatic ATP and PKA, its inhibition by anti-CFTR antibody, and its absence from CF red blood cells, strongly support the notion that CFTR chloride channels are present in normal red blood cells and are tonically active under our experimental conditions. This concept is strengthened further by the finding, on the basis of RT-PCR, of low levels of CFTR mRNA in nucleated precursor cells, the erythroblasts, isolated from bone marrow punctures from healthy individuals (Fig. 1E) and by the recent demonstration of a 15-pS, PKA/ATP-activated linear anion conductance in uninfected non-CF red blood cells (17Egée S. Lapaix F. Decherf G. Staines H.M. Ellory J.C. Doerig C. Thomas S.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 542: 795-801Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data for the first time indicate a functional expression of CFTR in control but not in CFTRΔPhe-508/ΔPhe-508 red blood cells. Deformation of the erythrocytes by osmotic shrinkage, induced by raising the osmolarity from the bath from 300 to 600 mosm by increasing the mannitol concentration, resulted in the appearance of an additional chloride conductance (Fig. 2A) of similar magnitude and with an identical I-V relationship (Fig. 2C), pharmacological profile (Fig. 2D), and anion selectivity sequence (I– > Br– > Cl–) to that described for the P. falciparum-induced inwardly rectifying chloride current (6Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Similar to the CFTR-like current, this conductance was dependent on ATP and showed inhibition with all CFTR inhibitors tested earlier, including the G449 anti-CFTR antibody and PKI (Fig. 2D). However, it strikingly differed from the CFTR-like current in its sensitivity to furosemide, a potent inhibitor of the new permeation pathway and of the Plasmodium-activated chloride conductance (6Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The furosemide inhibition appeared unrelated to its known action as an inhibitor of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter because bumetanide (up to 250 μm), a more potent Na-K-Cl cotransporter inhibitor, was unable to block the chloride current (data not shown). Interestingly this shrinkage-induced, inwardly rectifying chloride current was likewise deficient in shrunken red blood cells from CF patients (Fig. 2B), suggesting a close functional relationship with the CFTR chloride channel. Notably, basal potassium conductances monitored by whole-cell patch-clamping in potassium gluconate-containing medium were not different between control and CF red blood cells (results not shown), arguing against a general nonspecific effect of the CF condition on ion permeabilities of the red blood cell membrane. To directly compare the pharmacological profiles of the shrinkage-induced and the malaria-induced chloride channels, we performed patch clamp experiments on P. falciparum trophozoite-infected red blood cells from healthy individuals at 0.5–5% parasitemia. Consistent with the study by Desai et al. (6Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), infection resulted in the appearance of an inwardly rectifying chloride current that was fully active under isosmotic conditions (Fig. 3A). The magnitude and I-V relationship (Fig. 3C) of this malaria-induced chloride conductance were identical to the shrinkage-activated, endogenous chloride conductance. Moreover, osmotic shrinkage of infected red blood cells did not further enhance the chloride conductance of the plasma membrane (Fig. 3D), indicating that the malaria-induced current and the cell shrinkage-induced endogenous current are manifestations of the same, inwardly rectifying chloride channel. However, the pharmacological profile (Fig. 3E), although largely identical to that of the shrinkage-activated chloride conductance (Fig. 2D), indicated that the conductances do differ in at least three important aspects; whereas shrinkage activation of the chloride channel is dependent on ATP and PKA and inhibited by anti-CFTR antibody, the P. falciparum-activated channel functions in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3E) (6Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and is insensitive to PKI and G449 antibody (Fig. 3E). These findings suggest that the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the R-domain of CFTR by PKA is necessary for shrinkage activation of the inwardly rectifying chloride channel but not for P. falciparum activation of the channel. Alternatively, infection of red blood cells with P. falciparum could result in a sustained phosphorylated status of CFTR, possibly induced by excessive production of endogenous Plasmodium PKA (18Li J.L. Cox L.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or cGMP-dependent protein kinase (19Deng W. Parbhu-Patel A. Meyer D.J. Baker D.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which is expressed in the early intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite life cycle (20Deng W. Baker D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The structurally related Toxoplasma gondii cGMP-dependent protein kinase was demonstrated to be important in the in vivo intracellular survival of the parasite (21Donald R.G. Allocco J. Singh S.B. Nare B. Salowe S.P. Wiltsie J. Liberator P.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A critical role of protein phosphorylation in chloride channel activation is also strengthened by the observation that the Plasmodium-activated chloride current gradually disappears when acid phosphatase is added to the pipette (n = 4) (Fig. 4A). No current inhibition was observed when heat-inactivated acid phosphatase was added to the pipette (n = 4) (Fig. 4B). We also patchclamped ring stage cells (2–6 h post-invasion) as identified by fluorescent microscopy following staining with the DNA dye Hoechst 33342 (Fig. 4C). There was no difference in amplitude of the inwardly rectifying chloride channel compared with trophozoite-infected cells (Fig. 4D), implying that full activation of the channel is already achieved at an early stage of infection, long before activation of the new permeation pathway (n = 4) (22Staines H.M. Ellory J.C. Kirk K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1576-C1587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 4A, representative traces of infected non-CF erythrocytes exposed to acid phosphatase (30 units/ml) in the pipette in the absence of ATP.

The inward rectifying current is active before the new permeation pathway becomes active.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CF red blood cells, lacking CFTR and CFTR-related conductances, offered us the unique possibility to study the obligatory role of this chloride channel in the survival of P. falciparum. If the parasite-activated channel is indeed identical to the endogenous shrinkage-activated channel, as strongly suggested by the experiments above, and the new permeation pathway is the macroscopic manifestation of this channel as suggested by Desai et al. (6Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), then the new permeation pathway, and thus survival of the malaria parasite, would be expected to be impaired in CF red blood cells. To test this hypothesis, blood samples from non-CF, CFTRΔPhe-508/ΔPhe-508 patients and obligate carriers (CFTR+/ΔPhe-508) were used for in vitro culture of P. falciparum FCR3 and NF54 strains. Two strains were used to exclude strain-specific effects. On the basis of [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assays, no difference in invasion rates and subsequent intraerythrocytic development of the P. falciparum FCR3 strain parasites could be observed between non-CF, CFTR+/ΔPhe-508, and CFTRΔPhe-508/ΔPhe-508 red blood cells (Fig. 5A). Follow-up of the individual cultures by analysis of Giemsa-stained thin films demonstrated that parasites in all cultures developed normally and had comparable growth rates, irrespective of the CF genotype. Similar results were obtained with the NF54 parasite strain, yet patch clamp analysis of the malaria-infected CF red blood cells revealed that the parasites had failed to induce the inwardly rectifying current (Fig. 3B), indicating that the CFTR-related chloride channel is not obligatory for parasite survival in vitro. To further investigate whether the functional absence of the inwardly rectifying channel changes the activity of the new permeation pathway, we performed isotonic lysis experiments in Plasmodium-infected red blood cells to monitor the transport of choline chloride, glucose, and alanine. In these experiments the infected red blood cells are incubated in an isosmotic solution of one of the nutrients. Passive movement of the solute through the red blood cell membrane causes swelling and subsequent lysis of the cell. The lysis rate can be used to assess the new permeation pathway activity (1Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and thus to monitor differences in nutrient transport across the red blood cell membrane of Plasmodium-infected CF and non-CF cells. The only major difference observed between infected non-CF and CF red blood cells was at the level of glucose uptake (p < 0.01 for all time points, n = 4) (Fig. 5B). Lysis experiments additionally suggested that the influx of alanine and choline is only slightly impaired in infected CF red blood cells, whereas the maximal percentage of lysis was similar in infected CF and non-CF red blood cells. These data suggest that the Plasmodium-induced inwardly rectifying chloride channel only accounts for a (minor) part of the nutrient influx in infected red blood cells. Collectively these data indicate that the (slightly) reduced influx of nutrients in infected CF red blood cells had no detectable influence on parasite growth rates under standard in vitro culture conditions, as shown by the invasion/growth experiments (Fig. 5A). Importantly, the new permeation pathway-inhibiting drug furosemide blocked glucose and alanine influx completely, and choline influx partially, both in infected control and CF red blood cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the antiplasmodial action of furosemide cannot be attributed to the inhibition of the inwardly rectifying chloride channel alone as this channel is only manifest in non-CF cells. This conclusion is reinforced by the observation that parasites growing in CF red blood cells remained fully sensitive to the new permeation pathway blocker furosemide, as demonstrated by the profound decline in parasitemia in both CF and non-CF red blood cells following a 48-h exposure to furosemide (Fig. 5C). The results presented here demonstrate that a CFTR-like chloride conductance is functionally expressed in normal but not in CF red blood cells. Combined with our data on CFTR mRNA expression in red blood cell progenitor cells, as well as on inhibition of channel activation by a CFTR-specific, R-domain-directed antibody, our study demonstrates for the first time that CFTR is responsible for an endogenous chloride conductance in red blood cells. Moreover, our results also indicate that CFTR is additionally required for the activation of a host cell-encoded inwardly rectifying chloride current by either cell shrinkage or P. falciparum infection. Because the inwardly rectifying conductance differs from the CFTR-chloride channel with respect to several major electrophysical, regulatory, and pharmacological properties (anion permeability sequence, rectifying behavior, sustained opening in the absence of ATP, and furosemide inhibition), our data collectively support a dual channel model in which CFTR and the inward rectifier constitute separate molecular identities but are tightly coupled functionally, analogous to the well established relationship between CFTR and the outwardly rectifying chloride channel (23Ogura T. Furukawa T. Toyozaki T. Yamada K. Zheng Y.J. Katayama Y. Nakaya H. Inagaki N. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 863-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, in view of recent data suggesting that ion selectivity and activation modes of CFTR in native tissues may differ from those in cultured cells (24Reddy M.M. Quinton P.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the present evidence for a two-rather than one-channel model is inconclusive and awaits further identification of the inwardly rectifying conductance, preferably at the molecular level. Taken together, our data do not support the hypothesis raised by Desai et al. (6Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) that the Plasmodium-activated inwardly rectifying ion channel (recently renamed PESAC (25Wagner M.A. Andemariam B. Desai S.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 116-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Cohn J.V. Alkhalil A. Wagner M.A. Rajapandi T. Desai S.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 132: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)) adequately accounts for the parasite-induced increases in permeability to a broad range of solutes. Their hypothesis was based on the highly similar pharmacological profile of the inwardly rectifying chloride conductance and the new permeation pathway (6Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and on the finding that the chloride conductivity of infected red blood cells, as calculated from patch clamp analysis, matched the chloride conductance calculated from chloride flux measurements (25Wagner M.A. Andemariam B. Desai S.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 116-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our data suggest a less vital role for the inwardly rectifying chloride channel. This is evident from the normal development of malaria parasites in CF red blood cells, in which the inwardly rectifying chloride conductance is completely lacking, and from the modest impact of the CF condition on functioning of the parasite-induced new permeation pathway, suggesting that the inward rectifier is not the target for the antiplasmodial action of furosemide. Additionally, patch-clamping ring stage cells demonstrated that the inwardly rectifying chloride conductance is activated long before the new permeation pathway becomes active (Fig. 4, C and D). Furthermore, the closure of the parasite-induced inwardly rectifying chloride conductance following protein dephosphorylation by acid phosphatase, a broad specificity protein phosphatase, demonstrates for the first time that the “sustained” activation of the inwardly rectifying chloride conductance can be reversed. This finding suggests that the inwardly rectifying chloride conductance is activated through Plasmodium-induced (hyper)phosphorylation of red blood cell proteins and argues against potential irreversible modes of channel activation, e.g. limited proteolysis or protein oxidation, as was suggested by Huber et al. (27Huber S.M. Uhlemann A.C. Gamper N.L. Duranton C. Kremsner P.G. Lang F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We were also unable to demonstrate an anion channel with outward rectifying properties that is up-regulated by Plasmodium infection; however, it was recently demonstrated that the outward rectifying current is only manifest when the holding potential is negative or when human serum is added to the bath (28Staines H.M. Powell T. Ellory J.C. Egée S. Lapaix F. Decherf G. Thomas S.L. Duranton C. Lang F. Huber S.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 177-183Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Baumeister S. Endermann T. Charpian S. Nyalwidhe J. Duranton C. Huber S. Kirk K. Lang F. Lingelbach K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 132: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we use a holding potential of 0 mV, and the human serum concentration in the bath, a remnant from the human serum necessary for the Plasmodium culture, is less than 0.001%. Although we demonstrate that the Plasmodium-induced inwardly rectifying chloride conductance is apparently identical to the endogenous shrinkage-activated inwardly rectifying chloride conductance, and therefore hostrather than parasite-encoded, our data do not reveal whether the new permeation pathway is endogenous or parasite-encoded and do not provide a clue as to the molecular identity of the malaria-induced new permeation pathway. Finally it should be emphasized that the results presented, although arguing firmly against a crucial role of CFTR and the CFTR-related inwardly rectifying chloride conductance in new permeation pathway formation, do not exclude the possibility that chloride channel abnormalities in red blood cells could become of pathophysiological significance under in vivo conditions. Our finding that these channels are defective in CF offers the opportunity to test this hypothesis in Plasmodium-infected CF animal models. Furthermore the functional expression of CFTR in red blood cells opens new perspectives to exploit the erythrocyte as a readily available cell type in electrophysiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic studies of CF.

Are molecules of this family generally involved in cell death? More specifically, do non-apoptotic caspase-independent types of cell death require paracaspases or metacaspases? Dictyostelium discoideum lends itself well to answering these questions because 1) it undergoes non-apoptotic developmental cell death of a vacuolar autophagic type and 2) it bears neither caspase nor metacaspase genes and apparently only one paracaspase gene. This only paracaspase gene can be inactivated by homologous recombination. Paracaspase-null clones were thus obtained in each of four distinct Dictyostelium strains. These clones were tested in two systems, developmental stalk cell death in vivo and vacuolar autophagic cell death in a monolayer system mimicking developmental cell death. Compared with parent cells, all of the paracaspase-null cells showed unaltered cell death in both test systems. In addition, paracaspase inactivation led to no alteration in development or interaction with a range of bacteria. Thus, in Dictyostelium, vacuolar programmed cell death in development and in a monolayer model in vitro would seem not to require paracaspase. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of developmental programmed cell death shown to be independent of any caspase, paracaspase or metacaspase.

To our knowledge, this is the first instance of developmental programmed cell death shown to be independent of any caspase, paracaspase or metacaspase. These results have implications as to the relationship in evolution between cell death and the caspase family. Caspases, a subset of cysteine proteases, play an essential role in apoptotic death in animals (1Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar, 2Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). The caspase family includes not only caspases but also other members called paracaspases and metacaspases. Paracaspases were identified through their remote homology with caspases, and metacaspases were identified in turn through their remote homology with paracaspases (3Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within eukaryotes, paracaspases are found in animals and Dictyostelium discoideum and metacaspases are found in plants, fungi, and some protists (3Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro M.T.

Proteins. 2002; 46: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The role of these caspase-related proteases is largely unknown. In particular, it is not known whether they are involved in cell death. A thorough investigation into the role of the human paracaspase, MALT1, showed that MALT1 as a complex with Bcl10 or as a fusion protein was able to activate NF-κB (3Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.

From a more general point of view, investigating the role of caspase family members in cell death may be difficult in animals where they are numerous and may have redundant roles. Model organisms that harbor only one member of the caspase family, thus excluding any possibility of functional redundancy within this family, would seem more appropriate for functional investigation. Thus, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only one metacaspase gene, Yor197w, and no caspases or paracaspases (3Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cell death with some traits of apoptosis occurs in certain cdc48 mutants (6Madeo F. Frohlich E. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) or upon treatment with low doses of H2O2 (7Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Yor197w increases this cell death, and disruption of the Yor197w gene prevents it (8Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that a metacaspase may be required for apoptotic-like cell death in this organism. The protist Dictyostelium bears only one paracaspase (pcp) 1The abbreviations used are: pcp, paracaspase; DIF, Dictyostelium differentiation-inducing factor; pcp-, bearing a disruption of the paracaspase gene; FDA, fluorescein diacetate; PI, propidium iodide; SB, Soerensen buffer. and neither metacaspase nor caspase genes (for review see Refs. 3Uren A.G.

Proteins. 2002; 46: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (see “Results”). Paracaspases share with caspases the conserved Cys-His catalytic diad, but the catalytic Cys resides within a context that is different from the QACXG prototypic caspase sequence, probably leading to a different specificity. The Dictyostelium paracaspase does not bear the death domain and immunoglobulin domains found in metazoan paracaspases (3Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V.

Cell death can be observed in Dictyostelium in vivo upon starvation, which triggers Dictyostelium cells to aggregate, differentiate, and develop into 1–2-mm high multicellular fruiting bodies. Each of these is made of a mass of spores supported by a stalk where cells are massively vacuolated and dead (10Whittingham W.F. Raper K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1960; 46: 642-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This developmental cell death can be mimicked and studied in detail in vitro using Dictyostelium HMX44A cells, which upon starvation and addition of the morphogen differentiation-inducing factor (DIF) differentiate as a monolayer from vegetative to “stalk” cells (11Kay R.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), undergoing caspase-independent (12Olie R.A. Durrieu F. Cornillon S. Loughran G. Gross J. Earnshaw W.C. Golstein P.

We obtained paracaspase-null (pcp-) clones by homologous recombination in this haploid organism in four distinct Dictyostelium strains. We tested their cell death behavior both in vivo in stalks for three strains and in vitro in the monolayer system for all four strains. Compared with parent cells, all of the pcp- cells showed undiminished cell death in vivo and in vitro. In addition, paracaspase inactivation led to no alteration of development or difference as to interaction with a range of bacteria. Thus, in Dictyostelium, programmed cell death does not require paracaspase. Cells and Cell Culture—D. discoideum axenic strain HMX44A was cloned from HMX44 cells adapted to axenic growth (a kind gift from J. G. Williams). Upon starvation HM44 and HMX44A cells did not morphogenize and produced only little of the differentiation factor DIF-1. Upon the addition of DIF-1, these starved cells differentiated to stalk cells, i.e. dead cells, as a monolayer (11Kay R.R.

The PCR product was cloned into pGEMT-easy vector (Promega). The bsr cassette of vector pBsR503 (16Puta F. Zeng C. Folia Biol. (Prague). 1998; 44: 185-188PubMed Google Scholar) flanked by EcoRV restriction sites was inserted into the HpaI site of the paracaspase sequence cloned into pGEMT-easy. The DNA was digested with AccI (leading to an extra 400-bp fragment because of an AccI site in the pGEM polylinker) and SacII (a restriction site present in the forward primer) (Fig. 1). The 2280-bp insert was purified from gel fractionation and electrotransfected into HMX44A, AX2, or K-AX3 cells, which were subsequently selected with blasticidine (Invitrogen).

The Thy1 cassette was inserted in the paracaspase/bsr vector above after BamHI removal of the bsr cassette. The resulting 4080-bp insert was purified and electrotransfected into JH10 cells. Cells were selected for their ability to grow without thymidine. Resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution in microplates. Putative pcp- cell clones were first analyzed by PCR using the primers described above or the forward primer (5′-GATTCCACTGGTGCCATAATCAAATAC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTCCCCATCTCTACAACAATCTACG-3′) and confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown) and Southern blots.

Southern blots were probed with a 445-bp HindIII-SspI paracaspase fragment (from a HindIII site 314 bp 5′ of HpaI to a SspI site 131 bp 3′ of HpaI) and with a blasticidine probe (a 450-bp XhoI-BglII fragment of pUCBsRBamHI) or with a Thy1 probe (a 1.5-kb ClaI fragment of pJH60). Development Assays—For development on filters, cells were washed twice with SB (Soerensen buffer 50 times: 100 mm Na2HPO4, 735 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.0) and resuspended in SB. Cells were starved on filter pads (18Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) (with the exception that cells were starved in SB), the pads were soaked with SB, and 50 μl of cells at 5 × 106 cells were spotted on the filters. The same conditions were used also for development on 1% agarose dishes (19Levraud J.-P. Adam M. Cornillon S. Golstein P. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 66: 469-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On both filters and agarose, upon incubation at 23 °C fruiting bodies were obtained in 1–2 days. For development on bacteria, bacteria previously grown on SM/5 plates (18Sussman M.

Cells were plated (50 μl of cells at 5 × 106 cells) on the bacteria lawn and incubated for 3–5 days at 23 °C. Plates were examined for plaques formed by Dictyostelium cells and for development with a binocular photomicroscope (Zeiss). Monolayer assays, cell fixation and staining, microscopy, and image processing were done as described previously (14Levraud J.-P. Adam M. Luciani M.-F. De Chastellier C. Blanton R.L. Golstein P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Dictyostelium Genome Search—To search the Dictyostelium genome for molecules of the caspase family, we used as probes the caspase domain (amino acids 301–600) of the human paracaspase (GenBank™ accession number AAG38589), the already known Dictyostelium paracaspase (GenBank™ accession number AAG38592), the caspase domain (amino acids 251–500) of the Caenorhabditis elegans paracaspase (GenBank™ accession number AAG38591), the S. cerevisiae metacaspase (GenBank™ accession number NP_014840), caspase 3 of Danio rerio (GenBank™ accession number AB047003), amino acids 151–402 of mouse caspase 1 (GenBank™ accession number P29452), and amino acids 1–350 of a Cyanobacteria “pseudocaspase” (NP_487716). These probes were used for blastp search on the NCBI site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/, limited to Dictyostelium proteins, default parameters, expect maximum 10), psi-blast on the NCBI site (default parameters, until convergence), wu-blast on the Sanger site (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_discoideum/blast_server.shtml, on all of the contigs produced by the international consortium, January 2003 update, default parameters), and tblastn on the Jena site (genome.imb-jena.de/Dictyostelium/, on all available sequences; shotgun Baylor+GCSJ+Sanger, ESTs, GenBank™, mtDNA, rDNA, expect 10). Paracaspase Gene Inactivation Does Not Grossly Alter Dictyostelium Developmental Cell Death—Currently (November 2003), the whole chromosome shotgun approach to Dictyostelium genome sequencing has reached an ∼8-fold coverage, leading to the probability of finding a given gene estimated to be higher than 0.98 (20Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) 2L. Eichinger, G. Gloeckner, W. Loomis, R. Sucgang, and M.-A. Rajandream, personal communications. The various Dictyostelium genome search approaches listed under “Experimental Procedures” most often yielded the already known Dictyostelium paracaspase with significant “e” values and sometimes yielded other Dictyostelium sequences, however, with very borderline expect values. Only one of the latter sequence, AAO51557, showed a caspase-like domain but considerably truncated and with very low homology. Altogether, the only unambiguous member of the caspase family found in the thoroughly sequenced Dictyostelium genome remains the paracaspase gene AF316600/AAG38592 identified previously (3Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We disrupted this paracaspase gene by homologous recombination in the K-AX3 strain (Fig. 1) and checked the impact thereof on development under three experimental conditions: on filters in starvation buffer, on agar in starvation buffer, and on a lawn of Klebsiella aerogenes. In each of these three conditions, development appeared similar in parent K-AX3 and in two independently obtained pcp-clones (Fig. 2). Testing on a lawn of bacteria checks not only development but also vegetative growth and ability to ingest and process bacteria and to resist to them, all of them clearly not dependent on paracaspase. In particular, stalk development appeared unaltered, suggesting that stalk cell death is unaffected by paracaspase gene inactivation. Because of mostly unpublished reports that Dictyostelium mutant phenotypes can be strain-dependent, we disrupted the paracaspase gene also in strain AX2 cells (Fig. 1). In this case as well, development as tested on filters and on agar and in particular stalk cell development appeared unaltered by the disruption (data not shown). In both K-AX3 and AX2 cells, the paracaspase gene had been disrupted using a blasticidine resistance cassette. To eliminate possible bias resulting from expression of this cassette, we disrupted the paracaspase gene in another strain, JH10, using the Thy1 cassette and selecting for thymidine prototrophy (Fig. 1) (15Hadwiger J.A. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The resulting JH10 pcp- cells tested on filters and on agar also showed unaltered stalk development (data not shown). Thus, in three different Dictyostelium strains, stalk development, thus presumably stalk cell death, did not require an intact paracaspase gene. To more directly check stalk cell death, K-AX3 stalks were examined after triple staining with fluorescein diacetate (FDA), propidium iodide (PI), and calcofluor. Both parent and pcp- stalks showed the usual pattern of dying vacuolated cells stained with FDA and later with PI and synthesizing cellulose as shown through calcofluor staining (Fig. 3). Thus, by these criteria, stalk cell death in vivo does not require an intact paracaspase gene. Paracaspase Gene Inactivation Does Not Alter DIF-induced Monolayer Cell Death—Stalk cell death in vivo can be mimicked in vitro in a monolayer system where cell death is induced by starvation and DIF (11Kay R.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Induction of vacuolated dead cells in the monolayer system was not impaired in both independently derived pcp- K-AX3 clones compared with parent cells (Fig. 4). Very similar results were obtained with parent and pcp- AX2 and JH10 cells (data not shown). In these strains as well, cell death in the monolayer system was not impaired in pcp- cells. The stages of Dictyostelium cell death have been described in detail (13Cornillon S. Foa C. Davoust J. Buonavista N. Gross J.D. Golstein P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2691-2704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Levraud J.-P. Adam M. Luciani M.-F. De Chastellier C. Blanton R.L. Golstein P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using cells of another strain, HMX44A, as a monolayer. Compared with the in vivo situation or with K-AX3 cell monolayers, this system could permit the detection of more subtle alterations of the cell death process. Therefore, we inactivated by homologous recombination the paracaspase gene in Dictyostelium HMX44A cells and the resulting pcp-clone (Fig. 1) was functionally investigated in more detail. Upon induction by starvation and addition of DIF, the morphological stages on the cell death pathway (emergence and demise of paddle cells, cellulose synthesis, paddle-to-round cell transition, actin depolymerization, vacuolization) seen in parent HMX44A cells (14Levraud J.-P. Adam M. Luciani M.-F. De Chastellier C. Blanton R.L. Golstein P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were also observed in pcp- cells (Fig. 5). To control for any clonal effect, the homologous recombination process in HMX44A cells was repeated in an additional, separate round of transfection and yielded another pcp- clone, which could also be induced to die (data not shown). Whereas the HMX44A strain was derived from the initial V12M2 Dictyostelium isolate, the AX2, K-AX3, and JH10 strains were derived from the NC4 isolate (see dictybase.org/strain_history.htm). Thus, in pcp- cell clones belonging to four distinct Dictyostelium strains of two distinct derivations, the paracaspase gene was not required for DIF-induced vacuolar cell death in the monolayer system. Paracaspase Is Not Required for Staurosporine-induced Cell Alterations or for Growth and Development on Some Bacteria—Most if not all animal cells would die when subjected to the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, and this death is often caspase-mediated (21Weil M. Jacobson M.D. Coles H.S.R. Davies T.J. Gardner R.L. Raff K.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 22Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). If staurosporine-induced cell death requires caspases in animal cells, staurosporine-induced cell death or other effects might require the caspase-related paracaspase in Dictyostelium. We subjected vegetative K-AX3 cells to 1 μm staurosporine in HL5 medium for 15 h. Unexpectedly, the cells acquired a flat morphology with marked extension of filopodia often appearing as networks (data not shown). Similar although less marked effects could be seen at 0.1 μm staurosporine. These cells were apparently not dead, because upon replacement of staurosporine-containing HL5 with fresh HL5, they reverted to vegetative cell morphology (data not shown). Thus, in Dictyostelium cells and under conditions similar to the ones that induce death in animal cells, staurosporine did not induce cell destruction but induced reversible alterations in cell morphology. We then subjected K-AX3 pcp- cells and also parent and pcp- HMX44A cells to staurosporine and observed the same alterations (data not shown). Thus, in Dictyostelium cells, under these conditions staurosporine induces reversible alterations and these do not require paracaspase. Because of the relationship between cell death and some defense reactions, we wondered whether paracaspase could be involved in interactions between Dictyostelium and bacteria. Therefore, we tested a range of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Xanthomonas campestris oryzae, Bacillus megaterium, Shewanella putrefaciens, Erwinia carotovora carotovora, and Erwinia chrisanthemi) for their ability to support vegetative growth and subsequent plaque development of parental or pcp- K-AX3 cells. We found no detectable difference linked to the absence of the paracaspase gene (data not shown). The purpose of this work was to check whether the paracaspase molecule was necessary for Dictyostelium cell death. The experimental answer seems to be that it is not. To our knowledge Dictyostelium is the only developmentally competent eukaryote so far, in which through a combination of natural absence of caspases and metacaspases and experimental inactivation of paracaspase, it has been possible to show the persistence of cell death in the genetic absence of all known caspases and paracaspases and metacaspases. Strengthening this conclusion, these results were obtained with four Dictyostelium strains derived from two distinct initial Dictyostelium isolates using two selection agents and two cell death procedures. However, there are some limitations to these conclusions. There is still a very remote possibility that a gene encoding a member of the caspase family lies in the few unexplored segments of the Dictyostelium genome. Also, we cannot exclude a role in Dictyostelium cell death of more remote members of the caspase-hemoglobinase fold protease family (4Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 2002; 46: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) nor of some other proteases that might have similar enzymatic activity. Clearly, other cysteine proteases could be involved in this cell death. Changes in protease activity have previously been found associated with Dictyostelium cell differentiation including that of stalk cells (23Fong D. Rutherford C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 521-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we could not inhibit Dictyostelium cell death using even high concentrations of several calpain inhibitors (data not shown). From another point of view, we cannot exclude the possibility that, in particular through the previously indicated domain differences, animal paracaspases might play a role in some instances of cell death. Dictyostelium cells inactivated for the paracaspase gene showed unchanged cell death but were also not grossly affected as to vegetative growth, co-existence with some bacteria, staurosporine-induced alterations, and overall development. Although our purpose was to explore the relationship between paracaspase and cell death, leading to the conclusion that paracaspase was not required for Dictyostelium cell death, paracaspase clearly did not seem to be required for a number of other key functions in Dictyostelium. We did not investigate further the function of this paracaspase. These findings have at least two implications. First, in the face of complexity of apoptosis (24Adams J.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2481-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) and of multiplicity of nonapoptotic types of cell death, moreover often intertwined within the same dying cell (25Yuan J. Lipinski M. Degterev A. Neuron. 2003; 40: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), there is a need for “cleaner” cell death models exhibiting only one type of cell death. These models would often belong to non-animal kingdoms and would ideally lend themselves to a trans-kingdom approach of cell death mechanisms (26Golstein P. Aubry L. Levraud J.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Within such cell death models, D. discoideum can be used to explore the mechanism of vacuolar autophagic cell death. The present results contribute to fully validate it as a model for this caspase-independent cell death. A second implication bears on the role of the caspase family in cell death mechanisms. To answer this question, two organisms, yeast and Dictyostelium, have been explored that show the favorable experimental situation of expressing only one member of this family. However, yeast cell death was apparently dependent on this caspase-extended family member (8Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) but Dictyostelium cell death was not. A number of factors may explain these contrasting results. From a molecular point of view, molecular proximity to caspases of the non-caspases should matter. Paracaspases are closer to caspases than metacaspases (3Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 2002; 46: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, in apparent paradox, the Dictyostelium paracaspase is not involved in cell death (this report), whereas the yeast metacaspase is involved (8Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Also, peculiarities of given metacaspases and paracaspases could be important such as the absence of some domains indicated above. From a phylogenetic point of view, the earlier emergence from the main eukaryotic lineage of Dictyostelium compared with yeast (27Baldauf S.L. Roger A.J. Wenk-Siefert I. Doolittle W.F. Science. 2000; 290: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) and the possibly distinct mode and earlier time of entry into eukaryotes of metacaspases compared with paracaspases (28Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) may be significant. Also, the circumstances of cell death were quite different, namely development in Dictyostelium and not so in yeast. It could well be, however, that the most important factor is the type of caspase-independent cell death, apoptotic-like in yeast and not so in Dictyostelium. Although clearly more information in more organisms is needed, this report shows that, at least in Dictyostelium, developmental cell death can occur in the absence of any member of the caspase family, making a constitutive link throughout evolution between this caspase family and programmed cell death unlikely. Rather, from the caspase family, only or mostly bona fide caspases were recruited to cell death. This caspase recruitment seems to have occurred when animals emerged in evolution, perhaps mostly as a tool to contribute together with cell death phagocytosis to the disappearance of dead cells, which is remarkably more thorough and rapid in apoptosis in the animal kingdom than in most other types of cell death.

The distinct electrical properties of different subtypes of neurons are determined by the biophysical characteristics of the intrinsic voltage-dependent conductances that they express. Although neuronal voltage-gated sodium currents are comparatively uniform, a highly varied array of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) 1The abbreviations used are: Kv channel, voltage-gated potassium channel; MiRP, MinK-related peptide; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: Kv channel, voltage-gated potassium channel; MiRP, MinK-related peptide; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. currents exist in mammalian brain, generated by a family of Kv channel α subunits with diverse properties and augmented by alternative splicing, extensive regulation, and co-assembly with ancillary subunits. Thus, the fine balance of Kv channel subunits expressed in each neuron is highly influential in setting neuronal resting membrane potential, regulating firing patterns and action potential phenotype, and modulating neurotransmitter release (1Coetzee W.A.

Four mammalian Kv3 genes have been identified, each of which generates by alternative splicing multiple protein products (3Rudy B. Chow A. Lau D. Amarillo Y. Ozaita A. Saganich M. Moreno H.

Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 genes express very similar delayed rectifier K+ currents in heterologous expression systems, whereas Kv3.4, and at least one splice variant of Kv3.3, can generate A-type (fast inactivating) currents (10Schroter K.H.

Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 are highly enriched in neurons that fire at high frequencies, such as fast spiking interneurons of the cortex and hippocampus (9Erisir A. Lau D. Rudy B. Leonard C.S. J.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6394-6404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their unusually rapid activation and deactivation rates allow channels containing Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 α subunits to repolarize action potentials quickly without compromising the threshold for action potential generation by promoting a rapid afterhyperpolarization period, thus minimizing the rate of recovery of sodium channel inactivation. Pharmacological or genetic disruption of Kv3 currents leads to impaired fast spiking in inhibitory neurons and increased seizure susceptibility (6Lau D. Vega-Saenz de Miera E.C. Contreras D.

Furthermore, computational modeling suggests that the unique activation and deactivation rates of Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 channels are kinetically optimized for high frequency action potential generation (9Erisir A.

Ozaita A. Lau D. Welker E. Rudy B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9332-9345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Betancourt L. Colom L.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting they perform functions other than to sustain rapid firing, despite their perfect adaptation for this task. One mechanism by which Kv α subunits can exhibit varied behavior, thus expanding their potential physiological roles, is by associating with ancillary subunits that alter the functional properties of the resultant mixed channel complex. A family of ancillary subunits, the MinK-related peptides (MiRPs, encoded by KCNE genes) are thought to play a particularly broad role in shaping Kv currents in mammalian heart (18Abbott G.W. Goldstein S.A. Sesti F. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Recently MinK-related peptide 2 (MiRP2) was demonstrated to form complexes in mammalian brain with Kv3.1, resulting in channels with slowed activation and a reduced ability to support fast spiking in computer simulations (20McCrossan Z.A. Lewis A. Panaghie G. Jordan P.N. Christini D.J. Lerner D.J. Abbott G.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8077-8091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that coassembly with MinK, MiRP1, or MiRP2 is a general mechanism for diversifying the gating of currents generated by Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 α subunits. MiRP-Kv3 channels are, to various degrees, slower activating and deactivating but faster inactivating than MiRP-free Kv3 channels, supporting a role beyond rapid spiking for MiRP-Kv3 channels. The data raise the possibility that MiRP-Kv3 channels may underlie a variety of voltage-gated currents in non-rapid firing cells in brain and other tissues.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in α minimum essential medium (containing l-glutamine, ribonucleosides, and deoxyribonucleosides; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator, gassed with 5% CO2:95% air. CHO cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks. On reaching full confluency, the monolayer was washed once with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Fisher Scientific, Suwanee, GA) for ≤1 min. The cells were then resuspended in supplemented α minimum essential medium and plated either at a 1/25 dilution into a new 75-cm2 flask, or at a 1/5 dilution in sterile 60-mm culture dishes for transfection. Cell culture medium was changed every 2-3 days and the cells passaged every 4 days.To study Kv3 channels in the presence and absence of MiRPs, wildtype CHO cells were transiently transfected with cDNA for rat Kv3.1b and/or rat Kv3.2a (a kind gift from B. Rudy) alone or in combination with cDNA for rat MinK, rat or human MiRP1, or rat or human MiRP2, all in cytomegalovirus-based expression vectors. When investigating the effects of MiRPs on heteromeric Kv3 channels, quantities of each transfected α subunit cDNA were adjusted in order to give a sum current density (MiRP-free) similar to that observed when expressed individually (MiRP-free). After reaching 70-80% confluency in 60-mm dishes, CHO cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and transfected using SuperFect™ transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were co-transfected with a plasmid containing the cDNA encoding the reporter protein green fluorescent protein to visualize transfected cells for whole cell voltage-clamp experiments. For immunoprecipitation studies, hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged constructs of MinK and MiRP1 were used to facilitate detection with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody. Experiments were carried out 24-48 h post-transfection.Co-immunoprecipitation—CHO cells transfected with the appropriate channel subunits were lysed 24 h later with immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer: 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Fisher Scientific), 1% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce, Rockford, IL), 1% CHAPS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 1% Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific), and 0.5% SDS (Sigma). Supernatants were pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) for 20 min at 4 °C; these beads were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 3 min and discarded. Precleared supernatants were incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibodies for immunoprecipitation: either anti-Kv3.1 (Sigma) or anti-Kv3.2 (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). After 5-12 h at 4 °C, protein A-Sepharose 4B beads were added and the mixture incubated for a further 2 h at 4 °C. The complexed beads were collected by centrifugation, washed for 4 × 15 min then immunopurified complexes were eluted by incubating the beads for 20 min at 37 °C in SDS-PAGE loading buffer: 10% dithiothreitol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 4% SDS, and 20% glycerol in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8. After centrifugation, the resulting bead eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels. After transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blots were probed with either monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibodies or polyclonal rabbit anti-Kv3.1 antibodies (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were horse-radish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG as appropriate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to facilitate subsequent detection by fluorography.Electrophysiological Analysis—Electrophysiological recordings from CHO cells were performed by resistive-feedback voltage-clamp under the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique (21Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15094) Google Scholar). Whole cell outward K+ currents were recorded at room temperature from transfected and non-transfected CHO cells using a Multiclamp 700A Amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pCLAMP 9.0 software (Axon Instruments). Cells were studied on an inverted microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics for green fluorescent protein detection. CHO cells were continuously perfused (2-3 ml/min) with a bathing solution containing (in mm) 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 2.5 CaCl2, 10 d-glucose (pH 7.4). Patch electrodes were pulled from standard walled, borosilicate glass capillaries with filament (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) using a P-97 horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments) and had resistances of 3-5MΩ when filled with intracellular solution containing (in mm): 10 NaCl, 117 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 11 HEPES, 11 EGTA, 1 CaCl2 (pH 7.2). All data were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz using a Digidata 1322A analogue-to-digital converter (Axon Instruments).The following voltage protocols were used: Protocol 1: From a holding voltage of -80 mV, cells were held for 300 ms at voltages between -60 mV and +60 mV in 10-mV steps, each followed by a 1-s tail pulse to -30 mV. Protocol 2 (Cumulative Inactivation): From a holding voltage of -80 mV, cells were pulsed to +40 mV for 300 ms at a frequency of 1 Hz. Protocol 3: From a holding voltage of -80 mV, cells were held for 1 s at voltages between -60 mV and +60 mV in 10-mV steps, each followed by a 2-s tail pulse to -40 mV. Protocol 4: From a holding voltage of -80 mV, cells were held for 8 s at +40 mV, followed by a 1-s tail pulse to -30 mV.Leak and liquid junction potentials (<4 mV) were not compensated for when generating current-voltage relationships. Conductance values were obtained by dividing the peak current by the electrochemical driving force (IK/(Vm - Ek)). Normalized conductance-voltage relationships were obtained by normalizing conductance (G) to maximal conductance (Gmax) and fitted using the Boltzmann equation (G = Gmax/[1 + exp(V - V0.5/k)], where V0.5 is the half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 9.0 software (Axon Instruments) and tabulated in Excel 5.0 (Microsoft). Graphs were generated using Origin 6.0 (Microcal), and data are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise stated, with n specifying the number of independent experiments. Statistical comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney rank sum tests (SigmaStat 2.0) with the level of significance set at p < 0.05.RESULTSRat MinK and MiRP1 Form Stable Complexes with Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 α Subunits—Previously, MiRP2 was shown to form stable complexes with Kv3.1 α subunits. Here, co-immunoprecipitations were performed to assess whether Kv3.1 or Kv3.2 α subunits form stable complexes with MinK and MiRP1 when expressed in CHO cells. Kv3 α subunits were immunoprecipitated with appropriate anti-α subunit antibodies, and co-immunoprecipitated HA-tagged rat MinK or MiRP1 (Fig. 1A) were probed for with anti-HA antibodies by Western blotting. First, Western blots of lysates expressing HA-tagged rat MinK or MiRP1 alone or with Kv3 α subunits showed bands at ∼25 kDa (as expected for fully glycosylated MinK and MiRP1) that were absent in lysate from non-transfected CHO cells, indicating expression and detection of either KCNE subunit when expressed alone or with Kv3 α subunits (Fig. 1B). Immunoprecipitations with antibodies against Kv3.1 or Kv3.2 gave a band of ∼25 kDa in Western blots probed with anti-HA antibody when either α subunit was co-expressed with rat MinK or rat MiRP1 (Fig. 1, C and D). Rat MinK or MiRP1 did not immunoprecipitate with any of the anti-Kv3 α subunit antibodies when expressed in the absence of the α subunit, neither did immunoprecipitation in cells expressing α subunits alone, but no KCNE subunits give an anti-HA band at 25 kDa, indicating specificity of the previous positive immunoprecipitations (Fig. 1, C and D). The additional band sizes exhibited by MiRP1 in panel D probably represent immature forms of MiRP1 (MiRP1 contains two glycosylation sites). The results suggest that rat variants of MinK and MiRP1 form stable complexes with rat Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 when co-expressed in CHO cells. Finally, as previously reported (7Hernandez-Pineda R. Chow A. Amarillo Y. Moreno H. Saganich M. Vega-Saenz de Miera E.C. Hernandez-Cruz A. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1512-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 α subunits formed heteromeric complexes when co-expressed, as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation using anti-Kv3.2 antibodies followed by Western blotting and detection with anti-Kv3.1 antibodies (Fig. 1E). The two upper bands observed in this blot are probably due to alternative post-translationally modified forms of Kv3.1, which can be glycosylated and also phosphorylated (5Macica C.M. von Hehn C.A. Wang L.Y. Ho C.S. Yokoyama S. Joho R.H. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lower band of the three is the immunoprecipitating rabbit anti-Kv3.2 antibody, recognized by the goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody.Rat MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 alter Kv3.1 Gating—Transfection of CHO cells with Kv3.1 gave ultra-rapid activating and deactivating currents as previously described (22Grissmer S. Ghanshani S. Dethlefs B. McPherson J.D. Wasmuth J.J. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20971-20979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Co-transfection of either rat MinK, rat MiRP1, or rat MiRP2 produced a slowing of both activation and deactivation (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, co-transfection with the human variant of MiRP1 had no effect on any of the attributes of rat Kv3.1 channels, despite efficient human MiRP1 expression, assessed both by Western blot and by ability to modulate human ether-a-go-go related gene currents (Protocol 3, data not shown). Furthermore, effects of rat MiRP2 on Kv3.1 gating kinetics were quantitatively different from those previously observed for human MiRP2 on rat Kv3.1 under similar conditions, and rat MiRP2 significantly increased Kv3.1 current density, opposite to the effect observed for human MiRP2 (20McCrossan Z.A. Lewis A. Panaghie G. Jordan P.N. Christini D.J. Lerner D.J. Abbott G.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8077-8091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat MiRP1 also shifted the voltage dependence of Kv3.1 activation 9 mV more negative, whereas rat MinK and MiRP2 had no effect on this parameter (Fig. 2C). Normalization of the first 100 ms of exemplar traces at 0 mV emphasizes the slowing of Kv3.1 activation by MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 (Fig. 2D). This slowing of activation rate was quantified (Fig. 2E), revealing a significant increase (∼2- to 4-fold) in the time constant of activation (τact) at all activating voltages. Deactivation rates at -30 mV were fitted with double exponential functions (Fig. 2F), revealing an 80-100% increase in the τ of both slow and fast components of Kv3.1 deactivation and a 50% increase in the amplitude of the slow component when co-expressed with rat MinK or MiRP1; rat MiRP2 similarly slowed the fast component but had less effect on the slow component and no effect on the relative amplitudes (Fig. 2G). Effects on Kv3.1 gating are summarized in Table I. The data indicate that rat MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 modulate Kv3.1 channel function to create distinct channel complexes with unique activation and deactivation properties.Fig. 2Effects of MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 on Kv3.1 activation and deactivation.

Chow A. Lau D. Amarillo Y. Ozaita A. Saganich M. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Hernandez-Pineda R. Hernandez-Cruz A. Erisir A. Leonard C. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 304-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Functionally, homomeric Kv3.2 channels are almost identical to homomeric Kv3.1 channels (7Hernandez-Pineda R. Chow A. Amarillo Y. Moreno H. Saganich M. Vega-Saenz de Miera E.C. Hernandez-Cruz A. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1512-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In CHO cell co-expression experiments rat MiRP1 caused a slight (∼6 mV) negative shift in the voltage dependence of Kv3.2 activation and rat MiRP2 significantly increased Kv3.2 current density (Fig. 3, A-C). All three MiRPs significantly slowed Kv3.2 activation, illustrated in Fig. 3D, in which the time base has been expanded to show the initial 100 ms of activation at 0 mV. Fitting of the Kv3.2 activation rate over a range of voltages revealed a 4- to 6-fold increase in the mean time constant of activation (τact) with rat MinK or MiRP1 and a 2- to 3-fold increase with rat MiRP2 (Fig. 3E). Co-expression with rat MinK, MiRP1, or MiRP2 also slowed the deactivation rate of Kv3.2 channels (Fig. 3F). Deactivation kinetics were quantified by fitting the deactivating tail at -30 mV with a double exponential function, indicating a doubling of both components of deactivation by MinK, a 3-fold slowing with MiRP1, and lesser effects with MiRP2. MinK and MiRP1 also both significantly increased the amplitude of the slow component (Fig. 3G). Thus rat MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 form functionally distinct channel complexes with Kv3.2. Effects on Kv3.2 gating are summarized in Table I. Human MiRP1 had no effects on Kv3.2 function, and effects of human MiRP2 were quantitatively different from those of rat MiRP2, again indicating species specificity of MiRP action (data not shown).Fig. 3Effects of MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 on Kv3.2 activation and deactivation.

https://openalex.org/W2039200600,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in primary endothelial cells and may be critical for VEGF-induced angiogenesis. We investigated the molecular basis for p38 activation in response to VEGF. The expression of a C-terminal splice variant of FAK, FRNK, had no affect on VEGF-induced activation of p38; however, expression of a dominant-negative RAFTK/Pyk2 mutant led to a decrease in the activation of p38, but had no affect on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Since calcium regulates RAFTK/Pyk2, we investigated its role in p38 activity. Preincubation with EGTA suppressed p38 activation, while calcium ionophore induced p38 activity. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) resulted in complete inhibition of ERK, while having no affect on p38 activity. These data suggested a bifurcation in the regulation of MAPKs that occurs at the level of PLC and RAFTK/Pyk2 activation. Src family kinases interact with RAFTK/Pyk2. Inhibition of Src by either pharmacological or genetic means decreased p38 activity. Finally, we found that both Src and RAFTK/Pyk2 were essential for endothelial cell migration. These data identified a novel regulatory network involving extracellular calcium, RAFTK/Pyk2, Src and p38. This signaling network appears to be critical for VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2065270399,"Src family kinases (SFKs) are abundant in chromaffin cells that reside in the adrenal medulla and respond to cholinergic stimulation by secreting catecholamines. Our previous work indicated that SFKs regulate acetylcholine- or nicotine-induced secretion, but the site of modulatory action was unclear. Using whole cell recordings, we found that inhibition of SFK tyrosine kinase activity by PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine) treatment or expression of a kinase-defective c-Src reduced the peak amplitude of nicotine-induced currents in chromaffin cells or in human embryonic kidney cells ectopically expressing functional neuronal α3β4α5 acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Conversely, the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium vanadate, or expression of mutationally activated c-Src resulted in enhanced current amplitudes. These results suggest that SFKs and putative phosphotyrosine phosphatases regulate the activity of AChRs by opposing actions. This proposed model was supported further by the findings that SFKs physically associate with the receptor and that the AChR is tyrosine-phosphorylated.

Res. 1996; 44: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which are derived from the neural crest during embryogenesis and reside in the adrenal medulla of the adult. Chromaffin cells are innervated by the preganglionic cholinergic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system, which secrete acetylcholine, the ligand that induces secretion of catecholamines from chromaffin cells. Binding of either acetylcholine or nicotine to the AChR on the surface of chromaffin cells opens the receptor channel, permitting cations to enter the cell through an electrochemical gradient. The resultant depolarization of the membrane opens voltage-gated calcium channels (L-type) followed by a subsequent calcium influx that triggers release of catecholamines (25Douglas W.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1968; 34: 453-474Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 26Cheek T.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). AChRs of chromaffin cells are similar in structure to neuronal AChRs (27Di Angelantonio S.M.C. Fabretti E. Nistri A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2313-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These receptors are pentamers, composed of three β and two α subunits that mediate high affinity ligand binding (28Lee K. Miwa S. Koshimura K. Ito A. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1992; 345: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29Picciotto M.R. Caldarone B.J. King S.L. Zachariou V. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000; 22: 451-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To date, eight different α subunits and three β subunits of the neuronal AChR have been identified. Various combinations of these subunits form functional receptors that relay excitatory impulses throughout the nervous system and regulate secretion from chromaffin cells (27Di Angelantonio S.M.C. Fabretti E. Nistri A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2313-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Nelson M. Wang F. Kuryatov A. Choi C. Gerzanich V. Lindstrom J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 563-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The neuronal AChR on chromaffin cells which regulates secretion is thought to be composed of two α3, one α5, and two β4 subunits, with α5 presumed to take the role of one β4 subunit (31Criado M. Alamo L. Navarro A. Neurochem. Res. 1992; 17: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Gu H. Wenger B.W. Lopez I. McKay S.B. Boyd R.T. McKay D.B. J.

This structure is different from the muscle AChR in composition and function, and its regulation by phosphorylation has not been reported. In comparison, the muscle receptor contains α, β, δ, and γ, or ∈ subunits (35Changeux J.P. Devillers-Thiery A. Chemouilli P. Science. 1984; 225: 1335-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 36Sapru M.K. Zhou G. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27811-27814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transmits signals that regulate muscle contraction. All subunits of this receptor can be phosphorylated by serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases (15Swope S.L. Qu Z. Huganir R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 757: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), an event that appears to increase the rate of receptor desensitization (37Huganir R.L. Miles K. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases influence chromaffin cell secretion (38Ely C.M. Tomiak W.M. Allen C.M. Thomas L. Thomas G. Parsons S.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Cox M.E. Ely C.M. Catling A.D. Weber M.J. Parsons S.J. J.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and that phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity associates with both c-Src and AChRs in large multimeric complexes isolated from the adrenal medulla (41van Hoek M.L. Allen C.S. Parsons S.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). SFKs localize to the cell membrane as well as to secretory vesicle membranes, spatially juxtaposing SFKs to the AChR (21Parsons S.J. Creutz C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Grandori C. Hanafusa H. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2125-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that SFKs and PTPases may coordinately regulate the activity of the neuronal AChR found on chromaffin cells. The current study was undertaken to investigate the potential role of SFKs in regulating AChR on chromaffin cells. Using pharmacological inhibitors of SFKs and mutational variants of c-Src, we demonstrate that SFK activity modulates both AChR channel currents and catecholamine secretion. Evidence for involvement of an opposing PTPase in regulating channel currents is also described. Biochemical analysis demonstrates co-immunoprecipitation of the nAChR with SFKs and tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor, suggesting that the channel activity may be modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. These are the first studies to reveal a functional relationship between SFKs and the neuronal AChR. Culture and Treatment of Chromaffin Cells and α3β4α5 AChR Human Embryonic Kidney Cells—Chromaffin cells were cultured from freshly harvested bovine adrenal glands as described previously (42Creutz C.E. Zaks W.J. Hamman H.C. Crane S. Martin W.H. Gould K.L. Oddie K.M. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1860-1868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modified (43Ely C.M. Oddie K.M.

Cells were maintained in serum-free N2 medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 environment. All stimulations and treatments were carried out at 37 °C. For secretion assays, 3–6-day cultures were stimulated with 20 μm nicotine, 55 mm KCl, or 50 μm A23187. Cells preequilibrated in BSSG (15 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, 14.4 mm NaHCO3, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) for 15 min were stimulated by replacement with BSSG ± secretagogue for the indicated times. Nicotine was purchased from Sigma and stored at –20 °C as a 100 mm stock in water. A23187 was purchased from Sigma and stored at room temperature as a 10 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide. When appropriate, BSSG was modified to accommodate the increase in KCl concentration to 55 mm by reducing the NaCl concentration to 90 mm. The indicated doses are maximum effective amounts, determined in previous dose-response analyses. The Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 and the negative control analogue PP3 were purchased from Calbiochem and stored at –20 °C as 100 mm stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide. For Src family inhibition studies, chromaffin cells were incubated with PP2 or PP3 at the indicated concentrations in BSSG for 15 min before and during induction of secretion. Untreated controls were incubated in an equivalent volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (not greater than 0.1% (v/v)). The α3β4α5 AChR cell line expressing β4, α3, and α5 subunits of the human AChR were generated from human embryonic kidney cells in the laboratory of J. Lindstrom (30Nelson M. Wang F. Kuryatov A. Choi C. Gerzanich V. Lindstrom J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 563-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 44Wang F. Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Keyser K. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28721-28732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The tsA201 cell line was generated from human embryonic kidney as a triple antibiotic transfection control. α3β4α5 and tsA201 cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (high glucose) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), 600 μg/ml G418, 500 μg/ml Zeocin, and 200 μg/ml hygromycin in a CO2 (5%) incubator at saturating humidity. [3H]Noradrenaline Release—Chromaffin cells seeded in 24-well cluster dishes (Corning) at 105 cells/well were assayed for catecholamine release in triplicate for each treatment by modification of the procedure described in Ref. 45Boksa P. Livett B.G. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were incubated for 2 h in N2 medium containing 1 μCi/well [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA, 17 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), washed, and incubated for 2 h in N2 medium to equilibrate the catecholamine pools. Cells were then stimulated as above. Released [3H]NA was measured by liquid scintillation counting of the harvested culture medium. The remaining cellular [3H]NA was extracted in 95% ethanol, 0.5 m HCl and counted. Basal efflux of [3H]NA was determined for pretreatments and from mock-stimulated cultures. Catecholamine release (percent [3H]NA release) was calculated as (cpm of [3H]NA released from stimulated cultures/released + remaining intracellular cpm of [3H]NA) × 100%. Generation of α3β4α5 AChR Clonal Cell Lines Stably Expressing c-Src Variants—HindIII-EcoRI fragments containing the entire coding sequences of either wild type (wt), kinase-defective (harboring a A430V mutation in the kinase domain), or activated (Y527F) chicken c-Src cDNA (46Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were inserted into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), and each of the resulting plasmids was transfected into α3β4α5 AChR cells along with the pGreen Lantern GFP plasmid (Invitrogen), using the Lipofectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s directions. A 4:1 ratio of the appropriate c-Src expression construct to the pGreen Lantern plasmid was utilized. As control, transfection with the pGreen Lantern plasmid alone was carried out. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h, trypsinized, and split 1:6 into growth medium to generate individual colonies of cells. GFP-positive colonies (identified by light microscopy) were picked by means of a cloning cylinder and cloned by limiting dilution. GFP-positive clones were subsequently analyzed by immunofluorescent staining for chicken c-Src expression, using mAb EC10 and Texas Red dye-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA), as described previously (47Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Clones exhibiting homogeneous fluorescence for both GFP and c-Src variants were tested further by Western immunoblotting for relative levels of ectopic c-Src expression using EC10 mAb as described below. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in this study: mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 337 specific for the β4 cytoplasmic domain of human AChR (30Nelson M. Wang F. Kuryatov A. Choi C. Gerzanich V. Lindstrom J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 563-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); mAb 268 specific for the α5 subunit of human AChR (J. Lindstrom); rat mAb 35, which immunoprecipitates α1, α3, and α5 AChR subunits (48Whiting P. Lindstrom J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3061-3069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Vernallis A.B. Conroy W.G. Berg D.K. Neuron. 1993; 10: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar); B3B9 anti-ERK-2 mouse mAb (a kind gift from M. Weber (50Reuter C.W. Catling A.D. Weber M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)); mouse mAb EC10 specific for residues 17–27 in the Unique domain of chicken c-Src (51Parsons S.J. McCarley D.J. Ely C.M. Benjamin D.C. Parsons J.T. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 272-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); Q0, a pan-Src family rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide (residues 522–533) of c-Src and reactive with c-Src, Fyn, c-Yes, and other SFKs (24Allen C.M. Ely C.M. Juaneza M.A. Parsons S.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 44: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 52Katagiri T. Ting J.P. Dy R. Prokop C. Cohen P. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4914-4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); mouse mAb 2–17, reactive with residues 2–17 in the Unique domain of c-Src from all species (Quality Biotech, Camden, NJ); rabbit polyclonal anti-Fyn antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); mouse mAb anti-c-Yes (Wako Industries, Japan); mouse mAb specific for human transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratory Inc., South San Francisco, CA); and mouse mAb PY99 specific for phosphotyrosine (Santa Cruz). ChromPure mouse, rabbit, or rat IgGs (Jackson Laboratory) were used as species-matched, negative antibody controls. Conjugation of rat mAb 35 to Sepharose beads was accomplished as follows. 2 mg of protein G-purified mouse mAb 35 was incubated with a 1-ml slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads at room temperature for 1 h, then washed twice with 10 volumes of 0.2 m sodium borate, pH 9.0. The bead-bound antibodies were resuspended in 10 volumes of the same sodium borate buffer and cross-linked by incubation in 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature with constant rocking. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0, and incubation for 2 h at room temperature. Beads were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in PBS made 0.01% sodium azide and stored at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Fresh bovine adrenal glands were cleared of blood by perfusion with cell buffer A (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 11.2 mm glucose, 145 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.0 mm NaHPO4) at room temperature and trimmed of external fat. The glands were then perfused with digestion buffer (0.25% collagenase (Roche Applied Science) and 0.005% DNase (United States Biochemical) in cell buffer A), incubated with gentle agitation for 5 min in a 37 °C water bath, and gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The perfusion and incubation with digestion buffer were repeated twice. Medullae were dissected from cortices, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Frozen tissues were ground with mortar and pestle and homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay protein lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) supplemented with 1 μg/ml leupeptin and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. α3β4α5 AChR cells at ∼70% confluence were washed three times with PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. All lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Clarified cell lysate (1 mg) was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of the indicated antibody and 40 μl of protein A-agarose (50% slurry; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), as described previously (38Ely C.M. Tomiak W.M. Allen C.M. Thomas L. Thomas G. Parsons S.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were resolved on 8% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, immunoblotted with specific primary antibodies, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse, anti-rat, or anti-rabbit antiserum (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (40Cox M.E. Parsons S.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As a primary immunoblotting antibody, Q0 antiserum was diluted 1:1,000. Other antibodies were used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in rinsing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.15 NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) made 5% with milk. The conventional blotting procedure was modified for detection of phosphotyrosine by blocking the filters and diluting the antibodies in 5% bovine serum albumin instead of milk. Whole Cell Voltage Clamp Recording—For these experiments, chromaffin cells, α3β4α5 AChR, or α3β4α5 AChR cells ectopically expressing GFP alone or GFP + c-Src variants were seeded on laminin-coated coverslips at densities ranging from 103 to 104 cells/coverslip and incubated in the appropriate medium in 35-mm plastic dishes until use. Coverslips were coated by incubation in a solution containing 0.01 mg/ml laminin in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C and washed twice with PBS before use. Seeded coverslips were transferred to a specially designed chamber where they were held by a Sylgard insert and viewed at ×800 magnification with Hoffman Modulation Contrast optics. Recordings were made with glass pipettes using standard patch clamping techniques to obtain GΩ seals and whole cell recording configuration. Solutions for the bath and the electrodes were as follows. The control bath solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 11 mm glucose, 10 μm nicotine, or 10 μm PP2, or both as indicated. The patch electrode solution contained 150 mm CsCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2 mm Mg-ATP. 100 μm sodium vanadate was added to the patch electrode solution as indicated. Voltage-clamped recording was amplified with an Axopatch 1-D (Axon Instruments) and stored on a digital data recorder (Instrutech VR100A). Whole cell currents monitored the response to nicotine in control trials and in trials with PP2 or sodium vanadate. Solutions were delivered locally to a cell by a superfusion system. The superfusion nozzle was placed within 200 μm of the cell and was connected by tubes to reservoirs held above the bath. These tubes were clamped off except for the one connected to a reservoir containing the solution that was applied to the cell. A change from one solution to another was accomplished by clamping off the open tube and unclamping the one to a test solution. This allowed solutions to be changed within 1 s. Nicotinic AChR Binding Assay—α3β4α5 AChR cells were grown in 30-mm tissue culture dishes to 60% confluence. To determine whether PP2 treatment alone caused internalization of the nAChR, α3β4α5 AChR cells were incubated initially in PBS at room temperature for 15 min in the presence or absence of 10 μm PP2 (as indicated) and then stimulated with nicotine. Four different treatment groups were tested. Group 1 was preincubated with 10 μm PP2 and then stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml 3H-labeled nicotine (0.275 μCi/ml, 81 Ci/mmol; Sigma) for 30 min on ice. Group 2 was preincubated at room temperature in the absence of PP2 and stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml 3H-labeled nicotine for 30 min on ice. Group 3 was preincubated in the absence of PP2 and stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml 3H-labeled nicotine mixed with 2 μg/ml unlabeled nicotine for 30 min on ice. Group 4 was incubated in PBS for 30 min on ice without prior PP2 treatment. After these incubations, cells were washed three times with cold PBS on ice and lysed with 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 100 μl of cell lysate from each sample was dissolved in 1 ml of scintillation fluid (Ecoscint™ A; National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and counted in a Beckman LS5801 liquid scintillation counter. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. The cpm/μg of protein for each plate was calculated. Results from five independent experiments were combined and expressed as the mean cpm/μg of protein ± S.E. for each treatment group. Requirement for SFK Activity in Nicotine-induced Secretion—Previous results from our laboratory showed that the activities of c-Src and Fyn tyrosine kinases in bovine chromaffin cells are modulated after binding of secretory ligands to the cells (24Allen C.M. Ely C.M. Juaneza M.A. Parsons S.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 44: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 53Oddie K.M. Litz J.S. Balserak J.C. Payne D.M. Creutz C.E. Parsons S.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and that vaccinia virus-mediated overexpression of wt or kinase-defective c-Src positively or negatively affects catecholamine secretion, respectively (38Ely C.M. Tomiak W.M. Allen C.M. Thomas L. Thomas G. Parsons S.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we next sought to examine the mechanism by which c-Src and/or its family members (SFKs) regulate the secretion process and more specifically, whether this mechanism involved regulation of the channel current of AChR. To gain insights into the site of action of SFKs in the signaling cascade that regulates secretion, we utilized a specific pharmacological inhibitor of SFKs (PP2) plus different secretagogues, which induce catecholamine secretion at different levels in the signal transduction stream, to assess the inhibitory effect of PP2 on secretion. Nicotine, as an acetylcholine agonist, activates the system at the level of the AChR, whereas 55 mm extracellular KCl intersects the cascade by depolarizing the membrane and activating voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium ionophore bypasses both of these upstream stages by introducing a bolus of Ca2+ into the cell from extracellular stores (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows that of the three secretagogues used, nicotine induced the greatest amount of catecholamine release, consistent with our previous studies (38Ely C.M. Tomiak W.M. Allen C.M. Thomas L. Thomas G. Parsons S.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 40Cox M.E. Parsons S.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The addition of PP2 significantly inhibited secretion elicited by nicotine but failed to reduce secretion induced by either 55 mm KCl or the Ca2+ ionophore (Fig. 1B). These results replicated those of Ely et al. (38Ely C.M. Tomiak W.M. Allen C.M. Thomas L. Thomas G. Parsons S.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), who utilized kinase-defective c-Src as a dominant negative inhibitor of endogenous c-Src to demonstrate that the action of SFKs in the secretory pathway occurred at the level of or immediately downstream of the AChR. The identical results obtained by the two methods of inhibiting SFKs substantiated the use of PP2 as a SFK inhibitor in this system. In further support of its use, PP3, an analogue of PP2 which has no effect on the kinase activity of SFKs, was approximately 1 order of magnitude less potent as an inhibitor of catecholamine release than PP2 (Fig. 1C). Overall, these results indicate that SFKs play a role in regulating catecholamine secretion at the level of the AChR. Src Family Kinases Positively Affect Nicotine-evoked Currents through the Neuronal AChR—To determine whether SFKs affect properties of the AChR channels themselves in the secretion process, whole cell recordings of chromaffin cells stimulated with nicotine in the presence or absence of PP2 were obtained. 10 μm nicotine was added to the bath, and inward currents were evoked in the absence of PP2 (Fig. 2A, top tracing), while the voltage was kept constant to avoid opening of downstream voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. After the addition of 10 μm PP2 to the bath, the middle tracing in Fig. 2A shows that the peak amplitude decreased substantially compared with the amplitude recorded from an untreated cell. The PP2-"

We have determined the crystal structure of residues 544-704 from yeast eIF2B∈ at 2.3-Å resolution, and this fragment is an all-helical protein built around the conserved aromatic acidic (AA) boxes also found in eIF4G and eIF5. The eight helices are organized in a manner similar to HEAT repeats. The molecule is highly asymmetric with respect to surface charge and conservation. One area in the N terminus is proposed to be directly involved in catalysis. In agreement with this hypothesis, mutation of glutamate 569 is shown to be lethal. An acidic belt and a second area in the C terminus containing residues from the AA boxes are important for binding to eIF2.

Two mutations causing the fatal human genetic disease leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter are buried and appear to disrupt the structural integrity of the catalytic domain rather than interfering directly with catalysis or binding of eIF2. The initiation phase of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells is a complex series of highly regulated interactions between ribosomal subunits, mRNA, aminoacylated initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet), and eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs). 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic inititation factor; TC, ternary complex; GAP, GTPase activating protein; GEF, GTPase exchange factor; eIF2(αP), phosphorylated eIF2α; AA, aromatic and acidic; MAD, multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion; r.m.s.d, root mean square deviation.1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic inititation factor; TC, ternary complex; GAP, GTPase activating protein; GEF, GTPase exchange factor; eIF2(αP), phosphorylated eIF2α; AA, aromatic and acidic; MAD, multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion; r.m.s.d, root mean square deviation. They all function to correctly position Met-tRNAiMet within the 80 S ribosomal P site at the correct AUG initiation codon of every mRNA (1Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). One of the key regulated initiation factors is eIF2, which delivers Met-tRNAiMet to the 40 S ribosomal subunit as part of an eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex (TC). When TC is bound to both the 40 S ribosomal subunit and the initiator AUG codon of an mRNA, GTPase activating protein (GAP) eIF5 stimulates GTP hydrolysis releasing an eIF2·GDP binary complex. eIF2B acts as a nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and promotes release of GDP from eIF2 and formation of an eIF2·GTP complex. Only eIF2·GTP can form TC, so by controlling eIF2B function, cells can control TC levels and protein synthesis initiation (1Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). eIF2B activity is controlled both indirectly by phosphorylation of eIF2, and directly by phosphorylation of eIF2B. Four protein kinases can phosphorylate the eIF2α subunit (eIF2α) at Ser51. Each kinase reacts to different cellular stress conditions. GCN2 responds to amino acid starvation (2Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar); PEK/PERK counters damage caused by unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum; PKR is activated by double stranded RNA in response to viral infection and HRI is regulated by heme levels in reticulocytes (1Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α (eIF2(αP)) reduces the activity of eIF2B by formation of a non-productive eIF2·eIF2B complex (3Pavitt G.D. Ramaiah K.V. Kimball S.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). As eIF2 is more abundant than eIF2B, a small fraction of eIF2(αP) can have a large effect on eIF2B activity and therefore significantly reduce TC levels. The reduction in TC levels by eIF2(αP) has opposing effects; overall protein synthesis is lowered, but the translation of stress responsive genes is enhanced. The activity of mammalian eIF2B can also be controlled directly in response to insulin signaling, which causes glycogen synthase kinase 3 inactivation and thereby contributes to activation of eIF2B (4Wang X. Paulin F.E. Campbell L.E. Gomez E. O'Brien K. Morrice N. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This permits increased eIF2B activity and protein synthesis in response to growth-promoting signals. It was recently demonstrated that mutations in eIF2B cause the fatal human genetically inherited brain disorder known as childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination or vanishing white matter leukoencephalopathy (5van der Knaap M.S. Leegwater P.A. Konst A.A. Visser A. Naidu S. Oudejans C.B. Schutgens R.B. Pronk J.C. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 6Leegwater P.A. Vermeulen G. Konst A.A. Naidu S. Mulders J. Visser A. Kersbergen P. Mobach D. Fonds D. van Berkel C.G. Lemmers R.J. Frants R.R. Oudejans C.B. Schutgens R.B. Pronk J.C. van der Knaap M.S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). eIF2 and eIF2B are proteins with three and five non-identical subunits, respectively. Whereas eIF2α appears to be largely required for regulation by phosphorylation, the β and γ subunits have a central role in GTPase function. eIF2γ contains the GDP/GTP binding domain and also binds Met-tRNAiMet (7Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6311-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), whereas eIF2β is required to bind both eIF5 and eIF2B (8Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functions for each of the five subunits of eIF2B have also been assigned from molecular genetic and biochemical studies of the yeast factor. The eIF2B α, β, and δ subunits share extensive sequence similarity and these three subunits form a regulatory subcomplex that mediates the inhibition of eIF2B function in response to eIF2(αP) (9Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6603-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This regulatory complex binds eIF2(αP) with higher affinity than non-phosphorylated eIF2. In contrast, the γ and ∈ subunits of eIF2B are required for the catalytic function of nucleotide exchange. These subunits share extensive similarity over the entire length of eIF2Bγ. eIF2B∈ subunits from rat, yeast, and Drosophila are capable of nucleotide exchange in vitro (3Pavitt G.D. Ramaiah K.V. Kimball S.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Heinzinger N.K. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3733-3742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the C-terminal ∼200 amino acids of eIF2B∈ contains the minimal eIF2B catalytic domain (12Gomez E. Mohammad S.S. Pavitt G.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5292-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This minimal fragment was proposed to contain two functional regions. The C-terminal 115 residues share sequence homology with the C termini of eIF5 and mammalian eIF4G, and has been defined as the W2 domain (two invariant tryptophans), and this domain also includes the shorter eIF5C domain. Within this region there are two AA boxes (rich in aromatic and acidic residues) (8Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are important for mediating protein-protein interactions. Multiple alanine substitutions in the AA boxes of eIF2B∈ disrupt binding to eIF2β and equivalent substitutions in eIF5 have similar effects on eIF2β binding (8Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C terminus of mammalian eIF4G is proposed to interact with the protein kinase Mnk1, which phosphorylates eIF4E on serine 209 and has a regulatory role in translation (13Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The second region within this catalytic domain is proposed to function as the catalytic center of the enzyme. This region encompasses residues 518-583 of the yeast protein and is well conserved in all eIF2B∈ proteins (12Gomez E. Mohammad S.S. Pavitt G.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5292-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of either Thr552 to Ile (T552I) or Ser576 to Asn (S576N) directly impairs catalytic function without detectably impairing binding to eIF2 (14Gomez E. Pavitt G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3965-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, although the eIF2B∈ C terminus is only a small fragment of the entire ∼275-295-kDa eIF2B complex, it contains the major functional regions required for nucleotide exchange and provides a structural model for the related C termini of eIF4G and eIF5. In this study we present the x-ray structure of the eIF2B∈ catalytic domain to 2.3 Å and genetic evidence that Glu569 plays a major role in the function of eIF2B. Protein Preparation, Crystallization, and Structure Determination— DNA encoding residues 524-712 was amplified by PCR using the pAV1693 plasmid as template (12Gomez E. Mohammad S.S. Pavitt G.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5292-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cleaved with Eco31I creating overhangs compatible with the NcoI and BamHI cloning sites of the pET24d vector into which it was ligated, resulting in a construct having the internal eIF2B∈ Met524 as start methionine. This construct was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Rosetta cells grown in a defined medium containing selenomethionine. The protein was purified to homogeneity by anion exchange chromatography. The columns were equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm EDTA) with 150 mm NaCl and eluted with a gradient to 500 mm NaCl in buffer A. Finally, the fragment was purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in buffer A with 100 mm NaCl and concentrated to 5-8 mg/ml prior to crystallization. Crystals were obtained at 5 °C by vapor diffusion of drops with equal volumes of protein and reservoir against a solution containing 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 23-25% PEG 2000 monomethyl ether, 100 mm Na citrate, pH 5.75. The crystals belong to the tetragonal space group I422 (a = 106.34 Å, c = 91.71 Å) with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen directly from the mother liquor supplemented with a few microliters of reservoir solution prior to data collection. Anomalous data collected from a selenomethionine-substituted crystal were collected at 100 K at the EMBL BW7A (Table I). The data were processed and scaled with MOSFLM and SCALA (15Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar), and multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phases were calculated with CNS (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16949) Google Scholar). After density modification a starting model containing 135 residues was build with ARP/wARP (17Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). This model was completed in O (18Jones T.A. Cowan S. Zou J.-Y. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar), and refined with CNS, using the MAD phases as restraints (Table I). Figures except for Fig. 2 were produced in MOLMOL (19Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51-55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6477) Google Scholar). The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1PAQ).Table IStatistics for data collection, phase determination and the final refinement for the eIF2B∈C Anomalous data were collected at the BW7A beamline at DESY.

The statistics for the Ramachandran plot are residues in most favored plus additionally favored regions/generously allowed regions/disallowed regions.

For yeast spot analysis, cell cultures were grown in SD to an A600 of 0.3. 5-fold serial dilutions were performed and 3 μl of each dilution spotted onto the appropriate media. Yeast strains KAY16 (MATα leu2-3 leu2-112 ura3-52 gcd6Δ gcn2::hisG pJB99[GCD6 URA3]) and GP4115 (MATα leu2-3 leu2-112 ura3-52 gcd6Δ gcn2::hisG pAV1732[SUI2 SUI3 GCD11 IMT4 2μ LEU2]) were used (12Gomez E. Mohammad S.S. Pavitt G.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5292-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Plasmid transformation employed the lithium acetate method (20Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Plasmid shuffling used 5-fluoro-orotic acid (21Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to introduce mutations into the coding region of eIF2B∈ (GCD6)inthe GCD6 LEU2 CEN plasmid pJB102 (22Bushman J.L. Asuru A.I. Matts R.L. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1920-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Details of all site-directed mutagenesis oligonucleotides used are provided in Supplementary Materials Table I. All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. For immunoblotting, proteins were resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Hybond P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were visualized by immunoblot using specific antisera as described (23Dever T.E. Yang W. Astrom S. Bystrom A.S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6351-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Structural Overview—The fragment used for structure determination contained residues Met524-Glu712 of eIF2B∈. Despite that no degradation was observed during crystallization, no residues beyond Asp544-Asp704 could be traced in either the experimental map calculated from MAD (24Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) phases based on data from three wavelengths collected from a selenomethionine-substituted crystal (Fig. 1) or in the final 2Fo - Fc map. Hence, the first 20 residues and the last 8 residues are disordered in the crystal. This may explain the Rfree value of 27.2% (Table I), which is slightly higher than expected. The residues in the N terminus may require residues upstream in eIF2B∈ or other residues in eIF2B to become ordered, whereas those in the C terminus may become ordered during complex formation with eIF2 (see below). Alternatively, phosphorylation of two conserved serines in the C terminus, as demonstrated for mammalian eIF2B∈, could have an effect on the structure of this region (4Wang X. Paulin F.E. Campbell L.E. Gomez E. O'Brien K. Morrice N. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The structured fragment of eIF2B∈ containing residues Asp544-Asp704 (eIF2B∈C) has overall dimensions of 47 × 43 × 32 Å. The protein is all-helical (Fig. 2) with α-helices I-VIII arranged in pairs with an angle between them of 129-166°. One such helical hairpin then packs against the next pair with an angle of 35-75°. This results in a left-handed superhelix with an axis approximately perpendicular to the axes of the individual helices (Fig. 3). There are also two 310 helices, the first in residues 619-624 is located right after helix IV, and the second with residues 684-686 prior to helix VIII. The protein has the overall appearance of a heart (Fig. 3, top) with helices III-VI forming the center, whereas helices I and II and VII-VIII are located on either side. Helices I, III, V, and VII form one surface of the molecule (the A-face), whereas the remaining helices are on the opposite side (the B-face). The three edges of the molecule can be named according to the contributing helices (Fig. 3). The N-edge is made from residues in the helices I and II, whereas helices VII and VIII contribute to the C-edge. Finally, the top edge contains residues from all helices. The structure can be divided into a structural core containing helices III-VIII with structural homology to other proteins onto which N-terminal helices I and II are attached. This core is organized around the two AA boxes (Figs. 2 and 3), which is shared with eIF5 and mammalian eIF4G. For both eIF2B∈ and eIF5 the AA boxes are required for interaction with the common binding partner, the N-terminal half of the β-subunit from eIF2 (8Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the exchange activity of eIF2B, eIF5 acts as a GAP by stimulating hydrolysis of GTP bound to eIF2γ in the preinitiation complex (25Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14039-14045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it is very likely that both eIF5 and eIF2B are in contact with the nucleotide binding pocket of eIF2γ although no such interaction has been reported. Structural Homology of eIF2B∈C to Other Proteins—The structure of eIF2B∈C is the first structure of a protein containing the AA boxes (see below). A search for homologous proteins with DALI (26Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar) reveals a similar arrangement of helices in several other proteins. The best Z-score, 12.0, is obtained by the 80-kDa subunit of the human nuclear cap binding complex (27Mazza C. Ohno M. Segref A. Mattaj I.W. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 383-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), where all eight helices in eIF2B∈C and eight helices within residues 497-651 in domain 3 of the large subunit of the complex can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 2.0 Å for 122 Cα atoms (Fig. 4). The second best match with a Z-score of 7.4 is obtained with a central fragment of initiation factor 4GII (MIF4G), and helices III-VIII of eIF2B∈C can be matched with the six N-terminal helices of MIF4G with an r.m.s.d. of 2.1 Å over 77 Cα atoms (Fig. 4) (28Marcotrigiano J. Lomakin I.B. Sonenberg N. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Importantly, this fragment does not contain the AA boxes, which are found at the C terminus of mammalian eIF4G. Because eIF2B acts as a GEF and eIF5 as a GAP, structural homology to other GEFs or GAPs is of interest. The only close structural homologues of eIF2B∈C detected in a DALI search are the Ras GEF (SOS) and GAP (p120GAP). Helices III-VIII of eIF2B∈C superimpose with six helices within residues 605-739 of SOS with a Z-score of 4.7 (78 Cα atoms with r.m.s.d. of 3.0 Å). However, the matching fragment of SOS is not part of the catalytic site of SOS, but rather involved in binding of a second Ras molecule, which has been characterized very recently (29Margarit S.M. Sondermann H. Hall B.E. Nagar B. Hoelz A. Pirruccello M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). After superimposition of eIF2B∈C onto the complex between SOS and two molecules of Ras, a loop region of eIF2B∈C containing non-conserved residues (Gln603-Asp609) comes close to both switch I and II of the second Ras molecule. Thus, the Gln603-609 loop could be implicated in binding to eIF2 and displacing GDP. An important role seems unlikely, however, as sequence is not well conserved among eIF2B∈ proteins in this region. The first six helices of eIF2B∈C can also be superimposed on six helices within residues 732-900 of p120GAP, the GAP of Ras (DALI score 6.1, r.m.s.d. of 2.0 Å for 66 Cα atoms), but in contrast to the three other cases, there is a very large insert between the second and the third matching helical hairpin of p120GAP. Nevertheless, this similarity superimposes the “GAP finger” Arg789 (30Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar) on the beginning of helix IV in eIF2B∈C, but as observed above for the SOS homology, the primary sequence in this area is also not well conserved between species (see below). The corresponding region is also poorly conserved in eIF5, the eIF2 GAP. If this region was important for GAP function in eIF5, it would most likely be better conserved. Hence, the similarity of eIF2B∈C (and by homology eIF5) to both the Ras GEF and GAP may indicate regions important for protein-protein interactions, but the low sequence conservation would imply the regions do not contain residues directly important for catalysis. The packing observed for helices III-VIII of eIF2B∈C is conserved within cap binding complex 80, MIF4G, and the SOS fragment. The resemblance of this helix arrangement in MIF4G to HEAT repeats has previously been described (28Marcotrigiano J. Lomakin I.B. Sonenberg N. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). HEAT repeats are often involved in protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions (31Andrade M.A. Petosa C. O'Donoghue S.I. Muller C.W. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The presence of helical repeats resembling HEAT repeats has now been observed in eIF4G and eIF2B, and must also be expected in eIF5 because of the conserved AA box motifs. Finally, eukaryotic elongation factor 3 (the “E” of HEAT) was one of the first proteins that was predicted to contain HEAT repeats (32Andrade M.A. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 115-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Thus it seems that such repeats are widespread among translation factors even though they often cannot be predicted from primary sequence alone, as demonstrated here for eIF2B∈C. The Surface Properties of eIF2B∈C—The surface properties of the fragment with respect to the distribution of charges and exposed conserved residues of putative functional importance are highly asymmetric (Fig. 3, middle and right column, respectively). The overall charge of the fragment is quite acidic with an isoelectric point of 4.3, and the surface electrostatic potential is dominated by a very large acidic belt, which starts at the N-edge, continues over the A-face over the top edge of the molecule, and ends at the B-face at the C terminus of helix VIII. A minor positively charged (basic) patch is located on the B-face and top edge around which the acidic belt is “tied.” The remaining charges are more or less randomly distributed (Fig. 3). The majority of the residues constituting the acidic belt and basic patch of eIF2B∈ are conserved. The acidic belt includes residues Asp564, Glu569, Glu548, Glu583, Asp634, Asp666, Glu670, Asp704, and Asp671, which are all highly conserved with respect to charge (the order of the listed residues following the direction of the belt as described above). Three of these residues, Glu670, Asp671, and Asp704, are conserved AA box residues (see below). The basic patch includes Arg574, Lys613, Lys623, and Arg624. As with the electrostatic potential, the exposed conserved residues are primarily found at the B-face, N-edge, and top edge (Fig. 3), and are roughly organized in two patches. The first of these contains residues from helices I and II and associated loops, whereas the second contains residues from helices VII-VIII and their associated loops. In this second area, residues from the AA boxes are dominating and the strictly conserved Tyr663, Glu670, Trp699, and Leu700 together with the highly conserved Ala703 form an exposed “handle” at the C-edge (Fig. 3). The AA Boxes—The AA boxes contain conserved aliphatic, aromatic and acidic residues (Fig. 2). The first box contains 12 conserved residues within amino acids Leu655-Trp676, which are all located within helices VI and VII (Fig. 5). The second box has eight conserved residues within amino acids Trp696-Glu706, of which the two last, Glu705 and Glu706, are disordered in our structure. This AA box is located at the C terminus of helix VIII. The first box is important for the structural integrity of the helix III-VIII core. Residues Ala658 in helix VI and Ile667 in the following loop contact helix IV and the following 310 helix, whereas Leu655 and Leu659 in helix VI together with the strictly conserved Trp676 in helix VII pack with helix V. The indole ring of the Trp676 also engages in a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn637, and furthermore, packs with side chains of Met636, Lys675, and Trp677. The strictly conserved Tyr663 is at the center of a cluster of five residues from the AA boxes linking helices VI-VIII (Fig. 5). It engages in van der Waal interactions with Glu670, Ile673, Trp696, and Leu700, which, except for the tryptophan, are strictly conserved in eIF2B∈. Furthermore, the hydroxy group of Tyr663 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain carboxyl group of Glu670. On one side this cluster is flanked by Tyr674, which fixes the end of helix VIII through a hydrogen bond from its hydroxy group to the side chain of Asp704, the last residue in our structure. To the other side Phe656 flanks the cluster. The N-terminal Helices—Although the two N-terminal helices are firmly associated with the six helical core of eIF2B∈C, residues 544-576 show significantly higher temperature factors (46.1 Å2) compared with amino acids 577-704 (34.8 Å2). This is not because of very high mobility of a few disordered residues, but rather a general trend for all atoms. Hence, these two helices are by average more mobile than the rest of the structure. This could be of functional importance for the exchange reaction, as these two helices are likely to be directly involved in catalysis, but may also be caused by missing residues from either eIF2B∈ itself or the other subunits of eIF2B. One indication in favor of their functional importance is that these two helices and the loop to helix III contain three strictly conserved residues. Strictly conserved residues are otherwise only found in the AA boxes. A direct function of residues from the two helices in catalysis is also supported by genetic and biochemical data (12Gomez E. Mohammad S.S. Pavitt G.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5292-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (see also below). The interface between helices I-II and the rest of the molecule is not extensive in agreement with the elevated temperature factors. Central contacts are formed by the packing of Met557 and Leu563 with Arg595 and Trp618 from helic"
https://openalex.org/W2023357287,"Two gene clusters each encoding the cyanophycin-metabolism enzymes cyanophycin synthetase and cyanophycinase are found in the heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. In cluster cph1, the genes cphB1 and cphA1 were expressed in media containing ammonium, nitrate, or N2 as nitrogen sources, but expression was higher in the absence of combined nitrogen taking place both in vegetative cells and heterocysts. Both genes were cotranscribed from three putative promoters located upstream of cphB1, and, additionally, the cphA1 gene was expressed monocistronically from at least two promoters located in the intergenic cphB1-cphA1 region. Both constitutive promoters and promoters dependent on the global nitrogen control transcriptional regulator NtcA were identified. In cluster cph2, the cphB2 and cphA2 genes, which are found in opposite orientations, were expressed as monocistronic messages in media containing ammonium, nitrate, or N2, but expression was higher in the absence of ammonium. Expression of the cph2 genes was lower than that of cph1 genes. Analysis of cph gene insertional mutants indicated that cluster cph1 genes contributed more than cluster cph2 genes to cyanophycin accumulation in the whole filament as well as in heterocysts. Diazotrophic growth was more severely impaired in cyanophycinase than in cyanophycin synthetase mutants, indicating that cyanophycin, although normally synthesized in the heterocysts, is not required for heterocyst function and that the inability to degrade this polymer is detrimental for the diazotrophic growth of the cyanobacterium.

Cyanobacteria are oxygenic photoautotrophs that make an important contribution to primary productivity in our planet. They fix CO2 through the reductive penthose phosphate pathway and preferentially assimilate inorganic sources of nitrogen. Many cyanobacteria are able to carry out the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, and, as a way to protect the nitrogen fixation machinery from oxygen, some filamentous strains differentiate cells called heterocysts where nitrogenase is confined (1Wolk C.P. Ernst A. Elhai J. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1994: 769-823Crossref Google Scholar). Nitrogen fixed in the heterocysts is donated, probably in the form of amino acids, to the rest of cells in the filament by a mechanism not yet understood that may involve the operation of amino acid uptake permeases (2Montesinos M.L. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3150-3157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that might be related to the accumulation of cyanophycin (see below) in the heterocyst. The differentiation of heterocysts and the assimilation of nitrogen in cyanobacteria are subjected to nutritional repression by ammonium (3Flores E. Herrero A. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 487-517Crossref Google Scholar). In the absence of ammonium, the transcriptional regulator NtcA activates expression of many genes encoding elements of the pathways for the assimilation of nitrogen or involved in the differentiation and function of the heterocyst (4Herrero A. Muro-Pastor A.M. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). NtcA is homologous to transcriptional regulators of the CAP family and directly binds to the promoter regions of nitrogen-regulated genes at specific DNA sites with the consensus sequence GTAN8TAC frequently centered at -41.5 and located upstream from a σ70-consensus -10 box in the form TAN3T (4Herrero A. Muro-Pastor A.M. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Cyanophycin is a nonribosomically synthesized peptide composed of multi-l-arginyl-poly-l-aspartate (α-amino groups of arginine residues linked to β-carboxyl groups of a polyaspartate backbone) that until very recently was considered exclusive of cyanobacteria. In these organisms, cyanophycin accumulates in the cytoplasm in the form of granules mainly under unbalanced growth conditions (e.g. under stationary phase or under starvation conditions that do not involve nitrogen starvation) (5Allen M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 6Simon R.D. Fay P. van Baalen C. The Cyanobacteria. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 199-225Google Scholar). It is considered that cyanophycin can represent a dynamic reserve of nitrogen; e.g. in Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, which temporarily separates N2 fixation and photosynthesis, cyanophycin is degraded during the light period and is formed during the period of darkness, when N2 fixation is operative (7Sherman L.A. Meunier P. Colón-López M.S. Photosyn. Res. 1998; 58: 25-42Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the N2-fixing heterocyst, cyanophycin accumulates, forming conspicuous deposits in the cellular poles adjacent to the vegetative cells (e.g. see Ref. 8Sherman D.M. Tucker D. Sherman L.A. J. Phycol. 2000; 36: 932-941Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A cyanophycin-synthesizing enzyme, called cyanophycin synthetase, has been identified that could add both l-aspartic acid and l-arginine to a cyanophycin primer (9Simon R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 422: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recently, cyanophycin synthetase has been purified from the heterocystforming Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 and characterized as a homodimer of a 100-kDa subunit (10Ziegler K. Diener A. Herpin C. Richter R. Deutzmann R. Lockau W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid sequence from this protein, the corresponding gene, cphA, has been identified in the genomic sequence of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and then in Anabaena variabilis (10Ziegler K. Diener A. Herpin C. Richter R. Deutzmann R. Lockau W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). On the other hand, based on analysis of the products of cyanophycin degradation by crude or fractionated cell extracts of different cyanobacteria, two different enzymatic activities have been implicated in cyanophycin degradation: an exopeptidase, called cyanophycinase, that would produce β-Asp-Arg dipeptides (11Gupta M. Carr N.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 125: 17-23Google Scholar) and a peptidase that would hydrolyze this peptide. Recently, the gene cphB encoding a cyanophycinase has been identified in the genomic sequence of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (12Richter R. Hejazi M. Kraft R. Ziegler K. Lockau W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and ORFs 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; tsp, transcription start point. of both Synechocystis sp. and Anabaena sp. have been described to encode plant-type asparaginases able to hydrolyze β-Asp-Arg bonds and that, thus, may be responsible for the last step of cyanophycin degradation (13Hejazi M. Piotukh K. Mattow J. Deutzmann R. Volkmer-Engert R. Lockau W. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cphB and cphA genes have also been identified in whole genome sequence projects of several cyanobacteria. Putative cyanophycin synthetase genes have recently been identified in the genomic sequences of a number of eubacteria different from cyanobacteria (14Krehenbrink M. Oppermann-Sanio F.B. Steinbüchel A. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 177: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and those from Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 (14Krehenbrink M. Oppermann-Sanio F.B. Steinbüchel A. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 177: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and Desulfitobacterium hafniense (15Ziegler K. Deutzmann R. Lockau W. Z. Naturforsch. C. 2002; 57: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have proven able to direct the synthesis of cyanophycin-like polymers when expressed in Escherichia coli. Moreover, 11 eubacteria different from cyanobacteria have been found to be able to utilize cyanophycin as a carbon source for growth based on the action of extracellular cyanophycinases. The product of the so-called cphE gene from Pseudomonas anguilliseptica strain BI, although exhibiting only 27–28% amino acid sequence identity to intracellular cyanophycinases occurring in cyanobacteria, catalyzes a very specific degradation of cyanophycin to β-Asp-Arg dipeptides (16Obst M. Oppermann-Sanio F.B. Luftmann H. Steinbüchel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25096-25105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, cyanophycin appears to occur in a wide range of bacteria that make use of diverse metabolic options including phototrophy, aerobic and anaerobic respiration, fermentation, and chemolithoautotrophy, where it can serve, perhaps among other functions, as a nitrogen reserve or an external carbon source. Therefore, cyanophycin seems to have a role in the biology of bacteria much wider than previously recognized. The present work deals with the genetic systems for cyanophycin synthesis and degradation in the filamentous, heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, which is amenable to genetic manipulation and whose entire genomic sequence is available (17Kaneko T. Nakamura Y. Wolk C.P. Kuritz T. Sasamoto S. Watanabe A. Iriguchi M. Ishikawa A. Kawashima K. Kimura T. Kishida Y. Kohara M. Matsumoto M. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Shimpo S. Sugimoto M. Takazawa M. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 227-253Crossref Google Scholar). The regulation of the expression of cyanophycin metabolism genes with regard to the nitrogen regime and cell type in the diazotrophic filament has been studied, and the involvement of cyanophycin in diazotrophic metabolism has been investigated through the generation of cyanophycin metabolism gene mutants. Strains and Growth Conditions—This study was carried out with the heterocyst forming cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and an insertional mutant of the ntcA gene, strain CSE2 (18Frías J.E. Flores E. Herrero A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 was grown axenically in BG11 medium, which contains 17.6 mm NaNO3 (19Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar), in BG110 (nitrogen-free) medium or in BG110 medium supplemented with 8 mm NH4Cl and 16 mm TES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5). Strain CSE2 was grown in ammonium-containing medium in the presence of 2 μg ml-1 of streptomycin and 2 μg ml-1 of spectinomycin. For plates, the medium was solidified with 1% separately autoclaved agar (Difco). Liquid cultures were incubated at 30 °C in the light (75 microeinsteins m-2 s-1), with shaking (80–90 rpm). Anabaena mutants carrying gene cassette C.K3 (20Mazodier P. Cossart P. Giraud E. Gasser F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) were routinely grown in medium supplemented with 5–25 μg ml-1 neomycin, mutants carrying cassette C.S3 (21Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar) were grown in medium supplemented with 2–5 μgml-1 Sm and Sp, and mutants carrying cat and erm genes, encoding for CmR and EmR, respectively, (SalI-XhoI fragment from plasmid pRL271) (22Black T.A. Cai Y. Wolk C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) were grown in medium supplemented with 5 μgml-1 Em. Growth rates were estimated from the increase in protein concentration of the cultures, determined by a modified Lowry procedure (23Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar) in 0.2-ml aliquots periodically withdrawn from the cultures. The growth rate constant (μ) corresponded to ln 2/td, where td represents the doubling time. Mutant Construction—To inactivate gene cphB1, a 1.63-kb DNA fragment from the cph1 region of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides CB1–1 (corresponding to nucleotides +8 to +29 with respect to the translation start of cphB1) and CA1–3 (complementary to nucleotides +536 to +519 relative to the translation start of cphA1) and genomic DNA from strain PCC 7120 as template. PCR products were cloned in vector pGEM-T (Promega) to generate plasmid pCSS37. The C.K3 gene cassette excised with SmaI (24Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) was inserted into the BclI site that is present in the Anabaena DNA insert of pCSS37 to generate plasmid pCSS38. The SpeI-ScaI fragment from pCSS38, filled in with Klenow enzyme, was ligated to the sacB-containing vector pRL277 (22Black T.A. Cai Y. Wolk C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) linearized with EcoRV, rendering plasmid pCSS39. The sacB gene determines sensitivity to sucrose and can be counterselected for in Anabaena sp., allowing positive selection for double recombinants (25Cai Y.P. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To inactivate gene cphA1, a 2-kb DNA fragment from the cph1 region of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides CA1–1 (corresponding to nucleotides +43 to +63 relative to the translation start of cphA1) and CA1–2 (complementary to nucleotides +2029 to +2009 relative to the translation start of cphA1) and genomic DNA from strain PCC 7120 as template. PCR products were cloned in vector pGEM-T to generate plasmid pCSS33. A 15-bp DNA fragment from pCSS33 was excised with EcoRV and substituted by the C.S3 gene-cassette excised with HindIII (24Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and filled in with Klenow enzyme, rendering plasmid pCSS34. The SalI-NcoI fragment from pCSS34, filled in with Klenow enzyme, was ligated to the sacB-containing vector pRL278 (22Black T.A. Cai Y. Wolk C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) digested with NruI, rendering plasmid pCSS35. To inactivate gene cphB2, a 2-kb DNA fragment from the cph2 region of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides CB2-1 (complementary to nucleotides +1654 to +1636 with respect to the translation start of cphB2) and CB2-2 (corresponding to nucleotides -386 to -366 with respect to the translation start of cphB2) and genomic DNA from strain PCC 7120 as template. PCR products were cloned in vector pGEM-T to generate plasmid pCSS50. The C.S3 gene cassette excised with HindIII was inserted into the HindIII site that is present in the Anabaena DNA insert of pCSS50, rendering plasmid pCSS51. The PvuII fragment from pCSS51 was ligated to the sacB-containing vector pRL271 (22Black T.A. Cai Y. Wolk C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), digested with BglII, and filled in with Klenow enzyme, rendering plasmid pCSS52. To inactivate gene cphA2, a 1.7-kb DNA fragment from the cph2 region of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides CA2–2-XhoI (complementary to nucleotides +1783 to +1762 relative to the translation start of cphA2 and ended with a XhoI restriction site) and CA2-3-XhoI (corresponding to nucleotides +60 to +77 relative to the translation start of cphA2 and ended with a XhoI restriction site). PCR products were cloned in vector pGEM-T to generate plasmid pCSS53. The EmR/CmR gene cassette (containing erm and cat genes) excised with XbaI from plasmid pCSE52, which contains the SalI-XhoI fragment from pRL271 cloned in vector pIC20R, and filled with Klenow enzyme was inserted into the Eco47III site that is present in the Anabaena DNA insert of pCSS53, rendering plasmid pCSS54. The XhoI fragment from pCSS54 was ligated to the sacB-containing vector pRL278 digested with XhoI, rendering plasmid pCSS55. Constructs generated in vitro bearing a gene cassette inserted into cphB1, cphA1, cphB2, or cphA2 and cloned in sacB-containing vectors were transferred by conjugation (26Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) to Anabaena sp. to generate strains bearing mutations in the cph1 or/and cph2 genomic regions. For generation of strains CSS7, CSS13, CSS21, and CSS25, E. coli strain HB101 containing plasmid pCSS35, pCSS39, pCSS52, or pCSS55 and helper plasmids pRL528 (26Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and pRL591-W45 (27Elhai J. Cai Y. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5059-5067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or pRL623 (28Elhai J. Vepritskiy A. Muro-Pastor A.M. Flores E. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1998-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) was mixed with E. coli ED8654 carrying the conjugative plasmid pRL443 and thereafter with Anabaena sp. For the generation of double mutants, plasmids pCSS39 and pCSS55 were transferred to strain CSS7 to generate strains CSS35 and CSS27, respectively, plasmid pCSS52 was transferred to strain CSS13 to generate strain CSS23, and plasmid pCSS55 was transferred to strain CSS21 to generate strain CSS36. Exconjugants were isolated (26Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), and double recombinants were identified as clones resistant to the antibiotic for which resistance was encoded in the inserted gene cassette, resistant to sucrose, and sensitive to the antibiotic for which the resistance determinant was present in the vector portion of the transferred plasmid and were confirmed by PCR analysis. Homozygous mutant clones were selected for this study. DNA Isolation and Analysis—Total DNA from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and its derivatives was isolated as previously described (25Cai Y.P. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). For sequencing ladders used in primer extension analysis, sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chain termination method, using a T7-Sequencing™ kit (Amersham Biosciences) and [α-35S]thio-dATP. DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels with the Geneclean II kit (BIO 101). Southern blot analysis, plasmid isolation from E. coli, transformation of E. coli, digestion of DNA with restriction endonucleases, ligation with T4 ligase, and PCR were performed by standard procedures (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green/Wiley-Interscience, New York2003Google Scholar). Band Shift Assays—DNA fragments to be used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays were obtained by PCR amplification. Oligonucleotides CB1–4 (corresponding to positions -697 to -679 relative to the translation start of cphB1), CB1–5 (complementary to positions -250 to -272 relative to the translation start of cphB1), CB1–7 (complementary to positions -458 to -477 relative to the translation start of cphB1), and CB1–9 (corresponding to positions -485 to -465 relative to the translation start of cphB1) and plasmid pCSS68, containing the cphB1 promoter sequence (cloned by PCR with oligonucleotides CB1–4 and CB1–5 in vector pGEM-T), were used to obtain DNA fragments of the cphB1 upstream region. Oligonucleotides CA1–6 (corresponding to positions -214 to -196 relative to the translation start of cphA1) and CA1–5 (complementary to positions +16 to -3 relative to the translation start of cphA1) and plasmid pCSS37 as a template were used for PCR amplification of the cphA1 upstream region. For competition tests, a DNA fragment from the region upstream from glnA containing an NtcA-binding site (18Frías J.E. Flores E. Herrero A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) was used as a specific binding fragment, and a DNA fragment of the pBluescript vector was used as a nonspecific fragment. In the case of the glnA upstream region, oligonucleotides GA3 (corresponding to positions -238 to -215 relative to the translation start of glnA) and GA6 (complementary to positions -70 to -87 relative to the translation start of glnA) and plasmid pAN503 (30Tumer N.E. Robinson S.J. Haselkorn R. Nature. 1983; 306: 337-342Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) were used for PCR. In the case of the pBluescript DNA fragment, oligonucleotides Forward and Reverse were used, rendering a DNA fragment of 220 nucleotides. DNA fragments were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) and [γ-32P]dATP as described previously (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green/Wiley-Interscience, New York2003Google Scholar). Assays were carried out as described previously (31Luque I. Flores E. Herrero A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2862-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with 1 fmol of labeled fragment and 0.1–3 μm of NtcA purified from E. coli strain DH5α (pCSAM61) bearing the strain PCC 7120 ntcA gene cloned in pTrc99A vector (Amersham Biosciences) and thus expressed from the trc promoter. Images of radioactive gels were obtained using a Cyclone storage phosphor system (Packard). RNA Isolation and Analysis—Cells used for RNA isolation were exponentially growing in the light (75 microeinsteins m-2 s-1) in liquid BG11 or BG110 media (19Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) or in medium BG110 containing 8 mm NH4Cl and 16 mm TES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5), supplemented with 10 mm of NaHCO3 and bubbled with air and CO2 (1%, v/v). Alternatively, filaments growing in ammonium-containing medium were harvested at room temperature and either used directly or washed with and resuspended in BG110 medium and further incubated under culture conditions for the number of hours indicated in each experiment. For the isolation of RNA from heterocysts, cells were grown in ammonium-containing medium until they reached a chlorophyll a concentration of 3–5 μg ml-1. Filaments were then washed with and resuspended in nitrogen-free medium (BG110) and further incubated until mature heterocysts were observed (19 h). Heterocysts were then isolated as described (32Golden J.W. Whorff L.L. Wiest D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7098-7105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from whole filaments or from isolated heterocysts was isolated in the presence of ribonucleoside-vanadyl complex as previously described (33Muro-Pastor A.M. Valladares A. Flores E. Herrero A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For Northern analysis, 40–70 μg of RNA were loaded per lane and subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose denaturating formaldehyde gels. Transfer and fixation to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences) were carried out using 0.1 m NaOH. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C according to the recommendations of the manufacturer of the membranes. The cph probes were internal fragments of these genes amplified by PCR, using plasmid pCSS33 as a template and oligonucleotides CA1–1 and CA1–2 (see above) in the case of the cphA1 probe; plasmid pCSS37 as a template and oligonucleotides CB1–1 (see above) and CB1–2 (complementary to nucleotides +885 to +864 with respect to the translation start of cphB1) for the cphB1 probe; plasmid pCSS53 as a template and oligonucleotides CA2–2 and CA2–3 (see above) for the cphA2 probe; and plasmid pCSS50 as a template and oligonucleotides CB2–3 (complementary to nucleotides +858 to +840 with respect to the translation start of cphB2) and CB2–4 (corresponding to nucleotides +76 to +95 with respect to the translation start of cphB2) in the case of the cphB2 probe. All probes were 32P-labeled with a Ready to Go™ DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) using [α-32P]dCTP. Images of radioactive filters and gels were obtained with a Cyclone storage phosphor system and OptiQuant image analysis software (Packard). The rnpB gene, which encodes a stable RNA (34Vioque A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3471-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was used as an RNA loading and transfer control. Primer extension analysis of the cph transcripts was carried out as previously described (35Muro-Pastor A.M. Valladares A. Flores E. Herrero A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6664-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides CB1–6 (complementary to nucleotides -198 to -220 with respect to the translation start of cphB1) and CB1–5 (see above) for the case of cphB1 and CA1–4 (complementary to nucleotides +74 to +55 with respect to the translation start of cphA1) and CA1–5 (see above) for the case of cphA1. Cyanophycin Measurements—Cells subjected to a treatment to force cyanophycin accumulation were used. Cells of 150-ml liquid cultures in BG11 medium supplemented with 10 mm NaHCO3 and bubbled with air and CO2 (1%) were harvested in the exponential growth phase (2–5 μg of Chl ml-1), washed twice with BG110 medium, and used to inoculate 150-ml cultures in BG110 medium supplemented with bicarbonate and bubbled with air and CO2 (1%). These cultures were then incubated for about 8 h under culture conditions. After this incubation, NH4NO3 was added at 4 mm final concentration, and the cultures were incubated under dim light (5 microeinsteins m-2 s-1) for 12–14 h. Cells from 100 ml of these cultures were collected at room temperature, washed twice with, and resuspended in, milliQ-purified and autoclaved H2O, and disrupted with a French Press (twice at 20,000 p.s.i.). After measuring the obtained volume of cell extract, chlorophyll a was determined in a 100-μl sample. The remnant of each extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm in a SS34 rotor, the resulting supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were washed twice with 11 ml of milliQ-purified, autoclaved H2O and resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 m HCl. After 2–4 h of incubation at room temperature and centrifugation under the same conditions, the resulting supernatants were stored. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 m HCl, incubated overnight at room temperature, and again subjected to centrifugation. The obtained supernatants were combined with those obtained after the first centrifugation, stored at 4 °C, for no longer than 1 week, and used for arginine determination, which was carried out by the Sakaguchi method as modified by Messineo (36Messineo L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 117: 534-540Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Microscopy—Cells grown during 7–10 days in shaken BG110 liquid medium were observed and photographed with a Zeiss Axioscop microscope equipped with an MC 80 camera.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Tor1/2 serine/threonine kinases are global regulators situated at the top of a signal cascade reported to receive and transmit nutritional signals associated with the nitrogen supply of the cell. At the other end of that cascade is Gln3, one of two transcriptional activators responsible for most nitrogen catabolic gene expression. When nitrogen is in excess, Tor1/2 are active, and Gln3 is phosphorylated and localizes to the cytoplasm. If Tor1/2 are inhibited by rapamycin or mutation, Gln3 becomes dephosphorylated, accumulates in the nucleus, and mediates nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)-sensitive transcription. The observations that Gln3 also accumulates in the nuclei of cells provided with poor nitrogen sources or during nitrogen starvation has led to the conclusion that Tor1/2 control intracellular Gln3 localization and NCR-sensitive transcription by regulating Gln3 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. To test this model, we compared Gln3 phosphorylation states and intracellular localizations under a variety of physiological conditions known to elicit different levels of NCR-sensitive transcription. Our data indicate that: (i) observable Gln3 phosphorylation levels do not correlate in a consistent way with the quality or quantity of the nitrogen source provided, the intracellular localization of Gln3, or the capacity to support NCR-sensitive transcription. (ii) Gln3-Myc13 is hyperphosphorylated during nitrogen and carbon starvation, but this uniform response does not correlate with Gln3 intracellular localization. (iii) Gln3-Myc13 dephosphorylation and nuclear localization correlate with one another at early but not late times after rapamycin treatment. These data suggest that rapamycin treatment and growth with poor nitrogen sources bring about nuclear accumulation of Gln3 but likely do so by different mechanisms or by a common mechanism involving molecules other than Gln3 and/or other than the levels of Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation thus far detected by others and ourselves.

The ability to sense and respond to a constantly changing and sometimes hostile environment is critical to the survival of free living organisms. To cope with these demands, cells have evolved sophisticated signal transduction pathways that sense important components of their environment, such as nitrogen and carbon supplies. These transduction pathways culminate in the activation of transcription factors that adjust gene expression to maximize the potential for survival, growth, and reproduction. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Tor1 and Tor2 are thought to be central components of the transduction pathway responsible for collecting, integrating, and responding to nutritional signals. Tor1/2 are serine/threonine kinases that also possess regions of homology with phosphatidylinositol 3-lipid kinases (1Barbet N.C. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N.

S. cerevisiae are able to utilize good nitrogen sources (e.g. glutamine and in some strains ammonia) in preference to poor ones (e.g. proline, urea). This capability derives from a regulatory process designated nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR). 1The abbreviations used are: NCR, nitrogen catabolite repression; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; SC medium, synthetic complete medium.1The abbreviations used are: NCR, nitrogen catabolite repression; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; SC medium, synthetic complete medium.

Ure2 complexes with phosphorylated Gln3 and prevents its nuclear entry either because (i) the phosphorylated form of Gln3, stabilized in the complex, is unable to enter the nucleus (13Bertram P.G.

Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Tor1/2 by rapamycin prevents Tor1/2-mediated phosphorylation reactions and thereby generates the opposite outcomes, i.e. Gln3 dephosphorylation, dissociation of the Gln3·Ure2 complex, nuclear localization of Gln3, and derepressed NCR-sensitive gene expression. The above model is based on several correlations. (i) Inactivation of Tor1/2 by rapamycin treatment results in derepressed expression of many NCR-sensitive genes, nuclear localization of Gln3, dissociation of Gln3 from its negative regulator Ure2, and dephosphorylation of Gln3 (10Beck T.

The most difficult observations to rectify were from studies of Gln3 localization in cells transferred from minimal glutamine to minimal proline medium or after the addition of rapamycin to ammonia- or glutamine-grown cultures. Both the time courses of and extents to which Gln3 accumulated in nuclei after these transfers was dependent upon the nitrogen source provided (20Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol.

This was unexpected because rapamycin specifically inhibits Tor1/2 that are posited to be situated downstream of the nutrient supply signal (10Beck T. Hall M.N.

More recently, Gln3-Myc13 accumulation in the nuclei of cells transferred from glucose-glutamine to glucose-proline medium was shown to require an intact actin cytoskeleton, whereas similar nuclear accumulation of Gln3-Myc13 in response to rapamycin treatment does not exhibit this requirement. 2K. H. Cox, J. J. Tate, and T. G. Cooper, submitted for publication.2K. H. Cox, J. J. Tate, and T. G. Cooper, submitted for publication. These observations prompted us to revisit the published correlative data and query whether we could find additional information that would resolve this paradox. Although we could confirm all of the previously reported correlations we tested, two critical correlations required by the current Tor1/2 model have not been tested, i.e. the electrophoretic mobility of Gln3 as a function of good versus poor nitrogen sources and quantitative comparison of Gln3 nuclear accumulation and electrophoretic mobility after changes in the nutritional environment of a cell. Results of experiments designed to provide this missing information indicate that the detectable extent of Gln3 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation does not correlate with its intracellular localization in good versus poor nitrogen sources. Further, the only condition for which Gln3 dephosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Gln3 do correlate in a consistent way is at early, but not late, times after rapamycin treatment. These data suggest that rapamycin inhibition of Tor1/2 generates the same outcomes with respect to intracellular Gln3 localization as growth in a poor nitrogen source but do not support the contention that this intracellular localization is the result of changes in Gln3 phosphorylation which have thus far been detected by others and ourselves. Strains and Media—S. cerevisiae strain TB123 (MATa leu2–3,112, ura3–52, rme1, trp1, his4, GAL+, HMLa, GLN3-Myc13[KanMX]) (10Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) was grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase (A600 nm = 0.4–0.5) in YNB (without ammonium sulfate or amino acids), containing 2% glucose, 120 μg/ml leucine, 20 μg/ml uracil, 20 μg/ml histidine, 20 μg/ml tryptophan, and the nitrogen source (0.1% final concentration) noted in the figure legend. Rapamycin (dissolved in 10% Tween 20 + 90% ethanol) was added directly to the medium in which cells had grown overnight (final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml). Experiments, in which yeast were transferred into carbon or nitrogen starvation media, were performed as described previously (20Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Media contained the required auxotrophic supplements as noted above. Samples were collected at the indicated times for immunofluorescence assays or protein or RNA isolation. Strain differences have significantly influenced results from studies of the Tor1/2 regulatory pathway and complicated their interpretation (22Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36924-36933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To avoid such strain differences and complications here, we performed the present analyses with the same strain initially used to demonstrate Tor1/2 regulation of intracellular Gln3 localization (10Beck T. Hall M.N.

A parallel correlation is observed when cells growing in rich medium are treated with rapamycin, i.e. Gln3 localizes to the cytoplasm of untreated cells but accumulates in the nuclei of most treated cells (data not shown) (1Barbet N.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Northern blots were performed as described earlier (20Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Western Analysis—Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 3,000 rpm and 4 °C), resuspended in ice-cold extraction buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and a commercial mixture of protease inhibitors (Minicomplete, Roche Applied Science) and lysed with glass beads by vortex mixing (four times for 20 s each with 30-s intervening cooling intervals on ice). Unbroken cells and glass beads were removed by centrifugation for 1 min at 9,000 rpm, 4 °C, and the supernatant was clarified further by centrifugation for 15 min at 9,000 rpm, 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay. Samples for electrophoresis were diluted with sample buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. They were then resolved by SDS-PAGE (6% polyacrylamide) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer without SDS (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates, Brooklyn, NY1991Google Scholar). The membrane was incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of 9E10(c-myc) (Covance MMS-150P) monoclonal antibody. The membrane was then washed and incubated with a 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG (H-L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad). After washing, immunoreactive species were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate, Bio-Rad). We observed too much variation in the intensity of staining in duplicate samples to permit quantitative lane-to-lane comparisons of the amounts of Gln3-Myc13 protein that were present. Phosphatase Treatment—Crude protein extracts were prepared as described above with the following extraction buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a commercial mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The crude extracts were incubated with 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Diagnostics) or 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase plus phosphatase inhibitor, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, for 10 min at 30 °C. Samples were boiled 5 min prior to loading onto the gel. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described by Cox et al. (20Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Gln3-Myc13 was visualized using 9E10(c-myc) (Covance MMS-150P) monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000 and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:200. Nuclei were stained with DAPI as described previously (20Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope with a 100× Plan-Apochromat 1.40 oil objective. Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axio camera using AxioVision 3.0 (Zeiss) software. For quantitation of intracellular Gln3 localization, at least 100 cells from randomly selected fields were counted. Gln3-Myc13 Phosphorylation Profiles Generated in Response to Nitrogen Limitation Differ from Those Generated by Rapamycin Treatment—A critical correlation required by the current model describing Tor1/2 regulation of NCR-sensitive transcription is that Gln3 be dephosphorylated in cells provided with a poor nitrogen source and phosphorylated when cells are growing in rich medium. To test this correlation, we compared Gln3 phosphorylation (assayed by its electrophoretic mobility in Western blots) in rapamycin-treated cells versus cells provided with nitrogen sources ranging from good to poor. Ordered by the levels of NCR-sensitive transcription they support, the poor to good nitrogen sources we used were proline > urea > ammonia > synthetic complete (SC) > glutamine (26Cooper T.G. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 39-99Google Scholar, data not shown). Gln3-Myc13 mobility is slower in cells provided with glutamine, a rich nitrogen source, than it is when glutamine-grown cells are treated with rapamycin (Fig. 2, all panels, lanes A versus B and F versus E), precisely the results expected if Gln3-Myc13 were phosphorylated in the former case and dephosphorylated in the latter (10Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 13Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.-F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Because these results are identical to those observed by multiple laboratories after rapamycin treatment of cells provided with rich nitrogen sources, we used these conditions in all subsequent experiments to establish positive and negative electrophoretic mobility standards. Gln3-Myc13 mobilities observed with rapamycin-treated and untreated ammonia-grown cells were similar to those seen with glutamine as nitrogen source (Fig. 2A, lanes C and D). This was the expected result because ammonia, like glutamine, is a good nitrogen source. With SC medium results were similar, but not identical, to those with glutamine and ammonia (Fig. 2B, lanes C and D). Gln3-Myc13 mobility increased upon rapamycin treatment but not to the same degree observed with glutamine or ammonia. When this experiment was repeated with proline, a poor nitrogen source, we expected to see the more rapidly migrating species characteristic of dephosphorylated, nuclear localized Gln3-Myc13, both before and after rapamycin treatment. However, only the slower mobility species were observed irrespective of whether or not rapamycin was added to the proline-grown cultures (Fig. 2C, lanes C and D). In fact, if anything, Gln3-Myc13 migrated slightly slower in proline-grown, rapamycin-treated cells than in untreated cells. When cells provided with urea were analyzed, Gln3-Myc13 again unexpectedly migrated less rapidly in the absence of rapamycin treatment, but like ammonia, more rapidly when rapamycin was added to the medium (Fig. 2D, lanes C and D). In sum, Gln3-Myc13 electrophoretic mobility did not correlate with either the localization of Gln3-Myc13 or the levels of NCR-sensitive transcription supported by the various nitrogen sources. The above data suggested that Gln3-Myc13 electrophoretic mobility failed to correlate with intracellular localization and NCR-sensitive transcription predicted by the Tor1/2 regulatory model. Because these observations were not consistent with expectations, we were concerned that we might have missed small differences in the mobilities of Gln3 derived from cells provided with the nitrogen sources described"
https://openalex.org/W2170938209,"Several studies have demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are cytotoxic. The responsible mechanisms, however, are not well understood. MMPs may promote cytotoxicity through their ability to disrupt or degrade matrix proteins that support cell survival, and MMPs may also cleave substrates to generate molecules that stimulate cell death. In addition, MMPs may themselves act on cell surface receptors that affect cell survival. Among such receptors is the α2β1 integrin, a complex that has previously been linked to leukocyte death. In the present study we show that human neurons express α2β1 and that pro-MMP-1 interacts with this integrin complex. We also show that stimulation of neuronal cultures with MMP-1 is associated with a rapid reduction in the phosphorylation of Akt, a kinase that can influence caspase activity and cell survival. Moreover, MMP-1-associated dephosphorylation of Akt is inhibited by a blocking antibody to the α2 integrin, but not by batimastat, an inhibitor of MMP-1 enzymatic activity. Such dephosphorylation is also stimulated by a catalytic mutant of pro-MMP-1. Additional studies show that MMP-1 causes neuronal death, which is significantly diminished by both a general caspase inhibitor and anti-α2 but not by batimastat. Together, these results suggest that MMP-1 can stimulate dephosphorylation of Akt and neuronal death through a non-proteolytic mechanism that involves changes in integrin signaling.

The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; Akt, protein kinase B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. represent a family of endopeptidases named for their ability to degrade extracellular matrix components. These proteinases play a role in tissue remodeling associated with both development and disease (1Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs.

In the central nervous system MMPs are released by cells including activated astrocytes, microglia, and neurons (8Gottschall P.E. Yu X. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Yong V.W. Krekoski C.A. Forsyth P.A. Bell R. Edwards D.R. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 75-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Previously, we and others have shown that MMPs can be toxic to neurons in vitro (10Johnston J.B.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2665-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it is also reasonable to consider the non-mutually exclusive possibility that other mechanisms are involved. One extracellular matrix-independent mechanism by which MMPs may function involves their ability to cleave non-matrix proteins and thereby generate potential cell surface receptor signaling ligands (15Fowlkes J.L. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25742-25746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fernandez-Patron C. Radomski M.W. Davidge S.T. Circ.

Blood. 2000; 96: 2673-2681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another mechanism by which MMPs could affect cell survival might include direct effects on cell surface receptors. For example, MMP-9 binds to CD44 (20Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), MMP-2 binds to integrin αvβ3 (21Brooks P.C. Stromblad S.

Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar), and pro-MMP-1 binds to integrins α2β1 and α1β1 (22Stricker T.P. Dumin J.A. Dickeson S.K. Chung L.

Such binding interactions may facilitate activation of the pro-enzyme, localize enzyme activity, disrupt cell matrix interactions to promote cell motility, and/or mediate internalization of the protease. Cell surface receptor binding by an MMP may also alter intracellular signaling. It has been shown that the snake venom metalloproteinase jararhagin can signal via α2β1 on fibroblasts in a manner that is insensitive to inhibition of proteinase activity (23Zigrino P. Kamiguti A.S.

In addition, we have shown that MMP-1 can stimulate protein release from neurons and monocytes in a manner that is insensitive to inhibition of its enzymatic activity (24Conant K. Haughey N. Nath A. St Hillaire C. Gary D.S. Pardo C.A. Wahl L.M. Bilak M. Milward E. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results fit into a growing literature suggesting that enzymes can stimulate biological effects in a manner that is independent of their catalytic activity (25Grisaru D. Sternfeld M. Eldor A. Glick D. Soreq H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 672-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26Stepanova V.V. Tkachuk V.A.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2319-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although protein release has been examined as an end point of proteinase-associated α2β1 signaling, other potential end-points have not been investigated. Of interest to the question of cytotoxicity, α2β1 signaling has been linked to Gi protein-dependent cell death (28Manna P.P. Frazier W.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), presumably via a seven transmembrane CD47-α2β1 complex (29Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). In addition, stimulation of α2β1 with bovine collagen has been linked to protein phosphatase activation and the dephosphorylation of Akt (30Ivaska J. Nissinen L. Immonen N. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.M. Heino J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Akt is a critical effector of cell survival with targets that include Bad, caspase-9, and GSK-3β (31Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 32Hashimoto M. Sagara Y. Langford D. Everall I.P. Mallory M. Everson A. Digicaylioglu M. Masliah E. J.

Reduced Akt activity has also been implicated in apoptosis mediated by diverse agents (33Takada T. Noguchi T. Inagaki K. Hosooka T. Fukunaga K. Yamao T. Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

In the present study we have investigated the possibility that MMP-1stimulation of neuronal cultures leads to the dephosphorylation of Akt. We have also examined the possibility that MMP-1 is linked to caspase inhibitor-sensitive cell death, a potential consequence of Akt dephosphorylation (34Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 35Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Brain specimens were obtained from human fetuses of 12-14 weeks gestational age with consent from women undergoing elective termination of pregnancy and approval by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board. Neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously (36Magnuson D.S. Knudsen B.E. Geiger J.D. Brownstone R.M. Nath A. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, the meninges and blood vessels were removed, and the specimens were washed in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) before mechanical dissociation by repeated trituration through a 20-gauge needle. Cells were then pelleted at 270 × g for 10 min and subsequently suspended in Opti-MEM with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.2% N2 supplement (Invitrogen), and 1% antibiotic solution (103 units/ml penicillin G, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml amphotericin B) and plated in tissue culture flasks. The cells were maintained in culture for at least one month before neurons were released through gentle shaking and then plated onto flat-bottomed plates, in which they were maintained for 5 days before experiments were conducted. The purity of cultures was established by immunostaining for microtubule-associated protein-2 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Immunostaining—Neuronal cultures were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS, 5 min each, then blocked for 1 h in a PBS solution containing 4% donkey serum (Sigma) and 0.3% Triton X-100. This was followed by 4 °C overnight incubation with 1:200 dilution of the primary antibody (mouse anti-human α2β1 or rabbit anti-human α2, both from Chemicon) diluted in 3% donkey serum. Normal mouse IgG was used as a negative control for α2β1 staining, and secondary antibody alone was used as a control for both α2β1 and α2 staining. Cells were washed 3 times in PBS for 5 min each and incubated for2hat room temperature in secondary antibodies diluted 1:500 in PBS (Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse from the Jackson Laboratory or goat anti-rabbit from Molecular Probes). Cells were again washed three times in PBS before mounting onto slides with Mowoil (Calbiochem). Slides were then analyzed using confocal (α2β1) or fluorescent (α2) microscopy. MMPs and Inhibitors—Purified MMP-1 was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA) and Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The proteinase was separated in aliquots and stored at -70 °C upon its arrival. MMP-1 from Oncogene Research Products was purified from human rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts by affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration, and MMP-1 from Chemicon was purified from transfected P2AH2A cells and also by ion exchange and affinity chromatography. The inactive pro-MMP-1 mutant, in which Glu-200 was changed to Ala (pro-MMP-1(E200A)), was overproduced in and purified from Escherichia coli according to methods previously described for the wild type enzyme (37Chung L. Shimokawa K. Dinakarpandian D. Grams F. Fields G.B. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29610-29617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Except where indicated MMP-1 from Oncogene Research Products was used in the experiments shown. As determined by Western blot, MMP-1 preparations from Chemicon contained both pro- and activated MMP-1, whereas that from Oncogene typically contained a majority of the pro-enzyme. Of note, 50-100 ng/ml MMP-1 (∼1-2 nm) was used in experiments since previous studies showed that interleukin-1β-stimulated astrocyte supernatants contained amounts in this range and that neurons were responsive to these concentrations of the proteinase (12Vos C.M.

Pardo C.A. Wahl L.M. Bilak M. Milward E. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Purified active MMP-9 was purchased from Oncogene Research Products and was a recombinant preparation made in mammalian cells. The α2 integrin blocking antibody, which has previously been shown to block signaling through α2β1 (30Ivaska J. Nissinen L. Immonen N. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.M. Heino J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), was obtained from Serotec (MCA743). Okadaic acid was obtained from Sigma. The metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat was obtained from British Biotech, and the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor ZVAD was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories. Preparation of Cell Extracts—Neuronal extracts were prepared from cells that had been cultured on 12-well plates as follows. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1%SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) was then added to each well (∼105 cells). After 5 min the cell suspension was scraped and placed into an Eppendorf tube. The suspensions were then sonicated for 10 s and spun at 4 °C in a desk top Eppendorf centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatants were then saved for analysis by Western blot or ELISA. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Western Blot—Western blot was performed for α2, β1, and phosphoserine GSK-3β using 30 μg of protein per lane that had been mixed 2× with Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and then heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were run on 4-15% gradient pre-cast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). After protein transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane the blot was probed with an antibody to α2 (Chemicon, AB1936), β1 (Chemicon, MAB1965), or phospho-GSK-3β (BioSource 44-600). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by electrochemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences), and molecular weights were inferred by comparison with pre-stained standards (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation Experiments—After a 1-h incubation with MMP-1 that, as determined by Western blot, contained both pro- and active length MMP-1, cultured cells were washed twice in PBS and then lysed in a detergent-containing buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% IGEPAL, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were spun, and supernatant was incubated 1:1 with pre-swollen protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2h at 4 °C, a step taken to eliminate proteins in the lysate that may bind non-specifically to the protein G. The mix was subsequently spun, and the supernatant was incubated at 4 °C overnight with an anti-MMP-1 that recognizes pro- and active forms (Chemicon, AB8105), an isotype matched control antibody (Chemicon, AB5320), anti-α2β1 (Chemicon, MAB1998Z), or anti-β1 (Chemicon MAB2252). The mix was next incubated for 2 h with protein G-Sepharose, and after 3 washes the precipitate was analyzed by Western blot using a primary antibody to pro- and active MMP-1 (R&D Systems MAB901), α2β1 (Chemicon 1998Z), α2 (Chemicon AB1936), or β1 (MAB2252) as indicated. All incubations (antibody and protein G) were performed on a rotary table at 4 °C, and all spins were performed using a desktop Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min at maximum speed (14,000 rpm). ELISA—ELISA for phospho- and total Akt was performed using kits (KHO0111 and KHO0101) from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). The phospho-Akt specific ELISA detects Akt, which is phosphorylated on serine 473. Both ELISAs were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Although equal sample volumes were added to wells, correction for differing protein concentrations was made before calculation of relative Akt. Determination of Neuronal Cell Death—At the time of experimental treatments, the culture medium was replaced with Locke's buffer containing 154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, and 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.2). Cell death in each case was monitored by trypan blue exclusion 15 h after treatment of cells as described previously (12Vos C.M. Sjulson L. Nath A. McArthur J.C. Pardo C.A. Rothstein J. Conant K. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 163: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 36Magnuson D.S. Knudsen B.E. Geiger J.D. Brownstone R.M. Nath A. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Neuronal cell counts were determined from five fields at predetermined coordinate locations. Each field was photographed and coded, and both live and dead cells were subsequently counted. A minimum of 100 cells was typically counted in each field. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate wells so that 15 fields were counted. Results were normalized so that control means were equal to 1. In these experiments MMP-1 was used at 50 ng/ml, ZVAD at 100 μm, pertussis toxin at 100 ng/ml, and batimastat at 20 ng/ml and 500 ng/ml (∼1 μm). ZVAD and pertussis toxin were added in advance of MMP-1 (2 h for pertussis toxin and 30 min for ZVAD). For batimastat studies, MMP-1 was added to medium containing the inhibitor, and the mixture was applied to the cultured cells. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Activity—Six hours after the treatment of neuronal cultures with the indicated stimulus in Locke's buffer containing 154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, cells were washed in buffer and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator in the presence of 10 μm 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Cells were then extensively washed again in Locke's buffer. In the absence of mitochondrial damage membrane potential is high, and JC-1 forms aggregates that give a red fluorescence. When mitochondria are damaged, potential is lost, and JC-1 remains in monomers that give a green fluorescence. Optical measurements were, therefore, acquired with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 527 nm and 590 nm. The levels of fluorescence at both emission wavelengths were then quantified, and a ratio of measurements was assessed. Statistics—Data are given as means ± S.E. After normality testing data were evaluated by ANOVA or Kruskall Wallis, and pairwise comparisons were made by Tukey or Mann-Whitney testing as appropriate. Human Neurons Express α2β1—Previous studies show that pro-MMP-1 binds to the I domain of the α2 integrin on keratinocytes (22Stricker T.P. Dumin J.A. Dickeson S.K. Chung L. Nagase H. Parks W.C. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29375-29381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine whether this integrin is expressed on human neurons, we performed immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis of lysates from these cells. As shown in Fig. 1, a-d, neurons showed immunoreactivity for α2β1 and α2. Staining was prominent along the cell body and was also present along cell processes. No staining was observed when normal mouse IgG or secondary antibody alone were used (not shown). In addition, expression of both α2 and β1 was confirmed by Western blot analysis of cell lysates (Fig. 1, d and e). MMP-1 Co-immunoprecipitates with Neuronal α2β1—To determine whether MMP-1 associates with neuronal integrins, as it does with those expressed on keratinocytes (22Stricker T.P. Dumin J.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29368-29374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we examined immunoprecipitates made using an antibody to α2β1 and to β1 for the presence of MMP-1. Results are shown in Fig. 2a. The antibody used to make the precipitate is shown at the top, whereas that used to probe the blot is shown at the side. The upper panel is an image obtained after a relatively short exposure of film to membrane, whereas the lower panel is an image showing the immunoprecipitate lanes as they appeared after a longer exposure. In this experiment purified MMP-1 that had undergone some auto-activation was used as a control (shown in the upper panel only). Although the control was overloaded, two bands representing pro and active length MMP-1 can be appreciated. It can also be appreciated that, although cultures from which the precipitates had been made were treated with MMP-1 that contained near equal amounts of both pro and active length forms and the blot had been probed with anti-MMP-1 that recognizes both forms, only pro length MMP-1 was detected. It is of course possible that active length MMP-1 can also associate with α2β1, but in our experiments its ability to do so was below the limits of detection. Of interest, the region of MMP-1, which is important to integrin binding, is not within the pro-domain but within the hinge and hemopexin domains, and yet it is also pro-MMP-1 that is detected in keratinocyte immunoprecipitates (22Stricker T.P.

As shown in Fig. 2b, immunoprecipitates that were made using anti-MMP-1 also contained both β1 and α2. Neuronal extracts were used as controls in this figure. MMP-1 Stimulation of Neurons Is Associated with a Decrease in the Phosphorylation of Akt, and This Is Inhibited by a Blocking Antibody to α2—We had previously shown that MMP-1 is toxic to human neurons, but the potential mechanisms were not investigated (12Vos C.M. Sjulson L. Nath A. McArthur J.C. Pardo C.A. Rothstein J. Conant K. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 163: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Signaling through α2β1 in other cell types has been linked to protein phosphatase activation and subsequent Akt dephosphorylation (30Ivaska J. Nissinen L. Immonen N. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.M. Heino J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Reduced activity of Akt has in turn been linked to cell death (31Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). We, therefore, measured levels of phospho-Akt in untreated and MMP-1-treated neuronal cultures. MMP-1 stimulation of human neurons was associated with reduced levels of phospho-Akt as determined by ELISA (Fig. 3a). Although MMP-1 from Oncogene was used in these experiments, similar results were obtained using a purified preparation from Chemicon. Also of note, the magnitude of the MMP-1-associated reduction in phospho-Akt was similar to that observed in fibroblasts after their stimulation with an established α2β1 agonist (30Ivaska J. Nissinen L. Immonen N. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.M. Heino J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To ensure that the reduction we observed in phospho-Akt was not due to degradation, total Akt levels were also measured by ELISA and were unchanged (data not shown). To examine the potential involvement of an α2 integrin-containing complex, we also tested MMP-1 on cultures that were pretreated with a blocking antibody to α2. Results demonstrate that anti-α2 attenuated the effect of MMP-1 (Fig. 3b). Because α2β1 has been linked to the activation of protein phosphatase 2A, we also tested the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid at a concentration relatively selective for protein phosphatase 2A for its effect on MMP-1-associated dephosphorylation of Akt. We observed that okadaic acid did reduce the ability of MMP-1 to reduce phospho-Akt while stimulating no significant increase on its own (50 ng/ml MMP-1, 74 ± 10% that of control; 50 ng/ml MMP-1 plus 1 nm okadaic acid, 104 ± 8% that of control, n = 3). The MMP-1-stimulated Reduction in Phospho-Akt Is Independent of Proteolytic Activity—Although immunoprecipitation studies suggest that MMP-1 may directly bind to α2β1, it is also possible that MMP-1 can generate a ligand that signals through α2β1 and/or other cell surface receptors to stimulate a decrease in phospho-Akt. Pro-MMP-1 undergoes auto activation, and it is difficult to rule out activation of the pro-enzyme after its addition to cultured cells. We, therefore, tested batimastat, an inhibitor of the catalytic activity of MMP-1, for its ability to affect MMP-1-related changes in phospho-Akt. The results are shown in Fig. 4a and suggest that the ability of MMP to reduce phospho-Akt may be independent of proteolysis. As an additional experiment to assess the question of whether MMP-1 was acting in a manner independent of proteolysis, we tested the inactive pro-MMP-1 mutant in which Glu-200 was changed to Ala (pro-MMP-1 (E200A)). A glutamic acid residue at position 200 allows for interaction of a water molecule with the active site zinc, which in turn is critical for substrate catalysis (1Woessner J.F. Nagase H.

As shown in Fig. 4b pro-MMP-1 E200A also affected a statistically significant decrease in phosphorylated Akt. MMP-9 Does Not Decrease Phospho-Akt—Like MMP-1, MMP-9 has been associated with neurotoxicity (10Johnston J.B. Zhang K. Silva C. Shalinsky D.R. Conant K. Ni W. Corbett D. Yong V.W. Power C. Ann.

In these experiments the active form of MMP-9 was used because it is this form of the enzyme that has been linked to cytotoxicity (11Gu Z. Kaul M. Yan B. Kridel S.J. Cui J. Strongin A. Smith J.W. Liddington R.C. Lipton S.A. Science. 2002; 297: 1186-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1986160345,"Transfer of the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii from low light to high light generated an oxidative stress that led to a dramatic arrest in the synthesis of the large subunit (LSU) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). The translational arrest correlated with transient changes in the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species and with shifting the glutathione pool toward its oxidized form (Irihimovitch, V., and Shapira, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 16289–16295). Here we examined how the redox potential of glutathione affected the RNA-protein interactions with the 5′-untranslated region of rbcL. This RNA region specifically binds a group of proteins with molecular masses of 81, 62, 51, and 47 kDa in UV-cross-linking experiments under reducing conditions. Binding of these proteins was interrupted by exposure to oxidizing conditions (GSSG), and a new protein of 55 kDa was shown to interact with the RNA. The 55-kDa protein comigrated with Rubisco LSU in one- and two-dimensional gels, and its RNA binding activity was further verified by using the purified protein in UV-cross-linking experiments under oxidizing conditions. However, the LSU of purified and oxidized Rubisco bound to RNA in a sequence-independent manner. A remarkable structural similarity was found between the amino-terminal domain of Rubisco LSU in C. reinhardtii and the RNA binding domain, a highly prevailing motif among RNA-binding proteins. It appears from the crystal structure of Rubisco that the amino terminus of LSU is buried within the holoenzyme. We propose that under oxidizing conditions it is exposed to the surface and can, therefore, bind RNA. Accordingly, a recombinant form of the polypeptide domain that corresponds to the amino terminus of LSU was found to bind RNA in vitro with or without GSSG.

When plants and algae absorb light energy that exceeds the level of electron carrier saturation they generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; Rubisco, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; RB, RNA binding; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; SK, pBluescript; RBD, RNA binding domain; LSU, large subunit; UTR, untranslated region; DTT, dithiothreitol; aa, amino acids. that cause a variety of cellular and molecular damage. This phenomenon is referred to as photoinhibition and is common to all photosynthetic organisms (1Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 2Osmond C.B. Baker N.R. Boyer J.R. Photoinhibition of Photosynthesis, from Molecular Mechanisms to the Field.

V., Amsterdam1992: 295-348Crossref Google Scholar). Recovery from photoinhibition can be achieved by decreasing the chlorophyll content and by activating a variety of antioxidant pathways that involve ascorbate and glutathione (4Foyer C.H. Lopez-Delgado H. Dat J.F. Scott I.M. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 241-254Crossref Google Scholar, 5Noctor G. Gomez L. Vanacker H. Foyer C.H. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1283-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) is the key enzyme in photosynthetic carbon assimilation. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and in land plants the enzyme is composed of eight large subunits (LSU) encoded by the chloroplast rbcL gene and eight small subunits encoded by the nuclear rbcS gene family. Assembly of the holoenzyme is mediated by the chloroplast chaperonins cpn60 and cpn10 (6Gutteridge S. Gatenby A.A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7Thirumalai D. Lorimer G.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 245-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We previously showed that transfer of the green algae C. reinhardtii from low light (70 μmol m–2 s–1) to high light (700 μmol m–2 s–1) generates an oxidative stress that leads to photoinhibition and a dramatic arrest in the synthesis of the LSU of Rubisco (8Shapira M. Lers A. Heifetz P. Yrihimovitz V. Osmond B.C. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These light-induced effects were found to be transient, with cell recovery taking place within 6–12 h once chlorophyll levels were reduced and ROS levels were decreased. It was further found that translation of Rubisco LSU varies with the changes in ROS production and correlates with alterations in the ratio between oxidized and reduced glutathione. Upon transfer to high light the glutathione pool shifts to its oxidized form, and LSU synthesis stops almost completely. When the cells recover from light stress, the glutathione pool shifts back to its reduced form, and LSU translation resumes (9Irihimovitch V. Shapira M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Rubisco holoenzyme is highly susceptible to oxidative stress in vivo. Excess ROS caused a rapid translocation of the soluble enzyme complex into the chloroplast membrane and the formation of intermolecular cross-linking between the large subunits via disulfide bonds (10Mehta R.A. Fawcett T.W. Porath D. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2810-2816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, oxidative stress can cause direct fragmentation of Rubisco LSU at Gly-329 into 37- and 16-kDa polypeptides in illuminated intact chloroplasts in chloroplast extracts and in its purified form when exposed to a hydroxyl radical-generating system (11Ishida H. Makino A. Mae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5222-5226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Translational regulation allows plants to respond quickly to environmental changes such as light intensities and is, therefore, a predominant mechanism in chloroplasts. Upstream UTRs are expected to play a key role in translation of chloroplast genes via interaction with regulatory proteins. A group of RNA binding (RB) proteins with molecular masses of 60, 55, 47, and 38 kDa assemble on the 5′-UTR of the psbA RNA (12Danon A. Mayfield S.P.Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). RB47 shows a high homology with the eukaryotic poly(A)-binding protein (13Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and RB60 shows high homology to protein disulfide isomerase (14Kim J. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1954-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 15Trebitsh T. Meiri E. Ostersetzer O. Adam Z. Danon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4564-4569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Binding of the protein complex is mediated by specific thiol-containing proteins, and light-induced reduction of thioredoxin enhances this binding. It was proposed that RB60 serves as a redox sensor that activates binding of RB47 (16Trebitsh T. Levitan A. Sofer A. Danon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Proteins with similar molecular masses assemble on the 5′-UTR of psbC and other chloroplast leaders (17Hauser C.R. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1486-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Zerges W. Rochaix J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), although it is possible that different RNA-binding proteins of size 47 kDa have altered target specificities (19Zerges W. Wang S. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In an attempt to examine the mechanism that underlies the unique pattern of regulation observed for Rubisco LSU, we examined how the redox state of RNA-binding proteins affected their interaction with the rbcL leader. We show that the interaction between RNA-binding proteins and the rbcL leader is interrupted by oxidative stress and that Rubisco LSU can bind RNA in its oxidized form, although in a nonspecific manner. Strains and Growth Conditions—C. reinhardtii wild type CC-125 cells were grown in high salt reduced sulfate medium with bubbling of 5% CO2 and constant rotary shaking at 25 °C. Cultures were illuminated with medium light (150 μmol m–2 s–1) using cool white fluorescent lamps. The photosynthesis-deficient mutant CC-2653 has an amber mutation at the 5′ end that terminates translation of Rubisco LSU at position 65 (20Spreitzer R. Goldschnidt-Clermont M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5460-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was grown on Tris acetate phosphate medium at 25 °C under dark conditions. For Rubisco purification CC-125 cells were grown in Tris acetate phosphate medium under low light conditions (70 μmol m–2 s–1). Plasmids Used for in Vitro RNA Synthesis—The 5′-UTR of rbcL from C. reinhardtii was cloned from P-266, a plasmid that contains the 4-kilobase EcoRI-BamHI fragment of chloroplast DNA (21Dron M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). An EcoRI-XmnI fragment of the insert was inserted into pBluescript at the EcoRI-SmaI site, resulting in pVI1. The complete 5′-UTR of rbcL (between positions –93 to +24 relative to the ATG start codon) was amplified from pVI1 using the primers 5′-TAAATGTATTTAAAATTTTTCAACAAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTAGTTTCTGTTTGTGGAACCAT-3′ (reverse). The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequences between the PstI and NsiI sites were removed, resulting in pΔVI3. The plasmid encoding rbcL was linearized by NcoI and NotI for synthesis of the sense and antisense strands, respectively. In vitro synthesis of the 5′-UTRs derived from psbA, atpB (chloroplast genes), and α-tubulin (a nuclear gene) was performed from plasmids D1-HA, P-419, and P-654, respectively. Plasmid D1-HA was the generous gift of A. Danon; plasmids P-419 and P-654 were obtained from the Chlamydomonas Center at Duke University. Plasmid D1-HA was linearized with EcoRI, and P-419 and P-654 were linearized with BamHI. In vitro synthesis of the sense strands derived from the corresponding 5′-UTRs was performed with T7 RNA polymerase. Synthesis of a non-related RNA fragment was performed using pBluescript (SK) as a template. The plasmid was linearized by NotI, and RNA was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase. Preparation of Protein Extracts—C. reinhardtii wild type CC-125 cells were grown at medium light, and protein extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (12Danon A. Mayfield S.P.Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Hauser C.R. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1486-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells (3 × 1 liter) were grown in high salt reduced sulfate and harvested at a concentration of 5–7 × 106 cell/ml. The pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C until use. Cell pellets (8 g fresh weight) were thawed in 25 ml of low salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm DTT) in the presence of protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 76 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were disrupted by triple passage through a French press (Sim-Amico, Spectronic Instruments) at 4000 p.s.i. The broken cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g (SS-34 rotor, 10,000 rpm in an RC-2 Sorvall). The supernatants were collected and further centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C (TI50 rotor, 50,000 rpm in an L8–55 Beckman ultracentrifuge). The 200,000 × g supernatant was collected and applied immediately onto a 5-ml heparin-Actigel column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was first prewashed with 3 volumes of high salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 2 m potassium acetate) and equilibrated with extraction buffer containing (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT). The bound proteins were eluted with a continuous gradient of potassium acetate concentrations (0–1.6 m) in low salt buffer. Fractions (500 μl) were collected, dialyzed against dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 20% glycerol), and stored at –70 °C. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%), and their protein content was evaluated by Coomassie Blue staining. In Vitro RNA Synthesis—Radiolabeled RNA transcripts (described above) were synthesized in vitro using 0.5–1 μg of DNA in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 12.5 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 20 units of RNasin, 0.5 mm ATP, GTP, and CTP, 12 μm UTP, 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), and 20 units of SP6 (Roche Applied Science) or T7 (Promega) RNA polymerase in a reaction volume of 20 μl. The reactions were performed at 37 °C for 40 min followed by the addition of 1 unit of DNase I (RNase-free, Promega) and were then incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. The labeled RNAs were separated from the unincorporated ribonucleotides on a spun-down mini-column of Sephadex G-50 in double-distilled H20. Under these conditions transcripts were labeled to specific activities that ranged between 5 × 108 and 2 × 109 cpm/μg of RNA. Unlabeled transcripts that were used for competition assays were synthesized as described above, except that the reactions were scaled up to 100 μl, and all the four ribonucleotides were included at equal concentrations (0.5 mm). RNA products were analyzed on 7 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gels to verify production of a single transcript and to evaluate its size and concentration. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed essentially as described previously (17Hauser C.R. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1486-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Samples from the heparin-Actigel column fractions (2 μl containing approximately 9 μg of protein) were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 5 units of RNasin (Promega) in 3 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 5 μl. The mixtures were then added to the RNA probes (10,000 cpm) in the presence of 20 μg of Escherichia coli tRNA (Sigma) in a final volume of 15 μl. After an incubation of 15 min at room temperature, 2 μl of loading buffer (0.25 μg/μl xylene cyanol, 0.25 μg/μl bromphenol blue, and 6% (v/v) glycerol) were added, and the reactions were separated on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide 49:1) in 1× TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8). Running conditions were 25 mA for 2–3 h. The gels were then fixed in a solution of 20% methanol and 10% acetic acid, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. In competition experiments unlabeled RNA transcripts were added in varying amounts of mass excess and preincubated with the protein samples before the addition of the radio-labeled probe. UV Cross-linking Assays—Binding assays were performed as previously described (17Hauser C.R. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1486-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Samples of proteins eluted from the heparin-Actigel column (2 μl containing approximately 9 μg of protein), purified Rubisco (25 ng), or the recombinant polypeptides that corresponded to Rubisco LSU (amino acids 1–475) or its sub-fragments (amino acids 1–150 and 151–475) after purification over a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column (25 ng) were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 0.5 units of RNasin (Promega) in 3 mm MgCl2 in a volume of 5 μl. Radiolabeled RNA (100,000 cpm) was then added to the protein solution along with 0.2 μg of E. coli tRNA (Sigma) in a final volume of 15 μl. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature the binding reactions were placed on ice and cross-linked by UV irradiation at 254 nm in a UV cross-linker (Hoefer) for 90 s. RNA transcripts were then digested with 20 μg of RNase A (Sigma) for 40 min at 37 °C. The samples were separated over 15% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained by Coomassie Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography or analyzed by phosphorimaging. In competition experiments unlabeled RNA transcripts were added in varying mass excess and preincubated with the protein samples before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. To examine how the redox state affected the binding proteins, GSSG or GSH was added to the protein extracts or to the purified Rubisco (25 ng) 10 min before the addition of the labeled 5′-UTR. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Protein separation on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as previously described (22O'Farrel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Separation on the first dimension was performed by isoelectric focusing using ampholytes (Bio-Rad) that ranged between pH 3 and 9. Separation on the second dimension was preformed by SDS-PAGE over 12% polyacrylamide gels. Antisera—Polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against Rubisco holoenzyme from tobacco were a generous gift of T. J. Andrews from the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated over one- and two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Western blot analysis was performed using anti-Rubisco antibodies (1:4000) and a conjugate of protein A with alkaline phosphatase (1:2000). Antibody binding was detected with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5′-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Sigma) dissolved in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. Rubisco Purification—Wild type C. reinhardtii cells (CC-125) were grown in Tris acetate phosphate medium (3 liters), harvested to yield 8 g fresh weight, and disrupted in a French press as describe above. The cell extract was loaded on a heparin-Actigel column pre-equilibrated in low salt buffer (see above) and was eluted by a single step of 1.6 m potassium acetate in low salt buffer. The eluate (5 ml) was dialyzed against low salt buffer and loaded (1 ml) on a linear 10–30% sucrose gradient in low salt buffer. The gradient was centrifuged for 16 h at 164,000 × g (SW40 rotor, 40,000 RPM in a Beckman LE-80K ultracentrifuge) at 4 °C, and fractions (1 ml) were collected. Samples of each fraction were examined by Western blot analysis using antibodies raised against Rubisco. Expression of Recombinant LSU and Its Subdomains in Bacteria— The DNA region that encodes for Rubisco LSU was amplified using primers derived from both ends of the rbcL gene; the LSU-fwd-(1–21) primer was 5′-ATCCATGGTTCCACAAACAGAAACT-3′, and the LSU-rev-(1506–1482) primer was 5′-TTAGGAATTCAACGTAAACACCATA-3′. The DNA region which encodes the amino terminus of Rubisco LSU (aa 1–150) was amplified by PCR using the LSU-fwd-(1–21) primer; and the reverse primer, LSU-rev-(450–432), 5′-GGAATTCTTAACCTACGAATGTTTTAACG-3′. The DNA region that encodes the TIM barrel domain of Rubisco (aa 151–475) was amplified by PCR using the primer LSU-fwd-(451–466), 5′-ATCCATGGAACCTCCACACGGTATTC-3′, and the LSU-rev-(1506–1482) primer. Anchors that introduced restriction sites, NcoI (fwd primers) and EcoRI (rev primers), were added and are marked in bold letters. The resulting fragments were cloned in-frame into the parallel pHisII expression vector (23Sheffield P. Garard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Expression was induced in BL21 cells by incubation of the transgenic bacteria with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C for 2.5 h. The bacteria were harvested, washed once in double-distilled H2O, resuspended in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole, and lysed in a French press using 20,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 25 min. The expressed protein present in the soluble bacterial fraction was affinity-purified over a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). Because the recombinant TIM barrel domain was insoluble, it was denatured after a previously described procedure (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 15.49-15.54Google Scholar) and renatured by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mm MgCl2,10 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm DTT. The soluble recombinant polypeptides were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against Rubisco. Structural Characterization of Rubisco Subdomains—Subdomains of the large subunit of Rubisco were identified based on the SCOP data base that provides a structural classification of proteins (25Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar). RNA Binding Activity of Protein Extracts to the rbcL 5′-UTR; Specificity and Sensitivity to the Redox State—To test whether translational arrest of the rbcL transcript at high light and during oxidative stress correlated with changes in the redox state of proteins that bind to its 5′-UTR, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed. The fraction of proteins that bind nucleic acids was enriched by purification of cell extracts over a heparin-Actigel affinity column followed by elution with a gradient (0–1.6 m) of potassium acetate concentrations. Radiolabeled RNA extending from positions –93 to +24 relative to the translational start site of the rbcL gene was synthesized in vitro and incubated with the protein fractions. Binding of proteins to the radiolabeled RNA was monitored by their inhibitory effect on migration of the RNA in native polyacrylamide gels as compared with control unbound RNA. RNA binding activity was observed with the radiolabeled 5′-UTR of rbcL (Fig. 1A). Migration of the RNA-protein complexes resulted in multiple bands, suggesting that the binding involved more than a single protein. Binding to the labeled 5′-UTR of rbcL was interrupted in a dose-response manner by adding increasing amounts of the corresponding unlabeled rbcL 5′-UTR (Fig. 1A, lanes b–f). Binding was not affected by the addition of increasing amounts of SK RNA (lanes h–l) or by a large excess of E. coli tRNA (lanes m and n). Thus, only the homologous non-radioactive RNA fragment could efficiently compete-out the RNA-protein interaction. In addition, no binding was observed with a nonspecific labeled RNA fragment of comparable size, derived from pBluescript (SK RNA, data not shown). To strengthen the association between the shift of glutathione to its oxidized form during light stress and the translational arrest of Rubisco LSU (9Irihimovitch V. Shapira M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), binding assays were carried out under oxidizing (GSSG) and reducing (GSH, DTT) conditions. Fractionated proteins capable of binding to the 5′-UTR of rbcL in EMSA were preincubated with increasing concentrations of GSSG, GSH, and DTT (5, 10, and 25 mm) before the addition of the radiolabeled rbcL 5′-UTR. Band shifting of the RNA was inhibited already in the presence of 5 mm GSSG and was completely abolished by 10 and 25 mm GSSG, whereas GSH and DTT had no effect on the binding activity (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that mediating the redox of thiol groups on RNA-binding protein(s) affects their ability to interact with the 5′-UTR of the rbcL transcript. Binding Specificity of Proteins to the 5′-UTR of rbcL—A biochemical characterization of the proteins that bind to the rbcL leader was initiated using UV cross-linking. Radiolabeled RNA corresponding to the 5′-UTR of rbcL was incubated with proteins eluted from the heparin column and subjected to UV irradiation followed by RNase digestion. Using this approach we found that proteins with a molecular mass of 81, 62, 51, 47, 38, 36, and 34 kDa bind to the 5′-UTR of rbcL. To establish that the binding was specific to the 5′-UTR of rbcL, UV cross-linking was performed in the presence of non-radioactive RNA competitors. Binding of the 81-, 62-, 51-, and 47-kDa proteins was inhibited by the homologous rbcL –93/+24 fragment (Fig. 2A, lanes a–g) and was hardly affected by the SK RNA or tRNA controls (Fig. 2A, lanes h–q), indicating a sequence specificity for the RNA-protein interactions. Because binding of the 38-, 34-, and 32-kDa proteins was not competed-out by the cold rbcL RNA, their interaction with the RNA was most probably nonspecific. UV Cross-linking of Proteins to the 5′-UTR of rbcL Is Sensitive to the Redox State of Glutathione—To test how the redox state of thiol groups modulated binding of proteins to the 5′-UTR of rbcL, UV-cross-linking assays were performed in the presence of reduced and oxidized glutathione. Protein extracts eluted from the heparin-Actigel column were preincubated with increasing concentrations of GSSG before the addition of the labeled rbcL 5′-UTR. Under oxidizing conditions binding of the 81-, 62-, 51-, and 47-kDa proteins decreased (Fig. 2B); however, cross-linking of a new 55-kDa protein was observed. In view of the similar molecular weights of this newly UV-cross-linked protein and the LSU of Rubisco, the possibility that an autoregulatory pathway exists was considered. Rubisco LSU Is an RNA-binding Protein—The 55-Da protein was characterized on one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels combined with Western blot analysis. Proteins were preincubated with GSSG (7.5 mm) before their UV cross-linking with the radiolabeled 5′-UTR of rbcL. The cross-linked proteins were separated by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were exposed to a film (Fig. 3, C and D) and then reacted with an antibody raised against Rubisco LSU (Fig. 3, A and B). Alignment of the autoradiograms and films indicated that the 55-kDa protein that cross-linked to the 5′-UTR of rbcL under oxidizing conditions co-migrated with Rubisco LSU on two-dimensional gels. Direct evidence for binding of Rubisco LSU to the rbcL leader under oxidizing conditions was obtained by using the purified enzyme in UV-cross-linking experiments. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the purified protein cross-linked with the rbcL leader in direct correlation with the GSSG concentration, whereas no binding was observed in the absence of GSSG. In addition, the 55-kDa protein was absent in UV-cross-linking experiments performed under oxidizing conditions using CC 2653 (20Spreitzer R. Goldschnidt-Clermont M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5460-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a mutant that fails to express Rubisco LSU due to a point mutation that pre-terminates translation (data not shown). To examine the binding specificity between Rubisco LSU and its corresponding rbcL leader, competition assays were performed with unlabeled RNAs that corresponded to the homologous rbcL leader in its sense and antisense orientations. Equal inhibition of binding to the labeled rbcL leader was observed with similar amounts of either fragment, suggesting that in vitro the binding of Rubisco LSU to its leader was sequence-independent (Fig. 5A). A similar conclusion was drawn from experiments that compared the competition between non-labeled SK RNA and the sense rbcL fragment. Both of these RNA fragments competed out the binding between Rubisco LSU and its RNA leader with comparable efficiencies (Fig. 5B). It, therefore, appears that under oxidizing conditions Rubisco LSU binds non-specifically to RNA. In the presence of a large excess of cold competitor RNA, a higher band was observed. Its appearance could result from incomplete RNase digesti"

Glucocorticoids and progestins control bcl-X expression and influence the ratio between bcl-XL (antiapoptotic isoform) and bcl-XS (proapoptotic isoform) in different tissues. The 5′-UTR region of the mouse bcl-X gene contains at least five different promoters, which exhibit a tissue-specific pattern of promoter usage. Several mRNAs with different 5′-leading exons can be generated upon promoter activation. Here we explore the potential of the various bcl-X gene promoters to be regulated by glucocorticoids or progestins. We found that the region located immediately upstream of promoter 4 (P4) contains two hormone response element (HRE)-like sequences at positions –3040 (HRE I) and –3001 (HRE II) relative to the translation initiation codon. These HRE-like sequences confer hormone responsiveness to a core promoter and bind glucocorticoid or progesterone receptors in vitro. Point mutations of both HREs that prevent steroid receptor binding also eliminate hormonal inducibility. In cells treated with glucocorticoids, the hormone receptor is recruited to the P4 region containing the HREs. Analysis of the products of the endogenous bcl-X in epithelial mammary cells showed that only transcripts originating from P4 increased upon hormone treatment. This observation correlates with the induction of the bcl-XL mRNA, suggesting that P4 is one of the bcl-X promoters responsible for the generation of this antiapoptotic isoform. Bcl-X exists in at least five different isoforms with complex effects on programmed cell death.

At least five different isoforms produced by alternative splicing of a unique gene have been described previously (1Pecci A. Viegas L.R. Baranao J.L. Beato M. J. Biol.

Thus, the control of apoptosis in some cell types could involve changes in the relative proportions of various Bcl-X isoforms, suggesting an accurate regulation not only of transcription but also of splicing of bcl-X transcripts. Steroid hormones, in particular glucocorticoids and progestins, control programmed cell death in several tissues. Although the molecular mechanism of hormone-dependent apoptosis is still not completely known, a link between glucocorticoids and genes from the Bcl-2 family has been demonstrated in several systems (6Pecci A. Scholz A. Pelster D. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11791-11798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Vicent G.P. Pecci A. Ghini A. Piwien-Pilipuk G.

In fact, the steroid hormones, glucocorticoids, and progesterone, have been shown to control bcl-X expression and to influence the ratio between bcl-XL (antiapoptotic isoform) and bcl-XS (proapoptotic isoform) in different cell types (6Pecci A.

It contains at least five different promoters (P1–P5), 1The abbreviations used are: P, promoter; HRE, hormone response element; PR, progesterone receptor; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; cons, consensus; Dex, dexamethasone; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; gapdh, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. which are used in a tissue-specific manner (Fig. 1) (1Pecci A. Viegas L.R. Baranao J.L. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21062-21069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, several mRNAs differing in at least their 5′-leading exon can be generated upon alternative promoter usage. Although the physiological relevance of this mechanism is still not clear, it might be involved in the tissue-specific gene expression. Moreover, the activation of a particular promoter might generate specific splice isoforms. In this way, external signals like steroid hormones could influence the outcome of the splice process by regulating promoter choice by their activated hormone receptors. Steroids exert their action by interacting with their intracellular receptors, which are ligand-dependent transcription factors (12Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). After hormone binding, the hormone receptor complex regulates the expression of target genes by binding to specific DNA sequences in chromatin called hormone response elements (HREs). In particular, progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors (hereafter denoted PR and GR, respectively) bound to the same palindromic consensus sequence TG-TYCTXXXACARGA (12Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) located in the promoter or enhancer regions of target genes. To explore the possibility of a direct effect of steroid hormones on the bcl-X gene expression, we performed transient transfection assays of expression vectors containing the luciferase gene under the control of different bcl-X promoter regions. In several cell lines, mainly P4 responds selectively to the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone or to the progestin agonist R5020. The screening of the region around this promoter revealed the presence of two HRE-like sequences located at positions –3040 (HRE I) and –3001 (HRE II) relative to the translation initiation site. Both HREs differ from the consensus HRE (cons-HRE) by three mismatches. Here we show that recombinant GR and PR bind specifically to a bcl-X oligonucleotide containing HRE I and II sequences. An analysis of the endogenous gene expression showed that only those transcripts generated by the activation of P4 increased their levels upon steroid treatment in mouse epithelial mammary cells. This observation was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, which demonstrated the loading of GR and increased occupancy by the RNA polymerase II at the P4 region after the addition of dexamethasone. P4 activation correlates with the induction of the bcl-XL mRNA, suggesting that P4 may be one of the bcl-X promoters responsible for the generation of this antiapoptotic isoform. These results contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of hormone-dependent apoptosis. Steroids and Reagents—R5020 was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Dexamethasone (Dex) and RU 38486 (RU) from Sigma were used for all of the hormonal treatments. Hormones were dissolved in absolute ethanol. For in vitro assays, 1000× solutions were prepared. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium and fetal calf serum were purchased from Invitrogen. RPMI 1640 medium was purchased from Sigma. Fetal calf serum was previously charcoal-stripped to deplete it of steroid hormones (13Bottenstein J. Hayashi I. Hutchings S. Masui H. Mather J. McClure D.B. Ohasa S. Rizzino A. Sato G. Serrero G.

Expression Vectors—The vector pGAW (kindly provided by Dr. Guntram Suske, IMT, Philipps Universität, Marburg, Germany) is a derivative plasmid from pGL3-basic (Promega). This vector was used to subclone the bcl-X promoter fragments upstream of the luciferase gene. The expression vector P1 contained a genomic sequence of mouse bcl-X gene from nucleotides –594 to –95 relative to the translation initiation codon. It was generated by subcloning a HindIII-BamHI fragment from pNM1–9 SalI plasmid (1Pecci A. Viegas L.R. Baranao J.L. Beato M. J. Biol.

This fragment includes from P5 to P2 a promoter region. This vector was generated by digesting a 2884-bp fragment of pNM1–9EagI (1Pecci A. Viegas L.R. Baranao J.L. Beato M. J. Biol.

The vector P2 contained the P2 promoter region from nucleotides –1000 to –537, and it was generated by digestion of P5-P2 with EcoRI enzyme followed by religation. P3 vector was generated by amplifying from pNM1–9 SalI plasmid, a fragment of 497 bp with the oligonucleotides 5′-CATGGAATTCGGTCATCCTATGCTACATAG-3′ and 5′-CGAGCTCGAGCTAGTTCCTTCATCCATCTG-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGAW. Vector P4 “core” was generated by digesting P4-P3 vector with XhoI enzyme followed by Klenow treatment and then by digestion with SspI enzyme followed by religation. Vector P4-P3 was generated by subcloning an EcoRI-XhoI fragment from P5-P2 into pGAW. Vector P4 “extended” was generated by digestion of P5-P2 with BamHI enzyme followed by religation. The obtained vector was then digested with XhoI enzyme followed by Klenow treatment. This vector then was cut with SspI enzyme and religated. Vector P4-extended ΔHRE was generated by cutting from P4 extended, a fragment of 95 bp between the nucleotides –3045 and –2950 with XmnI and MscI enzymes followed by Klenow treatment and religation. Cell Cultures and Transfection Assay—Cells were cultured at 37 °C under humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in p100 plates. COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and glutamine (2 mm). Mammary epithelial T47D and HC11 (the latter one was kindly provided by Dr. Nancy Hynes, Basel, Switzerland) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. 5 μg/ml insulin were added to HC11 cell cultures. For transient transfections, 5 × 105 cells plated in 60-mm plates were transfected with Lipofectin 2000 (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. 5 pmols of each expression vector expressing luciferase under the control of bcl-X promoters were transfected in HC11, T47D, or COS-1 cells. 1 μg of PR (expressing human progesterone isoform B receptor) (14Kastner P.

Nature. 1987; 325: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) was cotransfected into COS-1 cells. 3 μg of pCMV-LacZ were also introduced as control of transfection. The plasmids were diluted in 100-μl medium and added dropwise to an equal volume of medium containing 4 μl of Lipofectin 2000. After 20 min, the transfection mixture was added dropwise to the cells. 6 h later, the medium was replaced by medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum and the antibiotics described above and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were then incubated with the corresponding steroids for 36 h. After incubations, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (Promega, catalog number E3971) and luciferase activity was measured with luciferase kit according to manufacturer protocol (Promega, catalog number E1501). β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (16Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Hache R.J. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In Silico Analysis—Screening for the potential HREs was performed using MatInspector software (17Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed with the synthetic oligonucleotides: cons-HRE (5′-TCGGAGTGCCTAGAGAACAAACTGTTCTGACTCAAC-3′) (18Chalepakis G. Schauer M. Cao X.A. Beato M. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); bcl-X HRE (5′-GAGTTTGAAACAATTCTGGTGTGTCTGTTCCCACATGGGCTCAGCTCTCCAGCACACACCAAATTTCAGTCAAGGGG-3′); and mutated bcl-X HRE(mut) (5′-GAGTTTGAAACAATTCTAGTATGTCTATTTCCACATGGGCTCAACTTTCCAACATACACCAAATTTCATCAAGGGG-3′) as described previously (19Di Croce L. Koop R. Venditti P. Westphal H.M. Nightingale K.P. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Beato M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 45-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The complementary strands were annealed in equimolar amounts (100 nm each) in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm KCl) by denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min and cooling down to room temperature. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Recombinant PR and GR were expressed in baculovirus and purified as described previously (19Di Croce L. Koop R. Venditti P. Westphal H.M. Nightingale K.P. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Beato M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 45-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts containing PR were prepared from T47D cells treated for 2 h with 10 nm R5020 as described previously (20Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 192499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out in 30-μl reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 90 mm NaCl, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 50 ng of radiolabeled probe, 100 ng of calf thymus DNA, and 3 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. 1–8-μl aliquots of the nuclear extract or 15–120 ng of recombinant PR/GR were added to the binding reaction and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Specific competition assays were performed by adding 10–500-fold molar excess of unlabeled bcl-X HRE. For the detection of the complexes, the reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis for 3 h on 3.5% acrylamide, 20% glycerol, 0.5% agarose, 0.3× Tris borate-EDTA gel. Results were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Fuji FLA 3000G) and quantification software (Image Gauge, version 3.1). The monoclonal GR antibody (BuGR, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) was included in the incubation mixture for supershift experiments. Dimethyl Sulfate Methylation Assay—Methylation was carried out by the addition of 1 μl of 10% dimethyl sulfate to 20 μl of binding buffer (see above) containing 50 ng of end-labeled DNA, 250 ng of poly(dI-dC), 3 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 15–75 ng of recombinant PR. After 1 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 250 mm dithiothreitol. After extraction with phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation, the samples were treated with 1 m piperidine during 30 min at 90 °C, dried under vacuum, and analyzed in 6.5% sequencing gels. RNA Analysis—Cells were resuspended in denaturing solution (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7, 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% sarcosyl), and total RNA was extracted by the single step method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). For reverse transcription, 4 μg of total RNA were used. The first cDNA strand was synthesized with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 25 ng/μl oligo(dT) (Invitrogen) as reverse complementary primer. For PCR amplification of the P4 5′-leading exon, the oligonucleotide 5′-exonD (5′-CCAGGATCTGAGTTCCACTCTTGAACAGAATTAACGC-3′) corresponding to the nucleotides –2694 to –2658 and the oligonucleotide 3′-exonD (5′-AAATGAGCTATAACTCAGTTTTTCAA-3′) corresponding to the nucleotides –2551 to –2577 were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The reaction yielded a 143-bp length cDNA fragment. For the amplification of the cDNAs generated by the activation of P1 the oligonucleotides, bcl-X P1 (5′-CCTGAAGCTCTCTCTCTCTCTTCA-3′) corresponding to the nucleotides –137 to –114 and exonStop (5′-CCCGTAGAGATCCACAAAAGTGTC-3′), which hybridized with the 5′-region of the second coding exon of bcl-XL or bcl-XS, were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The reaction yielded a 730-bp length cDNA fragment. PCR amplification of the cDNAs containing exon B were performed with the oligonucleotides bcl-X P2 (5′-GACTAGTCCAGGTTGTGAGGGGGCAGGTTCCTAAGCTTCGCAATTCCTCT-3′) corresponding to the nucleotides –619 to –577 and exonStop (described above). The reaction yielded a 908- and 726-bp length cDNA fragment corresponding to bcl-XL and bcl-XS isoforms respectively. All of the PCRs were normalized against gapdh expression. Primers gapdh-for (5′-TCATCAACGGGAAGC CCATCACCATCTTC-3′) and gapdh-rev (5′-GTCTTCTGGTTGGCAGTAATGGCATGGACT-3′), which specifically hybridize with gapdh mRNA, were used. The reaction yielded a 357-bp length cDNA fragment. To achieve semiquantitative conditions, reverse transcriptase-PCRs were terminated and the products were quantified when all of the samples were in the linear range of amplification. The cDNA pool (2 μl), 1.25 units Thermus aquaticus Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), and amplification primers (20 pmol each) in 50 μl of PCR mixture (1× polymerase buffer, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each dNTP) denatured 3 min at 96 °C followed by 8, 15, 25, and 30 cycles of amplification by using a step program (96 °C for 40 s; 65 °C (for gapdh), 60 °C (for exonD), 58 °C (for bcl-X P1 and bcl-X P2) for 30 s; and 72 °C for 1 min) and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. 10 μl of PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels and visualized under UV light. The negative was scanned, and the density was quantified with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Amersham Biosciences). RNase protection analysis was performed as described previously (22Zinn K. DiMaio D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1983; 34: 865-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). For preparing the bcl-X probe, plasmid pGLD3 was digested with HinfI and transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase. The full-length transcript size of the bcl-X riboprobe was 294 nucleotides, and the protected fragments for bcl-XL and bcl-XS were 237- and 155-bp long, respectively. The gapdh template pTRIGAPDH (Ambion, Austin, TX) was digested with BglII and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase. The probe length was 359 nucleotides, and the size of the protected fragment was 316 bp. [α-32P]CTP (Amersham Biosciences) radiolabeled RNA probes were prepared using a kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). The probes were coprecipitated with RNA samples and dissolved in hybridization buffer, denatured at 95 °C for 10 min, and hybridized at 52 °C for 18 h. After digestion with RNases A and T1 followed by digestion with proteinase K, the samples were precipitated, denatured, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% denaturing acrylamide gel. Quantification was performed with a PhosphorImager (Fuji FLA 3000G) using ImageGauge software. In all of the cases, the quantitation was normalized against gapdh signal. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—HC11 cells were untreated or incubated for 30 min with 10 nm Dex, and ChIP assays were performed as described previously (23Strutt H. Paro R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 455-467PubMed Google Scholar, 24Eberhardy S.R. D'Cunha C.A. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33798-33805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) by using the following monoclonal antibodies, α-GR (BuGR, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) and α-Pol-II (8WG16, Berkeley Antibody Company). For each experiment, PCRs were performed with different numbers of cycles or with dilution series of input DNA to determine the linear range of the amplification. All of the results shown fall within this range. Primer sequences are available on request. bcl-X P4 Promoter Region Contains HRE-like Sequences—To check the hormone responsiveness of the bcl-X promoters, expression vectors containing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of different promoter regions of the mouse bcl-X gene (Fig. 2A) were cotransfected with GR (Fig. 2B) or PR (Fig. 2C) in COS-1 cells. With a fragment containing all of the five promoters, we observed around a 2-fold induction by the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (Fig. 2B, lane 2), or by the progestin agonist R5020 (Fig. 2C, lane 2). Of the five promoter fragments tested, only the one containing an extended P4 region from –3288 to –2652 relative to the translation initiation codon exhibited a robust response to dexamethasone (Fig. 2B, lane 5) and to R5020 (Fig. 2C, lane 5). In all of the cases, the coincubation with the antagonist RU38486 completely abolished the hormone effects (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes 3 and 6). Vectors with P1, P2, or core P4 did not respond either to glucocorticoid or to progestin treatment (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes 8, 14, and 17, respectively). However, whereas treatment with dexamethasone had no effect (Fig. 2B, lane 11) in cells transfected with the P3 vector, treatment with R5020 increased luciferase expression <2-fold (Fig. 2C, lane 11). This construct contains one of the three HRE-like sequences reported recently by Gascoyne et al. (11Gascoyne D.M. Kypta R.M. Vivanco M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18022-18029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). With other vector containing these three HRE-like sequences, we also observed a steroid hormone-dependent expression; however, it was lower than that obtained with extended P4 vector (data not shown). An increase in luciferase expression was also observed when extended P4 vector was transfected in the human mammary cell line T47D and treated with R5020 (Fig. 2D, lane 2). T47D cells contain high amounts of endogenously expressed PR (25Keydar I. Chen L. Karby S. Weiss F.R. Delarea J. Radu M. Chaitcik S. Brenner H.J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1979; 15: 659-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), which probably mediated the response to R5020, because it was blocked by RU38486 (Fig. 2D, lane 3). No induction was observed when cells were transfected with core P4 vector (Fig. 2D, lane 5). As the expression of Bcl-XL is induced by dexamethasone in the mouse epithelial mammary cell line HC11 (9Schorr K. Furth P.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5950-5953PubMed Google Scholar), we assayed the effect of dexamethasone on P4 activation in these cells (Fig. 2E). Luciferase expression was enhanced after glucocorticoid treatment in HC11 cells transfected with extended P4 vector (Fig. 2E, lane 2) but not with core P4 vector (Fig. 2E, lane 5). All of the constructs showed similar basal activities in the various cell lines tested (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in the RENTROP cell line, which is derived from rat epithelial endometrial cells and responds to steroid hormones with inhibition of programmed cell death through the induction of bcl-XL expression (data not shown) (6Pecci A. Scholz A. Pelster D. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11791-11798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the region located between the nucleotides –3288 and –2766 relative to the translation initiation codon contains sequences responsible for the hormone-dependent P4 activation. A sequence analysis of the promoter region revealed the presence of several putative HRE sites located upstream of core P4. Two of these HRE-like sequences located between positions –3040 and –3027 (HRE I = TGGTGTgtcTGTTCC) and between –3014 and –3001 (HRE II = AGCTCTccAGCACA) are included in the extended P4 construct (Fig. 3). Both these HREs are relatively well conserved when compared with the palindromic cons-HRE identified in the mouse mammary tumor virus gene (TGTYCTnnnACARGA) (26Scheidereit C. Geisse S. Westphal H.M. Beato M. Nature. 1983; 304: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). HRE I and HRE II are imperfect palindromes separated by 3 and 2 bp, respectively, and differ from the cons-HRE by three mismatches. To test whether these two putative HREs bind GR or PR, we performed EMSA with increasing amounts of nuclear extracts from the T47D cell line treated with R5020. We observed a retarded band (Fig. 4A, lanes 2–5), which was abolished by a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled cons-HRE (Fig. 4A, lane 6). Increasing amounts of recombinant GR generated a similar retarded complex (Fig. 4B, lanes 2–6), which was also abolished by a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled cons-HRE oligonucleotide (Fig. 4B, lane 7), but not of nonspecific oligonucleotide (Fig. 4B, lane 8). The identity of the complex was confirmed by a supershift assay with a monoclonal GR antibody (Fig. 4B, lane 9). Similar results were obtained with recombinant PR (data not shown). Since the bcl-X HREs are degenerated, we tested whether they were able to compete for the binding of PR to cons-HRE (Fig. 4C). The binding of PR to a labeled cons-HRE was competed by the unlabeled bcl-X HREs in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4C, lanes 3–8). A 50% reduction in PR·DNA complex formation was observed with 10-fold molar excess of the unlabeled cons-HRE. In contrast, approximately a 20-fold molar excess of the bcl-X HRE oligonucleotide was required to reduce by 50% binding of PR to the labeled cons-HRE (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that PR binds to the bcl-X HREs with approximately half of the affinity compared with the cons-HRE. To identify the guanines contacted by PR, we next performed dimethyl sulfate methylation experiments. Increasing amounts of recombinant PR protected specific guanine residues located within both HRE I and HRE II sites (Fig. 5, lanes 3–6). These protected guanines correspond to those previously reported on murine mammary tumor virus HRE1 (18Chalepakis G. Schauer M. Cao X.A. Beato M. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To test the relevance of the identified receptor contacts, we mutated all of the contacted guanines of the HREs to adenines (Fig. 6A) and tested the effect of these mutations on receptor binding. In binding competitions experiments, an unlabeled bcl-X mutHRE oligonucleotide was a very weak competitor for the binding of PR to the labeled cons-HRE in comparison with wild type bcl-X HREs (Fig. 6B, lanes 2–11). >100-fold molar excess of the mutated form was required to reduce by 50% binding of PR to the labeled cons-HRE (Fig. 6C). These experiments suggest that PR binds to the bcl-X mutHREs with approximately five times less affinity compared with the bcl-X HREs. bcl-X HREs Are Necessary to Confer Steroid Responsiveness to P4 —To test the functional relevance of HRE I and II, we performed transient transfection assays with the extended P4ΔHRE expression vector, which contains a deletion of 95 nucleotides including both putative HREs (Fig. 7A). This construct did not respond to either R5020 (Fig. 7B, compare lane 5 with lane 2) in T47D cells or dexamethasone in HC11 cells (Fig. 7C, compare lane 5 with lane 2). These results suggest that HRE I and HRE II are bona fide functional HREs, which confer hormone responsiveness to P4. P4 Is Activated by Steroid Hormones in Vivo—Transcriptional activation of P4 by hormones in vivo was confirmed by RNase protection assay and reverse transcriptase-PCR in HC11 cells. As previously shown (6Pecci A. Scholz A. Pelster D. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11791-11798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), hormonal treatment lead to accumulation of transcripts for both bcl-XL and bcl-XS isoforms but the proportion of bcl-XL mRNA increased more markedly (Fig. 8A, lane 2). No hormonal effect was observed when we analyzed the PCR products obtained from transcripts generated by the proximal promoters P1 or P2 (Fig. 8B, lanes 2 and 5, respectively). However, using specific primers for the amplification of the P4 5′-leading exon, an increase of the product was observed in samples obtained from cells treated with dexamethasone (Fig. 8C, upper panel, lane 2). This hormone effect was abolished by the coincubation with RU38486 (Fig. 8C, upper panel, lane 3). As a control, no change was detected in gapdh RNA levels after hormone treatment (Fig. 8C, lower panel). ChIPs experiments demonstrated that, 30 min after treatment of HC11 cells with dexamethasone, GR was recruited to the P4 promoter region of bcl-X containing the putative HREs (Fig. 9A, upper panel, lane 2). No differences in the binding of GR were observed in the bcl-X proximal promoter region encompassing P1 or P2 (Fig. 9A, middle panel, lane 2). We next tested whether the bcl-X P4 promoter region was transcriptionally active after the hormone treatment. ChIP experiments using a monoclonal RNA-polymerase II (RNApol II) antibody demonstrated a specific recruitment of the enzyme to this region after incubating HC11 cells with dexamethasone (Fig. 9B, upper panel, lane 4). Hormonal treatment did not influence the binding of RNApol II to the bcl-X proximal promoter region (Fig. 9B, middle panel, lane 4). In all of the cases, ChIPs of the gapdh gene were used as control (Fig. 9, A and B, lower panel). Thus, the specific binding of GR to the bcl-X P4 promoter region correlates with an increase in the binding of the RNApol II to this region, suggesting that GR would mediate in vivo activation of P4. The results demonstrate that glucocorticoid treatment induces the transcription of endogenous bcl-X gene, mainly through the activation of P4 in mammary epithelial cells. Among other genes, bcl-X has been postulated to be crucial in hormone-dependent apoptosis. In many cases, the patterns of Bcl-XL or Bcl-XS expression are different from or opposite to those reported for Bcl-2, suggesting that Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 regulate cell survival and death at different stages of cell differentiation through tissue-specific control of their expression (27Krajewski S. Bodrug S. Gascoyne R. Berean K. Krajewska M. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar). In mammary gland, Bcl-XL is the most abundant cell survival member from the Bcl-2 family. However, it has been demonstrated that this protein is not essential during mammopoiesis but is critical for controlled apoptosis during the first phase of involution (28Walton K.D. Wagner K.U. Rucker III, E.B. Shillingford J.M. Miyoshi K. Hennighausen L. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the ratio of bcl-XS/bcl-XL remained stable in the virgin, pregnant, and lactating gland, it increased 6-fold during the first 2 days of involution (29Heermeier K. Benedict M. Li M. Furth P. Nunez G. Hennighausen L. Mech. Dev. 1996; 56: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To ensure a correct control of apoptosis, the ratio between antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins (i.e. Bcl-2/Bax or Bcl-XL/Bcl-XS) must be precisely regulated. Thus, the regulation of cell death requires not only an accurate control of transcription but also control of splicing of bcl-X gene. The complex structure of mouse bcl-X gene with at least four different exons located upstream of the unique open reading frame suggests that promoter choice and alternative splicing may provide tissue-specific response to different stimuli. The experiments summarized in this paper support the notion that steroid hormones modulate bcl-X gene expression through the activation of a distal promoter. We identified two novel HREs immediately upstream of the bcl-X promoter P4 that specifically bind GR and PR in vitro with an affinity only 2-fold lower than a canonical HRE. Deletion of both bcl-X HREs contacted by the hormone receptors in vitro eliminates hormone induction of the P4 reporter gene in transfection assays, supporting a role of the HREs in the in vivo response of the bcl-X gene. Following hormone treatment of HC11 cells, in vivo binding of GR to the bcl-X P4 promoter region was detected. This recruitment of the hormone receptor correlates with an increased binding of RNApol II with accumulation of mRNA transcripts generated from the P4 promoter and with an increase in the ratio of bcl-XL isoform to bcl-XS isoform. These results support the hypothesis that GR mediates in vivo activation of P4 in mouse mammary epithelial cells. Because P4 is the only known bcl-X promoter responding to steroid hormones in this cell line, our results are congruent with the notion that P4 activation by hormones generates mainly the antiapoptotic bcl-XL isoform, although the mechanism of this differential activation is still unknown. After completion of the experimental part of this work, Gascoyne et al. (11Gascoyne D.M. Kypta R.M. Vivanco M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18022-18029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) describe the existence of other HRE-like sequences on the mouse bcl-X gene and show an in vitro interaction of these elements with nuclear extract of dexamethasone-treated fibrosarcoma cells (11Gascoyne D.M. Kypta R.M. Vivanco M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18022-18029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, these HREs are different from those we found and their studies do not address selective promoter usage controlled by glucocorticoids. The ChIP assays performed in our study did not discriminate whether GR binds in vivo to the HREs described here or to those described by Gascoyne et al. (11Gascoyne D.M. Kypta R.M. Vivanco M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18022-18029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, according to our transient transfection assays, only HRE I and HRE II, as described here, confer steroid responsiveness to P4 in mammary epithelial cells. In fact, the vector P4ΔHRE, which contains two of the HRE-like sequences described by Gascoyne et al. (11Gascoyne D.M. Kypta R.M. Vivanco M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18022-18029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), did not respond to dexamethasone or to the progestagen R5020 in HC11 and T47D cells, respectively. It is possible that the cell context determines GR or PR binding to different HREs in the proximity of P4. As suggested in a previous study (30Nordeen S.K. Suh B.J. Kuhnel B. Hutchison C.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the cooperativity among several HRE sequences may contribute to the inducibility of the promoter. Thus, the degree of occupancy of the different HREs may mediate recruitment of different tissue-specific or ubiquitous factors, which consequently determine hormone-dependent bcl-X expression. In this sense, the presence of several HREs within a short DNA region may provide the basis for specifying context-dependent hormonal regulation of programmed cell death. We thank Bernhard Gross for the preparation of recombinant PR, Dr. Damian G. Romero for P3 vector construction, and Dr. Nancy Hynes for HC11 cells."

The c-Abl and PTEN tumor suppressors are known to stabilize p53 by blocking the Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. This study investigated the correlation between p53 and merlin, a neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-related tumor suppressor, in association with the Mdm2 function. The results showed that merlin increased the p53 stability by inhibiting the Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53, which accompanied the increase in the p53-dependent transcriptional activity. The stabilization of p53 by merlin appeared to be accomplished through Mdm2 degradation, and the N-terminal region of merlin was responsible for this novel activity. This study also showed that overexpression of merlin-induced apoptosis of cells depending preferentially on p53 in response to the serum starvation or a chemotherapeutic agent. These results suggest that merlin could be a positive regulator of p53 in terms of tumor suppressor activity, and provide the promising therapeutic means for treating tumors with non-functional merlin or Mdm2 overexpression.

NF2 is characterized by the formation of a bilateral vestibular schwannoma, which results in a high predisposition to central nervous system (CNS) tumors, cafe-au-lait spots or other skin lesions, and lens opacities (4Short M.P.

It is caused by the disruption of an NF2 tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 22q12 (1Evans D.G. Huson S.M. Donnai D. Neary W. Blair V. Newton V. Strachan T. Harris R. J. Med.

The NF2 gene encodes merlin (also known as schwannomin) with 595 amino acids.Many studies have suggested that merlin is involved in regulating cell growth and proliferation (5Ikeda K. Saeki Y.

Mice with conditional homozygous NF2 mutations targeted to the neural crest and Schwann cells can develop schwannomas, Schwann-cell hyperplasia, cataracts, and osseous metastases (8Giovannini M. Robanus-Maandag E. van der Valk M. Niwa-Kawakita M. Abramowski V. Goutebroze L. Woodruff J.M. Berns A. Thomas G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1617-1630PubMed Google Scholar). However, germ line heterozygous NF2 mutant mice develop a variety of aggressive malignancies with metastatic properties, which are not typically observed in NF2 patients (9McClatchey A.I. Saotome I. Mercer K. Crowley D. Gusella J.F. Bronson R.T. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1121-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Overall, these reports suggest that merlin is both a tumor and metastasis suppressor. In addition, overexpression of wild-type merlin can reverse the Ha-Ras-induced malignant phenotypes such as anchorage- and contact-independent cell growth in NIH3T3 cells (10Tikoo A. Varga M.

Mdm2 binds to the transcriptional activation domain of p53 in the nucleus and translocates it to the cytoplasm where p53 is rapidly degraded via an ubiquitin-proteasome system (15Momand J.

Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Since mdm2 is a transcriptional target gene of p53, they create a negative auto-regulatory feedback loop (21Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar).Neutralizing the inhibitory effect of Mdm2 may be an efficient and common mechanism by which p53 is regulated. Indeed, recent studies have shown that two tumor suppressor proteins, c-Abl and PTEN, enhanced p53 activity by inhibiting the Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53 (22Sionov R.V. Moallem E. Berger M.

Subsequently, C-Abl was known to prevent the ubiquitination and nuclear export of p53 by Mdm2 via phosphorylation of Mdm2 at the Tyr394 residue both in vivo and in vitro (24Sionov R.V. Coen S.

Perets R. Van Etten R.A. Oren M. Taya Y. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3715-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PTEN was reported to restrict Mdm2 in the cytoplasm for degradation, possibly by inhibiting the phosphorylation by Akt at the Ser166 and Ser186 residues as well as the nuclear import of Mdm2 (23Mayo L.D.

Saotome I. Mercer K. Crowley D. Gusella J.F. Bronson R.T. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1121-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Therefore, this study investigated if merlin also increases the p53 activity as PTEN or c-Abl does. We found that merlin enhanced the stability and activity of p53 by inducing Mdm2 degradation.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—The expression plasmids for the NF-κB p65 subunit (pcDNA-p65), merlin (pcDNA-NF2), (26Kim J. Kim H. Jeun S. Rha S. Kim Y. Ko Y. Won J. Lee K. Rha H. Wang Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) GAL4 DBD-fused p53 (pSG-p53) (27Kim H. Lim J.Y. Kim Y.H. Kim H. Park S.H. Lee K.H. Han H. Jeun S.S. Lee J.H. Rha H.K. Mol. Cells. 2002; 14: 108-114PubMed Google Scholar), and intact p53 (pcDNA-p53) (29Lee H. Kim H.T. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19786-19791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were described previously. The plasmids for the NF2 deletion mutants (M1, M2, M3, and M4) were also described previously (26Kim J. Kim H. Jeun S. Rha S. Kim Y. Ko Y. Won J. Lee K. Rha H. Wang Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The p21 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (p21-Luc) is constructed by inserting p21 promoter region from p21-CAT (30Han J. Yoo H.Y. Choi B.H. Rho H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) into the pGL3-basic plasmid (Promega). The expression plasmid for the GAL4 DBD-fused transactivating domain of Elk (pFA2-Elk1), and the luciferase reporters with the GAL4 DNA binding sites (pFR-Luc) and the NF-κB response elements (pNF-κB-Luc) were purchased from Stratagene. The human Mdm2 expression plasmid (pcDNA-Mdm2) was kindly provided from Dr. Carl Maki (Harvard University). The expression plasmid for the full-length Mdm2 in reverse orientation (pcDNA-As-Mdm2) was constructed by cloning the PCR fragment in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego. CA) using the EcoRI/XhoI sites.Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Reporter Assay—The NIH3T3 cells and glioma cell lines (U87MG, U373, and A172) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Human lung carcinoma cell lines (H358 and H460) and human osteosarcoma cell lines (U2OS and SAOS-2) were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The Gene Porter2 transfection reagent (Gene Therapy System, Inc.) was used to transfect the plasmids according to the manufacturer's instruction. For the reporter assay, 3 × 105 NIH3T3 cells were plated in a 35-mm plate. After 16 h, the cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of reporter plasmids and combinations of expression plasmids. Total amount of the transfected DNA was kept same between samples using the pcDNA3.1 plasmid. The cells were harvested after 24 h, and the luciferase activity was measured. An internal control for the transfection efficiency could not be used because merlin influences the expression of most of the commercial promoters. Instead, the experiments were repeated three times and the results were statistically analyzed.Establishment of Merlin-expressing Stable Cell Lines (NIH3T3-NF2)—The NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA-NF2. After 48 h, the cells were split at a 10:1 ratio and cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. After 21 days in the selective medium, the individual G418-resistant colonies were isolated, and merlin expression was confirmed by Western analysis using anti-merlin antibodies.Adenoviruses—The adenovirus expressing merlin (Ad-NF2) was kindly provided by Dr. Jeun (Catholic University of Korea, Korea). The adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) was purchased from Neurogenex Inc. (Korea). The viruses were propagated in the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line, and the viral titers were determined by the limiting-dilution bioassay in HEK293 cells.Preparation of Meningiomas Samples—Human meningioma biopsy samples (neoplasmic regions of the meninges) were obtained from the department of neurosurgery, St. Mary's hospital at the Catholic University of Korea. The tissues were suspended in 1 ml of a lysis buffer containing 35 mm Tris, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 65 mm dithiothreitol (1,4-dithioerythritol), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg of each pepstatin A, chymostatin, and leupeptin, and antipain). The suspension was homogenized for ∼30 s and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C to remove the undissolved materials. The protein content in the supernatant was measured using the Bradford assay. Thirty micrograms of each sample were used for the Western blotting analysis.Antibodies and Western Analysis—The antibodies for merlin, p53, and Mdm2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), β-actin (Sigma, Inc), and p21 (Calbiochem) were obtained from commercial sources. The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for 30 min on ice in a radioimmune precipitation buffer-B buffer (0.5% Nonidet P40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then subjected to the SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. After transferring the proteins, the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. This was followed by the sequential incubation with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The signals were detected using ECL.Analysis of DNA Fragmentation—The cells (1 × 106) were plated in 100 mm dishes. After 24 h, the stable NIH3T3-NF2 or NIH3T3-pcDNA3.1 cells were directly starved with serum in a medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. The human lung carcinoma (H358 and H460) and human osteosarcoma (U2OS and SAOS-2) cell lines were first infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-NF2 at a dose of 100 moi for 2 h, after which the virus was washed off and replaced with the fresh medium. After 24 h, these cells were also starved with serum as above. After 72 h, the cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellets were resuspended in 0.1 ml of a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, the DNA was precipitated from the supernatants by adding a 0.1 volume of 5.0 m NaCl and a 0.5 volume of isopropyl alcohol. After incubation at -20 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of a Tris/EDTA buffer containing proteinase K (300 μg/ml) and RNase A (100 μg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at 50 °C. The samples were subsequently analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel in a 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer.MTT Assay—The cells were plated at 5,000 cells per well in a 96-well tissue culture plate. After 18 h, the human lung carcinoma (H358 and H460) and human osteosarcoma cell lines (U2OS and SAOS-2) were infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-NF2 at a dose of 100 moi for 2 h, after which the virus was washed off and replaced with fresh medium. After 24 h, the cells were treated with an increasing amount of doxorubicin (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 μg/ml). In the cases of the NIH3T3-pcDNA3.1 and NIH3T3-NF2–1, the cells were directly treated with the increasing amount of doxorubicin at 24 h after plating. After 48 h, MTT was incubated with the samples at a final concentration of 1 mm for 4 h. The colored formazan crystals were dissolved in a 100 μl of Me2SO solution, and the optical densities at 570 nm were measured using a microplate reader. The results were normalized against the blank readings. The percentage of cell survival was calculated using the following formula: (the values from the treated cells/the values from the untreated control) × 100. The data are plotted as the doxorubicin concentration versus the percentage of cell survival. Each data point is average value from two independent experiments done in triplicate.RESULTSExpression of Merlin and p53 in Human Brain Tumors—It was recently reported that the cooperation between the Nf2 and p53 mutations are important in tumor development in mice (9McClatchey A.I. Saotome I. Mercer K. Crowley D. Gusella J.F. Bronson R.T. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1121-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The c-Abl or PTEN tumor suppressor was known to elevate both the steady state level and the transcriptional activity of p53 (22Sionov R.V. Moallem E. Berger M. Kazaz A. Gerlitz O. Ben-Neriah Y. Oren M. Haupt Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8371-8374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Mayo L.D. Dixon J.E. Durden D.L. Tonks N.K. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5484-5489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was hypothesized that the function of merlin and p53 are also directly related, as in the case of c-Abl and PTEN. In this study, the levels of p53 and merlin were first examined in three glioma cell lines (A172, U373, and U87MG) and the tissues from 13 meningiomas. As shown in Fig. 1A, both p53 and merlin were highly expressed in the U373 cells only, and neither was detected in the A172 or U87MG cells. In the case of the meningiomas tissues, the expression levels of both merlin and p53 were examined in the 13 frozen samples. As shown in Fig. 1B, the meningiomas tissues that strongly expressed merlin also showed a high p53 expression level (lanes 6–9 and 11–13). Overall, these results suggest that the levels of p53, and merlin might be related to each other in many glioma cell lines and brain tumor samples.Merlin Stabilizes p53 Protein and Activates Its Transcriptional Activity—To assess the direct correlation between the p53 and merlin levels, this study first focused on the effect of merlin on the p53 levels as suggested from the cases of c-Abl and PTEN. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing merlin (NIH3T3-NF2-1) or the control cell line (NIH3T3-pcDNA3.1) were constructed. NIH3T3 cells were used because the tumor suppressor activity of merlin is well known in this cell line. The levels of p53 and p21Waf1/Cip1, a transcriptional target of p53, were measured using Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, merlin overexpression resulted in an increase in the endogenous levels of p53 and p21. This merlin effect on p53 and p21 levels was confirmed using a transient expression of p53 and merlin under the CMV promoter. Consistent with the result using the stable cell lines, overexpression of merlin resulted in an increase in the cellular levels of co-expressed p53 and endogenous p21 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). No effect of merlin was shown on the CMV promoter (data not shown). These results suggest that merlin could induce the accumulation of transcriptionally active p53.Fig. 2Elevation of p53 steady-state levels and transcriptional activity by merlin.A, the p53 and p21 levels in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing merlin (NIH3T3-NF2–1) or the control plasmid (NIH3T3-pcDNA3.1). The cell lysates were examined for p53, p21, merlin, and β-actin levels by Western blotting. B, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the p53 (pcDNA-p53) and the merlin (pcDNA-NF2) expression plasmid as indicated. After 48 h, the cell lysates were subjected to the Western blotting for merlin, p53, p21, and β-actin as an internal control. C, p21-Luc reporter plasmid (0.2 μg) was transfected into the NIH3T3 cells along with the pcDNA-p53 and pcDNA-NF2 as indicated (left). The NF-κB-Luc reporter plasmid (0.2 μg) was transfected into the NIH3T3 cells along with a plasmid encoding a p65 subunit of NF-κB (pcDNA-p65) and pcDNA-NF2, as indicated (right). After 24 h, the cell lysates were prepared, and the luciferase activities were determined. The experiments were performed three times in duplicate, and the results were averaged. The standard deviations are shown on the top of each bar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of merlin on the p53 activity was further assessed by the reporter assays performed in the co-expression system using p21 promoter (p21-Luc). The p21 promoter activity was increased considerably by the co-expression of p53 and merlin depending on the amount of merlin protein (Fig. 2C, left). Under similar conditions, the activity of the NF-κB p65 subunit was reduced by merlin (Fig. 2C, right) as reported previously (26Kim J. Kim H. Jeun S. Rha S. Kim Y. Ko Y. Won J. Lee K. Rha H. Wang Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).To exclude the possibility that merlin activates p53 directly by enhancing its DNA binding activity for instance, the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD)-fused p53 (GAL4-DBD-p53) was constructed and tested for the merlin effect in NIH3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, merlin induced transcriptional activity of GAL4-DBD-p53 (left), while it reduced the activity of GAL-DBD-Elk1 (pFA2-Elk1) (right) on the GAL4 DBD responsive reporter (pFR-Luc) in a dose-dependent manner. The GAL4-DBD-p53 protein level was also increased along with the increase in the amount of merlin (Fig. 3A). Taken together, these results suggest that merlin activates p53 via enhancing its stability.Fig. 3Stabilization and activation of GAL4-DBD-fused p53 (GAL4-DBD-p53) by merlin.A, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pSG-p53 encoding GAL4-p53 and pcDNA-NF2 as indicated. After 48 h, the cell lysates were subjected to the Western blotting for p53, merlin and β-actin as an internal control. B, GAL4-Luc reporter plasmid, pFR-Luc (0.2 μg), was transfected into the NIH3T3 cells along with pSG-p53 and pcDNA-NF2 as indicated (left). The GAL4 DBD-fused Elk1 (pFA2-Elk1) was used instead of pSG-p53 in the same set of experiment (right). After 24 h, the cell lysates were prepared, and the luciferase activity was determined. The experiments were performed three times in duplicate, and the results were averaged. The standard deviations are shown on the top of each bar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Merlin Inhibits the Mdm2-mediated Degradation of p53— The stabilization of p53 by merlin raises an intriguing possibility if merlin rescues p53 from Mdm2-mediated degradation. This was assessed by examining the effect of merlin on the p53 degradation caused by the ectopic expression of Mdm2 in NIH3T3 cells. As expected, the level of overexpressed GAL4-DBD-p53 was reduced considerably by Mdm2, which was recovered by the co-expression of merlin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). The functional assessment of this phenomenon in the GAL4-DBD-p53-dependent reporter system also showed that merlin relieves the inhibitory effect of Mdm2 on the p53 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Merlin neutralized the inhibitory effect of Mdm2 on the p53 stability and activity.A, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pSG-p53 alone or in combinations with the Mdm2 or merlin expression plasmid as indicated. After 48 h, the cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting for p53, merlin and β-actin. B, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the 0.2 μg of pFR-Luc and the combinations of pSG-p53, mdm2, or merlin expression plasmid as indicated. After 24 h, the cell lysates were prepared, and the luciferase activity was measured. The result is an average of three duplicate experiments, and the standard deviations are shown on the top of each bar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Merlin Stabilizes p53 via Down-regulating Mdm2 Levels— From the finding that merlin neutralizes Mdm2-promoted p53 degradation, we examined if the merlin effect on p53 stability is Mdm2-dependent. A plasmid containing an antisense sequence of human Mdm2 cDNA (pcDNA-As-Mdm2) was constructed to neutralize the Mdm2 expression in human lung carcinoma H460 cells with wild type p53. The cells were transfected with the pcDNA-As-Mdm2 and the expression plasmids for merlin and p53, and the levels of p53, Mdm2 and merlin were examined by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). As expected, As-Mdm2 alone clearly reduced the endogenous Mdm2 level and induced the level of co-expressed p53. Interestingly, the expression of merlin alone also resulted in the significant reduction of the endogenous Mdm2 level even without As-Mdm2, while it induced the p53 level. Co-expression of merlin and As-Mdm2 showed no additive effect on the p53 stability, when compared with the effects of each. This result suggests that the effect of merlin on p53 stability is Mdm2-dependent.Fig. 5Down-regulation of Mdm2 by merlin.A, H460 cells were transfected with pcDNA-p53 alone or in combinations with the antisense-Mdm2 and merlin expression plasmids as indicated. After 48 h, the cells were subjected to Western blotting for p53, Mdm2, merlin, and β-actin. B, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA-Mdm2 alone or in along with the merlin expression plasmid. After 48 h, the cells were subjected to Western blotting for Mdm2, merlin, and β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The merlin effect was further examined on the overexpressed Mdm2 under the CMV promoter, to assess if it occurred at the transcriptional level or at the protein level. As shown in Fig. 5B, co-expression of merlin significantly reduced the level of overexpressed Mdm2 in NIH3T3 cells. This result suggests that merlin induces the destabilization of Mdm2, because merlin did not affect the CMV promoter-derived gene expression (data not shown).The N-terminal 130 Amino Acids Are Responsible for the Destabilization of Mdm2—Merlin contains three domains including FERM (residues 1–302), an α-helical region (residues 303–478), and a unique C-terminal domain (residues 479–595) (31Sun C.X. Robb V.A. Gutmann D.H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3991-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The functional domains of merlin involved in the Mdm2 degradation were analyzed using deletion mutants of merlin (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, the M2 and M3 deletion mutants of merlin induced a reduction in the Mdm2 level as efficiently as the wild-type merlin, but the M1 or M4 deletion mutants showed no effect on the Mdm2 level. Both the M2 and M3 mutants contain the N-terminal 130 amino acids overlapping the FERM domain of merlin that lacks in the M1 and M4 mutants. This result suggests that the N-terminal region of merlin overlapping the FERM domain is important for destabilizing Mdm2.Fig. 6Domains of Merlin responsible for the Mdm2 degradation.A, schematic representation of the wild-type (WT) and deletion mutants of NF2 (M1–M4). The numbers indicate the amino acid positions. B, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the Mdm2 expression plasmid along with the plasmids for wild type or deletion mutants of merlin. After 48 h, the levels of Mdm2, merlin, and β-actin were detected by Western blotting.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W1998683977,"Epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent CD95-tyrosine phosphorylation was recently identified as an early step in apoptosis induction via the CD95 system (Reinehr, R., Schliess, F., and Haussinger, D. (2003) FASEB J. 17, 731–733). The effect of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) on modulation of the hyperosmotic and CD95 ligand (CD95L)-induced CD95 activation process was studied. Pretreatment of hepatocytes with ONOO- inhibited CD95L- and hyperosmolarity-induced CD95 membrane trafficking and formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, but not epidermal growth factor receptor activation and its association with CD95. Under these conditions, however, no tyrosine phosphorylation of CD95 occurred; instead, CD95 was tyrosine-nitrated. When ONOO- was added after induction of CD95-tyrosine phosphorylation by CD95L or hyperosmolarity, tyrosine nitration of CD95 was largely prevented and death-inducing signaling complex formation occurred. CD95-tyrosine nitration abolished the hyperosmotic sensitization of hepatocytes toward CD95L-induced apoptosis. Additionally, in CD95-yellow fluorescent protein-transfected Huh7-hepatoma cells, ONOO- induced CD95 Tyr nitration and prevented CD95L-induced Tyr phosphorylation and apoptosis. Tyrosine-nitrated CD95 was also found in rat livers derived from an in vivo model of endotoxinemia. The data suggest that CD95-tyrosine nitration prevents CD95 activation by inhibiting CD95-tyrosine phosphorylation. Apparently, CD95-tyrosine phosphorylation and nitration are mutually exclusive. The data identify critical tyrosine residues of CD95 as another target of the anti-apoptotic action of NO."
https://openalex.org/W1990652066,"Bile secretion is regulated by different signaling transduction pathways including protein kinase C (PKC). However, the role of different PKC isoforms for bile formation is still controversial. This study investigates the effects of PKC isoform selective activators and inhibitors on PKC translocation, bile secretion, bile acid uptake, and subcellular transporter localization in rat liver, isolated rat hepatocytes and in HepG2 cells. In rat liver activation of Ca2+-dependent cPKCα and Ca2+-independent PKC∈ by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10nmol/liter) is associated with their translocation to the plasma membrane. PMA also induced translocation of the cloned rat PKC∈ fused to a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), which was transfected into HepG2 cells. In the perfused liver, PMA induced marked cholestasis. The PKC inhibitors Gö6850 (1 μmol/liter) and Gö6976 (0.2 μmol/liter), a selective inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms, diminished the PMA effect by 50 and 60%, respectively. Thymeleatoxin (Ttx,) a selective activator of Ca2+-dependent cPKCs, did not translocate rat PKC∈-YFP transfected in HepG2 cells. However, Ttx (0.5–10 nmol/liter) induced cholestasis similar to PMA and led to a retrieval of Bsep from the canalicular membrane in rat liver while taurocholate-uptake in isolated hepatocytes was not affected. Gö6976 completely blocked the cholestatic effect of Ttx but had no effect on tauroursodeoxycholate-induced choleresis. The data identify Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms as inducers of cholestasis. This is mainly due to inhibition of taurocholate excretion involving transporter retrieval from the canalicular membrane.

Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). Subsequently, 12 isoforms were characterized and grouped into classical, Ca2+-dependent (cPKC: α, βI, βII, γ), novel, Ca2+-independent (nPKC: ∈, δ, θ, η), and atypical (aPKC: ζ, ι) PKCs. In rat hepatocytes expression of PKCα, βII, δ, ∈ and ζ was demonstrated (15Perletti G.P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 16Croquet F. Brehier A. Gil S. Davy J. Feger J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1315: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the Ca2+-independent PKC∈ isoform by taurolithocholate was reported to decrease bile flow (12Beuers U. Probst I. Soroka C. Boyer J.L. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Paumgartner G. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), while the therapeutically used bile acid tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) increases bile flow (17Kurz A.K. Graf D.

Materials—Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), Gö6976, and thymeleatoxin were from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany), Gö6850 and the mouse anti MRP2/Mrp2 (M2III-6) antibody were from Alexis (Grünberg, Germany). The rabbit anti-rat Bsep antibody (K12) and the rabbit anti-rat Ntcp (K4) were generous gifts from Dr. B. Stieger and Prof. P. Meier-Abt (Kantonsspital Zürich, Switzerland). The anti-mouse ZO-1 antibody was from Biozol (Eching, Germany). Isoform-specific PKC antibodies were from BD Biosciences (Heidelberg, Germany). The plasmid MARCKS-GFP was generously provided by Prof. N. Saito (Kobe University, Japan) (21Ohmori S. Sakai N. Shirai Y. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Shimizu N. Saito N. J. Biol.

Rat Liver Perfusion—Livers of male Wistar rats (150 g) were perfused as described previously (18Schliess F. Kurz A.K. vom Dahl S. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1306-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) in the presence of 100μmol/liter of taurocholate. Bile was collected every 2 min. Liver viability was assessed from the measurements of portal pressure, pH, and LDH- and glucose-release. After 30 min of perfusion, inhibitors or agonists were added to the medium as indicated. At various time points liver specimens were excised and snap frozen for cryosections or Western blots as described in Refs. 7Kubitz R. Wettstein M. Warskulat U. Häussinger D.

Isolation and Culture of Rat Hepatocytes—Rat hepatocytes were prepared as described previously (18Schliess F. Kurz A.K. vom Dahl S. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1306-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 6 mmol/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 nmol/liter dexamethasone, and 100 nmol/liter insulin). FBS was omitted 12 h before experiments were started. Western Blot Analysis and Densitometry—Liver specimen were minced in homogenization buffer containing Tris (20 mmol/liter, pH 7.4), sucrose (250 mmol/liter), EGTA (5 mmol/liter), MgCl2 (1 mmol/liter), and protease inhibitors according to Ref. 12Beuers U. Probst I. Soroka C. Boyer J.L. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Paumgartner G. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar. Samples were ultracentrifuged for 60 min at 150,000 × g. The pellets were enriched in cell membrane-bound proteins while supernatants contained cytosolic proteins. Equal protein amounts of the membranous or cytosolic fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE. PKC isoforms were detected by specific monoclonal antibodies. Densitometry was performed with 1D Image Analysis Software (PerkinElmer Optoelectronics, Wiesbaden, Germany). The amount of membrane-bound (mb) PKC isoforms is expressed as the intensity ratio Imb/(Imb + Icytosolic) or as the x-fold change compared with control. The total amount of PKC in cultured rat hepatocytes was determined in whole cell lysates. Uptake Studies in Isolated Hepatocytes—Rat hepatocytes cultured for 12 h in fetal calf serum-free medium were treated with PMA, Ttx, or Me2SO (control) for 30 min and were then incubated for 2–10 min in fresh medium containing 150 μmol/liter taurocholate (TC) and 450 cpm/fmol [3H]TC. Uptake was stopped by removing the medium and washing the cells three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 0.2 mol/liter NaOH and 0.05% SDS. Radioactivity of supernatants and cell lysates were measured in a scintillation counter (Packard instruments, Frankfurt, Germany). Unspecific binding of taurocholate was determined by incubating the cells in ice-cold incubation medium for 5 s. These values were subtracted from the uptake rates. Protein concentrations in cell lysates were determined with the Bradford method. TC uptake is expressed as pmol/mg protein. Uptake and unspecific binding was measured in three dishes per condition per cell preparation. Cloning of the Rat PKC∈ and Human PKCα and Transfection into HepG2 Cells—In order to clone the rat PKC∈ or the human PKCα, respectively, reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and oligo(dT) as a primer. The templates were mRNA from rat brain and from HepG2 cells, respectively. For the subsequent PCR the forward primers were 5′-ATCCGCTAGCGAATTCCGGAATCCGGCGAG-3′ and 5′-ATCCGCTAGCGGAGCAAGAGGTGGTTGG-3′, respectively. They contained an NheI restriction site and started in front of the 5′-untranslated region of rat PKC∈ and human PKCα, respectively (according to the sequence with the accession numbers M18331 and NM002737.1, respectively). The reverse primers were 5′-CCGCGGTACCCAGGGCATCAGGTCTTCACC-3′ and 5′-CCGCGGTACCCATACTGCACTCTGTAAG-3′, respectively, where the stop codons were replaced by KpnI restriction sites. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). After propagation in Escherichia coli inserts were excised with NheI and KpnI and were ligated into the vector pEYFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in frame to the N terminus of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. The sequences of the resulting plasmids (PKC∈-YFP and PKCα-YFP) were confirmed by sequencing. HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium-Nutrimix F12 with 10% fetal calf serum. PKC∈-YFP, PKCα-YFP, or MARCKS-GFP were transfected into HepG2 cells with LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Invitrogen). 24–48 h later cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Immunostaining and confocal laser-scanning microscopy were performed as described in Ref. 7Kubitz R. Wettstein M. Warskulat U. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar using a Leica TCS-NT confocal laserscanning system mounted on an inverted microscope. Identical settings were used to compare liver sections from different experimental conditions. Cross-talk of fluorochromes was excluded by the use of the acousto optical tunable filter. The entire depth of a section was scanned in 0.5-μm steps. The resulting stacks of pictures were mounted as single projections. HepG2 cells transfected with PKC∈-YFP, PKCα-YFP, or MARCKS-GFP were cultured on 12-mm glass cover slips. 24–48 h after transfection coverslips were placed in a bath holder at 37 °C and covered with medium. Cells were selected according to the expression of PKC∈-YFP, PKCα-YFP, or MARCKS-GFP. After brief adjustments of the microscope (excitation at 488 nm, emission at >510 nm), confocal pictures of HepG2 cells were taken in regular intervals (10 s to 1 min). After 2 min, PMA (100 nmol/liter) or Ttx (100 nmol/liter) were added to the medium, and cells were scanned for up to 60 min. Gö6976 (1 μmol/liter) or Gö6850 (1 μmol/liter) were added 30 min before microscopy was started. In the case of PKC∈ PMA was applied to the medium at the end of Ttx treatment to finally prove translocation of PKC∈-YFP. Statistics—Data were reproduced from at least three perfusions or cell preparations. Values are given as means ± S.D. (Western blots, uptakes) or S.E. (perfusions). The two-sided Student’s t test was used for statistical analysis, with a p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Phorbolester-induced Cholestasis—PMA (10 nmol/liter) induced cholestasis in perfused rat livers and reduced bile secretion by 77% from 3.25 ± 0.22 to 0.75 ± 0.36 μl/g liver/min (n = 4) after 60 min in the presence of 100 μmol/liter taurocholate (Fig. 1). Taurocholate excretion was similarly reduced by 78% from 201 ± 16 to 45 ± 21 nmol/g liver/min (n = 4) (Fig. 1) indicating that taurocholate was the major driving force for bile secretion in the experimental setting used. After 60 min of LDH release was 144 ± 19 (n = 3) and 100 ± 13 milliunits/g liver/min (n = 4) in the absence and presence of PMA, respectively, suggesting that PMA perfusion does not cause cell damage to the perfused livers. Gö6850 (bisindolylmaleimide I, 1 μmol/liter), a potent inhibitor of most Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent PKC isoforms (22Gekeler V. Boer R. Uberall F. Ise W. Schubert C. Utz I. Hofmann J. Sanders K.H. Schachtele C. Klemm K. Grunicke H. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 74: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) diminished the effect of PMA on bile and taurocholate secretion by about 50% (Fig. 1). Gö6850 had no significant effect on these parameters by itself (not shown). Gö6976, a carbazole derivate, is a selective inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms with an IC50 for cPKCα of 2.3 nmol/liter and for cPKCβI of 6.2 nmol/liter (23Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). nPKCδ and nPKC∈ are not inhibited by Gö6976 even at micromolar concentrations (23Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gö6976 (0.2 μmol/liter) inhibited the PMA-induced cholestasis by 60% after 60 min of PMA-infusion (Fig. 1), suggesting that the PMA-dependent cholestasis is largely transmitted by Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms. Ca2+-independent PKC isoforms such as nPKCδ and nPKC∈, which are activated by PMA, apparently contribute to cholestasis only to a smaller extent. Activation of PKC isoforms is associated with their translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (24Shoji M. Girard P.R. Mazzei G.J. Vogler W.R. Kuo J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 26Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the effect of PMA on subcellular PKC localization, rat livers were separated into a membrane (M) and cytosolic fraction (C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In control livers cPKCα was distributed in favor of the cytosol in contrast to nPKC∈ (Fig. 2A). Liver samples were taken before or 20 min after Me2SO (control) or PMA perfusion. Both, cPKCα and nPKC∈ translocated to the membrane fraction in PMA-treated but not in control livers (Fig. 2B). The effect of PMA on both PKC isoforms was statistically significant. The amount of cPKCα in the membrane fraction increased 2.3 ± 0.4-fold (n = 3; p < 0.05) and was stronger compared with nPKC∈ translocation (1.6 ± 0.4-fold increase; n = 3; p < 0.05)). Calcium-dependent PKCs Mediate Cholestasis—Ttx, a diterpene-derivate of mezerein from the plant Thymelea hirsuta, is a selective activator of Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms (27Ryves W.J. Evans A.T. Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. Evans F.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 28Llosas M.D. Batlle E. Coll O. Skoudy A. Fabre M. Garcia de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the perfused rat liver, Ttx at a concentration of 0.5 nmol/liter induced cholestasis (Fig. 3) and reduced bile flow and taurocholate excretion by ∼80%. The cholestatic effect was dose-dependent (Table I) resulting in an almost complete cholestasis at a Ttx concentration of 10 nmol/liter, while no signs of liver damage were detectable as assessed by LDH release (Table I). Ttx at 0.5 nmol/liter induced a minor increase in portal pressure (Fig. 3), which was more pronounced with increasing concentrations, therefore further experiments were performed with low Ttx concentrations (0.5 nmol/liter). Initial glucose output was 1.8 ± 0,2 nmol/g liver/min (n = 4) in controls and declined during perfusion. It was not significantly affected by Ttx (Fig. 3). The pH was not affected by Ttx treatment. At the beginning it was 7.44 ± 0.02 and 7.45 ± 0.01 in control and Ttx livers, respectively, and increased to 7.49 ± 0.03 and 7.51 ± 0.01, respectively, after 60 min.Table IDose-dependent effect of thymeleatoxin on bile flowTtxDecrease of bile flow nLDH releasenmol/liter%milliunits/g/min019 ± 2 (3)144 ± 190.161 ± 14 (3)119 ± 300.578 ± 7 (5)144 ± 161.081 ± 11 (3)167 ± 485.086 ± 8 (3)163 ± 1710.093 ± 4 (8)158 ± 11 Open table in a new tab Gö6976 (200 nmol/liter) abolished the cholestatic effect of Ttx (Fig. 3). This finding strongly suggests that Ttx-induced cholestasis is mediated by a Ca2+-dependent PKC isoform. Gö6976 itself had no significant effect (Fig. 3). In Ttx-treated livers (1 nmol/liter), cPKCα but not nPKC∈ translocated to the membrane fraction (Fig. 4A), in line with selective activation of cPKCs by Ttx. At 10-fold higher Ttx concentrations selectivity was still observed. The amount of membrane-bound cPKCα was 2.2 ± 0.3-fold increased in Ttx livers compared with control. The ratio of membrane-bound PKCα to total cPKCα significantly increased from 0.47 ± 0.03 (control, n = 3) to 0.65 ± 0.06 (Ttx, n = 3; p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the ratio of membrane-bound to total nPKC∈ was not increased (Fig. 4B; control: 0.55 ± 0.06, n = 3; Ttx: 0.51 ± 0.05, n = 3) after 60 min of Ttx perfusion. At this time point no significant changes in the distribution of cPKCβ (control: 0.55 ± 0.06; Ttx: 0.47 ± 0.01) or of nPKCδ (control: 0.66 ± 0.02; Ttx: 0.72 ± 0.07) were detectable (not shown). In the membrane fraction of Ttx-treated livers a second band of higher electrophoretic mobility was detected by the cPKCα antibody (Fig. 4B). In order to provide further evidence for the specificity of Ttx compared with PMA, the Ca2+-independent PKC∈ from rat and the Ca2+-dependent human PKCα were cloned as described in the methods section and were fused to the N terminus of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Human HepG2 cells were transfected with PKC∈-YFP or PKCα-YFP and were analyzed 24 h later. In many unstimulated cells PKC∈-YFP already localized to the cell membrane to some extent (e.g. Fig. 5A). However, PMA (100 nmol/liter) always induced a strong and rapid translocation of PKC∈-YFP to the cell membrane within 1–2 min (Fig. 5A and movie PMA and PKCe-YFP under Supplementary Materials). In contrast, no translocation to the plasma membrane was observed for PKC∈-YFP when cells were treated with Ttx (100 nmol/liter) for 15 min, while PMA still exerted the translocation (Fig. 5B, and movie Ttx plus PMA and PKCe-YFP under Supplementary Materials). Activation of the Ca2+-dependent human PKCα as indicated by its translocation to the cell membrane was observed for both PKC activators, PMA (Fig. 5C) and Ttx (Fig. 5D). It was noted that PKCα translocated faster in response to PMA compared with Ttx and that PKC∈ translocated faster than PKCα in response to PMA. Taken together, the data are in line with a selective activation of cPKCs but not nPKCs by Ttx. Differential Inhibition of PKC Isoforms by Gö6850 and Gö6976 —In order to investigate the efficacy of the two PKC inhibitors Gö6850 and Gö6976 in living cells, translocation of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrates (MARCKS) was studied in transfected HepG2 cells. In unstimulated cells MARCKS is localized at the cell membrane because of its myristoylation at the N terminus and its basic residues in the effector domain (29George D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24879-24885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of multiple residues in the effector domain in response to PKC activation introduces negative charges into MARCKS and eventually leads to translocation of MARCKS into the cytosol (21Ohmori S. Sakai N. Shirai Y. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Shimizu N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26449-26457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore subcellular localization of MARCKS was used as an indicator of PKC activity. In transfected HepG2 cells, both, PMA (Fig. 6A) and Ttx (Fig. 6B) induced translocation of MARCKS to the cytosol, indicating PKC activation by these compounds. Gö6850 inhibited PMA-(Fig. 6C) and Ttx- (Fig. 6D) induced MARCKS-translocation to the cytosol, indicating that Gö6850 affects all PMA- and Ttx-sensitive PKC isoforms. In contrast, Gö6976 only inhibited MARCKS translocation induced by Ttx (Fig. 6F) but not by PMA (Fig. 6E), which is in line with its inhibitory effect on Ca2+-dependent but not Ca2+-independent PKCs. The differential effects of PKC activators and inhibitors used in this study are summarized in Fig. 6G. TUDC-induced Choleresis Is Independent of cPKCs—Tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC, 20 μmol/l) increased taurocholate excretion from 220 ± 8 to 280 ± 9 nmol/g liver/min (Fig. 7) as described earlier (17Kurz A.K. Graf D. Schmitt M. vom Dahl S. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 407-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Schliess F. Kurz A.K. vom Dahl S. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1306-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). When Gö6976 (200 nmol/liter) was added 20 min before TUDC, it did not affect the TUDC-dependent increase in TC excretion (Fig. 7). This suggests that Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms are not essential for TUDC signaling toward choleresis. TC Uptake Is Not Impaired by PKC Activation in Isolated Hepatocytes—Taurocholate is taken up by the basolateral sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) and by organic anion-transporting polypeptides (Oatp) (30Meier P.J. Stieger B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 635-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). It is secreted by the canalicular bile salt export pump (Bsep). In order to differentiate whether PKC stimulation affects the transporter at the sinusoidal or the canalicular membrane, uptake of taurocholate was determined in isolated rat hepatocytes. 12 to 24 h after cell isolation, Ntcp was localized at the basolateral and canalicular proteins such as Mrp2 at the apical membrane (Fig. 8A), demonstrating polarized localization of the transporters. Cells cultured for 12 h were incubated 1 to 8 h with Ttx (100 nmol/liter) or PMA (100 nmol/liter). After treatment total amounts of cPKCα were determined in whole cell lysates by Western blots. Expressional down-regulation indirectly verified activation of cPKCα (Fig. 8B) by Ttx and PMA. The Km of Ntcp for TC transport is ∼25 μmol (31Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M. Lubbert H. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 32Kuhn W.F. Gewirtz D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G732-G740PubMed Google Scholar). In order to saturate transport TC-uptake was measured in the presence of 150 μmol/liter of TC. TC uptake was almost linear during the first 10 min (Fig. 8D). When cells were preincubated for 30 min with 1, 10, or 100 nmol/liter of Ttx or PMA, no inhibition of the initial TC uptake was observed compared with controls (Fig. 8D). Likewise shorter preincubation (2 min) with Ttx or PMA (100 nmol/liter each) did not decrease initial TC uptake (not shown). These data suggest that cPKCs in cultured hepatocytes are responsive to PMA or Ttx treatment, but do not affect TC uptake across the sinusoidal membrane. Effects of PMA and Ttx on Mrp2 and Bsep Localization—It was demonstrated recently that cholestasis can result from retrieval of canalicular transporter proteins into subapical vesicles (7Kubitz R.

https://openalex.org/W1982788039,"Glycodelin, previously known as PP14 (placental protein-14), is a kernel lipocalin secreted by the glandular epithelium of the endometrium upon progesterone stimulation and by the seminal vesicles. The isoform of the protein present in female reproductive tissue, glycodelin A (GdA), and the male counterpart, glycodelin S (GdS), have identical amino acid sequences, but strikingly different N-linked glycans. It is well documented in literature that GdA is an immunosuppressive protein, and we have shown that this activity is due to its ability to induce apoptosis in activated T cells. The precise role of GdS in seminal plasma is not known. In this study, we report that GdS is not apoptotically active. We observe that the apoptotic activity requires the presence of sialic acid residues on the complex glycans, as in the case of GdA; however, complex glycans of GdS are non-sialylated. We have expressed the wild-type protein in Pichia pastoris, which does not add sialic acid to the secreted proteins, and confirmed our observations that the protein is apoptotically inactive in the non-sialylated form. Our results indicate that differential glycosylation modulates the function of the different glycodelin isoforms.

Placenta Suppl. 1982; 4: 67-81PubMed Google Scholar), is a 162-amino acid glycoprotein classified under the lipocalin superfamily based on its 70% similarity to equine β-lactoglobulin (2Julkunen M. Seppala M. Janne O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8845-8849Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).

Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and by the glandular epithelium of the seminal vesicles (glycodelin S (GdS)) (4Seppala M. Koskimies A.I. Tenhunen A.

The amino acid backbones of these two major isoforms being identical, the difference lies at the level of their glycosylation. Detailed characterization of the different types of complex glycans present on these two isoforms has been reported (5Dell A. Morris H.R. Easton R.L. Panico M. Patankar M. Oehniger S. Koistinen R.

Patankar M.S. Oehninger S. Clark G.F. Seppala M. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1996; 2: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the major difference being sialylation and fucosylation. GdA is rich in sialylated complex glycans, whereas GdS is not sialylated, but has fucose- and mannose-rich glycan structures.GdA has been well documented to have multiple functions, viz. contraceptive (7Oehninger S. Coddington C.C. Hodgen G.D. Seppala M. Fertil. Steril. 1995; 63: 377-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), morphogenic (8Kamarainen M. Seppala M. Virtanen I. Andersson L.C. Lab. Investig. 1997; 77: 565-573PubMed Google Scholar), angiogenic (9Song M. Ramaswamy S. Ramachandran S. Flowers L.C. Horowitz I.R. Rock J.A. Parthasarathy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9265-9270Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and, the most widely studied, immunosuppressive (10Bolton A.E. Pockley A.G. Clough K.J. Mowles E.A. Stoker R.J. Westwood O.M. Chapman M.G. Lancet. 1987; 1: 593-595Abstract PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), by its ability to suppress the proliferation of activated T cells. Due to its role in immunoregulation, GdA has been subclassified as an immunocalin (11Logdberg L. Wester L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 284-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Substantial evidence in literature indicates that GdA is an indispensable molecule in the maternal system for the establishment, maintenance, and progression of pregnancy (12Tulppala M. Julkunen M. Tiitinen A. Stenman U.H. Seppala M. Fertil. Steril. 1995; 63: 792-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, its synthesis in the uterine endometrium and decidua is temporally regulated by progesterone (3Julkunen M. Koistinen R. Sjoberg J. Rutanen E.M. Wahlstrom T. Seppala M. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The steroid dependence, together with its immunosuppressive activity, suggests that GdA plays a role in down-modulating the T cell-mediated immune response against the fetal allograft in the maternal system. Recent data from our laboratory have unequivocally shown that immunosuppression by GdA is via induction of apoptosis in activated T cells (13Mukhopadhyay D. Sundereshan S. Rao C. Karande A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28268-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as demonstrated by several independent assays. Apoptosis of activated T cells at the materno-fetal interface may be a protective mechanism during pregnancy, as disturbances in programmed cell death of activated T cells in human decidua have been implicated in pregnancy loss (14Jerzak M. Kasprzycka M. Wierzbicki P. Kotarski J. Gorski A. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1998; 40: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).In the case of immunocalins such as α1-acid glycoprotein and α1-microglobulin, which are members of acute-phase proteins, glycosylation plays a crucial role in their biological activity (11Logdberg L. Wester L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 284-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The contraceptive activity of glycodelin is also dependent on the type of glycosylation present (15Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Oehninger S. Patankar M.S. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32159-32167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The effect of differential glycosylation on the immunomodulatory activity of the protein has not been reported so far and is the subject of the study described in this work. As the primary amino acid sequences of the two forms (GdA and GdS) are identical, experiments were aimed at determining whether the latter also harbors apoptotic activity. GdS was found to be apoptotically inactive. Complete digestion of GdA with trypsin indicated that the isolated glycopeptides are not active and that the protein backbone is necessary for inducing apoptosis. Both glycodelins were deglycosylated using various glycosidases, and loss of GdA’s apoptotic activity was observed when the glycoprotein was desialylated. Thus, both the sialic acid residues on the N-linked glycans and the protein backbone are required for native GdA to show apoptotic activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Cell LinesPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using HISTOPAQUE (Sigma) from freshly drawn blood of normal healthy donors (male and female, 25–50 years old) according to the method described by Boyum (16Boyum A. Nature. 1964; 204: 793-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The human Jurkat (JR4) T cell line was obtained from the Cancer Research Institute (Mumbai, India), cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and passaged three times/week.Purification of GlycodelinD9D4, a glycodelin-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) raised in our laboratory, 2D. Mukhopadhyay, P. Gangatirkar, and A. A. Karande, unpublished data. was purified from the hybridoma culture supernatant by protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) chromatography (17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 310-311Google Scholar). The antibody was periodate-oxidized and cross-linked to Affi-Gel hydrazide beads (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions to obtain an immunoaffinity column for purification of glycodelin. Amniotic fluid or seminal plasma was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and passed twice through the immunoaffinity column at room temperature. The column was then washed with 5 column volumes of PBS, and the bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine HCl (pH 2.5). The eluate was immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The purified protein was dialyzed against PBS and sterilized by filtration. Amniotic fluid, seminal plasma, and purified glycodelin were subjected to Western blot analysis using mAb B1C2 (18Karri S. Mukhopadhyay D. Jing L. Karande A.A. Histochem. J. 2000; 32: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Cloning and Expression of Full-length Glycodelin in Pichia pastorisGlycodelin cDNA without the signal sequence and stop codon was amplified by PCR. Full-length glycodelin cDNA cloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) 2D. Mukhopadhyay, P. Gangatirkar, and A. A. Karande, unpublished data. was used as the template with the following primer pair: 5′-GCGGATCCGAATTCATGGACATCCCCCAGACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGAATGTCGACGAAACGGCACGGCTCTTCCAT-3′ (reverse). The forward primer has BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites; and the reverse primer has a SalI site, but no stop codon. For cloning the PCR product into the pPicZαA vector (Invitrogen), both the vector and PCR product were sequentially digested with SalI and EcoRI, purified, and ligated. 50 μg of pPicZαA-Gd was digested with BglII. The linear DNA was then purified.For making recombinant P. pastoris (Strain GS115) expressing glycodelin, the manufacturer’s instructions were followed. Briefly, 10 μgof linearized pPicZαA-Gd in 10 μl of water was used to electroporate 100 μl of the competent GS115 cells. The electroporated cells were immediately taken up in 1 ml of ice-cold sorbitol and transferred into a sterile 15-ml tube. The cells were kept at 30 °C for 30 min and plated onto 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose agar plates containing 1 m sorbitol and 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). The transformants were grown for 3–4 days at 30 °C.The colonies were screened with increasing concentrations of Zeocin up to 1 mg/ml. The recombinant glycodelin-expressing GS115 cells were grown in 5 ml of medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 1.34% yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate without amino acids, 0.00004% biotin, and 1% glycerol at 30 °C for 16 h. This pre-inoculum was divided into two 2-liter flasks containing 250 ml of the same medium, and the cells were grown for 48 h. The cell mass was determined, and 2 ml of medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 1.34% yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate without amino acids, 0.00004% biotin, and 0.5% methanol per g of cells was added to the cells. The cells were incubated at 30 °C for 120 h with vigorous shaking (250–300 rpm), with methanol being replenished every 24 h. At the end of methanol induction, the cells were separated from the supernatant by careful aspiration after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then dialyzed extensively against PBS and used for purification of full-length glycodelin expressed in P. pastoris (Pic-fl-Gd) by Ni2+-NTA (QIAGEN Inc.) chromatography.Cell Proliferation AssayPBMCs (0.2 × 106 cells/200 μl) or cell lines (0.1 × 106 cells/200 μl) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were cultured with the protein of interest in Nunc 96-well plates along with the appropriate controls. The anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3) hybridoma culture supernatant at a dilution of 1:2500 was used for inducing T-lymphocyte proliferation in PBMC cultures. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (5 × 104 counts/min; Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology, Mumbai) was added after a 36-h incubation of the PBMC cultures and a 24-h incubation of the cell lines and incubated for an additional 12 h. The cells were harvested and lysed on Whatman glass-fiber GF/C filters using a Nunc cell harvester. The filters were dried, and the [3H]thymidine incorporated was measured in a Wallac scintillation counter. All treatments were carried out in triplicates.Deglycosylation of GlycodelinPeptide N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) Treatment under Denaturing Conditions—Glycodelins (1 mg/ml) in PBS containing 1% SDS and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol were heated at 100 °C for 2 min. Nonidet P-40 was then added so that the ratio of Nonidet P-40 to SDS was 7:1 in the final reaction. The enzyme (0.5 milliunits/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. To prepare the samples for SDS-PAGE, they were precipitated with equal volumes of 50% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm sodium deoxycholate, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and electrophoresed on 12.5% polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with glycodelin-specific mAb B1C2 (18Karri S. Mukhopadhyay D. Jing L. Karande A.A. Histochem. J. 2000; 32: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).PNGase F Treatment under Nondenaturing Conditions—Glycodelins (1 mg/ml) in PBS were incubated with 0.5 milliunits/ml PNGase F at 37 °C for 48 h. The proteins were electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently immunoblotted with mAb B1C2.Endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) Treatment under Nondenaturing Conditions—Glycodelins (1 mg/ml) in 100 mm acetate (pH 5.5) were incubated with 20 milliunits/ml Endo-H at 37 °C for 24 h. The proteins were then electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently immunoblotted with mAb B1C2. The reaction mixture was neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8), sterilized, and used in Jurkat cell proliferation assays.Neuraminidase Treatment under Nondenaturing Conditions—Glycodelins (1 mg/ml) in 100 mm acetate (pH 5.5) were incubated with 20 milliunits/ml neuraminidase at 37 °C for 24 h. The proteins were then resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequently immunoblotted with mAb B1C2. The reaction mixture was neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8), sterilized, and used in Jurkat cell proliferation assays.Trypsin Digestion of GlycodelinComplete trypsin digestion of GdA was carried out by incubating GdA with trypsin at a molar ratio of 20:1 in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 2 mm MgCl2. After 4 h of digestion at 37 °C, completion of the reaction was checked by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. At the end of the trypsin digestion, the reaction mixture was used in a Jurkat cell assay, and apoptosis was measured by ethidium bromide staining and fluorescence-activated cell scan (FACS) analysis.Partial trypsin digestion of glycodelin was done by incubating glycodelin with trypsin at a molar ratio of 1000:1 in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C. At the end of varying time intervals, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was boiled in SDS sample buffer and stored at –20 °C. At the end of the experiment, all the samples were electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were visualized by silver staining. The apoptotic activity of GdA after partial trypsin digestion was determined in Jurkat cells.Two-dimensional Gel ElectrophoresisTwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out following the method of Celis et al. (19Celis J.E. Ratz G. Basse B. Lauridsen J.B. Celis A. Jensen N.A. Gromov P. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Vol. 4. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998: 375-385Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼2 μg of protein was mixed with lysis buffer (9.8 m urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2% Ampholine pH 3.5–9.5 (Amersham Biosciences), and 100 mm dithiothreitol), and isoelectric focusing was performed for 4 h at 400 V in 1.5-mm tube gels pre-focused for 30 min at 250 V using a mini-PROTEAN 2D-Cell (Bio-Rad). For the second dimensional separation, the tube gels were placed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, sealed with 1% agarose in SDS-PAGE running buffer with 0.01% bromphenol blue, and electrophoresed. At the end of the two-dimensional separation, the gels were either silver-stained or used for immunoblotting.Far-UV Circular DichroismCD spectra were measured and recorded with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a data processor. Protein solutions (0.5 mg/ml) were prepared in PBS. Spectra were taken at 25 °C in the far-UV region (200–280 nm) using a 0.5-cm quartz cuvette.Fluorescence Measurements and Stern-Volmer PlotsFluorescence studies were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 luminescence spectrometer. Fluorescence emission from tryptophan was measured using excitation at 295 nm to minimize the loss of intensity due to energy transfer to tyrosine. Slits with a band-pass of 5/10 nm were used in the excitation/emission channels. The proteins were dissolved in PBS or in PBS containing different concentrations of urea. The sample temperature was kept at 27 °C. The quenching constant was determined by fitting the data to the SternVolmer relation: F0/Fcorr = 1 + KSV[Q], where F0 and Fcorr are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the quencher, respectively; [Q] is the molar concentration of the quencher; and KSV is the Stern-Volmer (or dynamic) quenching constant (20Haque E.

Biochem. 1999; 259: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Partition Coefficient (KAV) Determination of Glycodelin50 μg of glycodelin was chromatographed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column using AKTA design systems (Amersham Biosciences). The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml/min, and the elution of the proteins was monitored by measuring the UV absorption at 280 nm. The partition coefficient of the proteins in the gel phase was calculated using the following formula: Kav = (Ve – V0)/(Vt – V0), where Kav is the partition coefficient of the protein, Ve is the elution volume of the protein, Vt is the bed volume of the column, and V0 is the void volume of the column.Ethidium Bromide Staining and FACS AnalysisCells (1 × 106) treated with glycodelin or with the appropriate controls were cultured for 12 h and harvested by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, treated with 1 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were then centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After a wash with PBS, 500 μl of staining solution (50 μg/ml ethidium bromide, 0.1 μg/ml RNase A, 1% Triton X-100, and 40 mm sodium citrate in PBS) was added to the cells and incubated for 1 h. Analysis was carried out using a fluorescence-activated flow cytometer (BD Biosciences FACScan). Blue light was used for excitation, and emission was measured in the red region.RESULTSGdS Is Not Apoptogenic on T Cells—GdA and GdS were purified from amniotic fluid and seminal plasma, respectively, by immunoaffinity chromatography using the mAb D9D4 column. The purity of the two proteins was determined by silver staining, and their identity was confirmed by Western blotting using mAb B1C2 (Fig. 1) (18Karri S. Mukhopadhyay D. Jing L. Karande A.A. Histochem. J. 2000; 32: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Whereas GdA resolved as a single band at 28 kDa, GdS resolved as a doublet at 27 and 30 kDa. Both bands of the doublet reacted with glycodelin-specific mAbs.The pure proteins were tested for their ability to inhibit Jurkat cell and anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3)-induced PBMC proliferation. Purified GdA was able to inhibit both Jurkat cell proliferation and mAb OKT3-induced proliferation of PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A), as reported previously (10Bolton A.E. Pockley A.G.

In the case of GdA, the 50% inhibitory concentration was 600 nm for PBMCs (Fig. 2A, panel a) and 150 nm for Jurkat cells (panel b). Interestingly, GdS purified by the identical procedure did not show inhibition of mAb OKT3-induced PBMC proliferation (Fig. 2B, panel a) or Jurkat cell proliferation (panel b). Purified GdA inhibits Jurkat cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis in these cells (13Mukhopadhyay D. Sundereshan S. Rao C. Karande A.A. J. Biol.

Panel a, PBMCs were stimulated with mAb OKT3 for 36 h in the presence of varying concentrations of GdA and then pulsed with [3H]thymidine for 12 h. Panel b, Jurkat cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of varying concentrations of GdA and then pulsed with [3H]thymidine for 12 h. Cells were harvested on glass-fiber filters and lysed, and the radioactivity was measured. B, GdS does not inhibit T cell proliferation. Panel a, PBMCs were stimulated with mAb OKT3 for 36 h in the presence of varying concentrations of GdS and then pulsed with [3H]thymidine for 12 h. Panel b, Jurkat cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of varying concentrations of GdS and then pulsed with [3H]thymidine for 12 h. Cells were harvested on glass-fiber filters and lysed, and the radioactivity was measured. The data presented are representative of at least three different experiments, and each bar represents [3H]thymidine counts of the sample in triplicates.

To observe the effect of the complex sugars on T cells in the absence of the protein backbone, GdA was completely digested with trypsin (Fig. 3A), and Jurkat cells were cultured with the digested product.

Tumour Biol. 1998; 19: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); hence, the difference in their apoptotic activity could be because of their differential post-translational modification, most likely glycosylation. To study the role of the glycans in the apoptotic activity of glycodelin, the protein was treated with PNGase F, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the asparagine–N-acetylglucosamine bond, thus completely deglycosylating the protein. Although the enzyme deglycosylated both glycodelins under denaturing conditions (Fig. 4A), it was not able to deglycosylate the proteins under native conditions (Fig. 4B), presumably because of inaccessibility of the glycosidic linkage site.Fig. 4PNGase F treatment of glycodelin.A, denaturing conditions. 1 μg of denatured glycodelin was incubated with PNGase F at 37 °C for 48 h, electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted with mAb B1C2.

Endo-H treatment of GdS led to a slight mobility shift from 27 to 24 kDa for the lower band and from 30 to 27 kDa for the upper band (Fig. 5A), indicating that Endo-H deglycosylates GdS at Asn28.It can be concluded that the difference in the mobilities of the two bands of GdS is because of the different extent of glycosylation present on Asn63. As expected, GdA was not sensitive to Endo-H (Fig. 5A), as it does not contain high mannose glycans (5Dell A. Morris H.R. Easton R.L. Panico M. Patankar M. Oehniger S. Koistinen R. Koistinen H.

In the present study, we report on the biochemical and functional association between cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and a PDZ domain-containing protein Shank2. Exploratory reverse transcription-PCR screening revealed mRNAs for several members of PDZ domain-containing proteins in epithelial cells. Shank2, one of these scaffolding proteins, showed a strong interaction with CFTR by yeast two-hybrid assays. Shank2-CFTR interaction was verified by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian cells. Notably, this interaction was abolished by mutations in the PDZ domain of Shank2. Protein phosphorylation, HCO3- transport and Cl- current by CFTR were measured in NIH 3T3 cells with heterologous expression of Shank2. Of interest, expression of Shank2 suppressed cAMP-induced phosphorylation and activation of CFTR. Importantly, loss of Shank2 by stable transfection of antisense-hShank2 plasmid strongly increased CFTR currents in colonic T84 cells, in which CFTR and Shank2 were natively expressed. Our results indicate that Shank2 negatively regulates CFTR and that this may play a significant role in maintaining epithelial homeostasis under normal and diseased conditions such as those presented by secretory diarrhea.

Secretory epithelia perform vectorial transport of salt and water molecules by coordinated actions of the transporters expressed in polarized epithelial membranes. One of the key membrane proteins regulating overall fluid movements is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), 1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CF, cystic fibrosis; NBC, Na+-HCO3- cotransporter; NHE3, Na+/H+ exchanger 3; PDZ, PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1; PSD, postsynaptic density; RT, reverse transcription; aa, amino acid(s); DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; IP, immunoprecipitation; BCECF-AM, [2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein]-acetoxymethyl ester; GKAP, guanylate kinase-associated protein.1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CF, cystic fibrosis; NBC, Na+-HCO3- cotransporter; NHE3, Na+/H+ exchanger 3; PDZ, PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1; PSD, postsynaptic density; RT, reverse transcription; aa, amino acid(s); DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; IP, immunoprecipitation; BCECF-AM, [2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein]-acetoxymethyl ester; GKAP, guanylate kinase-associated protein. which itself has an anion-transporting activity (1Anderson M.P.

Rev. 1999; 79: S145-S166Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Aberrant membrane transport caused by either hypo- or hyper-functioning of CFTR, can be detrimental, and may result in life-threatening diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or secretory diarrhea (4Quinton P.M. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S3-S22Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 5Kunzelmann K. Mall M. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 245-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Therefore, the fine regulation of salt and water transport is essential in epithelial and body homeostasis. Accumulating evidence suggests that protein-protein interaction performs an important role in the regulation of transepithelial ion transport (6Kunzelmann K. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 167-170PubMed Google Scholar). Clustering of ion transporters and associated proteins in microdomains of polarized epithelia can facilitate the effective secretion or absorption of salt and water molecules. In this regard, modular adaptor proteins such as PDZ (PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1) domain-containing proteins have drawn increasing attention due to their ability to form supramolecular complexes (7Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the regulatory interaction between CFTR and Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) through PDZ-based scaffolds is essential for the coordinated regulation of pancreatic bicarbonate secretion (8Ahn W. Kim K.H. Lee J.A. Kim J.Y. Choi J.Y. Moe O.W. Milgram S.L. Muallem S. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17236-17243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that a number of membrane transporters and receptors participating in pancreatic fluid formation, such as Na+-HCO3- cotransporters (NBC), purinergic receptors, and secretin receptors have a PDZ-binding motif on their C terminus (9Lee M.G. Ahn W. Lee J.A. Kim J.Y. Choi J.Y. Moe O.W. Milgram S.L. Muallem S. Kim K.H. J. Pancreas. 2001; 2: 203-206Google Scholar, 10Park M. Ko S.B. Choi J.Y. Muallem G. Thomas P.J. Pushkin A. Lee M.S. Kim J.Y. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Kurtz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50503-50509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, multiple protein interactions through PDZ-based scaffolds are believed to perform a critical role in fluid secretion by pancreatic epithelia and possibly by other CFTR-expressing epithelia. Recently, a large number of PDZ domain-containing proteins were identified in neuronal cells, especially in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses. Although limited information is available up to now, in general, organization by PDZ-based scaffolds allows the stable localization of interacting proteins and enhances the rate and fidelity of signal transduction (7Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Because both neurons and epithelia share many common features, such as ectodermal origin and polarized intracellular structures, it is predicted that some of these scaffolds are expressed in epithelial cells and that they mediate protein-protein interaction. In this study, we aimed to identify the PDZ domain-containing proteins expressed in secretory epithelia and to further characterize their roles in transepithelial ion transport using integrated molecular, biochemical, and physiological approaches. In an exploratory RT-PCR, it was found that pancreatic epithelia express the mRNAs of several PDZ domain-containing proteins, including SAP97, PSD-95, and Shank2. Of these, Shank2, an isoform of the recently identified family of multimodular adaptors (11Sheng M. Kim E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), showed an association with CFTR through its PDZ domain in the yeast two-hybrid system and in the mammalian cells. Measurements in CFTR-expressing NIH 3T3 cells revealed that Shank2 overexpression suppressed the cAMP-induced phosphorylation and activation of CFTR. In addition, antisense-Shank2 treatment augmented the CFTR-dependent Cl- transport in T84 epithelial cells, in which CFTR and Shank2 are endogenously expressed. The above results indicate that Shank2 mediates inhibitory regulation of CFTR and that this may play an important role in epithelial homeostasis. Materials—The HA-tagged full-length pcDNA3.1-rShank2/CortBP1 construct has been described previously (12Park E. Na M. Choi J. Kim S. Lee J.R. Yoon J. Park D. Sheng M. Kim E. J. Biol.

To generate H6 fusion proteins for immunization, aa 1012–1252 of rShank2 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pRSETB (Invitrogen), and fusion proteins were purified using Probond resin (Invitrogen). The specificity of the Shank2 antibody was confirmed by immunoblotting on Shank isoforms expressed in heterologous cells as described previously (13Lim S. Naisbitt S. Yoon J. Hwang J.I. Suh P.G.

Welsh (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) and were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10 mm glucose and 10% fetal calf serum. For the stable expression of Shank2, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-rShank2 constructs and selected with G418. T84 cells originated from human colonic epithelia were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Ham’s F-12 medium and DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum.

The L40 yeast strain harboring reporter genes HIS3 and LacZ, under control of the upstream LexA DNA-binding domain, was used in the assay. To semi-quantify the interaction, HIS3 activity was determined by the percentage of yeast colonies growing on histidine-lacking medium. For pBHA (a bait vector containing the LexA DNA-binding domain) constructs, cDNA sequences containing about 30 aa of the C terminus of membrane proteins were amplified by PCR and subcloned in-frame into pBHA: rNBCn1 (aa 1190–1218: KYSPEKPVSVTINFEDEPSKKYMDAETSL), mDRA (aa 728–757: QEKERKFDFTINTNGGLRNRECQVPVETKF), hCFTR (aa 1452–1480: HRNSSKCKSKPQIAALKEETEEEVQDTRL), hNHE3 (aa 800–831: PFRLSNKSVDSFLQADGPEEQLQPASPESTHM), hVIP receptor (aa 467–495: TCSTQVSMLTRVSPGARRSSSFQAEVSLV), and rSecretin receptor (aa 421–449: SFSNATNGPTHSTKASTEQSRSIPRASII).

Immunohistochemistry—The pancreas and colon tissues from Sprague-Dawley rats were embedded in OCT (Miles, Elkhart, IN), frozen in liquid N2, and cut into 4-μm sections. Immunostaining of frozen sections was performed as previously reported (8Ahn W. Kim K.H. Lee J.A. Kim J.Y. Choi J.Y. Moe O.W. Milgram S.L. Muallem S. Lee M.G. J. Biol.

Briefly, the sections were fixed and permeabilized by incubation in cold methanol for 10 min at -20 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% gelatin (blocking medium). After blocking, the sections were stained by incubating them with anti-Shank2 1136 and/or anti-CFTR 24–1 antibodies and then treated with fluorophore-tagged secondary antibodies. Images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Pre-cleared pancreatic or NIH 3T3 lysates were mixed with the appropriate antibodies and incubated overnight at 4 °C in lysis buffer. Immune complexes were collected by binding to mixed protein A/G beads and were washed four times with lysis buffer prior to electrophoresis. The lysis buffer contains (in mm) HEPES 50 (pH 7.4), NaCl 150, EDTA 1, Nonidet P-40 1% (v/v), glycerol 10% (v/v), and the complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The immunoprecipitates or lysates were suspended in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the membranes were blocked by a 1-h incubation at room temperature in a blocking solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, and protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence solutions (Amersham Biosciences). The staining intensities of immunoblots were analyzed using imaging software (MCID version 3.0; Brock University, St. Catharine’s, Ontario, Canada). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange kit (Stratagene) with pcDNA3.1-rShank2 plasmid according to the manufacturer’s protocol. His-109 residue of rShank2 was substituted with different amino acids. The mutagenesis primers were as follows: H109A, CAA TGA AAA TGT CGT CAA GGT GGG CGC CAG GCA GGT GGT GAA CAT GAT CCG; H109R, GAA AAT GTC GTC AAG GTG GGC CGC AGG CAG GTG GTG AAC ATG ATC; and H109Q, GAA AAT GTC GTC AAG GTG GGC CAA AGG CAG GTG GTG AAC ATG ATC. Corresponding antisense primers were also made and used for the PCR reactions to generate plasmids with mutated sequences. Measurement of Cl- Channel Activities—Whole cell recordings were performed on CFTR-expressing NIH 3T3 cells after they had been stably transfected with pcDNA3.1-rShank2 or mock plasmids. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride (NMDG-Cl), 5 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, 1 Tris-ATP, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2), and the bath solution contained 140 NMDG-Cl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). After establishing the whole cell configuration, CFTR was activated by adding 5 μm forskolin. Currents were digitized and analyzed using an AxoScope 8.1 system and a Digidata 1322A AC/DC converter. Mean currents were normalized as current densities (pA/picofarad (pF)). Measurement of Cl-/HCO3- Exchange—Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity was measured by recording the intracellular pH (pHi) in response to [Cl-]o changes of the perfusate, as previously detailed (16Namkung W.

Typically, the first 10–40 s of the initial linear portion of pHi increases due to Cl--dependent intracellular uptake of HCO3- were fitted to a linear equation using the Felix software (version 1.4; PTI Inc.) and expressed as ΔpH units/min. Cell-attached glass coverslips were washed once with HEPES-buffered solution A and assembled to form the bottom of a perfusion chamber. The HEPES-buffered solution A contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). NIH 3T3 cells were loaded with a fluorescent pH probe BCECF by incubating them for 10 min at room temperature in solution A containing 2.5 μm BCECF-AM. After dye loading, the cells were perfused with a HCO3--buffered solution and BCECF fluorescence was recorded at excitation wavelengths of 490 and 440 nm at a resolution of 2/s using a recording setup (Delta Ram; PTI Inc.). The HCO3--buffered solution containing (in mm) 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 5 HEPES, 25 NaHCO3 (pH 7.4) was continuously gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Cl--free solutions were prepared by replacing Cl- with gluconate. The 490/440 ratios were calibrated intracellularly by perfusing the cells with solutions containing 145 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 μm nigericin with pH adjusted to 6.2–7.6. Biotinylation of Surface Membrane Proteins—Surface biotinylation of glycosylated CFTR was performed as described by Lisanti et al. (17Lisanti M.P. Le Bivic A. Sargiacomo M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and then incubated with 10 mm NaIO4 for 30 min at 0 °C in the dark to increase acceptability of biotin to glycoside moiety. The cells were then washed and biotinylated using EZ-Link biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce, 2 mg/ml in solution A) for 30 min at room temperature. Free biotin was washed out twice with a glycine-containing solution (100 mm glycine, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and then with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. For time-course experiments, cells were incubated with DMEM media for 2, 8, 18, or 24 h and lysed with a lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm EGTA, 134 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with complete protease inhibitor cocktails). The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min (13,000 × g), and the pellet was discarded. Avidin solution (UltraLink Immobilized NeutrAvidin beads 10%, Pierce, 200 μl) was added to the supernatant (500 μg of protein in 500 μl of lysis buffer), and the mixture was incubated overnight with gentle mixing at 4 °C. Avidin-bound complexes were pelleted (13,000 × g) and washed three times. Biotinylated proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred, and immunoblotted with the anti-CFTR antibody M3A7. 32P Labeling of CFTR Protein—NIH 3T3 cells grown in 6-well plates were incubated in a phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with DMEM and treated with the phosphatase inhibitor NaVO4 (1 mm) and the designated concentrations of forskolin for 10 min. The 32P-labeled lysates (1 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with M3A7 CFTR antibody, separated by 6% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Antisense mRNA for hShank2 in T84 Cells—Antisense mRNA was expressed in T84 cells to reduce human Shank2 expression. The common 217-bp regions of the two identified splicing variants of hShank2 (NM012309 and NM133266) covering the initiation codon, were selected as target sequences. The target sequences were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector in the reverse direction using the XhoI and BamHI sites. The primer sequences were as follows: sense (BamHI), CGG GAT CCA TGA TGA TGA ACG TCC CCG; antisense (XhoI), CCG CTC GAG CTG GGA AAG CCG GTG TTG G. Stable transfectants were selected using G418 and the reduced expressions of Shank2 were confirmed by immunoblotting. Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as the means ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. The results of multiple experiments were analyzed using the non-paired Student’s t test or analysis of variance as appropriate. Expression of PDZ-based Scaffolds in Pancreatic Epithelia—In previous studies, we reported that interactions between multiple membrane proteins, which have PDZ-binding motif on their C terminus perform important roles in pancreatic bicarbonate secretion (8Ahn W. Kim K.H. Lee J.A. Kim J.Y. Choi J.Y. Moe O.W. Milgram S.L. Muallem S. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17236-17243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Lee M.G.

Therefore, as an initial step, we analyzed the expressions of PDZ domain-containing proteins in pancreatic epithelia by RT-PCR using brain tissue as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1A, rat pancreatic tissue expressed the mRNAs of SAP97, PSD-95, and Shank2. However, pure pancreatic duct cells isolated by microdissection showed only the mRNA of Shank2. Occasionally, a faint band of guanylate kinase-associated protein (GKAP) was observed in samples from pancreatic tissue. The expression of Shank2 in pancreatic tissue was further confirmed by immunostaining (Fig. 1B). Of interest, Shank2 was found to be principally localized in the luminal (apical) pole of large and small pancreatic ducts. A weaker expression was also detected in the luminal area of pancreatic acinar cells (Fig. 1B). Protein-Protein Interaction between PDZ-based Scaffolds and Membrane Proteins—Possible interactions between the C termini of membrane proteins in pancreatic epithelia and the PDZ domains of SAP97, PSD-95, and Shank2 were screened by the yeast two-hybrid assay. Peptide sequences of class I PDZ-binding motif of the membrane proteins are listed under “Experimental Procedures.” To estimate the intensity of the protein interactions, HIS3 activity was determined by the percentage of yeast colonies growing on histidine-lacking (His-) medium with empty pGAD10 as negative controls. Positive colonies (His- growth) were confirmed twice by the β-galactosidase activity. In the yeast two-hybrid screening, Shank2 showed a strong association with CFTR, NHE3, and NBCn1 (Table I). Among the possible Shank2-associated membrane transporters, we chose CFTR for further studies, because CFTR is known to perform a central role in luminal ion transport and to have regulatory functions on the other two transporters, NHE3 and NBCn1 (8Ahn W. Kim K.H. Lee J.A. Kim J.Y. Choi J.Y. Moe O.W. Milgram S.L. Muallem S. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17236-17243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Park M.

To verify the interaction between CFTR and Shank2 in mammalian cells, CFTR-expressing NIH 3T3 cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3.1-rShank2 or with mock plasmids, and immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 2A, transfection of pcDNA3.1-rShank2 induced expression of Shank2 protein in NIH 3T3 cells (arrowhead). Notably, large amounts of CFTR proteins were detected in anti-Shank2 IP samples from Shank2-transfected cells (Fig. 2A, right). Co-IP experiments using antibodies in reverse order also demonstrated the association between Shank2 and CFTR (see Fig. 2B).Table IYeast two-hybrid assay HIS3 activity was determined by the percentage of yeast colonies growing on histidine-lacking medium to estimate the intensity of protein-protein interactions between the PDZ domains of adaptor proteins and the C terminus of membrane proteins. After the transfection with the prey and bait vectors, equal amounts of yeast cells were plated on histidine-lacking and histidine-supplemented media. The number of yeast colonies growing on histidine-lacking medium was divided by that of growing on histidine-supplemented medium and expressed as percentage.HIS3 activityMembrane proteinpGAD10, aloneaEmpty pGAD10 was used as negative controlSAP97, PDZ1-2PSD-95, PDZ1-3Shank2, PDZ%CFTR00033NHE300044NBCn101244DRA0000VIP receptor01110Secretin receptor0000a Empty pGAD10 was used as negative control Open table in a new tab It has been reported that the first histidine residue of the second α-helix of PDZ domain (position αB1, His-109 in rShank2) plays an important role in class I PDZ interaction by forming a strong hydrogen bond between its N-3 nitrogen and the hydroxyl group of the -2 serine/threonine residue of the ligand (18Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). To verify the importance of the PDZ-domain in CFTR-Shank2 interaction, we substituted His-109 with two other amino acids containing nitrogen side chain (H109R and H109Q) and with a hydrophobic amino acid (H109A) and then measured the protein-protein interaction by IP. As shown in Fig. 2B, CFTR-Shank2 interactions were abolished in H109R and H109A mutants by 78 ± 8% and 96 ± 3%, respectively (n = 4). Therefore, it was concluded that PDZ-based interactions are required for CFTR-Shank2 binding. Inhibition of CFTR-dependent Anion Transport by Shank—It is well known that CFTR protein has a cAMP-activated Cl- channel function (1Anderson M.P. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 251: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Thus, the cAMP-activated chloride channel activities of CFTR-expressing NIH 3T3 cells were measured in the whole cell configuration after they had been stably transfected with pcDNA3.1-rShank2 or mock plasmids. Treatment with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin produced a large inward current in NMDG-Cl solutions with linear I-V relationships (Figs. 3, A and B). Further treatment with 5-nitro-2-(3′-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (30 μm) inhibited this current by 94 ± 3% (not shown). These characteristics were in line with previous observations of CFTR Cl- currents (2Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3414-3421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Shank2 overexpression decreased the CFTR current densities (pA/pF) by 53% (Fig. 3C). Recently, it was found that CFTR plays an important role in transepithelial HCO3- transport by regulating Cl-/HCO3- exchange (2Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14670-14677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, reduced HCO3- secretion by defective CFTR-dependent HCO3- transport has been suggested to be an important pathological mechanism in mutant CFTR-induced respiratory and pancreatic diseases (21Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 410: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 22Quinton P.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 292-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities were measured in NIH 3T3 cells by estimating the pHi increase due to Cl- removal from HCO3--buffered perfusate. As reported earlier (2Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3414-3421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities of CFTR-expressing NIH 3T3 cells were highly increased by forskolin stimulation (Fig. 4B), but those of CFTR-non expressing cells were unchanged (Fig. 4A). The basal and forskolin-stimulated activities of CFTR-expressing NIH 3T3 cells were 0.121 ± 0.026 ΔpH unit/min and 0.865 ± 0.150, respectively. In Shank2-overexpressing cells, basal activity (0.079 ± 0.018, p = 0.22) was not significantly changed compared with mock transfected cells. However, similar to the results of whole c"
https://openalex.org/W2086179867,"Residue Asp-189 plays an important dual role in thrombin: it defines the primary specificity for Arg side chains and participates indirectly in the coordination of Na+. The former role is shared by other proteases with trypsin-like specificity, whereas the latter is unique to Na+-activated proteases in blood coagulation and the complement system. Replacement of Asp-189 with Ala, Asn, Glu, and Ser drastically reduces the specificity toward substrates carrying Arg or Lys at P1, whereas it has little or no effect toward the hydrolysis of substrates carrying Phe at P1. These findings confirm the important role of Asp-189 in substrate recognition by trypsin-like proteases. The substitutions also affect significantly and unexpectedly the monovalent cation specificity of the enzyme. The Ala and Asn mutations abrogate monovalent cation binding, whereas the Ser and Glu mutations change the monovalent cation preference from Na+ to the smaller cation Li+ or to the larger cation Rb+, respectively. The observation that a single amino acid substitution can alter the monovalent cation specificity of thrombin from Na+ (Asp-189) to Li+ (Ser-189) or Rb+ (Glu-189) is unprecedented in the realm of monovalent cation-activated enzymes.

The molecular origin of protease specificity remains an elusive issue in enzymology. Studies on trypsin have revealed the complexity of converting the primary specificity of this enzyme into that of chymotrypsin (1Hedstrom L. Szilagyi L. Rutter W.J.

The conversion is never complete and requires substitutions at residue 189 in the S1 site, as well as swaps of the 186- and 220-loops that contribute to the architecture of the primary specificity pocket but make no direct contact with substrate (6Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). However, turning chymotrypsin into trypsin using the same strategy proves to be unsuccessful (7Venekei I. Szilagyi L. Graf L. Rutter W.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The underlying conclusion from these studies is that primary substrate specificity is a “distributed” property of the protein structure and may require ad hoc changes in each system under study.The discovery of the molecular basis of the Na+-dependent allosteric activation of serine proteases like thrombin (8Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 9Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) has added further complexity to the mechanism of protease specificity. Thrombin binds Na+ in close proximity to the primary specificity pocket and thereby enhances its catalytic activity toward synthetic and natural substrates (8Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol.

Chest. 2003; 124: 11S-17SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This property is shared by several other enzymes involved in blood coagulation and the immune response, but not by digestive enzymes like trypsin (9Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and played a crucial role in the segregation of function in serine proteases during evolution (12Krem M.M. Di Cera E.

Sci. 2002; 27: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The Na+ coordination shell is formed by water molecules and protein backbone atoms (10Di Cera E. Guinto E.R.

One of the ligating water molecules bridges Na+ to the side chain of Asp-189 in the primary specificity pocket. When Na+ is released from its site, this water molecule is relocated; the side chain of Asp-189 acquires mobility and rearranges in a position no longer optimal for electrostatic coupling with the guanidinium group of the Arg side chain at the P1 position of substrate (15Pineda A.O. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40177-40180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In Na+-activated allosteric proteases like thrombin, substrate recognition is influenced by the presence of Na+ that fixes the orientation of residue Asp-189. Studies on the role of Asp-189 in allosteric proteases must, therefore, evaluate the effect of mutations at this position not only upon substrate binding and specificity, as is done in the case of trypsin, but also upon the ability of the enzyme to bind Na+ and to transduce this event into enhanced catalytic activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSSite-directed mutagenesis of human thrombin was carried out in an HPC4-pNUT expression vector, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Expression of mutants and wild-type thrombins was carried out in baby hamster kidney cells. The enzyme was activated with the prothrombinase complex for 30 min at 37 °C or with the immobilized snake venom enzyme ecarin. Activated thrombin was purified to homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography using Resource Q and S columns with a linear gradient from 0.05 to 0.5 m choline chloride (ChCl), 1The abbreviations used are: ChCl, choline chloride; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol; FPR, H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide; FPK, H-d-Phe-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide; AAPF, H-d-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide. 5 mm MES, pH 6 at room temperature. The active site concentration was determined by titration with hirudin and was found to be >95% in all cases.All assays of amydolytic activity were carried out under experimental conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG, pH 8.0 at 25 °C. The salt concentration, NaCl or ChCl, was 200 mm. The chromogenic substrates H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (FPR) and H-d-Phe-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide (FPK) were purchased from Midwest Bio-Tech (Carmel, IN), and H-d-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (AAPF) was obtained from Sigma. The values of kcat/Km were obtained from the analysis of progress curves of the release of p-nitroaniline as a function of substrate concentration taking into account product inhibition (16Krem M.M. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 100: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because of the drastic loss of substrate specificity, individual values of Km and kcat could not be obtained for all mutants under all conditions of interest.The interaction of thrombin with the inhibitor hirudin was studied from analysis of progress curves as detailed elsewhere (17Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 18Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Experimental conditions were 5 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% PEG-8000, pH 8.0 at 25 °C. The release of fibrinopeptide A subsequent to cleavage of fibrinogen, activation of protein C, cleavage of the thrombin receptors PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4, and inhibition by antithrombin were studied as reported (19Ayala Y.M.

Fluorescence titrations took place under experimental conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG-8000, pH 8.0 at 10 °C. The salt concentration was 800 mm. Titrations were carried out by adding aliquots of thrombin in a solution containing [M+] = 800 mm Cl– salt to a solution containing the enzyme in 800 mm ChCl. In this experiment, the ionic strength (800 mm), enzyme concentration (50 nm), and [Cl–] (800 mm) were held constant, while [M+] was varied. Excitation was at 295 nm and emission was measured at 333 nm. The value of thrombin intrinsic fluorescence, F, as a function of [M+] was fit according to the equation (16Krem M.M. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 100: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) F=F0+F1[M+]Kd1+[M+]Kd(Eq. 1) where F0 and F1 are the values of F in the absence and under saturating monovalent cation concentration, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for M+ binding. To ensure the uniqueness of the binding site, binding experiments for Rb+ (D189E) and Li+ (D189S) were also carried out at constant I = 800 mm in the presence of fixed amounts of NaCl. The apparent Kd for Rb+ or Li+ binding gave a linear dependence upon [Na+], as expected for competitive binding to a single site.RESULTSRecent structural work (14Guinto E.R. Caccia S. Rose T.

The side chain of Asp-189 engages the guanidinium group of the P1 Arg of incoming substrate. At the same time, it H-bonds to a water molecule that constitutes one of the six ligands of the bound Na+. When Na+ is released from its site, this water molecule is dislodged and the side chain of Asp-189 rearranges and moves away from its optimal interaction with Arg at P1. The movement of Asp-189 linked to Na+ release contributes to the lower specificity of the Na+-free form of thrombin for substrates like FPR carrying Arg at P1 (Fig. 2). The movement also affects recognition of Lys and Phe side chains in the S1 pocket, because Na+ enhances significantly the kcat/Km of less specific substrates like FPK and AAPF. Therefore, we examined the effect of amino acid substitutions on the linkage between Na+ binding and substrate recognition mediated by residue 189.Fig. 2Primary substrate specificity of wild-type and mutant thrombins. Shown are the values of s = kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of FPR, FPK, and AAPF in the presence of 200 mm NaCl (black) or ChCl (white). Experimental conditions were 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG, pH 8.0 at 25 °C. The wild type has a 10-fold preference for Arg versus Lys at P1 and a 106-fold preference for Arg versus Phe at P1. The Arg versus Lys preference is abrogated in the D189A and D189N mutants but is retained in the D189E and D189S mutants. On the other hand, the Arg versus Phe preference is compromised in all mutants from 2 to 4 orders of magnitude. This shift is because of the loss of specificity toward Arg at P1 rather than to a gain of specificity toward Phe at P1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Replacement of Asp-189 compromises the specificity of thrombin toward FPR measured as kcat/Km up to four orders of magnitude. The Ser substitution has the mildest effect on FPR hydrolysis, whereas Ala at position 189 is the most deleterious. Interestingly, the isosteric replacement D189N also results in severe loss of activity. When measurements of individual values of Km and kcat were possible, the defect was found to reside mostly in substrate binding (typically 1000-fold reduction) and, to a lesser extent, in substrate hydrolysis (10-fold reduction). Equally compromised is the hydrolysis of FPK that is less specific for thrombin than FPR. The D189A and D189N mutations abrogate the ability of thrombin to preferentially cleave Arg versus Lys at the P1 position of substrate (Fig. 2). In the case of the chymotrypsin-specific substrate AAPF, which shows only marginal specificity for thrombin, the mutation of Asp-189 has a more modest effect on substrate hydrolysis. This results in a drastic rebalancing of the Arg versus Phe preference for the P1 position of substrate; it drops up to five orders of magnitude in the case of the D189N mutant in the absence of Na+ (Fig. 2). The mutation D189S introduces the chymotrypsin residue in the primary specificity pocket of thrombin and shows a gain of specificity toward AAPF compared with wild type in the absence of Na+. The values of kcat/Km, however, remain too small to consider the change a significant gain of function. In conclusion, mutation of Asp-189 affects the ability of thrombin to interact with specific substrates like FPR and FPK and reduces drastically the Arg versus Phe preference for the P1 position of substrate. This change, however, is due predominantly to loss of trypsin-like specificity rather than to a gain in chymotrypsin-like specificity. The loss of specificity toward Arg and Lys residues at P1 and the lack of discrimination between charged and hydrophobic P1 residues are consistent with the results of mutations of Asp-189 in trypsin (4Graf L. Jancso A. Szilagyi L. Hegyi G. Pinter K. Naray-Szabo G. Hepp J. Medzihradszky K. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4961-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).Natural substrates of thrombin experience reduced cleavage by mutants of Asp-189 to an extent comparable with that seen for the hydrolysis of small chromogenic substrates (Fig. 3). Fibrinogen, protein C, and the PARs are cleaved with a specificity reduced by 3–4 orders of magnitude. The reduction is similar for all substrates with the exception of PAR3 that is less affected than PAR1 and PAR4 by mutation of Asp-189 to Ala. As a result, D189A cuts PAR1 (Arg at P1) and PAR3 (Lys at P1) with comparable specificity, as seen for the hydrolysis of FPR and FPK (Fig. 2). All thrombin natural substrates, except protein C, make ancillary contacts with exosite I, which resides about 20 Å away from the active site (11Di Cera E. Chest. 2003; 124: 11S-17SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The similarity of the perturbations in the recognition of chromogenic and natural substrates is conducive to an effect of the mutation of Asp-189 around the primary specificity pocket and the S2-S3 specificity sites. This conclusion is reinforced by the effect of mutations of Asp-189 on the inhibition by antithrombin (Fig. 3), which contacts primarily the active site of thrombin (23Olson S.T. Chuang Y.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the case of this inhibitor, mutation of Asp-189 to residues other than Ser practically abrogates the interaction, suggesting that binding to the S1 pocket is a major, irreplaceable determinant of recognition for the serpin. Recent mutagenesis studies of the P1 residue of antithrombin also vouch for the essential role of the P1-S1 interaction between thrombin and antithrombin (24Chuang Y.J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the inhibition by hirudin is unaffected by mutation of Asp-189. The crystal structure of the thrombin-hirudin complex (25Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) has documented the unusual binding mode of hirudin that cleverly avoids making contacts with the S1 specificity pocket of the enzyme to retain integrity of its backbone structure. Mutagenesis studies of hirudin lend support to the contention that positively charged residues of the inhibitor do not contact the enzyme active site (26Braun P.J. Dennis S. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6517-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Based on the results of the crystal structure and previous mutagenesis studies of hirudin, we expected mutations of Asp-189 to be largely inconsequential on hirudin recognition. This expectation is confirmed by the values of Ki for hirudin inhibition of the Asp-189 mutants that are within 10% of that of wild type (data not shown).Fig. 3Interactions of wild-type and mutant thrombins of residue 189 with natural substrates and inhibitors. Shown are the values of s = kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of fibrinogen (FpA), protein C (PC), and the thrombin receptors PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4. Also shown are the values of kon for the inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin (AT). Experimental conditions were 5 mm Tris, 145 mm NaCl, 0.1% PEG, pH 7.4 at 37 °C. Data for PC were collected in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and 50 nm thrombomodulin. Data for AT were collected in the presence of 0.5 USP/ml of heparin. The specificity of thrombin toward all substrates is reduced by 3–4 orders of magnitude, with a pattern similar for all mutants and reminiscent of that seen for the small chromogenic substrates FPR and FPK (see Fig. 2). The interactions with PAR3 and AT show a departure from the trend. PAR3 cleavage seems to be compromised to a lesser extent by the mutation of 189, whereas AT inhibition is practically abrogated in mutants of Asp-189 other than D189S.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutations of Asp-189 have pronounced effects on the Na+-induced enhancement of catalytic activity of thrombin. In the case of FPR, a significant enhancement is seen only for the D189S mutant (Fig. 2). The abrogation of the Na+ effect in the D189A mutant is consistent with the fact that most of the Na+-induced change on residue 189 involves a reorientation of the carboxylate group of Asp (15Pineda A.O. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40177-40180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The reduction of the Na+ effect seen in the D189E and D189N mutants calls for alternative explanations. The significant decrease in the Na+ effect can be analyzed in terms of the expression that links Na+ binding to the value of s = kcat/Km, i.e. (16Krem M.M. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 100: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Di Cera E. Hopfner K.P. Dang Q.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 174-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) s=s0+s1[Na+]Kd1+[Na+]Kd(Eq. 2) where s0 and s1 are the values of kcat/Km in the absence of and under saturating [Na+]. The value of s0 is derived in the presence of the inert cation Ch+, which mimics the Na+-free form of the enzyme, whereas the value of s1 refers to the extrapolation [Na+] → ∞. The important feature of Equation 2 is that the three parameters s0, s1, and the equilibrium dissociation constant for Na+ binding, Kd, are independent. This implies that the magnitude of cation activation (s1/s0) is not necessarily linked to the strength of cation binding (Kd). Hence, if a mutant shows a reduction of Na+-induced enhancement of s, the effect could be due either to a reduction of the s1/s0 ratio without effect upon Na+ binding and/or to reduced Na+ binding. The two possibilities are easily distinguished from direct measurements of Na+ binding.The Na+ affinity is significantly compromised upon substitution of Asp-189 with Ala and Asn (data not shown), underscoring the crucial anchoring role of the carboxylate of Asp-189 in the Na+ coordination shell (Fig. 1). The Glu and Ser substitutions of Asp-189 also reduce Na+ binding to a considerable extent (Fig. 4) and perturb the monovalent cation specificity profile (Fig. 5). The D189E and D189S mutants show a change in monovalent cation specificity from Na+ to the larger cation Rb+ (D189E) or to the smaller cation Li+ (D189S). In both cases, the monovalent cations were found to compete for the same site as Na+ (Fig. 6), ruling out the possibility that mutation of Asp-189 had created additional sites for Rb+ or Li+. It should be pointed out that the binding affinity of D189S and D189E toward their preferred cation is weaker than the Na+ affinity of wild type. The changes at residue 189 do not ensure optimal adaptation to a smaller (Li+ for D189S) or larger (Rb+ for D189E) cation compared with Na+. Furthermore, the kcat/Km toward FPR and other substrates is not optimal in the presence of Li+ for D189S or Rb+ for D189E (Fig. 7). This result echoes the properties of the quadA′ mutant of thrombin (28Prasad S. Wright K.J. Banerjee Roy D. Bush L.A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The results reported in the present study on thrombin confirm this view and extend it to the realm of Na+-activated proteases. The D189S substitution does not confer thrombin a chymotrypsin-like specificity: although it drastically reduces the Arg versus Phe preference at position P1 of substrate, the D189S mutant remains more specific for Arg side chains at P1.Because thrombin is a Na+-activated enzyme and residue 189 participates directly in the stabilization of the Na+ coordination shell, our mutagenesis study also offers insights into the origin of monovalent cation specificity. Substitutions of Asp-189 with Ala, Asn, Glu, and Ser generally results in a drastic loss of Na+ binding and the enhancement of catalytic activity. Importantly, the D189A and D189N mutants share striking similarities in their interaction with substrates like FPR, FPK, and AAPF, as well as natural substrates and inhibitors, and have lost the ability to bind monovalent cations. The properties of the D189A mutant are easily rationalized in terms of the lack of the carboxylate group that is required for both substrate and Na+ binding (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the properties of the D189N mutant are more difficult to explain. It is not clear why Asn-189 would not allow for significant Na+ or substrate binding if oriented as Asp-189. Electrostatic coupling between the guanidinium group of the P1 residue of substrate and the carboxylate of Asp-189 is an important component of substrate recognition in proteases with trypsin-like specificity (4Graf L.

RhoA, a member of the Ras superfamily of proteins, activates serum response element (SRE)-dependent transcription through changes in actin dynamics. We now show that the F-actin binding region of VASP is required for VASP stimulation of SRE-dependent transcription, and that VASP is downstream of RhoA in stimulating SRE-dependent transcription. The isolated carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil region of VASP mediates protein tetramerization and has been used as a dominant negative form of VASP; we found that it forms complexes with endogenous VASP in vivo and inhibits in a dose-dependent fashion serum-, RhoA-, and VASP-stimulated SRE-dependent transcription. Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase) inhibits RhoA activation of SRE-dependent transcription (Gudi, T., Chen, J. C., Casteel, D. E., Seasholtz, T. M., Boss, G. R., and Pilz, R. B. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 37382-37393). We now show that the G-kinase inhibition that occurs downstream of RhoA can be explained, at least in part, by G-kinase phosphorylation of VASP on Ser239 at the carboxyl-terminal end of the G-actin binding site, with some contribution by phosphorylation of Ser157, which is proximal to the profilin binding site. A phosphorylation-deficient VASP mutant can partly prevent cGMP/G-kinase inhibition of serum- and RhoA-induced SRE-dependent transcription. These studies show that VASP, an important component of the cellular microfilament system, plays a major role in regulating SRE-dependent transcription, and that G-kinase regulates VASP activity.

Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase), like cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase), regulates transcription of multiple genes including c-fos, and is the mediator of some of the effects of nitric oxide on gene expression (23Gudi T.

In this study, we found that VASP activates SRE-dependent transcription downstream of RhoA, and that the EVH2 domain of VASP is required for induction of transcription of VASP. A dominant negative VASP construct containing the tetramerization region interfered with VASP- and RhoA-dependent activation of gene transcription; G-kinase phosphorylation of VASP, particularly on Ser239, inhibited the transcriptional effects of VASP. Studies with phosphorylation-deficient VASP mutants suggest that VASP is important to the G-kinase regulation of SRE-dependent transcription that occurs distal to RhoA.

After a 1-h recovery period in full medium, cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM for 24 h, with some cultures receiving the indicated concentrations of 8-para-chlorophenylthio-cGMP (CPT-cGMP) during the last 30 min (for examination of VASP phosphorylation) or 7 h (for reporter gene assays). For A7R5 and MCFB cells, subconfluent cultures in 12-well cluster dishes were transfected with a total of 0.6 μg of DNA and 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen); the cells were then treated as described above. In the experiments shown in Fig. 2A, inset, and Fig. 6D, C6 cells were stimulated with 10% serum for the last 4 h.Fig. 6Effects of cGMP/G-kinase on phosphorylation-deficient VASP mutants. C6 cells were transfected with 150 ng of expression vectors encoding the following VSV epitope-tagged full-length VASP constructs: wild type VASP (WT); VASP (Ala157); VASP (Ala239); VASP (Ala278); VASP Ser157 and Ser239 mutated to Ala (AAT); VASP Ser157, Ser239, and Thr278 mutated to Ala (AAA); or VASP Ser157, Ser239, and Thr278 mutated to Asp (DDD). Cells were additionally transfected with pSRE-Luc, pRSV-β-Gal, and G-kinase Iα (25 ng), and were serum starved as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, half of the cultures were left untreated (filled bars), and half received 100 μm CPT-cGMP 7 h prior to extraction (cross-hatched bars). Relative luciferase activities were determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1 with untreated cells not receiving VASP assigned a value of 1. cGMP treatment had no effect on VASP-stimulated reporter gene activity in the absence of G-kinase (not shown). B, as indicated, cells were transfected with the VASP constructs described in panel A, with some cotransfected with 25 ng of G-kinase Iα, and some treated with 100 μm CPT-cGMP for 30 min prior to extraction.

For immunoprecipitation experiments, C6 cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of expression vectors for the EVH2 domain (VSV-tagged) in the absence or presence of GFP-tagged full-length VASP. Thirty-six hours later cells were lysed and proteins were immunoprecipitated using the mouse monoclonal anti-VSV antibody and protein G-agarose beads. Western blots were generated from the immunoprecipitates using the rabbit polyclonal anti-VASP antibody. Phalloidin Staining—REF 52 cells plated on glass coverslips coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) were serum starved for 48 h, and transfected as described above; 36 h later, the cells were fixed and stained as previously described using Texas Red-labeled phalloidin (1:50, Molecular Probes), and the mouse anti-VSV antibody followed by an fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (31Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Statistical Analysis—The data in bar graphs and G-kinase enzyme activity are presented as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Blots or photographs represent data that were reproduced at least three times in independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student’s t test, with p < 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. Effect of VASP and Different VASP Subdomains on SRE-dependent Transcription—Along with other proteins and agents that deplete the G-actin pool and induce F-actin accumulation, VASP has been shown to induce SRE-dependent transcription in NIH 3T3 cells (6Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). We found that transfection of full-length VASP into serum-starved rat C6 glioma cells stimulated SRE-dependent transcription: as little as two to three times the amount of endogenous VASP increased SRE-dependent transcription with further increases in transcriptional rates occurring at higher amounts of transfected VASP (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine which regions in VASP were responsible for transcriptional activation, we expressed VASP subdomains in the C6 cells and found that the amino-terminal EVH1 domain (amino acids 1-113), which includes the vinculin and zyxin binding site, had no effect on SRE-dependent transcription (Fig. 1A). The carboxyl-terminal EVH2 domain (amino acids 225-380), which includes the G- and F-actin binding motifs and the tetramerization region of VASP, was about 40% as effective as full-length VASP (Fig. 1A). Further truncation of the EVH2 domain to amino acids 259-380, which removes the G-actin binding region, reduced its effectiveness little (Fig. 1A); this construct can still bind F-actin, induce actin cross-linking in vitro, and localize to stress fibers in vivo (14Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, removal of the F-actin binding region at residues 259-277 yielded a construct (EVH2, amino acids 278-380) that no longer stimulated SRE-dependent transcription (Fig. 1A), and in fact inhibited transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, discussed below). These data suggest that the F-actin binding region of VASP is important for its induction of SRE-dependent transcription, but that other parts of VASP, in particular the proline-rich region, contribute to the effect of VASP, possibly through interaction with other proteins (12Reinhard M. Jarchau T. Walter U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 243-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The VASP constructs were expressed at relatively similar levels (Fig. 1C), and thus their differential effects on SRE-dependent transcription could not be attributed to variable expression; the isolated G- and F-actin binding regions consisting of amino acids 225-278 did not express sufficiently well to be used in these studies. Similar differential effects on SRE-dependent transcription by full-length VASP, and the EVH1 and EVH2 domains were found in REF 52 cells, a fibroblastic cell line (data not shown). Compared with C6 cells, which as neuronal cells have a cortical shell of F-actin that mediates cytoskeletal contraction but does not form stress fibers (39Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), REF 52 cells afforded the opportunity to demonstrate that transfection of VASP into cells induced an increase in F-actin levels (Fig. 1D; while phalloidin stained some stress fibers in untransfected cells, there was a marked increase in stress fibers in the VASP-transfected cells). These results are similar to those reported previously (14Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 19Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, these data are consistent with VASP stimulating SRE-dependent transcription by changing actin dynamics (6Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 7Posern G. Sotiropoulos A. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4167-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Effect of the EVH2 Tetramerization Region on SRE-dependent Transcription—As described above, the distal part of the EVH2 domain, amino acids 278-380, lacks the G- and F-actin binding regions. This construct retains the tetramerization region, and has been shown to act as a dominant negative regulator of VASP functions in some systems: it reduces stress fiber formation in epithelial cells, and interferes with formation of adhesion zippers and epithelial sheets in primary keratinocytes (14Bachmann C.

https://openalex.org/W2052921081,"Tight regulation of luteinizing hormone-β subunit (LHβ) expression is critical for differentiation and maturation of mammalian sexual organs and reproductive function. Two transcription factors, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and early growth response-1 (Egr-1), play a central role in activating LHβ promoter, and the synergy between these two factors is essential in mediating gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation of LHβ promoter. Here we demonstrate that the transcriptional co-activator p300 regulates this synergy. Overexpression of p300 results in strong stimulation of LHβ promoter but only in the presence of both SF-1 and Egr-1, and not in the presence of other Egr proteins. Mutation of the binding sites for either SF-1 or Egr-1 completely abolishes the synergy between these two factors, as well as the influence of p300. Importantly, LHβ promoter is precipitated using p300 antibodies in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with LβT2 gonadotropes, and this effect is enhanced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The influence of p300 on LHβ promoter is potentiated by steroid receptor co-activator, as well as by E1A proteins, and attenuated by Smad nuclear interacting protein 1.

Notably, this synergy requires the binding of both SF-1 and Egr-1 to their respective LHβ promoter elements (5Dorn C. Ou Q. Svaren J. Crawford P.A. Sadovsky Y. J. Biol.

Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Because SF-1 and Egr-1 can individually interact with the coactivator p300/CBP (21Monte D. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol.

JEG3 cells were grown in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 5% CO2. LβT2 cells, obtained from Pamela Mellon (University of California, San Diego, CA), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were cultured in a 5% CO2 environment (32Alarid E.T.

CV1, JEG3, and 293 cells were transfected using the modified calcium phosphate method described previously (34Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4809) Google Scholar, 35Ou Q. Mouillet J.F. Yan X. Dorn C. Crawford P.A. Sadovsky Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). LβT2 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), following the manufacturer's protocol. Empty expression plasmids were used to balance the total amount of transfected DNA, where necessary. Standard luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection as described previously (28Crawford P.A. Polish J.A. Ganpule G. Sadovsky Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1626-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), using a Lumistar 96-well plate reader (BMG, Durham, NC). Because we found that p300 influenced the expression of the control vector β-galactosidase, we normalized the results to transfection efficiency and cell viability by one of the following methods: (1) determination of total protein in transfected cells, and (2) Renilla luciferase activity, co-transfected using the pRL-null vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and determined by a dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega). Results were expressed as relative luciferase units (RLU). All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and PCR—Approximately 1 × 107 LβT2 cells were grown on 10-cm dishes and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation, and incubated for 10 min on ice in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS plus protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma). Cell lysates were then sonicated on ice to a mean length of 500–1,000 bp and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. The chromatin solution was diluted in a buffer containing 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 nm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl and then pre-cleared with 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. Input samples were obtained at 0.1% (v/v), followed by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The antibodies included anti-p300 (sc584), anti-Egr-1 (sc110), and anti-PPARγ (sc1984), all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and anti-SF-1 (06–431) from Upstate Biotechnology. Immune complexes were collected with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry and sequentially washed for 10 min each in low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 15 Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1), and two washes with Tris/EDTA buffer. Precipitates were then extracted two times with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaCO3. Eluates were pooled, and cross-linking was reversed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. Samples were then digested with proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics) for 2 h at 45 °C and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was dissolved in 50 μl of Tris/EDTA buffer, and 5 μl was used for PCR, described below.For standard PCR, immunoprecipitated DNA was used as a template in 25-μl reactions using specific LHβ promoter primers, which include forward primer 5′-TTCAGCGAGCAGCCTGCAGTGGCCTCCCCT and reverse primer 5′-CCACTAAGTAGTGGCTACAGGCTTGGGTAA. Band density was quantified using LabWorks 4.0 software (UVP, Upland, CA). Transcript level was determined by quantitative PCR using a 5700 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems). Each 50 μl of PCR included 3 μl of reverse transcription products, forward primers (5′-GGTTACCCAAGCCTGTAGCCA) and reverse primers (5′-TGGCTTTATACCTGCGGGTT), and 25 μl of SYBER Green Master mix (Applied Biosystems). Transcript level was determined by using Gene-Amp 5700 SDS software (Applied Biosystems).Statistics—Each set of results was determined in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Because of the nature of transfection experiments, representative results are shown. For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, data presented are mean ± S.D. from four independent experiments. Relevant paradigms were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA), with post hoc Bonferroni t test (Primers of Biostatistics, v. 3.0). A value of p < 0.05 was determined significant.RESULTSP300 Strongly Stimulates the Activity of LHβ Promoter—To test the hypothesis that p300 influences the transcriptional activation of LHβ promoter by SF-1 and Egr-1 we initially determined the effect of p300 on the activity of LHβ promoter. For this purpose, we transiently transfected CV1 cells with expression plasmids for SF-1, Egr-1, and p300, along with an LHβ reporter construct that spans nucleotides -156 to +7 of rat LHβ promoter upstream of luciferase. As shown in Fig. 1, in the absence of SF-1 and Egr-1 (lane 2) we observed minimal and non-significant activation of LHβ promoter by p300. The influence of p300 on LHβ promoter was pronounced in the presence of either SF-1 or Egr-1 (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 8). Coexpression of SF-1 and Egr-1, along with p300, resulted in dramatic up-regulation of LHβ promoter (Fig. 1, compare lane 11 with lanes 5 and 8), suggesting that p300 potentiates the synergy between SF-1 and Egr-1 in regulation of LHβ promoter. As a control we tested the effect of steroid receptor co-activator-1 (SRC-1), a co-activator known to interact with and enhance the transcriptional activity of SF-1 (28Crawford P.A. Polish J.A. Ganpule G. Sadovsky Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1626-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 36Ito M. Yu R.N. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As expected, SRC-1 potentiated the interaction of SF-1 and Egr-1 on LHβ promoter (Fig. 1, lane 12), but to a lesser extent than p300. To ensure that these results are not cell type-specific we repeated these experiments in JEG3 cells, as well as 293 cells, and recapitulated in these cell lines the strong p300-dependent potentiation of LHβ promoter transactivation by SF-1/Egr-1 synergy (not shown). To ensure that the dramatic p300-dependent increase in LHβ reporter activity is not because of significant alteration of SF-1 and Egr-1 expression we examined the level of these factors in transfected cells, using Western analysis. We found that the level of transfected SF-1, but not Egr-1, is weakly (3–5-fold) increased in the presence of overexpressed p300 (not shown). Moreover, transfection of 10-fold more SF-1 expression plasmid alone resulted in only a minor increase of the LHβ promoter activity compared with the combined effect of SF-1/Egr-1 with p300, effectively ruling out altered SF-1/Egr-1 expression level as an explanation for the striking effect of p300.To obtain further support for the influence of p300 on SF-1/Egr-1 synergy in the context of LHβ promoter we used LHβ promoter reporter plasmids that harbor mutated binding elements for Egr-1, SF-1, or both (5Dorn C. Ou Q. Svaren J. Crawford P.A. Sadovsky Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13870-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, mutations in either SF-1 or Egr-1 elements resulted in a dramatic reduction in SF-1/Egr-1 synergy and markedly attenuated the influence of p300 on LHβ promoter. These results demonstrate that p300 acts through interaction with DNA-bound SF-1 and Egr-1 in the context of LHβ promoter. Whereas SF-1 and Egr-1 may directly interact (9Tremblay J.J. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Halvorson L.M. Ito M. Jameson J.L. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14712-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), our results suggest that this direct interaction is not sufficient for promoter potentiation by p300, which requires tethering of SF-1 and Egr-1 to their promoter elements.Fig. 2The stimulation of LHβ promoter by p300 requires binding of both SF-1 and Egr-1 to their promoter elements. Binding elements for SF-1 and Egr-1 in LHβ promoter are shown. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with wild type or mutated forms of the rat LHβ-luciferase construct, along with SF-1 (0.1 μg), Egr-1 (0.4 μg), and p300 (3.0 μg). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept equal by addition of empty expression plasmids. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection. Results (mean ± S.D.) are expressed as RLU and represent three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.

We transiently transfected LβT2 cells with p300, along with our LHβ-promoter reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 3, we found that overexpression of p300 in LβT2 cells led to a significant up-regulation of basal LHβ reporter. This effect was further potentiated by exposing LβT2 cells to GnRH, thus providing further support to the influence of p300 on LHβ activation by SF-1 and Egr-1.Fig. 3p300 enhances transactivation by SF-1 and Egr-1 in LβT2 cells. LβT2 cells were transiently transfected with the rat LHβ-luciferase construct, along with SF-1 (0.1 μg), Egr-1 (0.4 μg), and increasing amounts of p300. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept equal by addition of empty expression plasmids. Cells were stimulated for 24, 6, and 1 h with GnRH (100 mm) before harvest. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection. Results (mean ± S.D.) are expressed as RLU and represent three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.

We performed these experiments in LβT2 cells, which produce LHβ and in which p300 overexpression was shown to significantly enhance a LHβ reporter. LβT2 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde to cross-link proteins to chromatin within the live cells, and complexes were captured using specific antibodies. To confirm the specificity of our immunoprecipitation we performed parallel experiments with a protein A-agarose mixture that either lacked the relevant antibody or had been bound to an irrelevant antibody (nonspecific IgG or anti-PPARγ antibody). As shown in Fig. 4A, the use of p300 antibody resulted in enrichment of the DNA genomic segment harboring LHβ promoter, confirming the recruitment of this factor to the promoter. As positive control we used anti-SF-1 or -Egr-1 antibodies, both resulting in precipitation of the genomic LHβ promoter fragment. In contrast, there was no precipitation using a control, nonspecific IgG (Fig. 4A) or anti-PPARγ antibody (not shown).Fig. 4Recruitment of p300, SF-1, and Egr-1 to LHβ promoter. The direct interaction of p300, Egr-1, and SF-1 with the endogenous LHβ promoter was determined by ChIP analysis in LβT2 cells. Cells were treated with formaldehyde, washed, lysed, and sonicated. The DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with indicated antibodies and captured with protein A-agarose beads. The DNA was purified and amplified with primers flanking LHβ promoter. Input DNA represents a fraction of the sonicated chromatin prior to immunoprecipitation. A, chromatin preparations from untreated cells were immunoprecipitated with p300, Egr-1, or SF-1 antibodies, and precipitated DNA was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR. Amplification products were visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Rabbit nonimmune IgG (or anti PPARγ antibodies; not shown) was included as a negative control. B, LβT2 cells were stimulated with or without GnRH (10-7m), and immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified using PCR. Densitometric analysis of the bands is shown below the figure, demonstrating the influence of GnRH on precipitation of p300, Egr-1, or SF-1. C, chromatin immunoprecipitation was quantitated by real-time PCR, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results depict mean ± S.D., derived from four independent experiments, expressed as -fold from GnRH-stimulated cells over non-stimulated cells for each antibody used in immunoprecipitation.

Using qualitative PCR in four independent ChIP experiments we consistently found an increase in PCR-amplified DNA from chromatin complexes precipitated with p300 in GnRH-stimulated LβT2, compared with non-stimulated cells (Fig. 4B). Similar results were found with precipitation of Egr-1, but not SF-1. To quantify the changes in immunoprecipitated chromatin, we used real time quantitative PCR. As shown in Fig. 4C, a significant influence of GnRH was observed on precipitation of LHβ chromatin fragment with p300 antibody. We also confirmed the qualitative PCR data, demonstrating a significant influence of GnRH on precipitation of LHβ promoter fragment using anti Egr-1 antibodies. As expected, the effect of GnRH on SF-1 was not significant. Together, these results indicate that p300 is physically recruited to endogenous LHβ promoter in LβT2 cells and that this recruitment is enhanced following stimulation by GnRH.p300 Potentiates the Effect of SRC/p160 Co-activators on LHβ Promoter—SF-1 has been shown to interact with all three members of the p160 steroid receptor co-activator family of proteins, SRC-1 (28Crawford P.A.

Despite the similarity and potential redundancy in their functions, CHK1 and CHK2 are unrelated protein kinases, each having a distinctive regulatory domain. Here we compare how the regulatory domains of human CHK1 and CHK2 modulate the respective kinase activities. Recombinant CHK1 has only low basal activity when expressed in cultured cells. Surprisingly, disruption of the C-terminal regulatory domain activates CHK1 even in the absence of stress. Unlike the full-length protein, C-terminally truncated CHK1 displays autophosphorylation, phosphorylates CDC25C on Ser216, and delays cell cycle progression. Intriguingly, enzymatic activity decreases when the entire regulatory domain is removed, suggesting that the regulatory domain contains both inhibitory and stimulatory elements. Conversely, the kinase domain suppresses Ser345 phosphorylation, a major ATM/ATR phosphorylation site in the regulatory domain. In marked contrast, CHK2 expressed in either mammalian cells or in bacteria is already active as a kinase against itself and CDC25C and can delay cell cycle progression. Unlike CHK1, disruption of the regulatory domain of CHK2 abolishes its kinase activity. Moreover, the regulatory domain of CHK2, but not that of CHK1, can oligomerize.

In mammalian cells, DNA damage checkpoints operate throughout the cell cycle to monitor and maintain genomic stability. These checkpoints ensure that damaged DNA is not replicated in S phase or segregated to the daughter cells in mitosis until repaired. Cells that harbor defects in these pathways are prone to genomic instability and neoplastic transformation. The gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), 1The abbreviations used are: AT, ataxia-telangiectasia; IR, ionizing radiation; FHA, forkhead-associated; HU, hydroxyurea; NOC, nocodazole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: AT, ataxia-telangiectasia; IR, ionizing radiation; FHA, forkhead-associated; HU, hydroxyurea; NOC, nocodazole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein. ATM, encodes one of the critical protein kinases activated by DNA double strand breaks (1Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). Cells derived from AT patients exhibit a greatly enhanced radiosensitivity, radioresistant DNA synthesis, and chromosomal instability. After ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage, ATM phosphorylates and activates CHK2, which in turn phosphorylates CDC25C on Ser216 (2Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). This either directly inactivates the phosphatase activity of CDC25C or indirectly inactivates it through the creation of a 14-3-3 binding site (3Blasina A. de Weyer I.V. Laus M.C. Luyten W.H. Parker A.E. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 4Lopez-Girona A. Kanoh J. Russell P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 50-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). IR-induced destruction of another member of the CDC25 family, CDC25A, requires CHK2-mediated phosphorylation of CDC25A on Ser123 (5Mailand N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Groth A. Mann M. Bartek J. Lukas J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5911-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 6Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). CDC25A and CDC25C activate CDC2 by dephosphorylating two residues (Thr14 and Tyr15) located within the catalytic cleft. Thus, inactivation of CDC25 promotes inhibitory phosphorylation and inactivation of CDC2. This mechanism is critical for the G2 DNA damage checkpoint, because the cyclin B1-CDC2 complex is a key regulator of mitotic entry (7Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Similarly, the ATM-CHK2-CDC25A pathway is also essential for the intra-S phase DNA damage checkpoint by inhibiting CDK2 (6Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). In addition to acting through the CHK2-CDC25A-CDK pathways, ATM also acts on a parallel pathway involving the trimeric protein complex MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 (8Wang J.Y. Nature. 2000; 405: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In response to IR, the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain-containing protein MDC1 is phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner, relocalizes to nuclear foci containing the MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 complex, and associates with CHK2 (9Lou Z. Minter-Dykhouse K. Wu X. Chen J. Nature. 2003; 421: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 10Goldberg M. Stucki M. Falck J. D'Amours D. Rahman D. Pappin D. Bartek J. Jackson S.P.

Nature. 2003; 421: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The ATM- and Rad3p-related kinase ATR is activated by a broader spectrum of genotoxic stimuli than ATM (12Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 13Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). These include IR, UV, and other agents that induce DNA cross-linking as well as inhibitors of DNA replication. Several lines of evidence suggest that whereas the effects of ATM are mediated mainly through CHK2, the effects of ATR are mediated through another kinase called CHK1. Disruption of CHK1 in mice results in peri-implantation embryonic lethality (14Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6521-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage or replication block, CHK1 is phosphorylated at Ser317 and Ser345 by ATR (14Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J.

Like CHK2, CHK1 also phosphorylates and inactivates CDC25 (19Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 20Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H.

In addition, CHK1 also phosphorylates WEE1, the protein kinase that opposes the action of CDC25 by phosphorylation of CDC2 on Tyr15 (22O'Connell M.J. Raleigh J.M. Verkade H.M. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar); this creates a 14-3-3 binding site and stimulates the kinase activity of WEE1 (23Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As the mediators that link the DNA stress responses to the cell cycle, CHK1 and CHK2 share many similarities in functions as well as regulation. However, these two protein kinases share no significant sequence similarity outside the protein kinase domain. CHK1 comprises a kinase domain at the N-terminal half and a regulatory domain at the C-terminal half of the protein. An SQ/TQ domain (residues 317–383) contains putative phosphorylation sites for ATM/ATR and lies within the regulatory domain. CHK1 is phosphorylated on Ser317 and Ser345 in response to replication stress or other types of DNA damage in an ATM/ATR-dependent fashion (14Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) also act upstream of CHK1 phosphorylation. Another upstream regulator of CHK1, claspin, is phosphorylated and binds to CHK1 after replication block or DNA damage. Phosphorylated claspin docks with a phosphate-binding site in the kinase domain of CHK1, which may mimic activating phosphorylation (29Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol.

In comparison with CHK1, the kinase domain of CHK2 is located at the C-terminal half of the protein. The N-terminal regulatory region contains an SQ/TQ domain (residues 19–68) and an FHA domain. Thr68 in the SQ/TQ domain is a major ATM phosphorylation site (33Zhou B.B. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol.

Other sites are also phosphorylated by ATM, because only mutation of all seven SQ/TQ sites abolishes phosphorylation (35Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The FHA domain is dispensable for Thr68 phosphorylation but necessary for efficient autophosphorylation in response to IR (37Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 38Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 9: 1045-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). After DNA damage, Thr68 phosphorylation triggers autophosphorylation of Thr383 and Thr387 (40Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These residues are located within the activating loop of the kinase domain and are essential for CHK2 activity. The FHA domain also mediates CHK2 oligomerization via direct interaction with phosphorylated Thr68 on another CHK2 molecule (37Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 38Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although Thr68 phosphorylation may be required for initial oligomerization and activation of CHK2, it is not needed for maintenance of oligomerization or kinase activity (41Ahn J. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48418-48426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Many protein kinases possess an integral regulatory domain that mediates a variety of functions including interactions with other proteins, activation, or inhibition of the kinase domain (42Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6214) Google Scholar). The precise functions of the regulatory domains of CHK1 and CHK2 remain to be deciphered. Here we address the issue by creating a series of truncation mutants of human CHK1 and CHK2. We found that full-length CHK1 has only low basal activity when expressed in mammalian cells. Surprisingly, disruption of the regulatory domain activates CHK1 even in the absence of stress. In contrast, ectopically expressed full-length CHK2 is already active as a kinase and can inhibit the cell cycle. Unlike CHK1, disruption of the regulatory domain of CHK2 abolishes its kinase activity. Moreover, the regulatory domain of CHK2, but not that of CHK1, can form oligomers. Finally, the regulatory domain of CHK1 is phosphorylated during mitotic block, which correlates with the inhibition of CHK1 kinase activity. Collectively, these data reveal the very different mode of regulation between CHK1 and CHK2. Materials—All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise.

CHK1 antiserum was a generous gift from Dr. Helen Piwnica-Worms (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Fas antiserum was a gift from Dr. Benjamin Bonavida (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). Antibodies against Ser345-phosphorylated CHK1 and Tyr15-phosphorylated CDC2 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal antibodies against CHK1 (sc-8408), CHK2 (sc-5278 and sc-17747), cyclin B1 (sc-245), and cyclin E (sc-247) and polyclonal antibodies against Ser10-phosphorylated histone H3 (sc-8656R) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The Regulatory Domain Suppresses the Kinase Activity of CHK1—This study was initiated by our observations that CHK1 was significantly overexpressed in liver cancer (hepato-cellular carcinoma) in comparison with nontumorous liver tissues from the same patients. 2C.-P. Ng, H. C. Lee, C. W. Ho, T. Arooz, W. Y. Siu, A. Lau, and R. Y. C. Poon, unpublished data. Given that the overexpressed CHK1 apparently does not hinder liver cancer cell growth, we hypothesized that full-length CHK1 may not be active even when overexpressed. To see whether recombinant CHK1 is active, both full-length CHK1 and a mutant lacking part of the C terminus (CΔ390; see Fig. 1 for schematic diagram) were ectopically expressed in mammalian cells (Fig. 2A). FLAG epitope tags were introduced to distinguish the recombinant proteins from the endogenous CHK1. We found that whereas full-length CHK1 appeared as a single band on SDS-PAGE, CΔ390 exhibited mobility shifts that are typical of phosphorylation. Consistent with the mobility shifts, CHK1 was only weakly radiolabeled, but CΔ390 was robustly autophosphorylated when incubated with radioactive ATP. To measure the kinase activity of CHK1 against external substrates, a GST-CDC25C195–259 fusion protein containing the CHK1 phosphorylation site (Ser216) was used. Consistent with the autophosphorylation activity, CDC25C was phosphorylated by CΔ390 more strongly than by full-length CHK1. Phosphorylation was specific for Ser216, because a GST-CDC25C195–259 with Ser216 mutated to alanine was not phosphorylated by recombinant CHK1 (data not shown).Fig. 2The regulatory domains of CHK1 and CHK2 have opposite effects on the basal kinase activity.A, C-terminal truncation activates CHK1. HtTA1 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged CHK1 or CΔ390 as indicated. At 24 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared, and the FLAG-tagged proteins were detected by immunoblotting (top panel). Immunoprecipitates (IP) of FLAG antiserum were assayed for autophosphorylation (Auto-p; middle panel) and kinase activity against GST-CDC25C195–259 (bottom panel) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, gel mobility shifts of recombinant CHK1. FLAG-CHK1 and the indicated truncation mutants were expressed in HtTA1 cells. At 24 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared, and the FLAG-tagged proteins were detected by immunoblotting. C, kinase activity of recombinant CHK1. FLAG-tagged CHK1, CHK1(K38R), and the indicated truncation mutants were expressed in HtTA1 cells. At 24 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared, and the FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antiserum. The autophosphorylation and kinase activity against GST-CDC25C195–259 were assayed. The positions of molecular size standards (in kDa) are shown on the right. The phosphorylation of the recombinant CDC25C was quantified with a PhosphorImager and is shown in the bottom panel. D, CHK1 lacking the entire regulatory domain has no autophosphorylation activity. FLAG-CHK1(CΔ366) and FLAG-CHK1(CΔ284) were expressed in HtTA1 as indicated. Cell extracts were prepared and the samples were subjected to immunoblotting for FLAG-tagged proteins or to an autophosphorylationassay after immunoprecipitation with FLAG antiserum (lanes 3 and 4). E, disruption of the N-terminal regulatory domain of CHK2 abolishes kinase activity. FLAG-tagged CHK2, CHK2(K249R), and various truncation mutants were expressed in HtTA1 cells as indicated. At 24 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared, and the FLAG-tagged proteins were detected by immunoblotting (top panel). The autophosphorylation (middle panel) and kinase activity against GST-CDC25C195–259 (bottom panel) were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” F, purification of CHK2 from bacteria. GST-CHK2 and GST-CHK2(NΔ220) were expressed in E. coli and purified with GSH column chromatography. The purified proteins were applied onto SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.

https://openalex.org/W2041879341,"TGF-beta is a multifunctional growth factor whose best-known function is to inhibit cell growth and suppress tumor formation. TGF-beta causes cells to accumulate in mid-to-late G1 phase by blocking the transition from G1 to S. It has been shown that TGF-beta inhibits Cdk2-cyclin E kinase activity by promoting the binding of cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 to the kinase complexes. Here, we show that TGF-beta treatment leads to stabilization of p27Kip1 during G1 to S transition. We found that TGF-beta negatively regulates components of the SCF complex, which degrades the p27Kip1 during the G1 to S transition, through two distinct mechanisms. Using a pulse-chase analysis, we demonstrated that the stability of Skp2 decreases in the presence of TGF-beta. Destabilization of Skp2 by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis was also demonstrated that in an in vitro degradation system, using cell extracts prepared from TGF-beta-treated cultured cells. In addition, TGF-beta treatment decreases the levels of Cks1 mRNA. The deficiency of Cks1 in TGF-beta-treated cells likely contributes to the stabilization of p27Kip1 and destabilization of Skp2, because in the absence of Cks1, SCFSkp2 cannot ubiquitinate p27Kip1; instead, self-ubiquitination of Skp2 occurs. Thus, stabilization of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 and cell growth inhibition in response to TGF-beta occur in part through limiting the threshold of the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2070210709,"p21Bax is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family and is converted by calpain into a truncated form called p18Bax. This proteolysis enhanced the apoptogenic properties of Bax by a mechanism not yet elucidated. We have shown recently that the first α helix (Hα1) of p21Bax contained a mitochondrial addressing sequence, which appeared to be necessary for p21Bax-induced apoptosis (Cartron, P. F., Priault, M., Oliver, L., Meflah, K., Manon, S., and Vallette, F. M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 11633–11641). This feature is in contradiction with the high apoptogenic profile of p18Bax, because the Hα1 is lost during the calpain cleavage of p21Bax. We investigated the role of p18Bax in apoptosis and found that its activity required the presence of p21Bax. In addition, p18Bax exhibited a higher affinity for Bcl-Xl than p21Bax did, a property that seems to be essential for the fulfillment of its pro-apoptotic role. In conclusion, calpain proteolysis converts the multi-domain p21Bax into a Bcl-2 homology 3-like protein capable of overcoming the inhibition of apoptosis due to Bcl-Xl. p21Bax is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family and is converted by calpain into a truncated form called p18Bax.

In conclusion, calpain proteolysis converts the multi-domain p21Bax into a Bcl-2 homology 3-like protein capable of overcoming the inhibition of apoptosis due to Bcl-Xl. Apoptosis is a cell death program that is central to cellular and tissue homeostasis and, as such, is involved in many normal and physiopathological processes (1Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2612) Google Scholar). Proteins of the Bcl-2 family are the key regulators of this program, during which their main function is to control mitochondrial permeability and, in particular, the release of apoptogenic proteins from this organelle (2Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Members of this family are divided into two main groups, the anti-apoptotic proteins with Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl as archetypes and the pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax. The pro-apoptotic proteins of this family can be subdivided into two groups. The first group is composed of Bax, Bok, and Bak and shares several domains of homology with Bcl-2 (i.e. Bcl-2 homology domains BH1, 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology domain; p21Bax, Baxα; p18Bax, Baxα Δ(1–37); p13tBid, truncated form of Bid; GBM, glioblastoma multiforme tumor; BdGBM, Bax-deficient GBM; BeGBM, Bax-expressing GBM; CCE, control cell extract; STS, staurosporine; ΔCT, C terminus deleted; IVT, in vitro translated; Hα1, first α helix. 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology domain; p21Bax, Baxα; p18Bax, Baxα Δ(1–37); p13tBid, truncated form of Bid; GBM, glioblastoma multiforme tumor; BdGBM, Bax-deficient GBM; BeGBM, Bax-expressing GBM; CCE, control cell extract; STS, staurosporine; ΔCT, C terminus deleted; IVT, in vitro translated; Hα1, first α helix. BH2, and BH3). The second group, typified by proteins like Bad or Bid, shared a homology with Bcl-2 limited to the BH3 domain and, hence, are called the “BH3-only proteins” (3Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The ratio between these different proteins determines the sensitivity of the cell to apoptosis; antiapoptotic proteins inhibit apoptosis by counteracting Bax and Bak, and BH3-only proteins either trigger apoptosis through direct interaction with Bax (i.e. Bid) or sensitize cells to death by inactivating Bcl-2 or Bcl-Xl (i.e. Bad) (4Letai A.

The importance of the latter class of proteins has been emphasized by recent experiments using synthetic peptides, which have shown that the mere introduction of the BH3 domain could faithfully reproduce death signals of the BH3-only proteins (3Huang D.C.

Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). It is believed that this property constitutes the basis of the regulation of their functions and that the binding of Bcl-2 or Bcl-Xl to Bax or Bak and/or BH3-only proteins inhibits apoptosis, whereas the homodimerization of Bax or Bak promotes cell death (2Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 10Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). The activity of the members of the Bcl-2 family is regulated in many ways; for example, the dephosphorylation of Bad allows its binding to the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-Xl (11Datta S.R. Ranger A.M.

Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). These results suggest that members of the Bcl-2 family can undergo post-translational modifications. This, in turn, allows these proteins to participate in the execution of apoptosis in addition to the complex inhibitory/activation interplay, which occurs at the onset of the apoptotic program (10Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). In the case of Bax, several reports have shown that the cleavage of Bax by calpain or cathepsin D, at a late stage of apoptosis, removes the first 33 amino acids of the N-terminal, resulting in the transition from the p21Bax to the p18Bax form (15Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 16Wood D.E. Newcomb E.W. J. Biol.

However, the physiological signification of this cleavage is unclear and, in particular, it is not known whether p18Bax is important for the apoptotic mitochondrial function or merely a consequence of the activation of proteolysis in a late apoptotic phase. A recent report by Cao et al. (19Cao X. Deng X. May W.S. Blood. 2003; 102: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) showed that a blockade of proteolysis by mutation of the calpain cleavage site inhibited the appearance of p18Bax and significantly delayed drug-induced apoptosis. Goping et al. (20Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) have identified a domain called ART (apoptosis-regulating targeting sequence) in the first 20 amino acids of Bax that is important for the translocation of p21Bax to the mitochondria during apoptosis. Truncation of this domain enhanced the binding of Bax to mitochondria (20Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that this deletion probably promoted the exposure of the Hα1 of Bax, which encompasses amino acids 20–37 and is a functional mitochondrial addressing signal necessary for p21Bax-induced apoptosis (21Cartron P.F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Cartron P.-F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because this sequence is lost in p18Bax, we have investigated its mechanism of induction of apoptosis in an attempt to address this apparent contradiction. Reagents—Unless otherwise stated, all reagents used in this study were from Sigma. The anti-N-terminal Bax antibodies 6A7 and 2D2 were from R&D Systems, and the anti-C-terminal (i.e. amino acids 150 to 165) Bax antibody Ab-1 was from Oncogene. Other commercial antibodies used were anti-actin from Chemicon (MAB1501R), anti-Bcl-2 from Dako (M0887), anti-Bcl-Xl and anti-Bad from Transduction Laboratories (respectively B22630 and B36420), anti-Bid from R&D Systems (AF 846), and the anti-His tag from Qiagen (34660). The MitoTracker Green-FM was obtained from Molecular Probes. Bax Constructs—p21Bax (Baxα) and p18Bax (BaxΔ1–37) with or without the C terminus (169–192) were obtained by PCR amplification as described previously (21Cartron P.F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The entire coding regions of p21Bax and p18Bax, cloned into pDEST 12.2 (Invitrogen), were subjected to mutagenesis to obtain the L63E mutant using the site-directed mutagenesis system from Invitrogen with the oligonucleotide 5′-ACCAAGAAGCTGAGCGAGTGTGAGAAGCGCATCGGGGAC-3′ (the mutated sequence is underlined). Similarly, the p21BaxD33A mutant (substitution of Asp-33 by Ala) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis with 5′-CTTTTGCTTAGGGTTTCATCCAGGCTCGAGCAGGGCG-3′ as the mutagenic primer (the mutated sequence is underlined). Cell Culture and Transfections—Bax-deficient and Bax-expressing cell lines derived from human glioblastoma multiforme tumors (BdGBM and BeGBM, respectively) (23Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L.

Plasmid DNA (5 μg) was introduced into 106 BdGBM or BeGBM cells by electroporation (GenePulser, Bio-Rad) using 200 V/cm and 250 farads. The transfected cells were selected in a medium containing neomycin (250 μg/ml) for 48 h. Cell-free Assay for Bax Insertion—Mitochondria were prepared from normal rat liver, and the cell-free association of Bax with the mitochondria was performed as described previously (5Moreau C.

Briefly, [35S]Met (Amersham Biosciences) labeled proteins were synthesized from cDNAs using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation system from Promega. Post-translational insertion of labeled proteins into mitochondrial membranes was performed in a standard import buffer as described previously (21Cartron P.F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). [35S]Met-labeled proteins bound to the mitochondria were recovered in the pellet after centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C at 8000 × g, and alkaline treatment of mitochondrial bound proteins was performed as described previously (21Cartron P.F.

[35S]Met-Bax associated with isolated mitochondria was analyzed in a SDS-PAGE and scanned with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of protein present in the gel was subsequently quantified using the IP-Lab gel program (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). In some mitochondrial association experiments, [35S]Met-labeled Bax (4 fmol) and unlabeled Bcl-Xl (4 fmol) were incubated together for 30 min before the addition of isolated rat liver mitochondria (50 μg) in the presence of Bax constructs (4 fmol) before the analysis of the insertion of [35S]Met-labeled Bax into mitochondrial membranes. The release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria was measured by the capacity of the mitochondrial supernatant to induce DEVDase activity in control cell extract (CCE) as described earlier (24Juin P. Tremblais K. LeCabellec M.T. Gregoire M. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Protein binding experiments were performed as described (5Moreau C. Cartron P.F. Hunt A. Meflah K. Green D.R. Evan G. Vallette F.M. Juin P. J. Biol.

Briefly, the coding regions of Bcl-Xl or Bcl-2 were subcloned into pDEST 17 (Invitrogen) to add a His tag at the N termini of the proteins. The His-tagged proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro His-tagged protein binding assays were performed as follows. p18Bax and p21Bax were in vitro translated and labeled with [35S]Met as described above. Equal amounts of each protein (4 fmol) were then diluted in 250 μl of binding buffer (142 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) and incubated with an equimolar concentration of the His-tagged Bcl-Xl or Bcl-2 immobilized on nickel-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. The resins were extensively washed with binding buffer, and then the His-tagged protein binding complexes were eluted with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 mm imidazole. The presence of the labeled proteins was detected after an SDS-PAGE of the eluted fractions and the resin, and then the radioactivity was quantified as described above. Quantification of Apoptosis—The DEVDase activity in BdGBM cell extracts (2 × 106 cells) transfected with the different Bax constructs was measured as described previously (21Cartron P.F. Priault M.

Briefly, cell death was induced in Bcl-Xl-BeGBM cells by a brief UV treatment (1 min) or by the addition of staurosporine (STS, 2 μm) and, in some cases, by doxorubicin (20 μg/ml). The cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide Ac-DEVDAMC, a substrate of executioner caspases, was then followed using a spectrofluorometer (Fluorolite 1000, Dynatech Laboratories) set at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 465 nm. Immunoprecipitation—Proteins were immunoprecipitated from sonicated cell extracts (5 × 107 cells) or from the cell-free assay using an immunoprecipitation buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and 0.1% SDS, the minimal concentration for solubilizing the extracts without inducing a change in the conformation of Bax. 2P. F. Cartron, unpublished results. Four micrograms of antibodies were added to the lysate, and the mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. A 10-fold excess of secondary antibody bound to agarose beads was added to the mixtures and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were then centrifuged for 2 min at 3000 × g at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed three times in Buffer B (Buffer A supplemented with 350 mm NaCl and 30% sucrose) and once in Buffer C (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), and 0.1% SDS) before a final centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 × g, at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Western blots were performed as described earlier (21Cartron P.F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) Confocal Analysis—For confocal analysis, the cells were incubated for 30 min with 5 μg/ml MitoTracker Green-FM at 37 °C and then fixed with 1:1 methanol/acetone for 15 min at -20 °C. After saturation with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with anti-Bax antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, a second antibody coupled to Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes) was added overnight at 4 °C. Images were collected on a Leica TCS NT microscope with a 63 × 1.3 NA Fluotar objective. p18Bax Appearance and Its Role in Drug-induced Apoptosis in a Human Glioma Cell Line—The cleavage of p21Bax into p18Bax by calpain and/or cathepsin during apoptosis has been reported in several tumor cell lines (15Wood D.E.

This cleavage provoked the removal of the first 33 amino acids of p21Bax and, thus, generated a form of Bax with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa, consequently called p18Bax. p18Bax has been shown to be a more potent inducer of apoptosis than p21Bax in several cell lines (15Wood D.E.

Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1531-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We investigated the appearance of p18Bax in a human glioma cell line, BeGBM (23Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L. Martin S. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4701-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), treated with 2 μm STS to induce apoptosis. Cell death was monitored using the measure of caspase-like activity (i.e. DEV-Dase) in cellular extracts (see “Materials and Methods”). As illustrated in Fig. 1A, the cleavage of p21Bax into p18Bax was associated with a marked increase in DEVDase activity at the beginning of the execution phase of apoptosis in BeGBM cells (23Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L. Martin S. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4701-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Of note, similar results were obtained with UV-treated BeGBM (see below and Fig. 1C). To evaluate the importance of p21Bax cleavage during apoptosis, we produced a mutant p21Bax in which Asp-33, identified as the calpain cleavage site (15Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), was replaced by an Ala to give p21BaxD33A. This substitution has been shown recently to significantly inhibit apoptosis in several cell lines (19Cao X. Deng X. May W.S. Blood. 2003; 102: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We transfected a Bax-deficient human glioma cell line, BdGBM, with either p21Bax or p21BaxD33A and then analyzed STS- or UV-induced apoptosis and compared the results with that observed in BeGBM cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, the mere expression of p21Bax was not sufficient to trigger apoptosis in BdGBM cells as observed previously (22Cartron P.-F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Cartron P.F. Juin P. Oliver L. Martin S. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4701-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with p21BaxD33A. On the other hand, the expression of both p21Bax and p21BaxD33A increased the sensitivity of BdGBM cells to UV- and STS-induced apoptosis, although p21BaxD33A was not as efficient as p21Bax. As illustrated in Fig. 1C, similar amounts of p21Bax and p21BaxD33A were produced in BdGBM cells, and the D33A substitution inhibited the appearance of p18Bax. From these results, we concluded that the cleavage of p21Bax into p18Bax significantly enhanced apoptosis in GBM cells. p18Bax Efficiently Induced Apoptosis Only in the Presence of p21Bax—To study the mechanism by which p18Bax induced apoptosis, we expressed transgenes encoding for p18Bax (see “Materials and Methods”) in BeGBM and BdGBM cells and compared the results with those obtained with similar p21Bax constructs. We used several constructs derived from p21Bax or p18Bax in which the C terminus (i.e. amino acids 169–192) was deleted (ΔCT) or the Leu at position 63, critical for Bax homo- or heterodimerization (27Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), was replaced by a Glu to produce p21BaxL63E and p18BaxL63E (27Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Clones expressing similar amount of p21Bax and p18Bax constructs were selected for this study (Fig. 2A). As reported by several authors (15Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C.

Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1531-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the expression of p18Bax in p21Bax-expressing cells induced apoptosis with an efficiency greater than that observed with p21Bax (Fig. 2B). This property appeared to be linked to its capacity to dimerize, because the BH3 mutant (p18BaxL63E) was not active. It should be noted that a deletion of the C terminus (p18BaxΔCT) did not affect its function. Strikingly, no signs of cell death were recorded when p18Bax was expressed in BdGBM cells (Fig. 2B). Of note, contrary to p21Bax, which did not induce apoptosis per se in both cell types (Fig. 2B) but sensitized BdGBM cells to drug-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1B), the overexpression of p18Bax did not enhance the sensitivity of BdGBM cells to apoptosis (data not shown). These results suggested that p18Bax was not a direct inducer of apoptosis, as it appeared to require the presence of p21Bax to trigger cell death. p18Bax Induced the Translocation of p21Bax to Mitochondria in Vitro—The confocal data presented in Fig. 3A give more detailed information about the mechanism(s) involved in p18Bax-induced apoptosis. BeGBM cells were transfected with p18Bax His-tagged at its C terminus, because the latter segment does not influence p18Bax-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2). Anti-His antibodies were used to visualize p18Bax, whereas, to specifically detect p21Bax we used a Bax antibody (2D2) that recognized an epitope located in the N terminus of p21Bax (i.e. amino acids 3–16) that was not present in p18Bax. In BeGBM cells in the absence of p18Bax, the immunostaining observed with the 2D2 antibody indicated that the endogenous p21Bax was essentially cytosolic (Fig. 3A). Similarly, BdGBM cells transfected with p18Bax exhibited anti-His staining, which was essentially cytosolic (Fig. 3A). However, in BeGBM cells transfected with p18Bax, p21Bax appeared colocalized to the mitochondria with the 2D2 antibody, indicating that the expression of the p18Bax transgene induced the translocation of endogenous p21Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Of note, under these co-expression conditions, p18Bax also partially translocated to the mitochondria.Fig. 3Confocal analysis of the expression and subcellular localization of p18Bax and p21Bax in BdGBM and BeGBM cells. A, the subcellular localization of p18Bax was determined using an anti-His antibody (and then the Alexa 633-coupled secondary antibody), and the subcellular localization of p21Bax was determined with the antibody 2D2 directed against amino acids 3–16 of Bax (and then with the Alexa 568-coupled secondary antibody) (see “Materials and Methods”). Mitochondria (mito) were labeled using MitoTracker Green-FM. B, the p18Bax-induced change in conformation of p21Bax was determined by the appearance of the 6A7 epitope (using the Alexa 568-coupled secondary antibody). Confocal analysis was performed as for panel A using MitoTracker Green-FM for the labeling of mitochondria. The experiments shown are representative of least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The antibody 6A7 is raised against an epitope located within the Hα1 (amino acids 12–26), which becomes exposed when p21Bax is bound to mitochondria (28Wolter K.G.

As shown in Fig. 3B, when BeGBM cells were transfected with p18Bax, the p21Bax located in the mitochondria was labeled with the 6A7 antibody, suggesting that the p18Bax induced the translocation of p21Bax as well as the apoptogenic change in conformation.

https://openalex.org/W1982104751,"Etk/Bmx, a member of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases, mediates various signaling pathways and confers several cellular functions. In the present study, we have explored the functional role of Etk in mediating EGF-induced apoptosis, using MDA-MB-468 cell line as a model. We first demonstrated that EGF treatment induces Etk tyrosine phosphorylation in both HeLa and MDA-MB-468 cells. Overexpression of Etk by recombinant adenovirus in MDA-MB-468 cells potentiates the extent of EGF-induced cell apoptosis. The observed Etk-enhanced MDA-MB-468 cell apoptosis is associated with the Stat1 activation, as demonstrated by electrophoresis mobility shift assays and reporter gene assays. By contrast, a kinase domain deletion mutant EtkΔK, functioning as a dominant-negative mutant, ameliorates EGF-induced Stat1 activation and apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells. To explore whether the activated Etk alone is sufficient for inducing apoptosis, a conditionally activated Etk (ΔEtk-ER), a chimeric fusion protein of PH domain-truncated Etk and ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptor, was introduced into MDA-MB-468 cells. Upon β-estradiol ligand activation, the ΔEtk-ER could stimulate Stat1 activity and confer cell apoptosis independent of EGF treatment. Taken together, our findings indicate that Etk is a downstream signaling molecule of EGF receptor and suggest that Etk activation is essential for transducing the EGF-induced apoptotic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2120306583,"Tenascin-R (TN-R) is a member of the tenascin family of multidomain matrix glycoproteins that is expressed exclusively in the central nervous system by oligodendrocytes and small neurons during postnatal development and in the adult. TN-R contributes to the regulation of axon extension and regeneration, neurite formation and synaptogenesis, and neuronal growth and migration. TN-R can be modified with three distinct sulfated oligosaccharide structures: HNK-1 (SO4-3-GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc), GalNAc-4-SO4, and chondroitin sulfate. We have determined that TN-R expressed in dendrite-rich regions of the rat cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex is one of the major matrix glycoproteins that bears N-linked carbohydrates terminating with β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4. The syntheses of these unique sulfated structures on TN-R are differentially regulated. Levels of HNK-1 on TN-R rise and fall in parallel to the levels of TN-R during postnatal development of the cerebellum. In contrast, levels of GalNAc-4-SO4 are regulated independently from those of TN-R, rising late in cerebellar development and continuing into adulthood. As a result, the pattern of TN-R modification with distinct sulfated carbohydrate structures changes dramatically over the course of postnatal cerebellar development in the rat. Because TN-R interacts with a number of different matrix components and, depending on the circumstances, can either activate or inhibit neurite outgrowth, the highly regulated addition of these unique sulfated structures may modulate the adhesive properties of TN-R over the course of development and during synapse maintenance. In addition, the 160-kDa form of TN-R is particularly enriched for terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 later in development and in the adult, suggesting additional levels of regulation.

Neural pattern formation in the central nervous system (CNS) 1The abbreviations used are: CNS, central nervous system; ECM, extracellular matrix; TN-R, tenascin-R; FN-III, fibronectin type III; HNK-1, SO4-3-GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; PNGase-F, protein N-glyconase-F. involves initial interactions between cell surfaces and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that direct cells to proliferate, migrate, and finally differentiate. Early in CNS development the ECM contains components such as fibronectin, laminin, and collagen, whereas chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and multimeric glycoproteins such as the tenascins appear later in maturation. Changes in the composition of the ECM play a critical role in generating the positive and negative signals necessary for normal pattern formation during development and tissue repair following injury (1Fawcett J.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Gary S.C. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 576-581Google Scholar). Tenascin-R (TN-R) is a member of the tenascin family of multidomain, matrix glycoproteins that are expressed exclusively in the central nervous system by oligodendrocytes and small neurons during postnatal development and in the adult. It has been implicated in the regulation of axon extension and regeneration, neurite formation and synaptogenesis, and neuronal growth and migration (3Pesheva P. Probstmeier R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 465-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 4Pesheva P. Gennarini G. Goridis C. Schachner M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). TN-R binds different cell surface receptors and/or ECM components depending upon the local environment and is able to either enhance or inhibit adhesion depending on the specific circumstances (3Pesheva P. Probstmeier R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 465-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The adhesive properties of TN-R reflect the cell type that expresses TN-R, the time in development it is synthesized, its post-translational modifications, the repertoire of receptors on adjacent cell surfaces, and intracellular signaling mechanisms (3Pesheva P. Probstmeier R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 465-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Jones F.S. Jones P.L. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 235-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Consequently the synthesis and processing of TN-R and its receptors are highly regulated throughout the development of the CNS and in the adult to facilitate neural pattern formation and tissue repair. TN-R has a highly conserved domain structure among different species as well as within the tenascin family of proteins (3Pesheva P. Probstmeier R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 465-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Schachner M. Taylor J. Bartsch U. Pesheva P. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1994; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar). It consists of an NH2-terminal cysteine-rich domain, 4.5 epidermal growth factor-type repeats, 9 fibronectin type III (FN-III) repeats, and a COOH-terminal fibrinogen domain (9Fuss B. Pott U. Fischer P. Schwab M.E. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 29: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Synthesis of TN-R by oligodendrocytes commences early in postnatal development, peaks during times of active myelination, and is down-regulated at later developmental stages. In contrast, neurons synthesize TN-R continuously beginning in late development and throughout adulthood (10Fuss B. Wintergerst E.S. Bartsch U. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1237-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 11Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Two molecular isoforms of TN-R of 160 (TN-R 160) and 180 kDa (TN-R 180) have been identified. TN-R 160 has been reported to be an alternatively spliced form of TN-R that is missing the sixth FN-III repeat (3Pesheva P. Probstmeier R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 465-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); however, the difference between the two forms has not been determined at the protein level. TN-R forms disulfide-linked dimeric and trimeric species through its NH2- terminal cysteine-rich region (11Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The differing patterns of expression observed for the two isoforms of TN-R in vivo have led to the suggestion that they may have different roles (3Pesheva P. Probstmeier R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 465-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). TN-R is extensively modified with both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides, 10–20% by weight (10Fuss B. Wintergerst E.S. Bartsch U. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1237-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 11Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Three distinct sulfated oligosaccharide structures have thus far been described on TN-R: HNK-1 (SO4-3-GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc) (12Kruse J. Keilhauer G. Faissner A. Timpl R. Schachner M. Nature. 1985; 316: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), O-linked chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (13Probstmeier R. Braunewell K. Pesheva P. Brain Res. 2000; 863: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and SO4-4-GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc (14Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Each may contribute to TN-R function. For example, the O-linked chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans may mediate TN-R interactions with fibronectin and tenascin-C, which induces inhibition of cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth in vitro (13Probstmeier R. Braunewell K. Pesheva P. Brain Res. 2000; 863: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Probstmeier R. Stichel C.C. Muller H.W. Asou H. Pesheva P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). There is evidence that HNK-1, present on all known isoforms of TN-R during neuronal development, modulates perisomatic inhibition of synapse formation and synaptic plasticity (16Saghatelyan A.K. Dityatev A. Schmidt S. Schuster T. Bartsch U. Schachner M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 226-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 17Saghatelyan A.K. Gorissen S. Albert M. Hertlein B. Schachner M. Dityatev A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3331-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The sulfated carbohydrate may regulate these functions through interaction with an HNK-1-specific receptor on the surface of neuronal cells, SBP-1 (18Chou D.K. Tobet S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although modification of glycolipids and other adhesion molecules in the CNS with HNK-1 is highly regulated, the developmental and tissue-specific pattern of HNK-1 addition to TN-R has not been determined (19Chou D.K. Prasadarao N. Koul O. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Chou D.K. Schachner M. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1239-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4 is prominent in the molecular layer of the rat cerebellum late in cerebellar development and persists into adulthood (14Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). GalNAc-4-SO4 on N- linked oligosaccharides is synthesized by the sequential action of a protein-specific GalNAc transferase and a GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase that are coordinately expressed in cerebellum and other regions of the brain such as the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and pituitary (21Dharmesh S.M. Skelton T.P. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17096-17102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein specificity of the GalNAc transferase ensures that this structure is confined to a limited number of glycoproteins bearing an appropriate recognition determinant. We have previously shown that TN-R is one of the glycoproteins in the cerebellum that bears N-linked sugars with terminal GalNAc-4-SO4. Furthermore, as with HNK-1, the appearance of the GalNAc-4-SO4 epitope in the cerebellum is regulated and confined to the molecular and Purkinje cell layers. We initially described terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 on the pituitary glycoprotein hormones lutropin (LH) and thyrotropin (TSH) (22Baenziger J.U. Green E.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 287-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). GalNAc-4-SO4 on glycoprotein lutropin hormone is essential for regulating its circulatory half-life, and in turn regulating ovum implantation (23Baenziger J.U. Kumar S. Brodbeck R.M. Smith P.L. Beranek M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Mi Y. Shapiro S.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We report here that TN-R is a major target for GalNAc-4-SO4 modification in the rat cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex, and that TN-R isoforms are differentially modified in the cerebellum during postnatal development and adulthood. Furthermore, modification of TN-R with GalNAc-4-SO4 versus HNK-1 is regulated differently during development. We have also determined that an established neuroblastoma cell line synthesizes TN-R that is modified with both GalNAc-4-SO4 and HNK-1. The highly regulated addition of different sulfated carbohydrate structures to TN-R may be important for recognition by carbohydrate-specific cell surface receptors and/or ECM molecules or for modulating adhesiveness or signaling potential of TN-R during normal CNS development and upon injury.

Gennarini G. Goridis C. Schachner M. Neuron. 1993; 10: 69-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell and Tissue Extracts—Developing and adult rat cerebellar, hippocampal, and cortical fractions were prepared as previously described (14Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells were prepared as follows. Media were harvested and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline, 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm PefaBloc SC, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Unbroken cells, nuclei, and Triton-insoluble proteins were removed by sedimentation. Cys-Fc Affinity Chromatography—Rat cerebellar fractions were affinity purified by incubation with Cys-Fc-agarose as previously described (14Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cell extracts or [35S]SO4-labeled SH-SY5Y cell extracts were incubated with Cys-Fc-agarose overnight at 4 °C in batch and unbound proteins were removed. Subsequently, the Cys-Fc-agarose was washed with Tris-buffered saline, plus 0.2% hydrogenated Triton X-100 and eluted with 500 μm GalNAc-4-SO4 in Tris-buffered saline, plus 0.2% hydrogenated Triton X-100. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Cys-Fc was immobilized on a BIAcore CM5 sensor surface as previously described (14Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The concentration of the GalNAc-4-SO4 bearing ligands present in SH-SY5Y media and cell extracts was determined as with the cerebellar extracts (14Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Western Blots, Ligand Blots, and Autoradiography—Samples were incubated in NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer with 0.05 m dithiothreitol, heated for 10 min at 70 °C, and separated on 7.0% Tris acetate acrylamide gels (Novex/Invitrogen). Proteins were visualized by autoradiography (below) or were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Following transfer, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were treated with 1% Casein prior to incubation with a polyclonal or monoclonal anti-TN-R antibody, anti-HNK-1 (Sigma), or Cys-Fc biotin in TBS (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl), containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 2–16 h at 4 °C. After removing excess primary reagent, the blots were incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz), goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (BIOSOURCE), goat anti-mouse IgM-horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Labs), or horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (Jackson Labs) for 1 h at 4 °C. Western and ligand blots were visualized using chemiluminescence as described by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gels containing [35S]SO4-labeled proteins were fixed in 40% methanol, 25% acetic acid for 30 min at room temperature, incubated in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min, dried, and exposed to film at -80 °C overnight to 1 week. Peptide Analysis—One-dimensional protein gel bands were visualized with colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250. The relevant bands were excised, using a Proteome Works Spot-cutter (Bio-Rad). The gel pieces were digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega). The recovered tryptic peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry on a Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Automated data acquisition and automated data base searching were performed with applied Biosystems Proteomics Solution 1 (PS1) software. Immunoprecipitations—Prior to immunoprecipitation with specific antisera, the soluble and peripheral membrane proteins from adult and developing rat cerebella or SH-SY5Y tissue culture media were diluted 1:2 in IP buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS), incubated with rabbit serum for 1 h at 4 °C, and then with protein A-Sepharose for an additional 1 h. The protein A-Sepharose was removed by sedimentation. pTN-R was added and the sample was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added for 1 h and washed extensively with IP buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by heating in lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer for 10 min at 70 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Immunohistochemistry and Immunocytochemistry—Rat and mouse brains were removed and 20-μm cryostat sections of hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum were prepared as described (14Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells were cultured (as described below) overnight on coverslips. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed in methanol at -20 °C for 6 min or 4% paraformaldehyde for 8 s. After fixation, coverslips were blocked with 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. After blocking, frozen brain sections and fixed cells were incubated with biotinylated Cys-Fc (10 ng/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Unbound fusion protein was removed prior to incubation with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Labs) and counterstaining with Hoechst number 33258 (Sigma). Tissue Culture—SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Ham’s F-12 and minimal essential Earle’s media with 15% fetal bovine serum and 1× non-essential amino acids. For [35S]SO4 labeling, 3 × 106 SH-SY5Y cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with minimal essential Earle’s media (without MgCl2, SO4, Cys, and Met) for 1 h at 37 °C. Media was removed and the cells were labeled in the above media supplemented with [35S]SO4 (ICN) at 100 μCi/ml for 6 h. Media and cells were collected for further analysis. Enzymatic Removal of N-Linked Oligosaccharides—For affinity purified [35S]SO4-labeled SH-SY5Y cell extracts, PNGase-F digests were carried out as previously described (14Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For labeled SH-SY5Y culture media, 2 ml of media was immunoprecipitated with pTN-R as described above, except after washes, immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured and removed from protein A-Sepharose by heating in 50 μl of 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% SDS for 10 min at 100 °C, sedimented, and the supernatant was collected. The Sepharose was resuspended in 50 μl of 50 mm NaH2PO4, sedimented, and the supernatant removed. The two supernatants were combined and half was treated with 1 unit of PNGase-F (New England Biolabs) and the other half incubated in buffer alone for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. TN-R Bears a Major Fraction of the GalNAc-4-SO4 Residues Present in Rat Cerebellum—We previously used a polyclonal goat antibody (anti-TN-R(SC) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) raised to a synthetic peptide included within the amino-terminal 50 amino acids of TN-R, to identify TN-R as one of the proteins from mouse and rat cerebellum that is bound by immobilized Cys-Fc because it is modified with terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 (Fig. 1C) (14Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the most abundant protein band bearing terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 (Fig. 1A) did not react with anti-TN-R(SC) and remained to be identified. This glycoprotein did react with anti-TN-R(BD) (Fig. 1B), a monoclonal raised to a tryptic peptide that included the entire NH2-terminal cysteine-rich region of TN-R, as well as with two other antibodies, pTN-R and monoclonal 596 (not shown), raised to other regions of TN-R (Fig. 1D). This suggested that the most abundant Cys-Fc reactive protein (Fig. 1A), which migrates more rapidly than the forms of TN-R previously identified using anti-TN-R(SC), is also a form of TN-R. This form of TN-R appears to correspond to TN-R 160, whereas the slower migrating band previously identified as TN-R 160 corresponds to TN-R 180 and the band previously identified as TN-R 180 corresponds to a form of TN-R 180 bearing additional carbohydrate that we have designated TN-R 180(g). The affinity purified, Cys-Fc reactive glycoprotein (Fig. 1A, arrow marked 160) that also reacted with anti-TN-R(BD) (Fig. 1B) but not with anti-TN-R(SC) (Fig. 1C) was examined by MALDI-TOF (Fig. 1F). The analysis confirmed that the glyco-protein was a form of TN-R. In contrast to the results obtained with anti-TN-R(SC), the relative intensities of the bands corresponding to TN-R were similar when probed with anti-TN-R(BD) and Cys-Fc (Fig. 1). The same pattern of staining was observed with pTN-R raised to immunopurified mouse TN-R 160 and with monoclonal antibody 596 raised to an HNK-1 positive fraction from chick brain that both react with rat TN-R (11Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The regions recognized by each of the TN-R-specific antibodies are indicated in Fig. 1D. Because the most abundant form of TN-R did not react with the anti-TN-R(SC), this suggested that in the adult rat cerebellum this TN-R isoform is missing a portion of its amino terminus including the 50-amino acid region containing the synthetic peptide used to generate anti-TN-R(SC). In support of this conclusion, no peptides corresponding to the amino-terminal region of TN-R were present in the MALDI-TOF analysis of the protein with the highest mobility (Fig. 1A, arrow marked 160 and Panel F), whereas a peptide corresponding to this region was present in analyses of the monomeric and multimeric forms of TN-R reactive with anti-TN-R(SC) (Fig. 1, arrows marked 180, d, and t and Ref. 14Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). The disulfide bonds resulting in covalent association of monomeric TN-R into dimeric and trimeric species are formed between cysteines located in the amino-terminal cysteine-rich region of TN-R (11Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The monomeric form of TN-R that does not react with the anti-TN-R(SC) is present following SDS-PAGE analysis in either the presence or absence of reducing agents (not shown). In contrast, monomeric forms of TN-R that are recognized by the amino terminus specific antibody are only observed following reduction. Our results suggest that monomeric forms of TN-R that do not contain the amino-terminal region arise by proteolytic cleavage of multimeric forms of TN-R and loss of covalent association through disulfide bonds (see Fig. 1E). To determine whether the forms of TN-R that do and do not contain the amino-terminal region correspond to the forms of TN-R that have previously been designated as TN-R 180 and TN-R 160 (11Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 25Pesheva P. Probstmeier R. Skubitz A.P. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Schachner M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2323-2333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TN-R 160 and TN-R 180 were purified from the brains of adult Wistar rats and NMRI mice by sequential immunoaffinity chromatography on monoclonal TN-R1 (clone 597) and TN-R2 (clone 596) antibody columns as previously described (11Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Following separation by SDS-PAGE the immunoaffinity purified TN-R 160/180 preparations were visualized by Western blotting with anti-TN-R(SC) and anti-TN-R monoclonal antibody 596 as shown in Fig. 2. As predicted, amino terminus-specific antibody TN-R(SC) recognized the doublet at 180 kDa (equivalent to 180 and 180g in Fig. 1) and TN-R dimers but did not recognize the 160-kDa band (Fig. 2). Previous studies based on PCR analyses indicated that TN-R 160 might arise by alternative mRNA splicing resulting in the loss of the sixth FN-III domain (10Fuss B. Wintergerst E.S. Bartsch U. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1237-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Whereas MALDI-TOF analysis of the band migrating at the position of TN-R 160 did not yield any peptide fragments from the amino-terminal region of TN-R, it did reveal the presence of two peptides fragments from the sixth FN-III repeat (Fig. 1F). Both fragments from the sixth FN-III repeat and a fragment from the amino-terminal region of TN-R were observed in the MALDI-TOF analysis of TN-R 180. Thus, TN-R 160 contains the sixth FN-III repeat but is missing a portion of its amino-terminal region. TN-R represents a major glycoprotein in the soluble and peripheral membrane protein fraction from rat cerebellum that is modified with terminal GalNAc-4-SO4. Whereas the majority of Cys-Fc reactive material is retained by Cys-Fc immobilized on agarose (Fig. 1A and Ref. 14Woodworth A. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50941-50947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) only a portion of TN-R is retained (Fig. 1B) indicating that not all cerebellar TN-R bears N-linked structures terminating with β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4. TN-R from Hippocampus and Cerebral Cortex Bears Oligosaccharides That Are Reactive with Cys-Fc—We have shown that the enzyme activities required for the addition of terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4 to N-linked oligosaccharides are present in extracts of rat brain cortex, midbrain, and cerebellum, as well as in human neuroblastoma cells, SH-SY5Y (21Dharmesh S.M. Skelton T.P. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17096-17102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase-1 mRNA is present in human cerebellum, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and pituitary (26Kang H.G. Evers M.R. Xia G. Baenziger J.U. Schachner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10861-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We used the Cys-Fc chimera to probe histologic sections of mouse brain for the presence of glycoproteins bearing terminal GalNAc-4-SO4. As was seen in the rat, the Purkinje cell and molecular layers of adult mouse cerebellum were intensely stained by the Cys-Fc chimera (Fig. 3B). No staining was observed when sections were incubated with biotinylated human IgG1 (not shown). The mouse hippocampus, like the cerebellum, was intensely stained with Cys-Fc (Fig. 3A), especially in regions rich in dendrites and extracellular matrix components such as CA1, CA2, CA3, and the dentate gyrus. In contrast, the granular layer was largely devoid of Cys-Fc reactive material. The cellular layers of the cerebral cortex, layers II-V (Fig. 3, C and D), were reactive with Cys-Fc. Perineuronal nets that form “rings” around neurons in the cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 3, A, C, and D, arrows) were also stained.

https://openalex.org/W2077688372,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase gamma (PTPgamma) is a member of the receptor-like family of tyrosine phosphatases and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene in kidney and lung cancers. Based on our previous findings, we hypothesize that PTPgamma is a potential estrogen-regulated tumor suppressor gene in human breast cancer. To examine the effects of PTPgamma on growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and compare the estrogenic responses of human breast cells with different PTPgamma expression levels, we established several stably transfected MCF-7 cell lines expressing different levels of PTPgamma, which were confirmed by RT-PCR and immunostaining. In our work, we used the antisense construct to breakdown endogenous PTPgamma level in MCF-7 cells. The results from doubling time assay suggested that PTPgamma is capable of inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth. We further demonstrated that PTPgamma is able to inhibit anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells in soft agar and reduce the estrogenic responses of MCF-7 cell proliferation to estradiol-17beta (E(2)) and zeranol (Z, a nonsteroidal growth promoter with estrogenic activity). Our data suggest that PTPgamma may function as an important modulator in regulating the process of tumorigenesis in human breast."

De novo synthesis of the apocytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase subunit I proteins was no longer detectable after 3 days of RNAi. The effect on protein synthesis correlated with a decline in the levels of the assembled mitochondrial respiratory complexes III and IV, and also cyanide-sensitive oxygen uptake. The steady-state levels of nuclear-encoded subunits of complexes III and IV were also significantly decreased. Because the levels of the corresponding mRNAs were not affected, the observed effect was likely due to an increased turnover of these imported mitochondrial proteins. This induced protein degradation was selective for components of complexes III and IV, because little effect was observed on components of the F1·F0-ATPase complex and on several other mitochondrial proteins.

Gene expression in the kinetoplast-mitochondrion of trypanosomatid protists involves a unique post-transcriptional mRNA maturation process, termed RNA editing, whereby U-residues are inserted to or deleted from a pre-edited transcript, and a translatable reading frame is thus created (1Alfonzo J.D.

Some transcripts, such as the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mRNA, do not require editing for translation. The mechanism of editing includes cleavage of RNA at specific editing sites, and the addition or deletion of a defined number of U-residues followed by religation (7Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L.

Because Cyb is translated from an edited mRNA, whereas COI is translated from a never-edited mRNA, this represents a useful system to investigate the effects of RNA editing on mitochondrial translation. In this paper, we have inhibited RNA editing in T. brucei by down-regulation of RET1 and have investigated the effects on mitochondrial translation and stability of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes. Cell Cultivation and RNAi—Procyclic cells of the T. brucei strain 29–13 were grown at 27 °C in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum albumin (20Brun R. Schonenberger M.

RNA Analysis—Total RNA from T. brucei was purified by the acid guanidium isothiocyanate method (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Poisoned primer extension was performed as described previously (34Estevez A.M. Thiemann O.H. Alfonzo J.D. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using the following mRNA-specific antisense oligonucleotides: 3807, 5′-CAACCTGACATTAAAAGAC-3′ (apocytochrome b, Cyb); 5785, 5′-TCTTGCATTCACGGTCCTCTAG-3′ (Rieske protein); 5865, 5′-CATTTGACTTATCGTTGCGGGCGTG-3′ (apocytochrome c1); 5866, 5′-CGCAGCTGTCATTCGCAGCCACCGTCTG-3′ (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4, trCOIV); 5904, 5′-ACGAGGCCGTTTGGCTTCTTGTGCGTTATGG-3′ (trypanosome alternative oxidase, TAO). For signal normalization, the calmodulin mRNA-specific primer (3813, 5′-GTTGATCGGCCATCGTAAATCAAGTGGATG-3′) was extended in the same reaction. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. Protein Sequencing—Mass spectrometric analysis of proteins was performed as described in detail earlier (10Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the protein spots of interest were digested with trypsin in situ, and the recovered peptides were purified using C18 ZipTip pipette tips (Millipore). Mass spectrometric measurements were performed on an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer, which is a tandem time-of-flight instrument with a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization ion source (35Bienvenut W.V. Deon C. Pasquarello C. Campbell J.M. Sanchez J.C. Vestal M.L. Hochstrasser D.F. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences were determined by manual interpretation of the tandem spectra. The inferred sequences were searched by using Protein Prospector against the NCBI data base, as well as the parasite genome databases. 2Protein Prospector is available on the Internet at prospector.ucsf.edu, and the parasite genome database is available at www.genedb.org. Measurement of Respiration Rate—Oxygen uptake by T. brucei cells was measured with a biological oxygen monitor YSI 5300 equipped with the YSI 5331 oxygen probe. The rate (expressed as μmol of O2 consumed per cell per minute) was calculated by assuming the oxygen content of air-saturated water is 0.276 mm at 28 °C (according to the YSI 5300 manual). KCN was used at 0.1 mm, and salicylhydroxamic acid was used at 0.03 mm. The cell concentration was 10–20 × 106/ml. Mitochondrial Cyb and COI Proteins Can Be Labeled by Incubation of Intact Cells with [35S]Methionine plus Cysteine in the Presence of Cycloheximide—It was shown previously that two of the maxicircle DNA-encoded proteins from L. tarentolae mitochondria are detectable by two-dimensional SDS gel electrophoresis as spots with a characteristic position off the main diagonal due to the extremely high hydrophobicity of these proteins (18Horváth A. Berry E.A. Maslov D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1639-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Horváth A. Kingan T.G. Maslov D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A similar separation was seen using T. brucei mitochondria (Fig. 1A). The peptide, FAFYCER, was obtained by tryptic digestion of the spot labeled “Cyb”; this sequence matched positions 206–212 of the T. brucei apocytochrome b polypeptide sequence (36Benne R. DeVries B. Van den Burg J. Klaver B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 6925-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), confirming that this spot represented monomeric Cyb, as is the case in L. tarentolae. This peptide was also detected from a digest of the spot labeled “Cyb/tub”; however, a peptide from α-tubulin was detected in addition to several unidentified peptides, indicating that this represented aggregated material which included Cyb (18Horváth A. Berry E.A. Maslov D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1639-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The COI polypeptide from an L. tarentolae mitochondrial extract migrated as a discrete stained spot off the diagonal, close to the monomeric Cyb polypeptide; however, in T. brucei mitochondrial extract, the COI spot was not visible. The faint stained spots labeled a and b in Fig. 1A did not contain COI-derived peptides, but rather represented contamination with several non-mitochondrial T. brucei proteins (data not shown). This is not unexpected, because the COI polypeptide from L. tarentolae was found previously to be refractory to trypsin digestion, 3A. Horváth and D. A. Maslov, unpublished observations. and a similar property is anticipated for the T. brucei protein. Both COI and Cyb could, however, be detected by incubation of intact cells for two hours with [35S]methionine + cysteine in the presence of cycloheximide and followed by electrophoresis in a 9.5%/14% two-dimensional denaturing gel (Fig. 1B). The labeled spot “Cyb” in Fig. 1B corresponded to the stained Cyb spot in Fig. 1A, and the spot “COI” migrated in the same relative position as the COI spot in L. tarentolae. The identity of the Cyb and COI spots were further substantiated by showing sensitivity of the in vivo incorporation of labeled amino acids to puromycin (Fig. 2) and insensitivity to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, hygromycin B, as was previously found in organello mitochondrial protein synthesis in L. tarentolae (22Horváth A. Nebohácová M. Lukeš J. Maslov D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7222-7230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This method for in vivo labeling and detection of the mitochondrial Cyb and COI proteins represents a valuable tool to study mitochondrial protein synthesis in these cells. Mitochondrial Biosynthesis of COI and Cyb Proteins Decreases during RET1 Silencing—It was shown previously that the RET1 TUTase is essential for viability of procyclic T. brucei (16Aphasizhev R. Sbicego S. Peris M. Jang S.H. Aphasizheva I. Simpson A.M. Rivlin A. Simpson L. Cell. 2002; 108: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of expression of RET1 by conditional RNAi affected editing of maxicircle-derived mRNAs (16Aphasizhev R. Sbicego S. Peris M. Jang S.H. Aphasizheva I. Simpson A.M. Rivlin A. Simpson L. Cell. 2002; 108: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) by affecting the length of the guide RNA 3′ oligo-U tails (37Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Simpson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10617-10622Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It follows that RET1 RNAi should also affect synthesis of proteins such as Cyb, where the mRNAs require editing to be translatable. We examined this possibility by assaying the in vivo labeling of Cyb at different times after induction of RNAi with tetracycline. In vivo labeling of the COI protein, which is translated from a never-edited mRNA, was also followed. Aliquots of the culture, the growth of which is shown in Fig. 3A, were withdrawn on days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 after induction, and the cells were labeled for two hours with 35S-amino acids in the presence of cycloheximide, followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to visualize the labeled Cyb and COI spots (Fig. 3B). The synthesis of Cyb was reduced by day 2 and was not detectable at day 3 after RNAi induction. Surprisingly, the synthesis of COI also decreased by approximately the same extent. The extent of decrease in synthesis of Cyb and COI by day 3 in several independent RET1-silencing experiments varied from 70–100%. No effect was observed by treating the parental 29–13 cells with the same concentration of tetracycline (not shown). The Levels of Several Nuclear-encoded Subunits of Respiratory Complexes III and IV Also Decrease upon RET1 Silencing—Mitochondrial fractions were isolated on days 0, 3, 5 and 7 after RET1 RNAi induction and the relative abundances of several mitochondrial proteins were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 4). The uppermost control panel shows the expected decrease in the RET1 protein by day 3. Mitochondrial matrix proteins, the RNA-binding protein, gBP21 (originally p28) (9Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Simpson L. RNA. 2003; 9: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and hsp60 (32Bringaud F. Peyruchaud S. Baltz D. Giroud C. Simpson L. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the inner membrane-localized alternative oxidase (TAO; Refs. 31Chaudhuri M. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 38Chaudhuri M. Ajayi W. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) showed little change until day 7, by which time RET1-silenced cells usually display abnormal morphology (16Aphasizhev R. Sbicego S. Peris M. Jang S.H. Aphasizheva I. Simpson A.M. Rivlin A. Simpson L. Cell. 2002; 108: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The nuclear-encoded trCOIV and trCOXI subunits of respiratory complex IV showed a dramatic decrease in abundance by day 3 and were undetectable by day 5. Two nuclear-encoded components of respiratory complex III, the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1, showed similar decreases in steady-state abundance. On the other hand, subunits β, b (originally p18; Ref. 29Bringaud F. Peris M. Zen K.H. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and S9 of F1·F0-ATPase remained stable or even slightly increased in relative abundance. The Assembly of Respiratory Complexes III and IV, but Not Complex V, Is Affected by RET1 Silencing—The effect of RET1 silencing on the assembly of the respiratory complexes was analyzed by the Blue Native/Tricine-SDS two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method which was used previously to identify respiratory complexes in L. tarentolae, T. brucei, and Leishmania amazonensis (27Maslov D.A. Zikova A. Kyselova I. Lukes J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 125: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The use of a 6% gel in the first dimension (Fig. 5A) allowed a well defined separation of complexes IV and III. However, a gradient gel (3–13%; Fig. 5B) allowed for a substantially better separation of monomeric and oligomeric forms of the F1·F0-ATPase complex V. We performed the silencing analysis with both gel systems, but only the gradient gels are presented in Fig. 5B. The relative abundances of complexes III, IV, and the oligomeric forms of complex V decreased strongly during the RET1 silencing and were undetectable at day 5. Only the monomeric form of complex V (Fig. 5, B–E,V′) remained relatively unaffected during the silencing. The decrease of several specific subunits of complex III and complex IV by day 3 of silencing is shown in the Western blots in Fig. 5, C–E. Interestingly, there was no accumulation of proteins migrating at positions of partially assembled or degraded complexes, suggesting that degradation of the complexes caused by the silencing of RET1 must be rapid and complete (not shown). Western analysis of the ATPase complex V in Fig. 5E confirms that this complex contains the F0 as well as the F1 moiety of the ATPase complex, and shows that the abundance of the oligomeric forms is reduced, whereas the abundance of the monomeric form is increased, as was observed in the stained gels in Fig. 5B. RET1 Silencing Has No Effect on Nuclear-encoded mRNAs for Respiratory Complex Subunits—Down-regulation of RET1 expression was shown previously to inhibit RNA editing but to have no effect on transcription or turn-over of mitochondrialencoded mRNAs for either edited or never-edited genes (16Aphasizhev R. Sbicego S. Peris M. Jang S.H. Aphasizheva I. Simpson A.M. Rivlin A. Simpson L. Cell. 2002; 108: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because we have observed a decrease in the abundance of nuclear-encoded subunits of respiratory complexes III and IV, we investigated whether this was caused by a decrease in the corresponding mRNAs or an increased turn-over of the proteins. Total cell RNA from RET1-silenced cells was isolated at days 0, 1, 3, and 5 after RNAi induction, and the relative abundances of several specific mRNAs were analyzed by using a primer extension assay (Fig. 6). Calmodulin mRNA, which encodes a non-mitochondrial protein, and TAO mRNA, which encodes a cytosolic-synthesized mitochondrial protein not present in respiratory complexes III and IV, were used for internal normalization of the assays. The steady-state levels of Rieske, cytochrome c1, and trCOIV mRNAs remained essentially unaffected by silencing of RET1 (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the decrease in abundance of the nuclear-encoded subunits of complexes III and IV is due to increased turn-over, probably as a result of an effect on assembly or stability of these complexes caused by the decrease in the mitochondrial-encoded subunits. Changes in Cyanide-sensitive Respiration of RET1-silenced Cells—Two modes of oxygen consumption are observed in procyclic T. brucei: cyanide-sensitive respiration mediated by respiratory complex IV and salicylhydroxamic acid-sensitive/cyanide-insensitive respiration mediated by trypanosome alternate oxidase (reviewed in Ref. 39Tielens A.G.M. Van Hellemond J.J. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 14: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of RET1 silencing on these two modes of respiration. Control cells showed an oxygen uptake rate of 4.7 ± 2.6 × 10-10 μmol/cell/min, of which ∼80% represents cyanide-sensitive respiration. By day 3 of RET1 silencing, the rate of oxygen consumption decreased to ∼50% of the control level, mainly as a result of a selective decrease in cyanide-sensitive respiration (Fig. 7). Oxygen uptake by the alternative oxidase pathway was not affected. These results are consistent with the above data on the effect of down-regulation of RET1 expression on the assembly or stability of respiratory complexes and the lack of effect on the level of the alternative oxidase. The results in this paper have shed some light on the interactions of editing and translation in the kinetoplast-mitochondrion of trypanosomatid protozoa. Conditional down-regulation of RET1 expression in procyclic T. brucei by RNAi was shown previously to be lethal (16Aphasizhev R. Sbicego S. Peris M. Jang S.H. Aphasizheva I. Simpson A.M. Rivlin A. Simpson L. Cell. 2002; 108: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The role of RET1 was shown to involve the addition of untemplated U's to the 3′ ends of guide RNAs, thereby creating a 3′ oligo-U tail, which is apparently required for editing (37Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Simpson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10617-10622Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have presented evidence that the effect on viability is due, at least in part, to an effect on the assembly or stability of the cytochrome bc1 complex (respiratory complex III) and the cytochrome c oxidase complex (respiratory complex IV), both of which contain some subunits translated from edited mRNAs. Similar results were obtained with conditional down-regulation of RET2 synthesis (data not shown). A rapid inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis of the Cyb protein, which is encoded by an edited mRNA, was demonstrated by development of a method to pulse-label newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins in intact T. brucei cells. This result provides additional evidence that edited mRNAs are translated and that the translated proteins are required for mitochondrial function. A rapid decrease in the steady-state abundance of several nuclear-encoded subunits of these respiratory complexes was also observed. Because there was no effect on the steady-state levels of the mRNAs, the observed decreases in abundance were probably due to increased turnover of the proteins. We realize that down-regulation of expression of RET1 by RNAi is not the best experimental method to obtain data on protein turnover, because of uncertainties involving the stability of the mRNA and the protein itself both free and incorporated in the pre-existing complex. We attempted to measure in vivo turnover of Rieske and COIV directly by a pulse-chase experiment using specific antisera, but this was unsuccessful for technical reasons. There is, however, sufficient precedent in other systems for the rapid degradation of mitochondrial proteins not incorporated into a respiratory complex. In yeast with defective mitochondrial protein synthesis, nuclear-encoded subunits of respiratory complexes III and IV continue to be synthesized and imported into the mitochondrion, but assembly of the complexes is impaired (40Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). In addition, a specific nuclear mutation (PET309) affecting the synthesis of Cox1p in yeast resulted in an increased proteolytic degradation of other mitochondrial and nuclear subunits (41Glerum D.M. Muroff I. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19088-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 42Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); interference with binding of mRNA-specific activators (43Grivell L.A. Artal-Sanz M. Hakkaart G. de Jong L.

Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1130-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) prevented membrane tethering of these mRNAs and induced increased turn-over of the newly synthesized polypeptides (45de Jong L. Elzinga S.D. McCammon M.T. Grivell L.A. van der Spek H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells in which mitochondrial protein synthesis was blocked by ethidium bromide, the synthesis of nuclear-encoded subunits of complexes I, III, and IV was not affected, but the proteins were rapidly degraded (46Hayashi J.-I. Tanaka M. Sato W. Ozawa T. Yonekawa H. Kagawa Y. Ohta S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 47Sanchirico M.E. Fox T.D. Mason T.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5796-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that in the case of RET1-down-regulated T. brucei, the absence of the newly synthesized mitochondrial subunits of complexes III and IV is responsible for the breakdown of the respiratory complexes and the subsequent rapid turn-over of imported nuclear-encoded subunits. The mechanism by which the silencing of RET1 results in a decreased level of the de novo synthesized mitochondrial polypeptides still needs to be elucidated. The Cyb protein is translated from a5′ edited maxicircle-encoded mRNA; therefore, mitochondrial translation of Cyb would be directly affected because of the effect on RNA editing. The COI protein, however, is translated from a never-edited maxicircle-encoded mRNA, the level of which is unaffected by RET1 silencing. This suggests that the observed effect may be due to an increased turnover of newly synthesized translation products. Little is known at present about these aspects of mitochondrial gene expression in trypanosomes. Interestingly, RET1 silencing had no effect on the abundance of the nuclear-encoded subunits of F1 nor of at least one nuclear-encoded component of F0. Nor was there any effect on several other mitochondrial proteins, including the alternative oxidase, a heat shock protein, and an RNA-binding protein possibly involved in RNA editing. This is consistent with results in other systems which showed that the ATPase complex is the least sensitive to the inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis as compared with other respiratory complexes (46Hayashi J.-I. Tanaka M. Sato W. Ozawa T. Yonekawa H. Kagawa Y. Ohta S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It was, however, somewhat surprising that assembly of F1·F0-ATPase in T. brucei was apparently unaffected by the inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis by edited mRNAs, because a pan-edited maxicircle gene was thought to represent a homologue of subunit 6 of F1·F0-ATPase (48Bhat G.J.

Cell. 1992; 70: 459-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence for the A6 protein actually being a functional subunit of F0 in T. brucei is lacking, and a resolution of this problem awaits further investigation.

Unlike in contraceptive activity, where the glycans on the molecule have been shown to play a crucial role, mutagenesis of the asparagines at sites of N-linked glycosylation (Asn28 and Asn63) to glutamine shows that the apoptogenic activity of glycodelin A is executed by the protein backbone. Glycosylation at Asn28 appears to play a role in the extracellular secretion of the molecule, as mutation of Asn28 resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of secreted protein, and loss of both glycosylation sites reduced the secretion drastically.

However, attempts to deglycosylate GdA and GdS under native conditions using enzymes were not successful. Therefore, we resorted to molecular biology approaches to mutate the glycosylation sites and to express the protein in a eukaryotic system. The functional analysis of protein thus expressed proves that the apoptogenic activity of the molecule resides in its protein backbone, with the oligosaccharides being either permissive or non-permissive in the manifestation of this observed property. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that glycosylation at Asn28 plays a role in the secretory rate of the protein, as the mutagenesis of the same drastically reduces protein secretion. We also have evidence to suggest that lack of glycosylation does not compromise the dimerization state of the molecule. Cells and Cell Lines—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood collected from healthy volunteers (male and female, 25–49 years old) using HISTOPAQUE-1077 (Sigma) according to the protocol described by Boyum (5Boyum A. Nature. 1964; 204: 793-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Sf21 cells (Spodoptera frugiperda; Invitrogen) were maintained in TC-100 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) and 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate at 27 °C. Cell cultures were maintained as monolayers and passaged once every 5 days. The human Jurkat (JR4) T cell line was procured from the Cancer Research Institute (Mumbai, India). It was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator and passaged twice/week. Cloning the Glycodelin cDNA into the Baculoviral System—The Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) was used to clone the glycodelin cDNA. In brief, the full-length glycodelin cDNA with the secretory signal, obtained from the uterine endometrium (26Mukhopadhyay D. SundarRaj S. Alok A. Karande A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8577-8584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), was cloned between BamHI and PstI into the shuttle vector pFASTBAC1 within the mini-Tn7 element. This vector was transformed into Escherichia coli DH10BAC cells, which harbor the bacmid (baculoviral genome)-carrying kanamycin resistance marker and an attachment site for the bacterial transposon Tn7 (mini-attTn7). The recombinant glycodelin bacmids thus obtained were screened by blue/white selection. Positive white clones were picked up and confirmed by PCR using a gene-specific forward primer and a bacmid-specific reverse primer (see Table I). The recombinant bacmid was isolated and transfected into the insect cell line Sf21 using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided with the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. The recombinant virus-containing medium was harvested at the end of 72 h. The virus was amplified further; its multiplicity of infection was determined, and it was stored at 4 or –70 °C.Table IList of primers used for generation and conformation of glycosylation mutantsSequenceFor N28Q mutantSense primer5′-GACCAACCAGATCTCCCTCATG-3′Antisense primer5′-CATGAGGGAGATCTGGTTGGTC-3′For N63Q mutantSense primer5′-GATGGGAGCAAAACAGTTGTGTTG-3′Antisense primer5′-CAACACAACTGTTTTGCTCCCATC-3′Bacmid-specific primersSense primer5′-GTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′Antisense primer5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3′Primers for PCR confirmation of bacmidsSense primer5′-GCGGATCCGAATTCATGCTGTGCCTCCTGCTC-3′Antisense primer5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3′ Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis of Asn28 and Asn63 (N28Q, N63Q, and N28Q,N63Q) in Glycodelin cDNA—The QuikChange method (Stratagene) followed by DpnI digestion was employed to make the glycosylation mutants. Briefly, sense-antisense primers (see Table I) carrying the site-specific mutation with an incorporated silent mutation for a unique restriction site were used. The primers for N28Q carried a BglII site, whereas the primers for N63Q abolished the pre-existing PvuII site in the DNA sequence. The pFASTBAC1-WT Gd vector was used as the template for the creation of single mutants. The pFASTBAC1-N28Q,N63Q vector was created by releasing the glycodelin cDNA from both single mutants (N28Q and N63Q) using BamHI and PstI. The released fragments were purified and subjected to digestion by AvaI, which digests the glycodelin cDNA between the mutated asparagines (N28Q and N63Q). To obtain the double mutant, the smaller 213-bp fragment carrying the N28Q mutation from the N28Q single mutant and the large 351-bp fragment carrying the N63Q mutation from the N63Q single mutant were swapped and religated to the BamHI&PstI-double-digested pFASTBAC1 vector using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs Inc.). Clones were screened by the unique restriction sites incorporated into them as well as by sequencing. The recombinant pFASTBAC1 clones were transformed in E. coli DH10BAC cells. The recombinant bacmids were purified, confirmed by PCR, and transfected into Sf21 cells using LipofectAMINE as described above. All restriction enzymes used were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Expression and Purification of the Baculovirus-expressed WT and Mutant Proteins of Glycodelin (Gd-Bac)—Because of the presence of the mammalian secretory signal, Gd-Bac was secreted into the culture medium. It was purified by passing the culture supernatant through a glycodelin-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) D9D4 immunoaffinity column. 2D. Mukhopadhyay, P. Gangatirkar, and A. A. Karande, unpublished data. The column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm NaCl), and the bound protein was eluted with 100 mm glycine HCl (pH 2.5). The fractions collected were immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris (pH 8.0), and protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon concentrator (Vivascience). The concentrate was dialyzed overnight against PBS and sterilized through a 0.45-μm membrane filter (Sartorius), and the protein concentration was estimated by the Lowry method as described (6Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide N-Glycosidase F Digestion—Treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F was carried out according to the previously described procedure (7Seppo A. Tienmeyer M. Cells: A Laboratory Manual.Vol. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 33.5-33.7Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein solution (2 mg/ml) in PBS containing 1% SDS and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol was boiled for 2 min. Nonidet P-40 was then added so that the ratio of SDS to Nonidet P-40 was 1:7 in the final reaction. The enzyme (0.5 milliunits/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. To prepare the sample for SDS-PAGE, the samples were precipitated with equal volumes of 50% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm sodium deoxycholate, boiled with SDS sample buffer, and electrophoresed on 12.5% polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with glycodelin-specific mAb B1C2 (8Karri S. Mukhopadhyay D. Jing L. Karande A.A. Histochem. J. 2000; 32: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography Analysis of Recombinant Glycodelin—WT Gd-Bac was assessed for its oligomerization status by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 prepacked column attached to ΔKTA design systems (Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein (50 μg/200 μl) was chromatographed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the eluant protein peaks were monitored at 280 nm. Bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and chymotrypsin (Amersham Biosciences) with known Stokes radii were used as standards. Quantitation of Secreted Glycodelin by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The insect cells were seeded at a density of 20× 106 cells/10 ml of culture medium and infected with the recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. At the end of 96 h, the cells were spun down, and the culture supernatants were assayed for the concentration of glycodelin by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 100 μl of a solution of glycodelin expressed in E. coli 2D. Mukhopadhyay, P. Gangatirkar, and A. A. Karande, unpublished data. at 10 μg/ml of PBS was coated in the wells of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate, and unoccupied sites were blocked with radioimmunoassay buffer (0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS). Varying dilutions of the Sf21 culture supernatant or standard GdA were then incubated with appropriately diluted glycodelin-specific mAb D9D4 (dilution of the antibodies exhibiting 80% of maximum binding). The binding of the mAb to immobilized antigen was determined by subsequent incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin, followed by incubation with the substrate tetramethylbenzidine (Bangalore Genie). The concentration of the Gd-Bac protein was determined from the standard graph plotted using GdA. Cell Proliferation Assays—Jurkat JR4 cells (0.1 × 106) in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS were cultured with varying concentrations of Gd-Bac for 24 h in Nunc 96-well plates along with the appropriate controls. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (5 × 104 cpm; Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology, Mumbai) was added after a 24-h incubation of the cells and incubated for an additional 12 h. The cells were harvested and lysed on Whatman glass-fiber GF/C filters using a Nunc cell harvester. The filters were dried, and the [3H]thymidine incorporated was measured in a Wallac scintillation counter. All treatments were carried out in triplicates. In a 96-well culture plate, PBMCs seeded at a density of 0.2 ×106 cells/200 μl of culture medium were activated with either phytohemagglutinin at 5 μg/ml or anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3) hybridoma supernatant at 1:1600 dilution. The cells were cultured with varying concentrations of Gd-Bac for 36 h, after which [3H]thymidine (5 × 104 cpm) was added and incubated for an additional 12 h. The cell-incorporated radioactivity was measured as described above. All treatments were carried out in triplicates with the appropriate controls. Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide Staining—Jurkat cells (1× 106) were cultured with 1 μg of either GdA or WT Gd-Bac for 16 h in 500 μl of 10% FBS containing RPMI 1640 medium and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested, centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in 25 μl of medium along with 1 μl of a dye mixture of acridine orange and ethidium bromide (100 μg/ml each in PBS). The cells were observed immediately under a Carl Zeiss fluorescence microscope using a blue filter. GdA served as the positive control, and untreated cells served as the negative control. Fluorescence-activated Cell Scan Analysis of Gd-Bac-treated Jurkat Cells—Jurkat JR4 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 in 500 μl of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated for 12 h with 25 nm Gd-Bac and the appropriate controls. The cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed in 70% alcohol for 1 h. After a wash with radioimmunoassay buffer, the cells were resuspended in 250 μl of ethidium bromide staining solution (50 μg/ml EtBr, 100 μm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml RNase in PBS) for 1 h at 45 °C and analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACScan with blue light. Isolation of Recombinant Baculoviruses Carrying the WT and Site-directed Mutants of the Glycodelin Gene—The presence of WT glycodelin cDNA in the bacmids was confirmed by PCR using a glycodelin gene-specific forward primer and a bacmid-specific reverse primer (Table I), and the clone was confirmed by the specific PCR product of ∼1000 bp (Figs. 1 and 2F). Restriction digestion of the pFASTBAC1-N28Q clone with Bg-lII revealed the presence of a 1163-bp insert in addition to the pre-existing 470-bp insert (Fig. 2A), confirming the presence of the primer-incorporated N28Q mutation. Digestion of the pFASTBAC1-N63Q clone with PvuII and HindIII failed to release an insert of 300 bp due to the loss of a pre-existing PvuII site (Fig. 2B), confirming the incorporation of the mutation. Fig. 2C shows the products of AvaI digestion of N28Q and N63Q glycodelin cDNAs, which were later used in the construction of the double mutant. The double mutant clone was confirmed using the restriction enzymes as mentioned for confirming both single mutants (Fig. 2, D and E). In addition, the pFASTBAC1 clones were further confirmed by sequencing the glycodelin cDNA. The recombinant bacmids of the mutants were confirmed as described for the WT bacmid by PCR using the same primers (Fig. 2F). The WT and mutant recombinant viruses were rescued from the corresponding bacmid DNA by transfection into Sf21 cells. The generated viruses were amplified and titrated.Fig. 2Confirmation of pFASTBAC1-N28Q, pFASTBAC1-N63Q, and pFASTBAC1-N28Q,N63Q clones by restriction digestion.A, pFASTBAC1-N28Q clones digested with BglII.

F, PCR confirmation of the bacmid clones. PCR was performed with the bacmid-specific sense and antisense primers. The presence of the ∼2500-bp band corresponds to the recombinant bacmid, and the 300-bp band indicates the non-recombinant bacmid.

The apparent molecular mass of native GdA is ∼28 kDa. It is well known that, in insect cell lines, differential glycosylation occurs, which results in expressed recombinant protein with multiple molecular species (9Hooker A.D. Green N.H. Baines A.J. Bull A.T. Jenkins N. Strange P.G. James D.C. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 63: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). WT Gd-Bac separated as four distinct molecular species, with maximum expression of the protein species corresponding to 26 kDa and the fastest moving species corresponding to 18 kDa (Fig. 3, A and B). The molecular mass of the predominant species in both recombinant N28Q Gd-Bac and N63Q Gd-Bac was 24 kDa. The double mutant protein separated as a doublet, with the upper band corresponding to 21 kDa and the lower band corresponding to 18 kDa (Fig. 3, A and B). The gel filtration chromatography analysis of WT Gd-Bac showed that it exists only as a dimer of ∼45 kDa (Fig. 1D). Peptide N-glycosidase F digestion of WT Gd-Bac showed the convergence of the multiple bands into a doublet (Fig. 1C). The upper band could be that of the peptide N-glycosidase F-resistant form due to the presence of proximal α1,3-fucose linkages (10Morais V.A. Serpa J. Palma A.S. Costa T. Maranga L. Costa J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The lower band in the double mutant could be due to degradation of the molecule. Gd-Bac Protein Secretion Is Dependent on Glycosylation— Mutation of the Asn28 glycosylation site resulted in almost 50% reduction of protein secretion by the cells compared with the WT protein (Table II). Loss of both Asn28 and Asn63 resulted in almost 80% reduction of protein secretion, as shown in the Table II. These results suggest that glycosylation at Asn28 is important for the proper folding and transport of the molecule. As there was a further decrease in protein secretion in the case of the double mutant, it can be concluded that both glycosylations are necessary for efficient secretion of the molecule by the insect cells. Interestingly, mutation of Asn63 to glutamine did not affect the secretion of the protein (Table II), which underlines the importance of Asn28 over Asn63 in proper folding and secretion of the protein.Table IIAmount of Gd-Bac secreted per liter of culture supernatant as determined by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGd-BacConcentrationmg/literWT5-6N28Q2-3N63Q5-6N28Q,N63Q<1 Open table in a new tab WT Gd-Bac and the Glycosylation Mutants Are Apoptotically Active—To investigate the immunosuppressive activity of the recombinant protein, PBMC proliferation assay was carried out. As shown in Fig. 4A (panels a and b), WT Gd-Bac inhibited phytohemagglutininas well as anti-CD3 mAb-induced proliferation of human peripheral T cells in a dose-dependent manner, comparable with that seen with GdA. The 50% inhibition (IC50) of proliferation was brought about by 120 nm WT Gd-Bac. Gd-Bac inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat JR4 cells as well (Fig. 4A, panel c). Inhibition of proliferation was found to be comparable with that exhibited by GdA, with the IC50 for WT Gd-Bac being 40–50 nm and that for GdA being 30–40 nm. This shows that the recombinant glycodelin expressed in the baculoviral system is biologically active. Having confirmed that the recombinant glycodelin expressed in baculoviral system is active, the glycosylation mutants N28Q Gd-Bac, N63Q Gd-Bac, and N28Q,N63Q Gd-Bac were assayed for immunosuppressive activity. Mutants N28Q, N63Q, and N28Q,N63Q were also found to be inhibitory for Jurkat JR4 cell proliferation, as shown in Fig. 5. The molar protein concentrations that exhibited 50% inhibition (IC50) were ∼30–45 nm for N28Q, N63Q, and N28Q,N63Q. Jurkat cells cultured with either WT Gd-Bac or the glycosylation mutant proteins were stained with propidium iodide and subjected to FACScan analysis. The apoptotic population was identified by the pre-G0/G1 peak. Treatment with the recombinant proteins increased the apoptotic population to ∼28% compared with 6% as seen with the control (Fig. 6). Morphological observation of apoptosis was carried out by dual staining of the cells with EtBr and acridine orange after culturing the cells with recombinant WT Gd-Bac for 16 h. As shown in Fig. 4B, Jurkat cells underwent chromatin condensation with WT Gd-Bac, which is very characteristic of apoptosis seen with GdA as shown in the positive control panel. GdA and GdS are products of the same gene and are secreted by the glandular epithelia of the endometrium (11Julkunen M. Koistinen R. Sjoberg J. Rutanen E.M. Wahlstrom T. Seppala M. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and the seminal vesicles (12Julkunen M. Wahlstrom T. Seppala M. Koistinen R. Koskimies A. Stenman U.H. Bohn H. Arch. Androl. 1984; 12: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), respectively. Although both are glycosylated at the same two asparagines (Asn28 and Asn63), their glycan structures are distinctly different (13Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R.

Several functions have been ascribed to GdA, one of which, the contraceptive activity (not shared by GdS), has been reported to be associated with its glycosyl groups (13Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Oehninger S. Patankar M.S. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32159-32167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Another function of GdA well documented in the literature is immunosuppression (3Bolton A.E. Pockley A.G. Clough K.J. Mowles E.A. Stoker R.J. Westwood O.M. Chapman M.G. Lancet. 1987; 1: 593-595Abstract PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and induction of apoptosis in T cells (4Mukhopadhyay D. Sundereshan S. Rao C. Karande A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28268-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated clearly that GdS lacks apoptotic activity as well (26Mukhopadhyay D. SundarRaj S. Alok A. Karande A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8577-8584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It was therefore logical to determine whether the glycans on GdA also dictate its immunosuppressive characteristics. Enzymatic deglycosylation of GdA using peptide N-glycosidase F under native conditions failed (26Mukhopadhyay D. SundarRaj S. Alok A. Karande A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8577-8584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); therefore, we resorted to recombinant DNA technology to address this question. The glycodelin cDNA was cloned into the baculoviral system and expressed in Sf21 insect cells, and the secreted protein was purified (Fig. 1B). The recombinant protein was found to harbor anti-proliferative activity in PBMCs (Fig. 4A, panels a and b) and Jurkat JR4 cells (panel c). It also exhibited apoptotic activity (Fig. 4B), as has been reported previously in the case of GdA (4Mukhopadhyay D. Sundereshan S. Rao C. Karande A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28268-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). With an active WT protein in hand, we went ahead to determine the relevance of either or both of the N-linked glycosylations of glycodelin. Asn28 and Asn63 were mutated to glutamine to abolish glycosylation, and glutamine was chosen to minimize the alteration of the native conformation. The mutant proteins thus expressed and purified were tested for anti-proliferative activity. Interestingly, all the mutant proteins exhibited activity comparable with that of WT Gd-Bac and the native protein, showing clearly that the immunosuppressive activity of glycodelin resides in the protein backbone. It has been shown previously in the case of α1-microglobulin, another member of the lipocalin superfamily, that the unglycosylated form of the recombinant protein retains biological activity (15Wester L. Fast J. Labuda T. Cedervall T. Wingardh K. Olofsson T. Akerstrom B. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). If the anti-proliferative activity of GdA is dictated by its primary structure, then the obvious question is why GdS is not active despite an identical amino acid sequence. A logical conclusion could be that the glycans present on GdA allow exposure of the apoptogenic region for binding to the target cells. High fucosylation and no sialylation (13Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Oehninger S. Patankar M.S. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32159-32167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) on GdS perhaps keep this region inaccessible. This hypothesis is supported by our observations that full-length glycodelin expressed in P. pastoris is inactive where there is a high level of glycosylation and a lack of sialylation (16Chotigeat W. Chayanunnukul W. Phongdara A. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 81: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26Mukhopadhyay D. SundarRaj S. Alok A. Karande A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8577-8584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The glycans also appear to play no role in the dimerization of the molecule, as demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography study. The absence of a peak at the region corresponding to the monomeric molecular mass of 18 kDa shows that even the unglycosylated species in WT Gd-Bac underwent dimerization (Fig. 1D). The fact that glutathione S-transferase-tagged glycodelin expressed in E. coli is apoptotically inactive 3R. Jayachandran and A. A. Karande, unpublished data. highlights the necessity of an endoplasmic reticular transit for proper folding and disulfide bond formation. Our data also show that full-length glycodelin expressed in P. pastoris and in the human embryonic kidney cell line is inactive2 and, importantly, that the baculovirus-expressed glycodelin is active. This suggests that a certain type of glycosylation can allow the glycodelin molecule to execute its apoptogenic activity, whereas other types of glycosylation hinder the apoptogenic activity perhaps by covering the apoptogenic region. The fact that GdA is apoptotically active and GdS is apoptotically inactive needs to be discussed in this light. It could be that the presence of a large number of negatively charged sialic acid residues at Asn28 and Asn63 of the GdA molecule might result in charge repulsion between each other, thereby exposing the apoptogenic region, whereas the absence of the same in GdS can result in the oligosaccharide chains keeping the apoptogenic region inaccessible. The difference in the hydrodynamic volume between GdA and GdS due to the presence and absence of sialic acid residues has been demonstrated (26Mukhopadhyay D. SundarRaj S. Alok A. Karande A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8577-8584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). But, in the case of Sf21 cell-expressed glycodelin, the extent of glycosylation may be not large enough to form a protuberant structure to bring about masking of the apoptogenic region. It is well known that glycans play a very important role in maintaining the stability, conformation, and biological activity of glycoproteins (17Goldwasser E. Kung C.K. Eliason J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4202-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wittwer A.J. Howard S.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4175-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides are essential recognition sequences in cell-mediated adhesions in inflammatory and immune responses (19Recny M.A. Luther M.A. Knoppers M.H. Neidhardt E.A. Khandekar S.S. Concino M.F.

The role of oligosaccharides in modulating the half-life and biopotency of biomolecules is indeed well known (17Goldwasser E. Kung C.K. Eliason J. J. Biol.

It has been shown in the case of thyroid-stimulating hormone that the deglycosylated form is 10 times more potent in vitro, but is 10 times less active in vivo due to rapid clearance (21Grossmann M.

The same is seen in the case of interferon-γ, where the unglycosylated form has full antiviral and anti-proliferative activity (22Rinderknecht E. O'Connor B.H. Rodriguez H. J. Biol.

Hirvonen S. Sareneva T. Pirhonen J. Julkunen I. J. Interferon Res. 1992; 12: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It could be that the sialylated GdA has a longer half-life in circulation, as in the case of erythropoietin, where it has been shown that the removal of sialic acid groups leads to rapid clearance of the molecule from circulation (25Imai N. Higuchi M. Kawamura A. Tomonoh K. Oh-Eda M. Fujiwara M. Shimonaka Y. Ochi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). From this study, it can be concluded that the apoptogenic activity of GdA resides in its protein backbone. However, it should be noted that the unglycosylated form of glycodelin is not physiological. Hence, the role played by the glycans on glycodelin needs to be unraveled further to obtain insights into functional constraints imposed on this molecule.

Previous data show that BMK1 can be activated by steady laminar flow and is atheroprotective by preventing endothelial cells from undergoing apoptosis. The primary structure of BMK1 is distinct from other MAPK members by virtue of a unique long C-tail, suggesting specific mechanisms of regulation. To characterize regulatory mechanisms for BMK1 function, we identified binding proteins by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Among these proteins, the scaffolding protein 14-3-3 was identified. BMK1 bound to 14-3-3β in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated by glutathione S-transferase (GST)-14-3-3β fusion protein pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation. Phosphorylation of BMK1 was most likely required for this interaction. GST-14-3-3β pull-down assays using truncated constructs of BMK1 and site-directed BMK1 mutants demonstrated that the interaction requires serine 486 within the C terminus of BMK1. BMK1 bound to 14-3-3β basally, and the interaction was greatly abrogated when BMK1 was activated. The interaction of 14-3-3β and BMK1 inhibited kinase activities stimulated by constitutively active (CA)-MEK5 and epidermal growth factor. Mutation of serine 486 (BMK1-S486A) prevented the interaction with 14-3-3β and enhanced BMK1 activity upon epidermal growth factor stimulation. These data demonstrate an inhibitory function for 14-3-3β binding to BMK1 and show that serine 486 phosphorylation represents a novel regulatory mechanism for BMK1.

The upstream kinase that specifically phosphorylates BMK1 has been identified as MEK5 (2Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Activation of MEK5-BMK1 dramatically enhances the phosphorylation and activity of the transcription factor MEF2C (4Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). BMK1 is important in promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell apoptosis (5Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H.

For example, in ischemic myocardium, activation of BMK1 counteracts ischemic cell damage and contributes to cell survival pathway. 2Y. Takeishi, Q. Huang, T. Wang, M. Glassman, M. Yoshizumi, J.-D. Lee, H. Kawakatsu, C. P. Baines, W. Che, S. Ohta, R. A. Walsh, B. B. Berk, and J. Abe, submitted. Previously, our lab showed that BMK1 was activated by fluid shear stress in endothelial cells (9Yan C. Takahashi M. Okuda M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and that BMK1 mediates anti-apoptotic signaling stimulated by flow (10Pi X. Yan C. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that BMK1 may be an important mediator of flow-stimulated atheroprotective signals in endothelial cells. To characterize regulatory mechanisms for BMK1 that mediate cell growth and anti-apoptosis, we identified BMK1-binding proteins. By yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified 14-3-3 as a BMK1-interacting protein. 14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved, ubiquitously expressed proteins with monomeric molecular mass around 30,000 (11Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). To date, seven highly conserved 14-3-3 isoforms (β, ∈, γ, η, σ, τ, ζ) encoded by seven distinct genes have been identified in mammalian systems (11Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 mainly exists in the cytoplasmic compartment, forming homo- or hetero-dimers with other 14-3-3 isoforms (12Jones D.H. Ley S. Aitken A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Most reports indicate that 14-3-3 isoforms are interchangeable with respect to protein binding (11Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that BMK1 bound to 14-3-3β under basal conditions, and the interaction was greatly diminished upon activation of MEK5 and phosphorylation of BMK1. 14-3-3β overexpression inhibited EGF-stimulated BMK1 kinase activity, and a BMK1-S486A mutant deficient in 14-3-3β binding exhibited increased kinase activity upon EGF stimulation. These findings define a new regulatory mechanism for BMK1 mediated by 14-3-3 binding to phospho-serine 486. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—We amplified the full-length mouse cDNA of BMK1 by PCR, and the fragment was cloned into pGBKT7 vector to create BMK1 bait expression construct (pGBKT7-BMK1). The insert sequence and reading frame were confirmed by sequencing. AH109/pGBKT7-BMK1 was obtained by transforming pGBKT7-BMK1 vector into AH109 using the lithium acetate-mediated method. After 11 days, a mouse embryo cDNA library (Clontech) was sequentially transformed into AH109/pGBKT7-BMK1, 1000 positive clones were grown on synthetic dropout (SD)/Trp-Leu-Ade-His-. Through a colony-lift filter assay by detecting β-galactosidase activity, 120 positive clones were obtained. 80 of them specifically interacted with BMK1 in yeast mating tests. Sequence analysis and bioinformatics studies indicated that 8 out of 80 BMK1-interacting sequences represented 14-3-3. DNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—Human 14-3-3β cDNA was a gift from Dr. A. J. Muslin (Washington University School of Medicine). Human BMK1 cDNA was a gift from Dr. J. D. Lee (The Scripps Research Institute). Mouse BMK1 cDNA was cloned by Dr. Chen Yan as reported (1Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). BMK1 point mutations were made by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. In Vitro Transcription/Translation—By using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), mouse BMK1 in pcDNA 3.1/Xpr-His was transcribed and translated in vitro. Briefly, 40 μl of TnT quick master mix, 1 μl of 1 mm methionine, 1 μg of DNA template, 1 μl of biotin-lysyl-tRNA were mixed in a final volume of 50 μl, incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The nascent protein was labeled with Transcend biotin-lysyl-tRNA (Promega) and used for binding assay immediately. Cell Culture and Transient Expression—293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2, 95% O2 incubator at 37 °C. 293T cells were seeded onto 60-mm dishes 24 h prior to transfection and then transiently transfected at 60–70% confluence using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). After 4 h of transfection, the medium was changed to 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Cells were growth-arrested (0% fetal calf serum) overnight prior to the experiment. Cell Lysate Preparation—Cell monolayers were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20mMNa2PO4, pH7.4) and then harvested in 300 μl of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton-X 100, 0.4 mMNa3VO4, 50 mm NaCl, plus 1:1000 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) on ice. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatants were used immediately. For some experiments with phosphatase treatment, cell lysates were collected in calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton plus protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were then incubated with or without 200 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Promega) at 37 °C for 1 h. GST Pull-downs and Coimmunoprecipitations—For the pull-down assays, cell lysates containing 1 mg of protein were incubated overnight with 10 μg of GST or GST-14-3-3β bound to glutathione-Sepharose. For coimmunoprecipitations, cell lysates from each sample were precleared by incubation with 10 μl of protein A/G agarose for 30 min at 4 °C and then incubated with 2 μg of specific antibody and 30 μl of protein A/G agarose overnight at 4 °C on a roller system. The immune complex beads were washed four times with 1 ml of cell lysate buffer before the addition of Laemmli buffer. Western Analysis—Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond TM-ECL). Immunoblotting was performed with anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen), M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), anti-HA antibody (Sigma), anti-14-3-3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-BMK1 antibody (gift from Dr. J. D. Lee), or anti-phosphoBMK1 (Thr-218/Tyr-220) antibody (Cell Signaling). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Reporter Gene Expression—A MEF2C reporter gene expression assay was performed as described previously (1Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were seeded on 24-well plates the day before the transfection. Cells were transfected with the indicated cDNA constructs, the reporter plasmid pG5E1bLuc (containing five Gal4 sites and a luciferase gene), MEF2C fusion activator vectors (containing a GAL4-binding domain and MEF2C activation domain), and Renilla luciferase control vector for 5 h followed by incubation in 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Cell lysates were collected for luciferase assay performed with a dual reporter assay (Promega). To correct for the transfection efficiency, the firefly luciferase activities were divided by the Renilla luciferase activities. BMK1 Kinase Assay—BMK1 kinase activity was measured by autophosphorylation as described previously (9Yan C. Takahashi M. Okuda M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, immune complex kinase assay was performed in a reaction mixture (30 μl) containing 15 μm ATP, 10mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was then terminated with 8 μl of 6× electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and autoradiographed. Statistical Analysis—Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Differences were analyzed with Student’s t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. 14-3-3β Binds to BMK1, Identification by Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—To elucidate BMK1 regulatory mechanisms, we identified BMK1 binding partners by using full-length BMK1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid library screen. We analyzed 80 positive clones that potentially interact with BMK1. Among these clones, we found proteins involved in multiple cellular processes, such as cell metabolism, growth regulation, and cytoskeleton maintenance. One prominent binding partner for BMK1 was 14-3-3∈. Since 14-3-3 isoforms are functionally similar, we investigated the interaction between BMK1 and 14-3-3β because cDNA constructs of this isoform were available for study. 14-3-3β Binds to BMK1 Both in Vitro and in Vivo —The interaction between 14-3-3β and BMK1 was confirmed in 293T cells. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-BMK1, and cell lysates were pulled down by GST or GST-14-3-3β (Fig. 1A). BMK1 was pulled down by GST-14-3-3β but not by GST alone. The interaction was also demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Cell lysates from Xpress-14-3-3β and FLAG-BMK1 cotransfected 293T cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody for BMK1, and anti-Xpress antibody was used to detect 14-3-3β. We found that 14-3-3β coprecipitated with BMK1 in 293T cells (Fig. 1B, upper panel), and the reverse immunoprecipitation showed that BMK1 coprecipitated with 14-3-3β (Fig. 1B, lower panel). The fact that 14-3-3β interacts with BMK1 in vivo was further addressed in endogenous coimmunoprecipitation, which showed that endogenous BMK1 coprecipitated with 14-3-3β. (Fig. 1C). 14-3-3β Interacts with BMK1 Directly—To investigate whether the interaction between 14-3-3β and BMK1 is direct, BMK1 protein was synthesized in vitro by transcription/translation. As shown in Fig. 2, GST-14-3-3β pulled down BMK1 in the absence of other cellular proteins, demonstrating that these two proteins interact with each other directly in vitro. Phosphorylation Is Required for the Interaction between 14-3-3β and BMK1—It has been well recognized that phosphorylation on serine and threonine is important for proteins to interact with 14-3-3 (13Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 14Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). To investigate whether phosphorylation is required for BMK1 interaction, lysates from 293T cells transfected with BMK1 were treated with alkaline phosphatase for 1 h at 37 °C followed by GST-14-3-3β pull-down. As shown in Fig. 3A, in vitro treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase diminished the interaction between 14-3-3β and BMK1. This result was further supported by an in vivo experiment in which cells were treated with staurosporine, a general serine and threonine protein kinase inhibitor. The association between 14-3-3β and BMK1 was abolished by staurosporine (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the interaction between 14-3-3β and BMK1 basally requires phosphorylation of BMK1. The Interaction between 14-3-3β and BMK1 Occurs via Serine 486 within the C Terminus of BMK1—To identify the binding region for 14-3-3β on BMK1, a GST-14-3-3β pull-down assay was performed for several truncated constructs of BMK1. The design of the truncated BMK1 constructs was based on the BMK1 structure, which has a unique C terminus containing two proline-rich regions (P1 and P2) and one nuclear localization sequence (Fig. 4A) (1Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). GST-14-3-3β pulled down BMK1(aa 1–494), BMK1(aa 1–577), and wild type BMK1, but not BM-K(aa 1–418) (Fig. 4B). This result suggests that the interaction of 14-3-3β with BMK1 occurs within the C terminus of BMK1(aa 419–494). We further localized the binding region as aa 451–494 by GST-14-3-3β pull-down assay using BMK1 internal deletion mutants (data not shown). Although there is no obvious 14-3-3 recognition motif (RSXpSXP, where pS denotes phosphorylated serine) in this region, we focused on the serines within this region because phosphorylation was found to be required for the interaction with 14-3-3β (Fig. 3). We made four serine-to-alanine mutations, S460A, S472A, S486A and S489A, to investigate which serine may be important for the interaction. Only the BMK1-S486A mutant was not pulled down by GST-14-3-3β, whereas the other serine-to-alanine mutants and wild type BMK1 were pulled down (Fig. 4C). Similarly, in 293T cells cotransfected with 14-3-3β and wild type BMK1 or BMK1-S486A mutant, 14-3-3β coimmunoprecipitated with wild type BMK1 but not BMK1-S486A (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that serine 486 within the motif LKpSLRS (where pS denotes phosphorylated serine) mediates the interaction between 14-3-3β and BMK1. The Interaction between 14-3-3β and BMK1 Is Reduced upon BMK1 Activation—To address whether the interaction between 14-3-3β and BMK1 is altered by BMK1 activation, constitutively active MEK5 (CA-MEK5) was used to activate BMK1. As shown in Fig. 5A, GST-14-3-3β bound to BMK1 under basal conditions, whereas the interaction was significantly reduced when BMK1 was activated by CA-MEK5. This result was further supported in a coimmunoprecipitation experiment, as shown in Fig. 5B. 293T cells were cotransfected with FLAG-BMK1 and CA-MEK5. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody for BMK1 and immunoblotted with anti-14-3-3 antibody. Compared with the basal condition, the interaction between BMK1 and 14-3-3β was significantly reduced when BMK1 was activated by CA-MEK5 (Fig. 5B). 14-3-3β Inhibits BMK1 Activity through Interaction at Serine 486 —The fact that BMK1 dissociates from 14-3-3β upon BMK1 activation suggests that 14-3-3 binding may modulate BMK1 kinase activity. To investigate this possibility, 293T cells were cotransfected with Xpress-14-3-3β and CA-MEK5. Endogenous BMK1 was immunoprecipitated, and its activity was measured by in vitro kinase assay based on BMK1 autophosphorylation (Fig. 6A). BMK1 activation was inhibited significantly by 14-3-3β expression. Based on this result, we hypothesized that wild type BMK1 and BMK1-S486A may have different activities since BMK1-S486A does not bind to 14-3-3β. To test this hypothesis, we used EGF to stimulate BMK1. 293T cells transfected with BMK1 or BMK1-S486A were stimulated with EGF (Fig. 6B). The BMK1-S486A mutant exhibited greater activity (∼3-fold-increase at 20 min) than wild type BMK1 as measured by anti-phosphoBMK1 antibody. Consistent with this result, in 14-3-3β-overexpressing 293T cells, EGF-stimulated endogenous BMK1 activity was significantly inhibited (by ∼70%) (Fig. 6C). Activation of BMK1 Is Inhibited by 14-3-3β—To demonstrate the physiological significance of BMK1 and 14-3-3β interaction, we studied BMK1-mediated transactivation of MEF2C, an important transcription factor in cardiovascular development. To determine the effect of 14-3-3β-BMK1 interaction on MEF2C activity, we used a reporter gene assay (Fig. 7). BMK1 overexpression increased MEF2C activity by ∼100% (Fig. 7, column 2), although 14-3-3β cotransfection inhibited MEF2C activity by ∼40% (Fig. 7, column 3). The increase in MEF2C activity (∼550%) upon cotransfection of BMK1 and CA-MEK5 (Fig. 7, column 4) was also significantly inhibited by ∼40% upon 14-3-3β cotransfection (Fig. 7, column 5). The major finding of this study is identification of a novel BMK1 regulatory mechanism that includes phosphorylation of serine 486 and binding of 14-3-3β. The interaction between BMK1 and 14-3-3β inhibits BMK1 phosphorylation and activation of MEF2C. 14-3-3β binding to BMK1 at serine 486 occurs within the motif LKSLRS (s = site of phosphorylation), which is conserved in human, mouse, and rat BMK1 proteins (1Yan C.

Prody C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4771-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As is typical for 14-3-3 binding, the interaction with BMK1 is most likely phosphorylation-dependent. Several motifs in 14-3-3 binding partners have been recognized. Among 14-3-3 motifs, one prominent binding motif is RX1–2pSX2–3S (where pS denotes phosphorylated serine and X represents any amino acid) (13Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 14Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). The motif LK(SLRS) in BMK1 is similar to RX1–2[pSX2–3S], as shown by the bracketed amino acids. 14-3-3 proteins bind to several kinases, including ASK, protein kinase C-μ, and p90 ribosomal s6 kinase isoform-1 (RSK-1), and inhibit their activities (16Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 17Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18376-18383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we found that BMK1 binds to 14-3-3 basally through serine 486 site on the C terminus and dissociates from 14-3-3 upon BMK1 activation. The mechanism of BMK1 activation is not fully understood, although the upstream kinase that activates BMK1 via phosphorylation of TEY motif is MEK5 (2Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Based on the mechanisms of 14-3-3 inhibiting other kinases, we propose a putative model for 14-3-3 in regulation of BMK1 signaling (Fig. 8). 14-3-3 binds to BMK1 directly and stabilizes its inactive form by blocking MEK5 interaction under basal conditions. Upon mitogen activation, a BMK1 activation intermediate forms that includes phosphorylation of TEY motif by MEK5 and dephosphorylation of serine 486 by an unknown phosphatase. It is possible that either action could be the initiation step facilitating the other. Fully activated BMK1 is characterized by phosphorylation at TEY and absence of 14-3-3 binding. The supporting evidence for this model is findings that overexpression of 14-3-3 inhibits BMK1 activity upon EGF stimulation, and the 14-3-3 binding-deficient BMK1 mutant has a higher kinase activity than wild type. Two unanswered questions are the identity of the kinase that phosphorylates BMK1 at serine 486 basally and the mechanism by which BMK1 and 14-3-3 dissociate from each other. We think it is unlikely that BMK1 autophosphorylates serine 486 since it is not surrounded by a MAP kinase phosphorylation motif. A protein kinase C isoform is more likely based on sequence motif. Based on the similarity to ASK1, we think the dissociation may be caused by recruitment of a phosphatase (phosphoserine phosphatase) that dephosphorylates serine 486. The protein identified as AIP-1 that binds to ASK1 and dissociates 14-3-3 from ASK1 is the first example of this mechanism (19Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A second role for 14-3-3 is to inhibit BMK1 interactions with substrates such as MEF2C. It has been reported that BMK1 contains a MEF2-interacting domain located between amino acids 440 and 501 in the C terminus, which is required for BMK1 to activate MEF2C (21Kasler H.G. Victoria J. Duramad O. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8382-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Since 14-3-3 interacts with serine 486 that is within the BMK1-MEF2C-interacting site, 14-3-3 and MEF2C may compete for BMK1 binding. Our data that show 14-3-3-inhibiting MEF2C transactivation is consistent with this model. A similar model has been described for 14-3-3 competition with Bax for Bad binding (8Tan Y. Demeter M.R. Ruan H. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25865-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To date, seven 14-3-3 isoforms have been identified, and they form homo- or hetero-dimers naturally. 14-3-3 proteins bind to their ligands through their conserved inner, concave surfaces within a cup-like shape as a whole. Most reports indicate that these 14-3-3 isoforms are non-selective regarding interaction with their ligands (11Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Our findings that 14-3-3∈ bound to BMK1 in yeast two-hybrid analysis and the binding of 14-3-3β to BMK1 in the mammalian system shown here also indicate the non-selective characteristic of 14-3-3 isoforms. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that 14-3-3 is a BMK1-binding protein that regulates BMK1 function. An important extension of the present study is identification of serine 486 as a regulatory site for BMK1 activation. Further work will be required to elucidate the nature of the kinase that phosphorylates serine 486 and the phosphatase and/or competing protein that dissociates 14-3-3 from serine 486."
https://openalex.org/W2005414005,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a mitogen, morphogen, and motogen that functions in tissue healing and acts as an anti-fibrotic factor. The mechanism for this is not well understood. Recent studies implicate somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in fibrosis. We examined the effects of HGF on ACE expression in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAEC). Short term treatment of BPAEC with HGF transiently increased both ACE mRNA (3 h) and activity (24 h), as determined by ACE protease assays and reverse transcription-PCR. Incubation of BPAEC with HGF for longer periods suppressed ACE mRNA (6 h) and activity (72 h). In contrast, phorbol ester (PMA) treatment produced sustained increase in ACE mRNA and activity. We examined the short term molecular effects of HGF on ACE using PMA for comparison. HGF and PMA increased transcription from a luciferase reporter with the core ACE promoter, which contains a composite binding site for SP1/3 and Egr-1. Immunocytochemistry and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that both HGF and PMA increased Egr-1 binding. HGF also increased SP3 binding, as measured by EMSA. However, HGF and PMA increased the cellular activity of only Egr-1, not SP3, as measured by luciferase reporter assays. Deletion of the Egr-1 site in the reporter construct completely abrogated HGF-induced transcription but only ∼50% of PMA-induced activity. Expression of dominant negative Egr-1 and SP3 blocked up-regulation of the ACE promoter by HGF but only reduced up-regulation by PMA. These results show that HGF transiently increases gene transcription of ACE via activation of Egr-1, whereas PMA regulation involves Egr-1 and additional factor(s).

Bottaro D.P. Aaronson S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). HGF has been shown to induce mitogenesis, motogenesis, and morphogenesis in both epithelial and endothelial cell types (1Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Aaronson S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). HGF is required for embryogenesis and organogenesis, and HGF knockouts in mice are lethal in utero (1Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Aaronson S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 2Uehara Y. Mori C. Noda T. Shiota K. Kitamura N. Genesis. 2000; 27: 99-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The c-Met receptor is a tyrosine kinase receptor with a single transmembrane-spanning region and a conserved tyrosine kinase domain. Signal transduction pathways activated by HGF include Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p44/p42 and p38, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, and phospholipase C (1Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Aaronson S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Through its multifunctional docking region c-Met can bind to proteins containing SH2 (Src homology) domains, including Gab 1, Grb2, SOS, and Shc, which appear to be required for downstream signaling events. HGF functions in a variety of organs as a tissue repair factor. HGF protein is up-regulated in response to tissue damage and inflammation in lung, liver, kidney, and heart (3Ono K. Matsumori A.

Animal studies show increased levels of HGF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in response to thoracic irradiation or treatment with bleomycin, a chemotherapeutic agent known to induce lung injury (9Yamazaki H. Takeuchi E. Tang J.T. Fukushima S. Inoue T. Shinkawa K. Watanabe Y. Tanaka E. Teshima T. Ozeki S. Koizumi M. Ito M. Nakamura H. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 2539-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 10Adamson Y. Bakowska J. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 949-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The increase of HGF protein in response to tissue damage is thought to function in the repair process in the lung, heart, liver, and kidney (10Adamson Y. Bakowska J. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 949-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. EXS (Basel). 1993; 65: 225-249PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, the time course of HGF induction in experimentally induced lung injury in rats correlated with epithelial cell proliferation (8Yanagita K. Matsumoto K. Sekiguchi K. Ishibashi H. Niho Y. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21212-21217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the use of neutralizing antibodies to HGF drastically reduced DNA synthesis in alveolar epithelial cells after experimentally induced ischemia-reperfusion lung injury in rats (12Yamada T. Hisanaga M. Nakajima Y. Mizuno S. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Nakano H. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that HGF is also an anti-fibrotic factor. Animal studies show that administration of HGF protein induces proliferation of epithelial and endothelial cells and promotes normal tissue regeneration while at the same time preventing the development of fibrosis (11Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. EXS (Basel). 1993; 65: 225-249PubMed Google Scholar). The simultaneous or delayed administration of HGF to mice undergoing bleomycin-induced lung injury prevents both endothelial and epithelial cell apoptosis, the appearance of fibroblast foci, and the accumulation of collagen found in pulmonary fibrosis (13Yaekashiwa M. Nakayama S. Ohnuma K. Sakai T. Abe T. Satoh K. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Takahashi T. Nukiwa T. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Care Med. 2000; 162: 2302-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, HGF appears to have the capacity to mediate tissue repair in a manner that circumvents aberrant tissue remodeling pathways. However, the mechanism for the anti-fibrotic activity of HGF is not well understood. Somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metalloproteinase expressed primarily on the luminal surface of vascular endothelial cells (15Caldwell P. Seegal B. Hsu K. Das M. Soffer R. Science. 1976; 191: 1050-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 16Rosen R. Noveral J. Mueller S. Levine E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 122: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The primary physiological role of ACE is maintenance of blood pressure homeostasis, but ACE is also up-regulated in response to injury in tissues including heart, lung, and kidney (17Corvol P. Michaud A. Soubrier F. Williams T. J. Hypertens. 1995; 13: S3-S10Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Hooper N. Int. J.

Recent findings suggest that increased ACE expression in damaged tissues is associated with remodeling and fibrosis (20Sun Y. Zhang J. Ramires F. J. Mol. Cell.

Here we have examined HGF regulation of ACE gene expression in BPAEC and compare the findings with regulation by the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a known positive regulator of ACE gene expression. In contrast with the sustained up-regulation of ACE by PMA, HGF biphasically regulates ACE with only a transient period of up-regulation followed by sustained down-regulation. Reagents—The MEK1/2 (MAPK kinase1/2) inhibitor U0126 was purchased from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. Other reagents are described below. Human HGF protein was the kind gift of Dr. G. vande Woude (Van Andel Research Inst., Grand Rapids, MI). Cell Culture and HGF and PMA Treatment—Primary bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAEC) were either obtained from freshly slaughtered calves as described previously (26Dasarathy Y. Lanzillo J.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L645-L649PubMed Google Scholar) or purchased from Cell Applications, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Passage 3–8 cells were used for all experiments. BPAEC were cultured in RPMI 1640 with antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin), fungisone, and 10% fetal bovine serum; cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere in a Fisher Scientific Isotemp culture incubator. PMA was dissolved in Me2SO and diluted at least 1:1000 into cell culture. Me2SO was added to control experiments at the same dilution. HGF was diluted in 20 mm Tris, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; vehicle alone was used in controls. ACE Hippuryl-l-Histidyl-l-Leucine Assay—BPAEC were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove dead cells and then scraped into PBS and sonicated (3 times for 10 s on ice) to extract cellular protein. ACE catalytic activity was determined by a fluorometric assay with the synthetic substrate hippuryl-l-histidyl-l-leucine as described by Friedland and Silverstein (27Friedland J. Silverstein E. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1976; 66: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Specificity of substrate hydrolysis was confirmed by complete inhibition of ACE activity by lisinopril, a specific ACE inhibitor. Protein concentrations were determined according to Lowry et al. (28Lowry O. Rosenburg N. Farr A. Randall R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative PCR—Total cell RNA was obtained from cultured cells using Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. 1 μg of RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 37 °C using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MLVRT) in 10 μl of reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 40 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 660 pmol of oligo(dT)16, 0.5 mm each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), and 1 unit of RNase inhibitor. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min to inactivate the MLVRT and stored at –20 °C. All RT reagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA. Competitive semiquantitative PCR for ACE mRNA was performed as described previously (29Lanzillo J.J. Kong X.J. Fanburg B.L. PCR Methods Applications. 1994; 4: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Day R. Yang Y. Suzuki Y. Stevens J. Pathi R. Perlmutter A. Fanburg B. Lanzillo J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was used in a PCR reaction buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, 400 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.08% gelatin, pH 8.5) with 0.4 μm concentrations of each forward and reverse primer, 200 μm each dNTP, and 1 units/50 μl Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out for 30–35 cycles with 30 s at 94 °C denaturation then 2 min of combined 68 °C annealing/extension. The last cycle extension was for 10 min. A deletion mutant internal standard was used to normalize for differences in PCR efficiency. ACE PCR results were normalized to PCR results of tubulin, also determined using a mutant internal standard (29Lanzillo J.J. Kong X.J. Fanburg B.L. PCR Methods Applications. 1994; 4: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 31Aschoff J.M. Lazarus D. Fanburg B.L. Lanzillo J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cell Transfection—BPAEC grown in 12-well plates to 60–80% confluence were transfected with promoter-reporter constructs by Gene-Porter II (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (30Day R. Yang Y. Suzuki Y. Stevens J. Pathi R. Perlmutter A. Fanburg B. Lanzillo J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells in serum-free RPMI were transfected with 1 μg of construct DNA and GenePorter II per well in a 12-well plate for 5 h before the addition of an equal volume RPMI, 20% fetal bovine serum containing antibiotics and fungisone. Transfection mixtures also contained 100 ng of the Renilla luciferase vector, pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI), to normalize transfection efficiency. After 16 h medium was switched to RPMI with 0.2% fetal bovine serum, and cells were treated with PMA or HGF. Plasmids—The 5′-flanking region of the ACE gene was obtained by PCR amplification of human genomic DNA and cloned into the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega) to produce the pACE230luc vector as previously described (30Day R. Yang Y. Suzuki Y. Stevens J. Pathi R. Perlmutter A. Fanburg B. Lanzillo J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PCR was performed in a buffer (60 mm Tris sulfate, 19 mm NH4SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, pH 8.9) containing 200 μm each dNTP, 1 m betaine, 10 μm each primer, 0.04 units/μl platinum Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen), and a 150-fold dilution of human genomic DNA (Oncor, Gathersburg, MD, catalog #p1600, lot #cos108). The primers were 5′-cccgggaggtaccgaAGGCCCTTTCTCCAGCTTCCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-tgacgtaagcttCTCTGCCCCTTCTCCTGCGCC-3′ (reverse), with uppercase bases corresponding to ACE gene sequences and lowercase bases indicating non-homologous 5′ extensions with restriction enzyme sites (bold) for Kpn-I and Hind III, respectively, to allow for directional cloning. These primers amplified a 230-bp amplicon encompassing a region from –230 to +1 of exon-1 of the ACE gene (Gen-Bank™ accession number AF229986). Samples were cycled at 95 °C for 1 min then 40 cycles at 95 °C for a 0.5-min denaturation and 68 °C for a 2-min combined annealing/extension, with a final extension at 68 °C for 8 min. The Egr-1 replacement mutant of the promoter was prepared from the 230-bp promoter from the transcriptional start site by overlap extension PCR (32Ho S. Hunt H. Horton R. Pullen J. Pease L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The forward and reverse external primers for –230 to +1 were the same as above; the internal primers used to prepare these mutants are 5′-GCAGTACTGATCCGCGGGGCGGGGGTGTGTCGGGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGTACTGATCCGCCCTCCTCCGCTCCAGAGTCC3′ (reverse); reaction buffers and cycles were the same as above. The minimal Egr-1-responsive reporter plasmid pEBS14luc contains four binding sites for Egr-1 and has been previously described (33Thiel G. Kaufmann K. Magin A. Lietz M. Bach K. Cramer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The minimal SP1/3-responsive reporter plasmid pAldCGB4luc contains four binding sites for Sp1 derived from the aldolase C promoter and was described previously (34Cibelli G. Schoch S. Pajunk H. Brand I.A. Thiel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Basal transcription mediated by this GC-rich region of the aldolase C gene is abrogated by dominant negative SP1 and SP3 mutants. 2A. Al-Sarray and G. Thiel, submitted for publication. The expression vector for dominant negative Egr-1, pCMV-FLAG-NLS-Egr-1DN, was described in Zhang et al. (35Zhang F. Lin M. Abidi P. Thiel G. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 28: 44246-44252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As a dominant negative SP3, we designed an expression vector encoding a chimera of the repression domain of the zinc finger protein RE-1-silencing transcription factor (REST) with the DNA binding domain of the SP3 transcription factor. The cDNA encoding human SP3 was purchased from ATCC (ATCC 95505, accession number M97191). To construct the DN SP3 expression vector we first cloned the N-terminal repression of REST into plasmid p3xFLAG-CMV (Sigma), generating plasmid pCMV-FLAG-REST-N. The SP3 cDNA was cut with Asp-718 and filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and the fragment was inserted into the filled-in BglII site of plasmid pCMV-FLAG-REST-N. The REST/SP3 chimera contains amino acids 1–419 of REST fused to amino acids 485–653 of SP3 (36Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Dual Luciferase Assay—Transfected BPAEC were washed twice with PBS, lysed with Promega passive lysis buffer, and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities by the dual luciferase assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions in a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described by Garner and Revzin (37Garner M.M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). To prepare nuclear extracts cells were washed in PBS and incubated in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate for 15 min at 4 °C. IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma) was then added at a final concentration of 0.6%(v/v). Samples were vortexed and centrifuged. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 1% (v/v) glycerol) then mixed vigorously for 20 min and centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatants were harvested, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). To perform EMSA binding reaction mixtures containing 2 μg protein of nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing consensus Egr-1 sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Electrophoresis of samples through a native 6% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bis, 29:1) was followed by autoradiography. Supershift experiments were performed by incubating 2 μg of antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in the binding reaction mixture for 1 h at 4 °C before the addition of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe to start the binding reaction. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Immunohistochemistry—BPAEC were grown directly on sterile glass coverslips to 60–80% confluence. Immunohistochemistry was performed at ambient temperature. Cells were washed with PBS for 5 min before fixing in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS for 3 min each and then permeabilized for 2–3 min with Triton buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 1% Triton, 90 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 75 mm KCl). Cells were again washed 3 times with PBS, 3 min each. Primary antibodies (4 μg/ml PBS final) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated on cells for 1 h and washed 3 times with PBS 3 min each before the addition of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (0.1 μg/ml PBS) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h. Finally, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and mounted in 90% glycerol, PBS. Cells were visualized, and digital images were made on a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. Statistics—All experiments were repeated at least 3 times. Statistical comparisons were performed using Student’s t test for unpaired samples and a two-way analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was determined p < 0.05. For non-linear regression for calculation of the ACE mRNA half-life, SigmaPlot 2000 V6 for Windows (SSPS Science, Chicago, IL) was used (38Zulueta J.J. Sawhney R. Kayyali U. Fogel M. Donaldson C.

HGF Biphasically Enhances ACE Activity and Expression— ACE activity was measured in BPAEC cell lysates after time courses of treatment with HGF and PMA (Fig. 1, A and B). ACE activity in response to 10 ng/ml HGF increased at 24 h (1.8-fold above control) but then decreased, first back to basal levels at 48 h and then to 50 ± 2% that of control levels at 72 h (Fig. 1A). In contrast, treatment of BPAEC with PMA induced increased ACE activity at all time points examined up to 72 h. In response to 10–9 and 10–7m PMA, ACE enzyme activity increased at 24 h (1.3- and 1.6-fold above control, respectively) and at 48 h (1.9- and 3.5-fold above control, respectively) (Fig. 1B). Studies with a number of biological and pharmacological agents show that changes in ACE activity correlate with changes in ACE mRNA (39Okabe T. Yamagata K. Fujisawa M. Takaku F. Hidaka H. Umezawa Y.

Investig. 1995; 95: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that ACE mRNA levels changed biphasically with HGF, and treatment with PMA positively regulated ACE mRNA at all times examined (Fig. 1, C and D). Within 3 h ACE mRNA increased in BPAEC in response to 50 ng/ml HGF (Fig. 1C). Longer exposure (6–24 h) of BPAEC to HGF resulted in a steady decrease in ACE mRNA, to <50% that of control levels at 24 h (Fig. 1C). ACE mRNA increased within 6 h in response to 10–7 m PMA (Fig. 1D), in agreement with findings by others (41Villard E. Alonso A. Agrapart M. Challah M. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25191-25197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). HGF and PMA Activation of Transcription Factors—We and others previously identified a core region of the ACE promoter from –230 to the +1 transcription start site that is sufficient for activation by several agents (30Day R.

J. 1993; 293: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This core ACE promoter contains potential binding sites for a number of transcription factors including Egr-1, SP1, and ets-1. Previous studies show a correlation between increased ACE gene expression and up-regulation and activation of Egr-1 (30Day R. Yang Y. Suzuki Y. Stevens J. Pathi R. Perlmutter A. Fanburg B.

Physiol. 1981; 108: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). HGF has not previously been shown to activate the Egr-1 transcription factor in these cells, and we wished to determine whether Egr-1 could be involved in the early induction of ACE protein and mRNA by HGF. Immunohistochemical experiments with BPAEC show that PMA increases the nuclear level of Egr-1 within 30 min (Fig. 2A). No change is seen for ets-1, SP1, or SP3, all of which are present in the nuclei of both control and PMA-treated cells. Treatment of cells with HGF also resulted in the increase of nuclear Egr-1 (Fig. 2B). No change was seen for ets-1, SP1, or SP3, which were constitutively nuclear as found for PMA (data not shown). The lack of change in SP1/3 and ets-1 is in agreement with findings by others that show that these factors are constitutively nuclear. EMSA experiments were performed for all three of the transcription factors used in immunohistochemistry. EMSA with an ets-1 consensus oligos failed to show any activity in control, PMA-treated, or HGF-treated BPAEC (data not shown). EMSA using Egr-1 consensus oligo showed that 10–7 m PMA increases binding within 30 min, with a peak between 60 and 90 min in BPAEC (Fig. 3A). Supershift was performed to confirm the identity of the EMSA band as Egr-1 (Fig. 3B). A similar time course was found for 50 ng/ml HGF-induced Egr-1 binding in BPAEC (Fig. 3C), which was also confirmed by supershift (Fig. 3D). PMA activation of Egr-1 was inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor calcinurin C, as previously shown (41Villard E. Alonso A. Agrapart M. Challah M. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25191-25197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and by the MAPK p42/p44 inhibitor U0126 (Fig. 3E). PMA-induced Egr-1 binding was also inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (data not shown). HGF activation of Egr-1 binding was blocked only by U0126 but not by bisindolylmaleimide I, pp2 (an Src kinase/focal adhesion kinase inhibitor), or by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 3F). Constitutitve binding to an SP1 family consensus oligo was found to be present in control BPAEC (Fig. 4A). This binding was not increased in the presence of 10–7 m PMA at any time point examined including 24 h (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Supershift analysis was performed to determine the isoforms of SP1 present in BPAEC; these experiments resulted in interference patterns rather than supershifted bands (Fig. 4B). A small amount of the binding was disrupted by an antibody specific for the SP1 isoform, but most of the binding was disrupted by an antibody against the SP3 isoform. Examination of the SP1 family consensus oligo using nuclear extracts from BPAEC treated with 50 ng/ml HGF showed that HGF induced an increase in SP1 binding with a time course peaking at 60 min, similar to the time course found for increased Egr-1 binding (Fig. 4C). Supershift analysis revealed that the primary species in this band was the SP3 isoform (Fig. 4D).

Here we identify a metformin-stimulated d-mannose transport (MSMT) activity in dermal fibroblasts. MSMT increased mannose uptake 1.8-fold and had greater affinity for mannose than basal mannose transport activity. It was attributed to robust stimulation of a transporter expressed weakly in untreated cells. MSMT was not explained by greater glucose transporter activity because metformin unexpectedly decreased transport of 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose by fibroblasts. Effective inhibitors of MSMT retained specificity for the 3-, 4-, and 6-OH groups of the mannose ring but not the 2-OH group. Thus, MSMT could be strongly inhibited by glucose and 2-deoxy-d-glucose even though the latter was not a good transport substrate. MSMT was significant because in the presence of 2.5 μm mannose, metformin corrected experimentally induced deficiencies in the synthesis of glucose3mannose9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol and N-linked glycosylation. MSMT was also identified in congenital disorder of glycosylation types Ia and Ib fibroblasts, and metformin acted synergistically with 100 μm mannose to correct lipid-linked oligosaccharide synthesis and N-glycosylation in the Ia cells. In conclusion, metformin activates a novel fibroblast mannose-selective transport system. This suggests that AMP-activated protein kinase may be a regulator of mannose metabolism and implies a therapy for congenital disorders of glycosylation-Ia.

This suggests that AMP-activated protein kinase may be a regulator of mannose metabolism and implies a therapy for congenital disorders of glycosylation-Ia. d-Mannose is a component of many eukaryotic glycoconjugates, such as asparagine (N)-linked glycans and their precursor lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLO), 1The abbreviations used are: LLO, lipid-linked oligosaccharide; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; CDG-I, congenital disorder of glycosylation type I; 2dG, 2-deoxyglucose; 3mG, 3-O-methylglucose; MSMT, metformin-stimulated mannose transport; TN, tunicamycin; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. glycosylphosphatidylinositols, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, mannose-containing serine/threonine (O)-linked glycans, and C-mannosyltryptophan (1Spiro R.G. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: R43-R56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). By metabolic conversion, extracellularly derived d-glucose can be a major source of d-mannosyl residues. This is illustrated by the human genetic disease congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) type Ib, which is characterized by defective phosphomannose isomerase and deficient conversion of the glucose metabolite Fru-6-P to Man-6-P (2Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Korner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P. Wu R. Harms E. Reiter K. von Figura K. Freeze H.H. Harms H.K. Marquardt T. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Man-6-P is converted to Man-1-P by phosphomannomutase, which generates GDP-mannose. GDP-mannose is used to form mannose-P-dolichol, and both are required for synthesis of complete LLOs. Thus, CDG-Ib cells have diminished LLO production and incomplete N-linked glycosylation (2Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Korner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P. Wu R. Harms E. Reiter K. von Figura K. Freeze H.H. Harms H.K. Marquardt T. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellularly derived mannose itself is also a significant physiological precursor of mannosyl residues. It is well known that [3H]mannose can be incorporated into glycoproteins when added to eukaryotic cell cultures. In dermal fibroblasts, this process is selective over glucose (3Panneerselvam K. Etchison J.R. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23123-23129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, [3H]mannose is incorporated into glycoproteins when injected into mice (4Alton G. Hasilik M. Niehues R. Panneerselvam K. Etchison J.R. Fana F. Freeze H.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and a mannose-selective transporter has been identified in human dermal fibroblasts (5Panneerselvam K. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9417-9421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Extracellular mannose can counteract abrogated LLO synthesis caused by culturing normal fibroblasts in glucose-deficient medium (6Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and it can correct the LLO defects in cultured CDG-Ia (phosphomannomutase-deficient) and CDG-Ib cells (2Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Korner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P. Wu R. Harms E. Reiter K. von Figura K. Freeze H.H. Harms H.K. Marquardt T. J. Clin.

Panneerselvam K. Waechter C.J. Freeze H.H. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, disease in CDG-Ia patients is not corrected by dietary mannose therapy, and CDG-Ia transferrin remains underglycosylated (9Marquardt T. Freeze H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2001; 382: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CDG-Ib is successfully treated with dietary mannose, but excess quantities of mannose can cause side effects such as bloating and kidney damage (10Harms H.K. Zimmer K.P. Kurnik K. Bertele-Harms R.M. Weidinger S. Reiter K. Acta Paediatr. 2002; 91: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in both cases mannose therapy might be more effective if its uptake by cells could be improved. Given the importance of mannose transport activity in normal physiology, as well as the potential for treatment of glycosylation disorders by mannose supplementation, we sought to identify agents that would enhance mannose transport. Metformin is a biguanide drug used to treat type II diabetes and has antihyperglycemic properties (11Davis S.N. Granner D.K. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics.

Med. 1995; 333: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Metformin acts by stimulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of energy homeostasis in liver, skeletal muscle, adipocytes, and pancreatic islets (14Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kemp B.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Michell B.J. Chen Z.-P. Witters L.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 22-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). AMPK is normally activated when cellular AMP concentrations rise relative to ATP, such as during vigorous exercise, and triggers a set of responses that help restore the AMP/ATP ratio to normal. Although an activator, metformin does not appear to interact with AMPK directly (18Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4472) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the effects of metformin on mannose transport and protein glycosylation. Because these processes are not well characterized in skeletal muscle, experiments were performed instead with dermal fibroblasts from both normal and CDG type I patients. A metformin-stimulated mannose transport (MSMT) activity was identified. The stimulation of mannose transport, although only roughly 2-fold, is comparable with the 2-fold effect of metformin on glucose transport by skeletal muscle. This was not due to the doubling of activity of a single transporter but rather an increase in the activity of a novel transporter that has little contribution in untreated cells. Unexpectedly, metformin decreased glucose transport activity in fibroblasts, a distinction with MSMT. Finally, we show that the effects of metformin can contribute a major fraction of the hexose necessary to assemble lipid-linked oligosaccharides and that metformin has the potential to counteract the glycosylation defect in CDG-Ia cells.

Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were generally grown to 80–90% of confluence for experiments. As described earlier (19Shang J. Korner C. Freeze H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the fibroblasts used were normal CRL-1904 (American Type Culture Collection), CDG-Ia (20Korner C. Lehle L. von Figura K. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and CDG-Ib (21Babovic-Vuksanovic D. Patterson M.C. Schwenk W.F. O'Brien J.F. Vockley J. Freeze H.H.

Analysis of [3H]Mannose-labeled LLOs and N-Linked Glycans by HPLC—Unless indicated otherwise, cultures were incubated for 20 min in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.5 mm glucose containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 40 μCi/ml (2.5 μm) [3H]mannose. 3H-Labeled LLOs were extracted with organic solvent, fractionated by HPLC, and detected as described previously (6Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Shang J. Korner C. Freeze H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The proteinaceous pellet remaining after organic extraction was digested with N-glycanase (Calbiochem catalogue number 362185) as directed by the manufacturer, and the released N-glycans were analyzed by HPLC as described (22Zeng Y. Lehrman M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In some experiments the amounts of [3H]mannose were varied, or 0.1 mm unlabeled d-mannose was included during the 20-min labeling period. As described earlier (6Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the peak heights of [3H]mannose-labeled glycans detected by HPLC were normalized to their mannose contents to determine their percentages in glycan pools. Analysis of [3H]Mannose Incorporated into Glycoconjugate Fractions—Cells were incubated with [3H]mannose for 10 min, and the total [3H] incorporated into each of four fractions was determined as follows. Cells from 35-mm wells of 6-well plates were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into methanol. After drying under nitrogen, the cellular residue was extracted with 10 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1). The supernatant recovered by centrifugation was dried under nitrogen, resuspended with 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1), mixed with 0.8 ml of water, and centrifuged to yield two layers. The lower organic layer was mixed with 2 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (3:48:47) and centrifuged. The resulting lower phase containing sugar-P-dolichols was saved, and the upper aqueous phase was combined with that from the first step for later use. The residue remaining after initial chloroform/methanol (2:1) extraction was further extracted with 10 ml of water, which (after recovery by centrifugation) was combined with the aqueous phases obtained earlier to yield free mannose plus water-soluble metabolites. The residue was then extracted with 10 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3) to obtain LLOs. The three solvent extracts were evaporated to dryness. The proteinaceous residue that remained was dissolved in 1% SDS with boiling. The distribution of [3H]mannose in the four fractions was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Hexose Uptake Measurements—0.5 or 1.0 × 105 cells were seeded per 35-mm well of a multiwell plate and grown to 40–50 or 80–90% of confluence (yielding ∼0.04 or 0.08 mg of cell-associated protein), respectively. No systematic differences in the outcomes of experiments were noted between the two conditions. After treatment in the absence or presence of metformin, fibroblasts were typically incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and the indicated concentrations of [2-3H]d-mannose, [G-3H]2-deoxy-d-glucose, or 3-O-methyl-[methyl-3H]d-glucose were essentially as described (6Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Prior to use, 3H-labeled sugars were subjected to two rounds of drying under nitrogen and dissolution in water to eliminate [3H]water formed by isotopic exchange during storage. 0.5 or 1 mm unlabeled glucose (as indicated), which had small effects on basal and metformin-stimulated mannose transport (see “Results”), was provided as a source of energy during the assay. After incubation, plates were placed on ice and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed with 1% SDS, and total cell-associated tritium was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. For [3H]mannose, essentially all of the tritium remaining in the medium or associating with cell pellets failed to evaporate under a stream of nitrogen, indicating that formation of [3H]water by phosphomannose isomerase was inconsequential. Model for Metformin-stimulated Mannose Transport (MSMT)— For clarity, the reader is referred to Fig. 1, which presents a model for three transport activities indicated by this study as follows: (i) an activity responsible for most 3-O-methyl-d-glucose (3mG) transport and a minor portion of the 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2dG) transport under basal conditions, which is relatively resistant to phlorizin and is diminished by about half with metformin treatment; (ii) an activity responsible for most of the 2dG transport and mannose transport under basal conditions that is not strongly affected by metformin but is relatively sensitive to phlorizin; and (iii) an activity that is stimulated by metformin, selective for mannose, and relatively resistant to phlorizin (MSMT). Although this model is consistent with the data presented below, other models may also be plausible. Metformin Increases Uptake of d-Mannose—As shown in Fig. 2, metformin treatment increased uptake of mannose by dermal fibroblasts. Assays were based upon the total amount of cell-associated tritium derived from [3H]mannose. Results are reported as transport by untreated cells (basal), transport by cells after treatment with metformin (metformin-treated), or the difference (metformin-stimulated mannose transport, MSMT). For a 10-min incubation with 2.5 μm mannose, the magnitude of the increase (1.8-fold, average of 23 determinations, Fig. 2, panel a) was comparable with the 2-fold effect of metformin on glucose transport in skeletal muscle (13Mu J.

Hundal H.S. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1978-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This enhancement was evident at multiple mannose concentrations (panel b). Uptake of mannose by MSMT was dependent upon assay duration (panel c), and the full effect of metformin required 12 h of treatment (panel d). Compared with basal mannose transport, MSMT was approximately 10 times more sensitive to inhibition by unlabeled mannose (panel e), consistent with a higher affinity. This difference between basal and MSMT is seen more clearly by directly measuring transport with different concentrations of [3H]mannose of a constant specific activity (panel f). MSMT became saturated with ∼1mm mannose, although the dependence of basal mannose transport upon concentration was linear with as much as 30 mm mannose (panel f and data not shown). Thus, two fibroblast mannose transport activities were discernible: a high capacity/low affinity basal mannose transport activity in untreated fibroblasts, and an MSMT activity with lower capacity but higher affinity (EC50 value ∼0.5 mm, Fig. 2, panel f). Detailed kinetic comparisons could not be performed, because calculation of MSMT was associated with unacceptable experimental error at mannose concentrations above 2 mm. At first glance, the stimulation of mannose transport shown in Fig. 2 may appear modest and not representative of a substantial biochemical effect. However, as shown below, this increase is best explained by a robust stimulation of a transporter that is expressed weakly in untreated cells, rather than the doubling of an existing transporter. Basal and Metformin-stimulated Mannose Transport Involve Distinct Transporters—To assess whether basal transport and MSMT were due to distinct transporters, inhibition by phloretin and phlorizin was evaluated. The effects of phloretin on basal and MSMT were indistinguishable (Fig. 3, panel a), with greater than 80% inhibition by 100 μm phloretin. In contrast, MSMT was resistant to inhibition by 0.5 mm phlorizin, although basal mannose transport was inhibited by about half, consistent with two distinct transport activities. Both were strongly inhibited with 2.5 mm phlorizin (panel b). To evaluate the possible roles of glucose transporters in MSMT, uptake of 0.6 and 100 μm 2dG and 3mG, both commonly used substrates for glucose transporters, were compared with mannose (Fig. 4). In surprising contrast to the enhancing effects of metformin on glucose transport by skeletal muscle (13Mu J. Brozinick Jr., T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 15Fryer L.G. Hajduch E. Rencurel F. Salt I.P. Hundal H.S. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1978-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and mannose transport by fibroblasts (Fig. 2; Fig. 4, panels a and d), transport measured with both glucose derivatives was decreased by metformin treatment (Fig. 4, panels b, c, e, and f). Thus, it is unlikely that MSMT is due to the activity of a conventional glucose transporter. Instead, the model presented in Fig. 1 is applicable. 2dG is equivalent to 2-deoxy-d-mannose, and as will be shown below, basal mannose transport tolerated epimerization at the 2-position. Thus, it is possible that the same transporter (transporter 2 in Fig. 1) was responsible for basal transport of both mannose and 2dG. However, because neither basal mannose transport nor MSMT tolerated substitutions at the 3-position (below), a different transporter was involved in basal transport of 3mG (transporter 1 in Fig. 1). With both 0.6 and 100 μm hexose, the basal capacities for mannose and 2dG transport were comparable and about 10-fold greater than for 3mG, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. Comparisons of the effects of 0.5 mm phlorizin on transport of 0.6 and 100 μm mannose, 2dG, and 3mG helped to distinguish further the transport activities (Fig. 4) and support the model shown in Fig. 1. 0.5 mm phlorizin was without effect on transport of 3mG, in the absence or presence of metformin (Fig. 4, panels c and f), or on MSMT (Fig. 3, panel b). However, 0.5 mm phlorizin partially inhibited basal mannose transport. Thus, the apparent decrease of total mannose transport by phlorizin in metformin-treated cells (black bars in Fig. 4, panels a and d) can be accounted for by the decrease in basal transport. Like basal mannose transport, basal 2dG transport was partially inhibited by 0.5 mm phlorizin (white bars in panels b and e), suggesting that both sugars were transported by the same phlorizin-sensitive transporter under basal conditions (transporter 2 in Fig. 1). Because metformin diminished 2dG transport (Fig. 4, panels b and e), it is possible that the same metformin-inhibitable transporter responsible for 3mG uptake (transporter 1 in Fig. 1), might also be responsible for transport of a portion of 2dG. However, in the presence of 0.5 mm phlorizin, metformin had little or no effect on 2dG transport. This result suggests that the inhibition of basal 2dG transport activity by phlorizin was counter-acted by a phlorizin-resistant 2dG transport activity stimulated by metformin. The latter activity could be due to 2dG uptake by transporter 3 (Fig. 1). Consistent with this, MSMT was moderately inhibited by 2dG (Table I). If so, each of the three transporters suggested in Fig. 1 would contribute to uptake of 2dG. Phloretin, phlorizin, and some of the inhibitors listed in Table I required the vehicles ethanol and Me2SO. Curiously, basal mannose transport activity was more sensitive to inhibition by 5% ethanol (66.8 ± 1.5% inhibition, n = 3) and 0.2 mm Me2SO (26.7 ± 1.6% inhibition, n = 9) than was MSMT (less than 10% inhibition by each), suggesting that MSMT may be more resistant to disruptive effects of these solvents. Specificity of Metformin-stimulated Mannose Transport— Table I lists the effects of 5 mm concentrations of saccharides on mannose transport and reveals additional differences between basal and MSMT. Up to 1 mm glucose inhibited only a minor fraction of the total mannose transport (Fig. 5), so these assays were done in the presence of 0.5 or 1 mm glucose to provide a source of energy. Low glucose concentrations were used in mannose uptake assays with fibroblasts in a previous study (5Panneerselvam K. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9417-9421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 5mm mannose and 5 mm glucose inhibited both the basal and MSMT activities (Table I), and consistent with the results of Figs. 2 and 5, basal mannose transport was somewhat less sensitive in each case. Thus, inhibitors of basal transport or MSMT could have axial or equatorial conformations for the 2-hydroxyl of hexose ring. Consequently, 5 mm 2dG, which lacks the 2-hydroxyl, also inhibited both activities (transporters 2 and 3 in Fig. 1) even though it did not appear to be a good substrate for the latter. GlcNAc was not an inhibitor, indicating that a bulky group at the 2-position was not tolerated. Neither d-altrose (the 3-epimer of mannose) nor d-allose (the 3-epimer of glucose) were effective inhibitors of either basal or MSMT activity, indicating that the 3-equatorial conformation is strongly preferred. 3mG caused mild inhibition of basal, but not MSMT activity, suggesting that bulky groups at the 3-position were not tolerated by MSMT. d-Talose (the 4-epimer of mannose) was a better inhibitor of basal mannose transport than of MSMT. This indicated that MSMT had a preference for equatorial conformations of the 4-hydroxyl, consistent with the observation that d-galactose (the 4-epimer of glucose) was unable to inhibit MSMT. d-Xylose, the 6-demethoxy analogue of glucose, inhibited neither basal nor MSMT activity indicating a requirement for the 6-methoxy group. None of the methyl- or phosphomannosides or glucosides tested, whether in α or β linkage, significantly inhibited either basal or MSMT, indicating that neither activity tolerated modification of the 1-position. Thus, as expected the transporters recognized free sugars but not glycosides. However, basal and MSMT were somewhat inhibited by 5 mm concentrations of para-nitrophenyl and methylumbelliferyl glycosides, suggesting a possible interaction with the aglycone. In summary, MSMT (transporter 3 in Fig. 1) can be distinguished from basal mannose transport (transporter 2 in Fig. 1) by the greater sensitivity of MSMT for inhibition by mannose and glucose, less tolerance for bulky groups at the 3-position (this property also distinguishes MSMT from transporter 1 in Fig. 1), less tolerance for epimerization of the 4-position, greater resistance to phlorizin, and relative resistance to disruptive effects of ethanol and Me2SO. Presumably, the basal transport of mannose observed in these studies is due to the combined actions of the high affinity (Kuptake = 35 μm) and low affinity (Kuptake = 850 μm) mannose transport activities reported previously in human dermal fibroblasts (5Panneerselvam K. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9417-9421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Apparently, the basal uptake data presented here (Fig. 2 and data not shown) did not have sufficient resolution to distinguish these two mannose transport activities. Interestingly, both the basal activity reported here and the high affinity mannose transporter reported earlier (5Panneerselvam K. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9417-9421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) retained about half of their activities in 0.5 mm phlorizin (Fig. 3) and physiological, i.e. 5 mm, glucose (Fig. 5). In contrast, MSMT was insensitive to 0.5 mm phlorizin, yet completely inhibited by physiological glucose, indicative of a specialized function (see below). Additional evidence dist"
