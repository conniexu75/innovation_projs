https://openalex.org/W1963872182,"Primary and secondary hypertriglyceridemia is common in the general population, but the biochemical basis for this disease is largely unknown. With the use of transgenic technology, two lines of mice were created that express the human apolipoprotein CIII gene. One of these mouse lines with 100 copies of the gene was found to express large amounts of the protein and to be severely hypertriglyceridemic. The other mouse line with one to two copies of the gene expressed low amounts of the protein, but nevertheless manifested mild hypertriglyceridemia. Thus, overexpression of apolipoprotein CIII can be a primary cause of hypertriglyceridemia in vivo and may provide one possible etiology for this common disorder in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1874621311,"Endothelins (ET) are a family of regulatory peptides synthesized by selected endothelial and epithelial cells that act in a paracrine fashion on nearby smooth muscle or connective tissue cells. We review the pathways of transmembrane signaling triggered by binding of endothelin peptides to receptors on the plasma membrane. Although our understanding of many components is unclear, endothelin peptides appear to evoke a phosphoinositide-linked signaling system that bears a striking resemblance to signaling pathways activated by other regulatory peptides. Expression of endothelin receptors and specific pathways stimulated by activated receptors are controlled in a cell- and tissue-specific manner, which perhaps explains the diverse biological actions of endothelin in different tissues. Complex negative feedback pathways regulate endothelin-induced signaling at the receptor and second messenger levels. Moreover, by regulating the activity of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins, short-term signals by ET can be extended to long-term effects involving gene expression. Regulation of gene expression by ET could account for complex events such as mitogenesis and vascular and tissue remodeling in disease."
https://openalex.org/W1596638623,"In previous studies we demonstrated that peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) were coupled to steroidogenesis in several adrenocortical and Leydig cell systems (Mukhin, A.G., Papadopoulos, V., Costa, E., and Krueger, K.E. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 9813-9816; Papadopoulos, V., Mukhin, A.G., Costa, E., and Krueger, K.E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3772-3779). The current study elucidates the specific step in the steroid biosynthetic pathway by which PBR mediate the stimulation in steroid hormone production. The adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-responsive Y-1 mouse adrenocortical cell line was used to compare the mechanisms by which ACTH and PK 11195 (a PBR ligand) stimulate steroidogenesis. The effects of these agents were studied at three stages along the steroid biosynthetic pathway: 1) secretion of 20 alpha OH-progesterone by Y-1 cell cultures; 2) pregnenolone production by isolated mitochondrial fractions; 3) quantities of cholesterol resident in outer and inner mitochondrial membrane fractions. Steroid synthesis stimulated by ACTH was blocked by cycloheximide, an effect documented by other laboratories characterized by an accumulation of mitochondrial cholesterol specifically in the outer membrane. In contrast, PK 11195-stimulated steroidogenesis was not inhibited by cycloheximide, and the magnitude of the stimulation was markedly enhanced when the cells were pretreated with cycloheximide and ACTH. When isolated mitochondria were used, stimulation of pregnenolone production by PK 11195 was largely independent of exogenously supplied cholesterol, indicating that PBR act on cholesterol already situated within the mitochondrial membranes. This phenomenon was found to be the result of a translocation of cholesterol from outer to inner mitochondrial membranes induced by the PBR ligand. These studies therefore suggest that mitochondrial intermembrane cholesterol transport in steroidogenic cells is mediated by a mechanism coupled to PBR."
https://openalex.org/W1942971202,"Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common mechanisms for controlling protein function. We now know that most phosphoproteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites and that these sites are often located in clusters. From the study of the enzyme glycogen synthase, one mechanism for the formation of phosphorylation clusters has been discovered that involves the concerted action of two or more protein kinases. One protein kinase, the primary kinase, introduces a phosphate group that is a requirement for the action of another, secondary, protein kinase. Thus the multiple phosphorylation occurs in a hierarchal fashion. This mechanism, which is critical for the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, is likely to be a much more widespread phenomenon.— Roach, P. J. Control of glycogen synthase by hierarchal protein phosphorylation. FASEB J. 4: 2961-2968; 1990."
https://openalex.org/W1944685607,"Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified rabbit skeletal muscle L-type calcium channel before and after reduction of disulfide bonds confirmed that 27- and 24-kDa forms of the delta subunit are disulfide-linked to the 143-kDa alpha 2 subunit. The amino acid sequences of three peptides obtained by tryptic digestion of the delta subunits corresponded to amino acid sequences predicted from the 3' region of the mRNA encoding alpha 2. One of these peptides had the same sequence as the N terminus of the 24- and 27-kDa forms of the delta subunit and corresponded to residues 935-946 of the predicted alpha 2 primary sequence. Anti-peptide antibodies directed to regions on the N-terminal side of this site recognized the 143-kDa alpha 2 subunit in immunoblots of purified calcium channels under reducing conditions, whereas an antipeptide antibody directed toward a sequence on the C-terminal side of this site recognized 24- and 27-kDa forms of the delta subunit. A similar result was obtained after immunoblotting using purified transverse tubules or crude microsomal membrane preparations indicating that alpha 2 and delta occur as distinct disulfide-linked polypeptides in skeletal muscle membranes. Thus, the delta subunits are encoded by the same gene as the alpha 2 subunit and are integral components of the skeletal muscle calcium channel."

https://openalex.org/W1540596982,"The effect of annexin VI (67-kDa calcimedin) on the activity of the Ca2+ release channel was studied using heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes reconstituted into planar bilayers. Annexin VI, in a range of 5-40 nM, modified the gating behavior of the Ca2+ release channel by increasing the probability of opening by 2.7-fold and the mean open time by 82-fold relative to controls. Annexin VI caused no change in the slope conductance of the channel. The modulatory effect of annexin VI on the activity of Ca2+ release channels was Ca2+ dependent, and the annexin VI-modified channel was sensitive to both ruthenium red and ryanodine. The effect of annexin VI was observed when this protein was added specifically to the trans chamber, which corresponds to the luminal side of sarcoplasmic reticulum as determined by the ATP activation of the channel. In addition, differential extraction studies demonstrated that some annexin VI is localized within the lumen of the isolated heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles prepared by several different procedures. Annexin VI did not modify, from either the cis or trans chambers, the activity of K+ or Cl- channels from sarcoplasmic reticulum or the dihydropyridine sensitive Ca2+ channel from transverse tubules. In addition, the 38-kDa core proteolytic fragments of annexin VI had no effect on the Ca2+ release channel activity. Annexin VI is therefore a candidate for a physiological modulator of the Ca2+ release channel and as such, may play an important role in the excitation-contraction coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1580410247,"Increases in cell phosphatidic acid content occur in response to a wide variety of agonists, many of which have growth promoting properties. These changes have correlated with calcium flux, enzyme activation, gene induction, or cell proliferation. In the current studies we show that exogenous phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylserine stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and DNA synthesis in cultured human renal mesangial cells. These phospholipids also induce mRNAs for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The activation of phospholipase C by PA appears to be desensitized via protein kinase C as brief preincubation with phorbol ester abrogates the effect. PA-induced DNA synthesis is only partly mediated via protein kinase C as co-incubation with the inhibitor staurosporine blunts DNA synthesis by only one-third. In contrast, induction of PDGF A-chain mRNA is almost totally inhibited by staurosporine. We propose that changes in endogenous phospholipids such as PA or phosphatidylserine may serve as common signaling pathway for a variety of growth factors. Induction of PDGF proto-oncogenes via protein kinase C may represent one mechanism by which this cell activation occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1606805257,"HL60 cells have types A and B tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors whereas HEp2 cells have only the type B receptor (Hohmann, H.-P., Remy, R., Brockhaus, M., and van Loon, A.P.G.M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14927-14934). TNF-beta can be cross-linked to each of these receptors and competes with TNF-alpha for binding to both receptors. TNF-alpha and TNF-beta activate the transcription factor NF-kappa B in HL60 and HEp2 cells. Maximal activation of NF-kappa B required binding of TNF-alpha or TNF-beta to 20-25% of the total number of TNF receptors and was achieved within minutes after the addition of TNF-alpha to HL60 cells. Both TNF-alpha and TNF-beta activate NF-kappa B at 5-10-fold lower concentrations in HL60 cells compared with HEp2 cells, and this correlates well with their different affinities for binding to these cells. Thus, TNF-alpha and TNF-beta are indistinguishable with respect to the correlation between degrees of receptor binding and activation of NF-kappa B."
https://openalex.org/W1561081856,"The transposon Tn10-encoded tetracycline resistance protein functions as a metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter (Yamaguchi, A., Udagawa, T., and Sawai, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4809-4813). The Ser65-Asp66 dipeptide is conserved in all known tetracycline antiporter proteins and is an important target for site-directed mutagenesis. When Asp66 was replaced by Asn, the transport activity was completely lost, whereas when it was replaced by Glu, the activity was reduced to 10% of the wild-type level, indicating that a negative charge at position 66 is essential for tetracycline transport. Replacement of Ser65 by Cys or Ala, in contrast, caused only a minor change in tetracycline transport activity. However, the Cys65 mutant antiporter was sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents. Complete inactivation of the Cys65 antiporter by N-ethylmaleimide was not prevented by the substrate. A less bulky reagent, methyl methanethiosulfonate, caused partial inactivation of the Cys65 antiporter without changing its affinity to the substrate. These results indicate that a region including the dipeptide plays an important role in metal-tetracycline transport except for substrate binding. It may act as a gate which opens on the charge-charge interaction between Asp66 and the metal-tetracycline."
https://openalex.org/W1574907524,"Abstract Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) gene expression is regulated by the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), by cyclic AMP analogues, and the cAMP agonist, forskolin. Based on nuclear run-on transcription assays, t-PA expression is modulated by PMA on the level of transcription. 8-Bromo-cyclic AMP and forskolin do not induce t-PA gene transcription alone but act synergistically with PMA. These effects are confirmed by transient expression assays in HeLa cells employing deletion mutants of the t-PA gene promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Constitutive expression and most of the PMA-mediated induction requires sequences downstream of position -145. DNase I protection (footprint) analysis of this region reveals two protein-binding sites: one between position -102 and -115, differing from the consensus sequence of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) by the substitution of an adenine for a guanine in the middle of the core motif (TGACATCA), and another, located in the first exon (between position +60 and +74), displaying homology to the consensus sequence of the activator protein 2- (AP-2) binding site (CCCCACCCCC). Base substitutions in the core of either the CRE-like element or the AP-2 site suppress constitutive CAT expression by over 80%, whereas the relative PMA- and PMA plus cAMP-mediated responses are retained. CAT expression is below the detection limit when both elements are mutagenized together. Hence, the CRE-like element and the exon-located AP-2-binding site have a cooperative impact on basal transcription, but each element can independently convey the effect of activators of the protein kinase C- and A-dependent pathways of signal transduction. The results of band-shift analysis and competition titration experiments demonstrate that the CRE-like element acts as a low affinity binding site for the same proteins which recognize the authentic CRE."
https://openalex.org/W1589509381,"A series of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) structural analogs in which one or more of the three tyrosine residues were replaced with nonaromatic residues were produced and their binding properties characterized. The single point mutations, [Leu24]IGF-I, [Ala31]IGF-I, and [Leu60]IGF-I result in an 18-, 6-, or 20-fold loss in affinity, respectively, for the type 1 IGF receptor. Multiple mutations, [Ala31,Leu60]IGF-I, [Leu24, Ala31]IGF-I, [Leu24, Leu60]IGF-I, or [Leu24, Ala31, Leu60]IGF-I result in a 520-, 240-, 1200-, or greater than 1200-fold loss in affinity, respectively, at the type 1 IGF receptor. In contrast, none of the analogs display greater than a 2-fold loss in affinity for the acid-stable human serum binding proteins. At the insulin receptor, [Ala31]IGF-I and [Leu24]IGF-I are equipotent to and 5-fold less potent than IGF-I, whereas [Leu60]IGF-I and the multiple mutation analogs are inactive up to 10 microM. Analogs [Leu24]IGF-I, [Ala31]IGF-I, and [Leu24, Ala31]IGF-I are equipotent to IGF-I at the type 2 IGF receptor, whereas all analogs containing Leu60 demonstrate little measurable affinity at this receptor. Thus, Tyr24, Tyr31, and Tyr60 are involved in the high affinity binding of IGF-I to the type 1 IGF receptor, while Tyr60 is important for maintaining binding to the type 2 IGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1641379836,"The UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins collectively catalyze the dual incision of a damaged DNA strand in an ATP-dependent reaction. We previously reported (Orren, D. K., and Sancar, A. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 5237-5241) that UvrA delivers UvrB to damaged sites in DNA; upon addition of UvrC to these UvrB.DNA complexes, the DNA is incised. In the present study, we have further characterized both the delivery of UvrB to DNA and the subsequent incision process, with emphasis on the role of ATP in these reactions. The UvrA-dependent delivery of UvrB onto damaged DNA is relatively slow (kon approximately 6 x 10(4) M-1 s-1) and requires ATP hydrolysis (Km = 120 microM). Although ATP enhances the stability of UvrB.DNA complexes (koff = 8.5 x 10(-5) s-1), the isolated UvrB.DNA complexes do not contain any covalently attached or stably bound nucleotide. However, ATP binding is required for the UvrC-dependent dual incision of DNA bound by UvrB. Interestingly, adenosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate can substitute for ATP at this step. The Km for ATP during incision is 2 microM, but ATP is not hydrolyzed at a detectable level during the incision reaction. The incisions made by UvrB-UvrC are on both sides of the adduct and result in the excision of the damaged nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W2011070372,"In 1988 to 1989, 698 adult cadavers in Abidjan's two largest morgues were studied, representing 38 to 43% of all adult deaths in the city over the study period, and 6 to 7% of annual deaths. Forty-one percent of male and 32% of female cadavers were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Fifteen percent of adult male and 13% of adult female annual deaths are due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In Abidjan, AIDS is the leading cause of death and years of potential life lost in adult men, followed by unintentional injuries and tuberculosis. In women, AIDS is the second leading cause of death and premature mortality, after deaths related to pregnancy and abortion. AIDS-specific and AIDS-proportional mortality rates may be higher in other African cities where AIDS has been found for a longer time than in Abidjan."
https://openalex.org/W1618858311,"Abstract In vitro biochemical assays are typically performed using very dilute solutions of components. On the other hand, total intracellular concentrations of solutes are very high, resulting in an in vivo environment that is significantly volume-occupied. In vitro studies with the DNA replication proteins of bacteriophage T4 have revealed anomalously weak binding of T4 gene 45 protein to the rest of the replication complex. We have used inert solutes to mimic typical intracellular solution conditions of high volume occupancy to investigate the effects of macromolecular on the binding equilibria involved in the assembly of the T4 polymerase accessory proteins complex. The same approach was also used to study the assembly of this complex with T4 DNA polymerase (gene 43 protein) and T4 single-stranded DNA binding protein (gene 32 protein) to form the five protein holoenzyme. We find that the apparent association constant (Ka) of gene 45 for gene 44/62 proteins in forming both the accessory protein complex and the holoenzyme increases markedly (from approximately 7 x 10(6) to approximately 3.5 x 10(8) M-1) as a consequence of adding polymers such as polyethylene glycol and dextran. Although the processivity of the polymerase alone is not directly effected by the addition of such polymers to the solution, crowding does significantly stabilize the holoenzyme and thus indirectly increases the observed processivity of the holoenzyme complex. The use of crowding to increase the stability of multienzyme complexes in general is discussed, as is the relevance of these results to DNA replication in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1511443862,"It was known in the 1950s that hepatic microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase plays an important role in the regulation of blood glucose levels. All attempts since then to purify a single polypeptide with glucose-6-phosphatase activity have failed. Until recently, virtually nothing was known about the molecular basis of glucose-6-phosphatase or its regulation. Recent studies of the type 1 glycogen storage diseases, which are human genetic deficiencies that result in impaired glucose-6-phosphatase activity, have greatly increased our understanding of glucose-6-phosphatase. Glucose-6-phosphatase has been shown to comprise at least five different polypeptides, the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase with its active site situated in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum; a regulatory Ca2+ binding protein; and three transport proteins, T1, T2, and T3, which respectively allow glucose-6-phosphate, phosphate, and glucose to cross the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Purified glucose-6-phosphatase proteins, immunospecific antibodies, and improved assay techniques have led to the diagnosis of a variety of new type 1 glycogen storage diseases. Recent studies of the type 1 glycogen storage diseases have led to a much greater understanding of the role and regulation of each of the glucose-6-phosphatase proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2099866835,"Previous studies on rabbit thrombomodulin (TM) re- vealed that certain anticoagulant activities expressed by TM depend on the presence of an acidic domain tentatively identified as a sulfated galactosaminogly- can (Bourin, M.-C., dhlin, A.-K., Lane, D., Stenflo, J., and Lindahl, U. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8044- 8052). The glycan was released by alkaline &elimi- nation, isolated by ion-exchange chromatography, and radiolabeled by partial N-deacetylation (hydrazino- lysis) followed by re-N-[3H]acetylation. The labeled product behaved like standard chondroitin sulfate on ion-exchange chromatography, exhibited a M. of lo- 12 x lo3 on gel chromatography, and was susceptible to degradation by chondroitinase and testicular hya- luronidase. The major labeled degradation products following digestion of the glycosaminoglycan with chondroitinase were identified, depending on the in- cubation conditions, either as 4/6-mono-O-sulfated, 4,5-unsaturated disaccharides (AHexA-GalNAc(S)) and N-acetylgalactosamine 4,6-di-O-sulfate (GalcNAc (dis)), the latter component accounting for -25% of the total label, or as a major fraction of labeled trisac- charide, with the predominant structure GalNAc(diS)- GlcA-GalNAc(diS). The terminal GalNAc(diS) unit (not substituted at C3) was shown to be more suscep- tible to N-deacetylation during hydrazinolysis than were the internal GalNAc units (substituted at C3), and thus was more extensively labeled, resulting in over- representation of this unit. It is concluded that rabbit TM is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, which car- ries a single glycan side chain characterized by an unusual accumulation of sulfate groups at the nonre- ducing terminus. Metabolically 35S-labeled TM was isolated from cultured rabbit heart endothelial cells and characterized as a chondroitin sulfate proteogly- can which accounted for l-2% of the total 35S-labeled cell-associated macromolecules. The isolated chondroi- tin sulfate showed weaker antithrombin-dependent anticoagulant activity, on a molar basis, than the intact TM proteoglycan. The anticoagulant action of TM thus depends on a unique form of functional collaboration between the different constituents of a glycoconjugate."
https://openalex.org/W2062568205,"L. collosoma or C. elegans SL RNA sequences joined to an adenovirus intron and 3′ exon are spliced highly efficiently and accurately in HeLa nuclear extract. After inactivation of U1 snRNPs using RNAase H and a deoxyollgonucleotide complementary to the first 12 nucleotides of U1, splicing of SL RNA-containing constructs continues undiminished, whereas control substrates no longer splice. Since neither binding of U1 snRNPs nor inhibition of splicing is detected using anti-(U1)RNP antibodies, splicing of SL RNA-containing constructs may be entirely U1 snRNP independent. Analyses of altered L. collosoma constructs revealed that the sequence surrounding the 5′ splice site is not sufficient to confer U1-independent splicing; the smallest U1-independent region identified so far retains only the first stem-loop of the SL RNA. That sequences responsible for recognition of the 5′ splice site can be relocated within the splicing substrate itself reinforces the similarity between group II self-splicing and spliceosome-mediated pre-mRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1482872668,"Activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase requires participation of membrane-bound cytochrome b558 and cytosol proteins of 47 kDa (p47) and 67 kDa (p67). We examined the sequence of participation of p47 and p67 in activation of the oxidase using an arachidonate-activated cell-free superoxidase (O2-) generating assay requiring phagocyte membrane and cytosol. Neutrophil cytosol from patients with certain forms of autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) lack either p47 or p67. Initial incubation of membrane and arachidonate with CGD cytosol deficient in either p47 or p67 fails to generate superoxide in the cell-free assay until addition of complementary cytosol. CGD cytosol was incubated with arachidonate and membrane for 5-15 min and the lag time of O2- generation was measured after addition of complementary CGD cytosol. The lag time is shortened when p47, but not p67, is present in the initial incubation. We have previously shown that the peptide, RGVHFIF, corresponding to a cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of cytochrome b558, inhibits activation of NADPH oxidase in the cell-free assay, but does not affect the enzyme activity of fully assembled oxidase. Experiments with sequential addition of complementary CGD cytosols were performed as above, except that RGVHFIF was added after the initial incubation. The peptide failed to inhibit when added after initial incubation if p47 was present during that incubation. In contrast, the peptide markedly inhibited oxidase activity if p47 was absent during the initial incubation. These results suggest that p47, but not p67, is a participant with membrane and/or other cytosol components in early arachidonate-dependent reactions. In the absence of p67, these reactions culminate in the irreversible formation of a metastable activation intermediate that is insensitive to inhibition by RGVHFIF. After addition of p67, this activation intermediate subsequently reacts to form the active NADPH oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1671632725,"Abstract A priming mechanism requiring dnaA, dnaB, and dnaC proteins operates on a single-stranded DNA coated with single-stranded DNA-binding protein. This novel priming, referred to as ABC-priming, requires a specific hairpin structure whose stem carries a dnaA protein recognition sequence (dnaA box). In conjunction with primase and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, ABC-priming can efficiently convert single-stranded DNA into the duplex replicative form. dnaA protein specifically recognizes and binds the single-stranded hairpin and permits the loading of dnaB protein to form a prepriming protein complex containing dnaA and dnaB proteins which can be physically isolated. ABC-priming can replace phi X174 type priming on the lagging strand template of pBR322 in vitro, suggesting a possible function of ABC-priming for the lagging strand synthesis and duplex unwinding. Similar to the phi X174 type priming, a mobile nature of ABC-priming was indicated by helicase activity in the presence of ATP of a prepriming protein complex formed at the hairpin. The implications of this novel priming in initiation of replication at the chromosomal origin, oriC, and in its contribution to the replication fork are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1846429388,"An electropermeabilized preparation of frog retinal rod outer segments (ROS) has been developed to examine the light sensitivity and amplification of visual transduction reactions in a minimally disturbed environment. Electropermeabilized ROS are indistinguishable from whole and osmotically intact ROS in the light microscope and retain 3-fold more protein than mechanically disrupted ROS. They differ from mechanically fragmented ROS in several respects. Illumination results in more amplified activation of the GTP-binding protein transducin (Gt) than previously observed: bleaching as little as approximately 1 rhodopsin molecule (Rho*) in every 10 disks within a single ROS activates 37,000 molecules of Gt per Rho*, equivalent to 70% of the light-activatable Gt present on a single disk face. This amplification is maintained over approximately 1 decade of light intensity but drops sharply as disk faces begin to absorb a second photon. Lower amplification is observed in fragmented ROS and derives from the fact that physical disruption of ROS causes Gt to bind GTP and elute from the membrane, thus decreasing the amount remaining and available for light activation. Illumination of electropermeabilized ROS in the presence of GTP or of the nonhydrolyzable substrate guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) causes redistribution of Gt: an amount (approximately 20 mmol/mol Rho) equivalent to the amount of inhibitory gamma subunit of phosphodiesterase (PDE) remains internal and bound to nucleotide, and the remaining activated Gt diffuses out in a manner graded with light intensity. This suggests that PDE activation by Gt alpha may not require dissociation of Gt alpha bound to the gamma subunit of PDE in a form than can elute from ROS. Two further differences between electropermeabilized and mechanically disrupted ROS are noted: the addition of ATP to electropermeabilized ROS does not affect the light sensitivity or kinetics of the GTP binding reaction, and a specificity for light-induced GTP versus GDP binding is observed."
https://openalex.org/W1560310527,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a hexatriacontapeptide amide, is present in high concentrations in the mammalian heart. Specific receptors of NPY in rat cardiac ventricular membranes have been characterized recently in our laboratory. Structure-activity studies with selected partial sequences of NPY revealed that NPY(18-36) inhibited the binding of 125I-NPY to rat cardiac ventricular membranes but had no effect on the cardiac adenylate cyclase activity. NPY, as previously reported, inhibited the cardiac adenylate cyclase activity. These observations suggested that NPY (18-36) may be an antagonist of NPY in cardiac membranes. Consistent with this observation, the presence of NPY (18-36) (1 microM) shifted the inhibitory adenylate cyclase activity dose-response curve of NPY to the right in a parallel fashion. Furthermore, NPY(18-36) (1 microM) completely abolished the effect of NPY (10 nM) that alone caused 80% of the maximum inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. These findings confirm that NPY(18-36) is a competitive antagonist of NPY in rat cardiac ventricular membranes. NPY cardiac receptor antagonist, NPY(18-36), or analogs based on this sequence may have potential clinical application, since NPY has been implicated in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W1585884201,"Irradiation of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. cv. Russian Mammoth) hypocotyls with white light resulted in a 51% decrease in plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP) kinase activity. As little as 10 s of white light irradiation was sufficient to lower the phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) produced in the in vitro phosphorylation assay. This decrease was not caused by an increase in phospholipase C activity since analysis of the water-soluble products indicated no increase in inositol bisphosphate or inositol trisphosphate. Treatment of the plasma membrane with 200 microM vanadate prior to phosphorylation enhanced the PIP kinase and appeared to overcome the light inhibition. In addition to decreasing the PIP kinase activity, light irradiation resulted in a corresponding decrease in the H(+)-ATPase activity to 53% of the dark control values. The plasma membrane ATPase activity increased approximately 2-fold when PIP or PIP2 was added to the isolated membranes. Thus, effects of external stimuli on the level of plasma membrane PIP or PIP2 could affect plasma membrane ATPase activity directly and thereby provide an alternative mechanism for control of cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1572124770,"We examined changes in the levels of the dolichol forms in Chinese hamster ovary cells containing alterations in the levels of activity of two enzymes in the oligosaccharyl-P-P-dolichol biosynthetic pathway, namely UDP-GlcNAc:dolichyl phosphate:GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase) and mannosylphosphoryldolichol (Man-P-Dol) synthase. Under normal conditions in wild type cells, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-pyrophosphoryldolichol was the most abundant form. Of the other anionic forms of dolichols, dolichyl phosphate, Man-P-Dol, glucosylphosphoryldolichol, and Man5GlcNAc2-pyrophosphoryl dolichol were approximately equally abundant. When 3E11 cells (a tunicamycin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary line containing 15 times more GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity than wild type), B4-2-1 cells (a mutant lacking Man-P-Dol synthase activity), and wild type cells incubated with or without tunicamycin were utilized, significant changes in the levels of most of the anionic dolichol derivatives, with the exception of dolichyl phosphate, were found. Since changes in dolichyl phosphate levels were not detected under a variety of conditions where the levels of enzyme activity utilizing this substrate were varied, all three enzymes appear to have access to the same pool of dolichyl phosphate, and further, to have similar Km values for dolichyl phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1600007162,"The dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2) component contains a COOH-terminal inner domain (E2I) and an extended NH2-terminal structure, which is composed of two lipoyl domains (the fragment containing both is designated as E2L) and a subunit-binding domain (E2B). The four domains are connected by hinge regions. A subcomplex, composed of an oligomer of E2 subunits, protein X (which also has an NH2-terminal lipoyl domain), and the [pyruvate dehydrogenase]-kinase catalytic and basic subunits (Kc and Kb, respectively) (i.e. E2.X.KcKb subcomplex), was treated with Clostridium histolyticum collagenase. E2 subunits were selectively cleaved at the NH2-terminal end of the E2B domain, releasing the E2L fragment. Complete release of E2 subunits also released the kinase subunits, indicating that the kinase is bound to the E2L portion of E2. The residual inner core subcomplex (designated E2IB.X) has a strong tendency to aggregate, but this can be reversed with heparin (1 mg/ml). The E2IB.X subcomplex binds the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) components. The E1 component, which binds to the E2B domain, blocked collagenase cleavage of E2. We evaluated the capacity of the collagenase-treated E2.X.KcKb subcomplex, from which different portions of the E2L domains were removed, to support (in combination with excess levels of the E1 and E3 components) the overall reaction of the complex. Loss of activity occurred only after more than half of the E2L domains were removed. This delay is in sharp contrast to the effect of selective removal of the lipoyl domain of protein X, which leads to an immediate decrease in activity (Gopalakrishnan, S., Rahmatullah, M., Radke, G.-A., Powers-Greenwood, S. L., and Roche, T. E. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 160, 715-721). These results suggest that multiple lipoyl domains of the E2 component service the rate-limiting E1 component. After all the E2L domains were removed and the E2IB.X subcomplex was separated from free E2L, 10% activity was retained in the overall reaction. Thus, the lipoyl domain of protein X supported the overall reaction of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1483885724,"To examine whether the norpA (no receptor potential A) gene encodes a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) in the eye of Drosophila, a major PLC in the extract from normal Drosophila heads, which was absent in the extract from norpA mutant heads, and purified and its partial amino acid sequences were determined. The purification of the major PLC in KCl extract from normal Drosophila heads was achieved by sequential column chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, Mono Q, Superose 12, Mono S, second Mono S, and second Mono Q, followed by column chromatography on Superose 12 in the presence of 1% sodium cholate. The enzyme thus purified was found to be homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 98,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed both phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Interestingly, the calcium and pH requirements for activation of the crude enzyme (KCl extract) were quite different from those of partially purified enzyme (active fraction from second Mono Q column). The maximal activity for PIP2 hydrolysis was observed at calcium concentrations between 10(-7) and 10(-5) M for both the crude and partially purified enzymes. On the other hand, the activity for PI hydrolysis of the crude enzyme increased with increasing calcium concentrations, while that of the partially purified enzyme reached a maximum at calcium concentrations between 10(-6) and 10(-4) M, and decreased at millimollar concentration. The pH dependences for PI hydrolysis of the crude enzyme and the partially purified enzyme were similar. The crude enzyme hydrolyzed PIP2 over a broad pH range from 6 to 8.5, while the activity of the partially purified enzyme monotonously increased with increasing pH. The partial amino acid sequences were determined by treating the purified enzyme with endopeptidase Lys-C; the resultant peptide fragments were purified on a high performance liquid chromatography-reverse phase column and then sequenced with sequencer. The obtained sequences were found to be a part of the deduced amino acid sequences of cDNA which was suggested to be norpA gene."
https://openalex.org/W1482190403,"Abstract Evidence is presented in support of a mechanism-based (suicide) inactivation of leukotriene A4 hydrolyase in intact human erythrocytes by leukotriene A4 and leukotriene A4 methyl ester. Loss of enzymatic activity, accompanying leukotriene B4 formation, was proportional to the substrate concentration. Inactivation was directly related to the amount of leukotriene B4 formation: for several, different experimental protocols 50% loss of hydrolase activity corresponded with formation of 10.3 +/- 2.1 microM leukotriene B4. The time course of inactivation was pseudo-first order and obeyed saturation kinetics. Apparent inactivation (KI) and first-order rate (ki) constants for leukotriene A4 were 28 microM and 0.35 min-1, respectively. Leukotriene A4 methyl ester was also a site-directed inactivator with a similar KI = 25 microM and a ki = 0.1 min-1. For single incubations substrate instability limited the extent of inactivation to 50% of the initial enzyme activity. Following multiple, consecutive incubations with leukotriene A4 this increased and approached 80-90%; however, a residual activity of 10-20% suggested that a pool of enzyme was not susceptible to inactivation. Recovery of enzymatic activity, following inactivation, was negligible in intact erythrocytes and isolated enzyme. A single radiolabeled protein, corresponding to leukotriene A4 hydrolase, was detected by electrophoretic analysis of the incubation between [3H]leukotriene A4 and erythrocytes, or partially purified enzyme. Incorporation of [3H]leukotriene A4 methyl ester into enzyme was linearly related to its inactivation: 191 +/- 5 pmol incorporated corresponded to 10% loss of activity. Results conform to criteria for a mechanism-based inactivation, in which leukotriene A4 participates in two parallel processes, one leading to leukotriene B4 formation, the other to suicide inactivation of leukotriene A4 hydrolase in intact erythrocytes. The specific, rather than indiscriminate nature of this process has implications for the regulation of cellular leukotriene B4 formation. It may also afford a basis to monitor transcellular biosynthesis of leukotriene B4 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1544816596,"The effects of five mutations at arginines 64, 69, and 73 of the Tar protein were analyzed using swarm assays, aspartate binding in purified membranes, and methylation both in vitro and in vivo. The defects in the responses of these mutant receptors to aspartate were shown to be directly attributable to reduced binding of aspartate to the receptor rather than to defects in their signaling characteristics. Mutations at residues 64, 69, and 73 reduced aspartate binding by factors of greater than 10(-4), 10(-3), and 10(-2), respectively. Once aspartate was bound, the mutants exhibited normal signaling properties. No cooperativity was observed in the coupling of aspartate binding to methylation, indicating that the monomers of the receptor dimer act independently. The in vitro methylation system was thus shown to be an effective way of measuring aspartate binding constants and examining the functional integrity of the proteins. The maltose responses of the receptor proteins were affected slightly, or not at all, in an in vivo methylation assay. Two models for the roles of these arginine residues in receptor function are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1585168522,"Recombinant human parathyroid hormone (hPTH)-(1-84) was obtained from Escherichia coli using a cleavable fusion protein strategy. The fusion protein contains residues 1-138 of human growth hormone as the amino-terminal region and residues 1-84 of hPTH as the carboxyl-terminal region. A 7-residue linker containing the recognition/cleavage sequence of the site-specific blood coagulation protease activated factor X (factor Xa) joins the two regions. Intact hPTH-(1-84) is released from this fusion protein by cleavage in vitro with factor Xa. The fusion protein was produced at a high level and formed inclusion bodies which allowed it to be easily purified by low speed centrifugation, with a yield of approximately 50 mg/liter of culture. After factor Xa cleavage and high performance liquid chromatography purification, highly purified hPTH was obtained, with a final yield of 1.5-3 mg/liter. Physical and biological characterization of the purified hormone demonstrated that it was intact and active hPTH-(1-84)."
https://openalex.org/W1594357708,"Glycation of the Na,K-ATPase in vitro (formation of Schiff base with glucose followed by reduction with NaCNBH3) shows the presence of three classes of reactive amino groups that differentially affect catalysis and cation binding. Reaction in the absence of ATP results in irreversible inhibition of enzyme activity with a t1/2 of 53 min. This is due to modification of one class of amino groups that affect the catalytic domain of the enzyme. In the presence of ATP, glycation first results in a shift in the steady state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis from substrate activation to Michaelis-Menten kinetics accompanied by an increase in the apparent affinity for K+ in the p-nitrophenylphosphatase reaction. This change in kinetic properties occurs with a t1/2 of 9 min and results in the complete loss of K+ occlusion. Incorporation of glucose is into the catalytic subunit, remote from the N-terminal end. Apparent total inhibition of K+ occlusion occurs with a stoichiometry 0.8 mol of glucose incorporated per mol of enzyme. Therefore, there is a rapidly reacting amino group that affects the cation binding domain of the Na,K-ATPase. More slowly, with a t1/2 of 9 h, the ATP hydrolysis kinetics change from Michaelis-Menten to substrate inhibition without recovery of K+ occlusion, showing that, in the E1 conformation, there is a third, slower reacting class of amino groups in the Na,K-ATPase that affects low affinity nucleotide interaction with the catalytic subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1605049434,"We have fractionated the whole cell extract of Xenopus oocytes (oocyte S-150) and isolated the endogenous components required for DNA supercoiling and nucleosome formation. Histone H2B and the three oocyte-specific H2A proteins were purified as free histones. Histones H3 and H4 were purified 100-fold in a complex with the acidic protein N1. In the presence of DNA topoisomerase I or II, histone H3/H4.N1 complexes supercoil DNA in a reaction that is inhibited by Mg2+, and this inhibition is relieved by NTPs. The supercoiling reaction induced by H3/H4.N1 complexes is enhanced by free histone H2A-H2B dimers, which by themselves do not supercoil DNA. Nuclease digestions and protein analyses indicate that H3/H4.N1 complexes form subnucleosomal particles containing histones H3 and H4. Nucleosomes containing 146-base pair DNA and the four histones are formed when histones H2A and H2B complement the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1548330054,"The gene responsible for familial vasopressin-resistant nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) has been localized to a small region of the human X-chromosome (Xq28). A series of hamster lung fibroblast and mouse lymphocyte cell lines carrying fragments of the wild type human X-chromosome was analyzed for vasopressin renal-type V2 receptor expression, to test the hypothesis that the NDI locus may have identity with the V2 receptor gene. V2 receptor binding activity and induction of cAMP production in response to [Arg8] vasopressin (AVP) were exhibited by all cell lines carrying the wild type NDI locus, in contrast to control cell lines. AVP stimulation of cAMP production was concentration-dependent and could be almost completely inhibited by co-incubation with a V2-V1 receptor-specific antagonist. The V2-specific agonist [Mpa1,Val4,Sar7]AVP was as potent as AVP in inducing cAMP production by NDI-DNA-carrying cells, whereas no response was shown to other hormones such as calcitonin, oxytocin (less than 10(-8) M), isoproterenol, or an oxytocin-specific agonist. All results were consistent with the hypothesis that the V2 receptor gene co-localized with the NDI locus, supporting the view that the loci are one and the same."
https://openalex.org/W1527851901,"A diacylglycerol (DG) kinase inhibitor, R 59 022, potentiated superoxide anion (O2-) production in guinea pig polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) induced by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). R 59 022 also potentiated O2- production induced by 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, a permeable DG. However, the production induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a direct activator for protein kinase C, was not potentiated by R 59 022. R 59 022 by itself had no significant effects on unstimulated O2- production. The potentiation of FMLP-induced O2- production by R 59 022 was correlated closely with increased formation of DG and decreased formation of phosphatidic acid, a product of DG kinase. R 59 022 had no effect on the breakdown of phosphoinositides. Phosphorylation of 46-kDa protein(s) by protein kinase C was also examined in relation to O2- production in PMNL. In coincidence with the increase in O2- production, the phosphorylation was potentiated by R 59 022 in the response to FMLP, but not in the response to PMA. In addition, staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, inhibited increases in both O2- production and phosphorylation of the 46-kDa protein(s) after PMA stimulation. Similar inhibitory effects of staurosporine were also observed upon stimulation with FMLP, irrespective of the presence of R 59 022. These results indicate that retention of DG as a result of the inhibition of further metabolism induces marked stimulation of O2- production via protein kinase C activation in PMNL. These results also provide further evidence for the close relationship between 46-kDa protein phosphorylation by protein kinase C and stimulation of O2- production in PMNL."
https://openalex.org/W1541732984,"Abstract Recent studies have shown that selection of proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin system occurs most probably by binding to specific sites of the ubiquitin-protein ligase, E3. A free alpha-NH2 residue of the substrate is one important determinant recognized by the ligase. Selective binding sites have been described for basic and bulky-hydrophobic NH2 termini (Reiss, Y., Kaim, D., and Hershko, A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2693-2698) and for alanine, serine, and threonine at the NH2-terminal position (Gonda, D. K., Bachmair, A., Wunning, I., Tobias, J. W., Lane, W. S., and Varshavsky, A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16700-16712). Proteins with acidic NH2-terminal residues are degraded by the ubiquitin system only following conversion of the acidic residue to a basic residue by the addition of an arginine moiety (Ferber, S., and Ciechanover, A. (1987) Nature 326, 808-811). Although the enzymes involved in this post-translational modification have been characterized, the underlying mechanism has been obscure. By using a chemical cross-linking technique, we demonstrate that proteins with acidic NH2 termini do not bind to E3 without prior modification of this residue by the addition of arginine. In contrast, proteins with a basic NH2-terminal residue bind to the ligase without any modification. The recognition of acidic NH2-terminal substrates by E3 is dependent upon the addition of all the components of the modifying machinery, arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase, arginyl-tRNA synthetase, tRNA, and arginine. The ligase-bound modified proteins are converted to ubiquitin conjugates in a pulse-chase experiment, indicating that the binding is functional and that the enzyme-substrate complex is an obligatory intermediate in the conjugation process. Chemical modification of the carboxyl groups, which results in their neutralization, generates substrates that bind to E3 without modification. This finding suggests that the amino-terminal binding site of E3 is negatively charged, and only positively charged amino-terminal residues may bind to it. Negatively charged (acidic) NH2-terminal residues will bind only following neutralization or reversal of the charge."
https://openalex.org/W1633926447,"Delta-opiate receptors have been solubilized with the non-ionic bile salt detergent digitonin from NG108-15 cell membranes and reconstituted into lipid vesicles. Specific opiate binding was restored to soluble receptor preparations after supplementation with a brain lipid extract, and dilution below the effective detergent concentration. Saturable and specific opiate binding was measured for both membrane and vesicle preparations; dissociation constants (Kd) obtained from saturation isotherms of [3H]bremazocine binding were 1.3 and 4.2 nM, respectively. Relative affinity (IC50) values of ligand binding measured for subtype-selective agonists confirmed that a delta-opiate binding site interaction was recovered in vesicle preparations. Changes in agonist binding affinity noted for these experiments were explained by dissociation of the GTP-binding protein Gi from the receptor in detergent. The recovery of solubilized opiate receptors was nearly quantitative, and strictly dependent upon the total brain lipid preparation used in the reconstitution. Ligand binding was incompletely recovered after substituting pure, vesicle-forming phospholipid preparations. [3H]Bremazocine binding was also reconstituted after lectin affinity chromatography of solubilized receptor preparations, using conditions which likely effect the removal of endogenous lipid cofactors. A photoaffinity cross-linking methodology was employed to verify recovery of the delta-opiate receptor after its solubilization from membranes and reconstitution. Two membrane-associated proteins (50 and 70 kDa) were covalently tagged with an azido analog of beta-endorphin(Leu5) in cell membranes and subsequently identified by immunoblotting with antisera directed against this opioid. Labeling of the 50-kDa polypeptide was prevented by coincubating assay samples with a relative excess of (D-Pen2,5)enkephalin. This opioid binding polypeptide was also present in solubilized/reconstituted receptor preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1519709368,"Abstract When human platelets are stimulated with thrombin or activators of protein kinase C, cytosolic pH (pHi) increases due to activation of Na+/H+ exchange. In order to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the exchanger, we used sodium fluoride, which is a known activator of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) in platelets. Although NaF induced the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites in fura2-loaded platelets, it failed to raise pHi as determined from the fluorescence of 2,7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-loaded platelets. Furthermore, when thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) or the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) had raised pHi from 7.13 +/- 0.05 to 7.35 +/- 0.07 (n = 30), addition of NaF (2.5-10 mM) rapidly restored pHi to values found before stimulation. Conversely, preincubation of platelets with low concentrations of NaF (2.5 mM) completely prevented alkalinization in response to thrombin or TPA. Unlike ethylisopropylamiloride, which completely blocked Na+/H+ exchange, NaF did not prevent the recovery of pHi from an artificial acid load. Hence, the inhibitory action of NaF is restricted to receptor-mediated activation of the antiport. In order to investigate whether the NaF effect was attributable to a G protein, platelets were preincubated with N-ethylmaleimide (50 microM), which is known to inhibit the adenylyl cyclase-inhibitory G protein. N-Ethylmaleimide treatment not only prevented inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by epinephrine but also completely reversed the inhibitory effect of NaF on the Na+/H+ exchanger. Our data suggest the existence of a novel G protein which is activated by fluoride and functions as a negative regulator of the Na+/H+ exchanger in platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1528956444,"The chemical properties of human renal dipeptidase (hrDP) purified from the membrane fraction of kidney have been characterized. When treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, hrDP was released from renal membrane fractions. After digestion with trypsin, carboxyl-terminal peptide was isolated employing anhydrotrypsin-agarose column chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was identified at positions 363-369 in the primary structure deduced from the cDNA sequence (Adachi, H., Tawaragi, Y., Inuzuka, C., Kubota, I., Tsujimoto, M., Nishihara, T., And Nakazato, H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3992-3995). Further examination of the chemical composion of the peptide showed that it contained, respectively, 2, 1, 5, 1, and 1 mol of ethanolamine, glucosamine, mannose, inositol, and phosphate in addition to amino acids. These results suggest that the mature hrDP molecule lacks the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic peptide extension predicted from the cDNA sequence and is anchored at Ser369 via glycosylphosphatidylinositol to the membrane. To characterize further the action of the enzyme, we have established expression systems for both secretory and membrane anchored forms of hrDP using COS-1 cells and found that both recombinant forms were as active as natural enzyme. Our expression system made it possible to prepare large amounts of soluble enzyme, and will contribute toward elucidation of the physiological roles of the enzyme."

The photoproduct of NO-Fe(III)Mb at 5 K exhibited entirely new X-band EPR absorptions in the magnetic field strength from 0 to 0.4 tesla. The widespread absorption together with distinct, sharp zero-field absorption was consistently observed in the photoproduct of the isoelectronic NO-Mn(II)Mb. These novel ERP signals indicate a spin-coupled pair with an effective spin of S = 2 between the high spin metal center (S = 5/2) and the photodissociated NO (S = 1/2) trapped adjacent to the metal center. On the other hand, the photolyzed form of nitrosyl complexes of Fe(III)- and Mn(II)-Glycera hemoglobins, in which the distal histidine of Mb is replaced by a leucyl residue, exhibited somewhat broader EPR absorptions similar to those of the corresponding native Fe(III)- or unliganded Mn(II)-Glycera hemoglobins, respectively, indicating that the photodissociated NO molecule moved farther away from the metal center in the heme pocket. These observations show the importance of the interaction of the distal residue with the ligand in determining the nature of the photolyzed states."

The activity of the altered 3C proteinases was examined by translation of synthetic RNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate/HeLa cell extract translation system. Analysis of the subsequent processing of virus polyproteins by the altered 3C proteinases showed that all of the mutant proteinases maintained some catalytic activity. The disruption of polyprotein cleavages mediated by 3C followed a distinct pattern, suggesting a specific order of events in processing the polyprotein. Differences in cleavage activity of mutant proteinases when tested on coxsackievirus or poliovirus protein substrates suggest that, although structural elements throughout the proteinase play a role in efficient substrate utilization, the carboxyl-terminal region of the 3C proteinase contains elements most important in species-specific substrate recognition."

The enzyme has been purified from rat kidney cortex nearly to homogeneity, and its kinetic constants have been calculated using a rigorous algebraic method.

https://openalex.org/W1496904524,"To study the biochemical characteristics of endothelium in vivo, we radioiodinated endothelial membrane proteins of the perfused rabbit lung using a water soluble analog of the Bolton-Hunter reagent, 125I-sulfosuccinimidyl (hydroxyphenyl) propionate (125I-s-SHPP). This technique led to a 10-fold increase in specific activity of radioiodinated lung membrane protein compared with our previously reported method using lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase-catalyzed radioiodination. Tissue autoradiography confirmed that radioiodination was largely confined to the endothelium. Perfusion pressure, wet-to-dry weight ratios, and the morphological appearance of the lungs were within normal limits, indicating that the procedure does not cause apparent lung injury. Lectin binding to a crude membrane fraction of 125I-s-SHPP labeled lung led to isolation of several putative endothelial membrane proteins. Immunoprecipitation studies with appropriate antibodies enabled the identification of radioiodinated angiotensin-converting enzyme and β2-microglobulin associated major histocompatibility complex class I molecules in the membrane fraction.

https://openalex.org/W1482638264,"The binding and conformational properties of the divalent cation site required for H+,K(+)-ATPase catalysis have been explored by using Ca2+ as a substitute for Mg2+. 45Ca2+ binding was measured with either a filtration assay or by passage over Dowex cation exchange columns on ice. In the absence of ATP, Ca2+ was bound in a saturating fashion with a stoichiometry of 0.9 mol of Ca2+ per active site and an apparent Kd for free Ca2+ of 332 +/- 39 microM. At ATP concentrations sufficient for maximal phosphorylation (10 microM), 1.2 mol of Ca2+ was bound per active site with an apparent Kd for free Ca2+ of 110 +/- 22 microM. At ATP concentrations greater than or equal to 100 microM, 2.2 mol of Ca2+ were bound per active site, suggesting that an additional mole of Ca2+ bound in association with low affinity nucleotide binding. At concentrations sufficient for maximal phosphorylation by ATP (less than or equal to 10 microM), APD, ADP + Pi, beta,gamma-methylene-ATP, CTP, and GTP were unable to substitute for ATP. Active site ligands such as acetyl phosphate, phosphate, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate were also ineffective at increasing the Ca2+ affinity. However, vanadate, a transition state analog of the phosphoenzyme, gave a binding capacity of 1.0 mol/active site and the apparent Kd for free Ca2+ was less than or equal to 18 microM. Mg2+ displaced bound Ca2+ in the absence and presence of ATP but Ca2+ was bound about 10-20 times more tightly than Mg2+. The free Mg2+ affinity, like Ca2+, increased in the presence of ATP. Monovalent cations had no effect on Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP but dit reduce Ca2+ binding in the presence of ATP (K+ = Rb+ = NH4 + greater than Na+ greater than Li+ greater than Cs+ greater than TMA+, where TMA is tetramethylammonium chloride) by reducing phosphorylation. These results indicate that the Ca2+ and Mg2+ bound more tightly to the phosphoenzyme conformation. Eosin fluorescence changes showed that both Ca2+ and Mg2+ stabilized E1 conformations (i.e. cytosolic conformations of the monovalent cation site(s)) (Ca.E1 and Mg.E1). Addition of the substrate acetyl phosphate to either Ca.E1 or Mg.E1 produced identical eosin fluorescence showing that Ca2+ and Mg2+ gave similar E2 (extracytosolic) conformations at the eosin (nucleotide) site. In the presence of acetyl phosphate and K+, the conformations with Ca2+ or Mg2+ were also similar. Comparison of the kinetics of the phosphoenzyme and Ca2+ binding showed that Ca2+ bound prior to phosphorylation and dissociated after dephosphorylation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
