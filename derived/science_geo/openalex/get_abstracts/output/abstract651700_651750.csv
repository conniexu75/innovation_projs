The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought tighter restrictions on the daily lives of millions of people, but we do not yet understand what measures are the most effective. Zhang et al. modeled virus transmission in Wuhan, China, in February 2020, investigating the effects of interventions ranging from patient management to social isolation. Age-mixing patterns were estimated by contact surveys conducted in Wuhan and Shanghai at the beginning of February 2020. Once people reduced their average daily contacts from 14 to 20 down to 2, transmission rapidly fell below the epidemic threshold. The model also showed that preemptive school closures helped to reduce transmission, although alone they would not prevent a COVID-19 outbreak. Limiting human mixing to within households appeared to be the most effective measure. Science , this issue p. 1481"
https://openalex.org/W3020001547,"Sudden, large-scale and diffuse human migration can amplify localized outbreaks of disease into widespread epidemics1–4. Rapid and accurate tracking of aggregate population flows may therefore be epidemiologically informative. Here we use 11,478,484 counts of mobile phone data from individuals leaving or transiting through the prefecture of Wuhan between 1 January and 24 January 2020 as they moved to 296 prefectures throughout mainland China. First, we document the efficacy of quarantine in ceasing movement. Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency and geographical distribution of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) until 19 February 2020, across mainland China. Third, we develop a spatio-temporal ‘risk source’ model that leverages population flow data (which operationalize the risk that emanates from epidemic epicentres) not only to forecast the distribution of confirmed cases, but also to identify regions that have a high risk of transmission at an early stage. Fourth, we use this risk source model to statistically derive the geographical spread of COVID-19 and the growth pattern based on the population outflow from Wuhan; the model yields a benchmark trend and an index for assessing the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 over time for different locations. This approach can be used by policy-makers in any nation with available data to make rapid and accurate risk assessments and to plan the allocation of limited resources ahead of ongoing outbreaks. Modelling of population flows in China enables the forecasting of the distribution of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the identification of areas at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission at an early stage."
https://openalex.org/W3020077371,"Abstract The great majority of globally circulating pathogens go undetected, undermining patient care and hindering outbreak preparedness and response. To enable routine surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic applications, there is a need for detection technologies that can scale to test many samples 1–3 while simultaneously testing for many pathogens 4–6 . Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection. In the CARMEN platform, nanolitre droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents 7 self-organize in a microwell array 8 to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN–Cas13) enables robust testing of more than 4,500 crRNA–target pairs on a single array. Using CARMEN–Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMEN–Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold. Scalable, highly multiplexed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health 9–11 ."

We then screened a pan-cancer tumor suppressor gene (TSG) library in pre-malignant organoids with APC−/−;KRASG12D mutations, which were xenografted to study clonal advantages in context of a complex tumor microenvironment. We identified TGFBR2 as the most prevalent TSG, followed by known and previously uncharacterized mediators of CRC growth. gRNAs were validated in a secondary screen using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to adjust for clonal drift and to distinguish clone size and abundance.

Tumorigenesis involves the successive acquisition of somatic alterations that confer unrestricted local growth before progression to metastatic disease. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequent type of newly diagnosed cancer in men and women and responsible for 8% of cancer-related deaths in the United States (Siegel et al., 2018Siegel R.L.

Genetic screening allows assignment of gene function in an unbiased manner. In translational oncology, pooled barcoded lentiviral screens using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology have leveraged the identification of resistance mediators and genotype-specific fitness genes (Shalem et al., 2014Shalem O.

Although cancer cell lines are readily accessible for large-scale experiments, they cannot reflect all aspects of human pathophysiology. Screening in primary tumor cells would be desirable to investigate patient-specific responses, processes involving tumor stem cells, cell differentiation, and interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Yet such screening technologies are currently not accessible. Patient-derived tumor organoids have recently emerged as preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of CRC (Sato et al., 2011Sato T. Stange D.E.

In a 3D matrix, tumor and normal epithelial cells can be expanded and remain dependent on exogenic factors that control proliferation and differentiation. Importantly, these exogenous signals (WNT, NOTCH, BMP/transforming growth factor β [TGF-β], and EGFR/RAS) comprise the major oncogenic pathways in CRC, which allows functional enrichment of tumor cells (van de Wetering et al., 2015van de Wetering M.

Using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, defined mutations can be introduced to transform normal organoids and induce tumorigenic growth upon xenotransplantation (Schwank et al., 2013bSchwank G. Koo B.-K.

Med. 2015; 21: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Here, we have combined the exploratory power of CRISPR-Cas9 screening with the 3D organoid system. By adaptation of the specific requirements with respect to scale and growth dynamics of organoids, we have devised protocols to study clonal advantages that are caused by human TSGs in vitro and in vivo. In order to establish pooled screens in human colon organoids, we first sought a phenotypic trait that allows robust positive selection. TGF-β sensitivity represents a suitable model because the TGF-β pathway is well characterized and contains several TSGs recurrently mutated in CRC (Jung et al., 2017Jung B. Staudacher J.J. Beauchamp D. Transforming growth factor β superfamily signaling in development of colorectal cancer.Gastroenterology. 2017; 152: 36-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Pharmacologic inhibition is critical for expansion of normal human colon organoids (Sato et al., 2011Sato T. Stange D.E. Ferrante M. Vries R.G.J. Van Es J.H. Van den Brink S. Van Houdt W.J. Pronk A. Van Gorp J. Siersema P.D. Clevers H. Long-term expansion of epithelial organoids from human colon, adenoma, adenocarcinoma, and Barrett’s epithelium.Gastroenterology. 2011; 141: 1762-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar), and addition of recombinant TGF-β to the culture medium allows efficient killing of organoids (Figure 1A; Matano et al., 2015Matano M. Date S. Shimokawa M. Takano A. Fujii M. Ohta Y. Watanabe T. Kanai T. Sato T. Modeling colorectal cancer using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated engineering of human intestinal organoids.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). For selection, the TGF-β receptor (TGFBR) inhibitor (A83-01) was withdrawn from the medium and TGF-β was added, which caused fully penetrant death within 3 weeks. In contrast, negative selection for other pathways, such as Wnt loss or TP53 stabilization, led to persistence of organoid cells (Figure S1A), possibly by induction of differentiation or cellular senescence, which could cause background in pooled screens. Next, we induced genetic resistance in normal organoids stably expressing Cas9. Transduction with a lentiviral gRNA against TGFBR2 rescued the toxicity (Figure 1A), offering a positive control to investigate performance and scalability of this model. Pooled lentiviral screening requires a multiplicity of infection (MOI) below 1; however, it is unknown whether single virus transduction is sufficient to induce biallelic loss-of-function mutations in organoids. In addition, the intrinsic cell heterogeneity due to spontaneous differentiation could result in inhomogeneous transduction and/or Cas9 modification. To address these questions, the transduction efficiency was first titrated (Figure S1B) before cells were simultaneously transduced at low titer with two TGFBR2 gRNA lentiviral vectors that contained either a GFP or a DsRed reporter (Figure 1B). Without selection, 4.0% of cells were reporter positive, but after TGF-β selection, we found strongly increased reporter expression in 68.0% of cells (Figure 1C). Clear enrichment of cells with only one color was observed, with only moderate bias toward double integrations (Figure 1C). By fluorescence microscopy, the majority of organoids displayed a single color, indicating their clonal origin (Figure 1D) and demonstrating that transduction at MOI < 1 allows efficient CRISPR-Cas9 modification. As benchmark parameters, we determined that 5.4% ± 0.4% of all organoid colonies were edited, corresponding to 5,000 events per 1 mL Matrigel (Figure S1C). Next, we turned to a pooled-barcoded scenario, in which multiple gRNAs can be studied in parallel by next-generation sequencing (NGS). For this purpose, a “training library” was designed targeting six critical components of the TGF-β pathway (Figure 2A) and 94 control genes. Among the control genes were neutral genes, as well as non-targeting random sequences. gRNAs were designed using the CRISPR library designer software (Heigwer et al., 2014Heigwer F. Kerr G. Boutros M. E-CRISP: fast CRISPR target site identification.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 122-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, Heigwer et al., 2016Heigwer F. Zhan T. Breinig M. Winter J. Brügemann D. Leible S. Boutros M. CRISPR library designer (CLD): software for multispecies design of single guide RNA libraries.Genome Biol. 2016; 17: 55Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar; Table S1), and each gene was targeted by 20 independent gRNAs to favor calling of positive hits. The entire library contained 2,200 gRNAs and was transduced in normal human colon organoids stably expressing Cas9 (Figure 2B). 20-fold coverage was envisaged, corresponding to 44,000 clonal events, and the screen was conducted in two experimental replicates. Organoids were either collected 2 days after transduction (T0 control), after 2 weeks of regular culture as “no selection control” (NSC) or following TGF-β selection (as above) after 6.5 weeks, when all non-transfected controls had died and positive clones had reached a discernable size (Figure S2A). In total, we observed 178 TGF-β-resistant colonies in the first and 148 in the second replicate (Figures S2B and S2C). In a pooled fashion, genomic DNA was extracted and lentiviral barcodes were analyzed by NGS. Individual gRNAs against the TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 were most strongly enriched, confirming effective selection. Concomitantly, the median gRNAs distribution was reduced compared to plasmid, T0 control, and NSC (Figure 2C; Table S2). Similar gRNAs were identified in both replicates (Figure 2D), and control gRNAs targeting neutral genes were not recovered, arguing for biologic specificity. Remarkably, however, only a small fraction of positive control gRNAs against the TGFBR2 (4/20), TGFBR1 (2/20), and SMAD2 (1/20) showed enrichment (mean log2 fold change > 2) and SMAD3, SMAD4, and SARA were not recovered (Figures 2D and 2E). Genomic position of gRNA binding sites or scores from various gRNA design tools did not associate with activity (Figures S3A and S3B), indicating limited power to predict efficient gRNAs in organoids. To further study the gRNA characteristics in organoids, we compared the library performance side by side with an immortalized cell line. HepG2 cells were chosen because they are TGF-β sensitive (Senturk et al., 2010Senturk S. Mumcuoglu M. Gursoy-Yuzugullu O. Cingoz B. Akcali K.C. Ozturk M. Transforming growth factor-beta induces senescence in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and inhibits tumor growth.Hepatology. 2010; 52: 966-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and have previously been used for CRISPR-Cas9 screens (Xia et al., 2016Xia P. Zhang X. Xie Y. Guan M. Villeneuve D.L. Yu H. Functional toxicogenomic assessment of triclosan in human HepG2 cells using genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening.Environ. Sci. Technol. 2016; 50: 10682-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were transduced at 100-fold coverage and collected after 3 weeks of TGF-β selection. The screen was conducted in two replicates, and 2,000 and 4,000 resistant colonies were obtained (Figures 3A and 3B ). Barcode sequencing showed strongly decreased representation of gRNAs after selection (Figure 3C; Table S3), although individual gRNAs against the TGFBR1 (13/20), TGFBR2 (16/20), SMAD3 (12/20), SMAD4 (13/20), and SARA (4/20) were strongly enriched (mean log2 fold change > 2; Figures 3D and S4B). Global comparison showed that gRNAs with high efficiency in organoids generally performed well in HepG2 cells (Figures 2E, 3D, and 3E). The activity in HepG2 cells was not generally associated with functionality in organoids. However, restriction to the ten TGFBR1/2 gRNAs with highest activity in HepG2 cells increased the fraction of effective gRNAs from 15% to 40% (Figure 3F). We conclude that prescreening in heterologous cells allows obtaining smaller, more effective gRNA libraries and thereby improve performance in organoids. To investigate the limiting factors for CRISPR-Cas9 activity in organoids, we directly measured the genome editing frequencies using the “Inference of CRISPR Edits” (ICE) assay (Hsiau et al., 2018Hsiau T. Maures T. Waite K. Yang J. Kelso R. Holden K. Stoner R. Inference of CRISPR edits from Sanger trace data.bioRxiv. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1101/251082Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Two TGFBR2 gRNAs with low and high enrichment in organoids were compared that showed similar indel frequency in HepG2 cells (Figure S5A). Experiments were performed in the absence of TGF-β to exclude cell-specific phenotypes upon selection. In organoids, however, significantly different editing was found (Figure S5B). Impairment of the weaker gRNA was preserved in organoids with APC and KRAS mutations, arguing that oncogenic transformation alone is not sufficient to improve CRISPR-Cas9 activity (Figure S5C). In contrast, additional mutation of TP53 partially restored gRNA functionality, suggesting that, similar to other untransformed cells, a CRISPR-Cas9-induced, P53-dependent DNA damage response limits the activity of some gRNAs in organoids (Haapaniemi et al., 2018Haapaniemi E.

Ye C. et al.p53 inhibits CRISPR-Cas9 engineering in human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Our next aim was to perform screening in transplanted organoids to study clonal selection in a complex microenvironment. As a positive-selection paradigm, we generated a pre-tumorigenic organoid line that can form subcutaneous tumors in NSG mice upon one additional genetic hit. Colon organoids that had been engineered with loss of APC and the oncogenic KRASG12D allele (AK organoids) showed growth only after additional deletion of TGFBR2 (AKT organoids; Figures 4A–4C, S6A, and S6B), providing a sensitive genetic system. To test whether gene ablation can induce a clonal growth advantage, AK organoids were transduced at low titer with a lentiviral gRNA together with a GFP reporter. We found that TGFBR2 gRNA, but not a random control gRNA, strongly increased the fraction of GFP-positive cells from 8.4% before transplantation to 98.5% after tumor growth (Figures 4D–4F). We furthermore confirmed that AK organoids retained a genetically stable diploid phenotype in vitro (Figures S6C and S6D) and could be efficiently modified by CRISPR-Cas9 (Figures S6E and S6F). Comprehensive tumor sequencing programs have only identified a limited number of TSGs that are recurrently mutated in CRC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012Cancer Genome Atlas NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.Nature. 2012; 487: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5904) Google Scholar, Grasso et al., 2018Grasso C.S.

Discovery and saturation analysis of cancer genes across 21 tumour types.Nature. 2014; 505: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of drivers that are less frequent in CRC and to cover diverse biological pathways, we designed a pan-cancer TSG gRNA library that included 85 TSGs that were previously identified in 16 solid non-neuronal cancer entities (Davoli et al., 2013Davoli T. Xu A.W. Mengwasser K.E. Sack L.M. Yoon J.C. Park P.J. Elledge S.J. Cumulative haploinsufficiency and triplosensitivity drive aneuploidy patterns and shape the cancer genome.Cell. 2013; 155: 948-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar; Table S4A). For each target, we designed 20 independent gRNAs, and including controls, the entire library contained 2,600 gRNAs. After transduction, AK organoids were transplanted into NSG mice at 20-fold library coverage (Figure 5A). For this scale, organoids corresponding to 70,000–90,000 independent CRISPR-Cas9 targeting events were injected subcutaneously into 8–10 mice. After 11 to 12 weeks, the genomic DNA of all tumors was pooled and the screen was conducted in 3 experimental replicates that showed heterogeneous results (Figure 5B). Strong enrichment of individual gRNAs was observed, although more homogeneous gRNA distribution was observed in plasmid, T0, and NSC (Figure 5C). After normalization, TGFBR2 was the most highly enriched gRNA in all three replicates, indicating a dominating growth-repressive effect of TGF-β in the tumor microenvironment. Additional hits were prioritized according to the mean enrichment and induction in at least 2 of 3 replicates (Figures 5D and 5E; Table S4F). Within the top 20 TSG barcodes, 3 independent gRNAs targeting TGFBR2 were recovered. Next strongest hits included other known drivers in CRC (TP53, ATM—2 gRNAs, CASP8, and SMAD4) as well as TSGs not somatically mutated (MED23, STK11—2 gRNAs, SMARCA4, and NETO1). However, among the most highly enriched gRNAs were a number of control guides targeting neutral and essential genes, indicating presence of false positives, e.g., due to neutral drift during the prolonged selection. For validation and to obtain insight on the clonal composition of organoid-derived tumors, we generated a library that couples each gRNA to unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Using a lentiviral vector described previously (Michlits et al., 2017Michlits G. Hubmann M. Wu S.-H. Vainorius G. Budusan E. Zhuk S. Burkard T.R. Novatchkova M. Aichinger M. Lu Y. et al.CRISPR-UMI: single-cell lineage tracing of pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screens.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we introduced the top 281 gRNAs from the TSG screen flanked by a 10-bp degenerated UMI (Figure S7A). In addition, gRNAs targeting neutral and essential genes were included together with positive controls (TGFBR1/2 gRNAs effective in HepG2 cells; Table S5A). By NGS, we first tested the rate of barcode uncoupling, which could compromise clonal detection. Using a pair of predefined gRNA and UMI sequences, we only detected PCR-introduced uncoupling in 0.1% of all reads (Figure S7B), thus permitting accurate clone tracing. The entire library then was transduced into Cas9 expressing AK organoids followed by subcutaneous transplantation in NSG mice and tumor growth for 8 weeks (Figures 6A and S7C). To study biological robustness and the effect of library coverage, tumors were either sequenced individually (n = 5; 15-fold coverage each) or as a pool of 10 tumors (150-fold coverage). Overall gRNA diversity was reduced in both the pool and individual tumors compared to the T0 control (Figure 6B; Tables S5B and S5C). Scoring for UMIs revealed a considerable heterogeneity of tumor clone sizes with Gini coefficients ranging between 0.6 and 0.8 (Figures S7D and S7E). After normalization, an average number of 3.6 × 103 individual clones was measured per tumor (Figure S7F). Yet the majority of all reads originated from a small percentage (1%–3%) of large clones (Figures S7G and S7H), paralleling the heterogeneity observed above (Figure 5B). To score for barcode incidence rather than abundance, we removed the largest three clones for each gRNA. Side-by-side comparison with conventional analysis showed that such removal of “outlier clones” allowed eliminating false positives (Figures 6C and 6D; Table S5D). Gene set enrichment analysis for positive controls and essential genes showed similar enrichment in both datasets, as well as in single tumors. Thus, the sensitivity of detection is neither compromised by outlier removal nor limited by the library coverage (Figure S7I). The biological robustness was confirmed by statistical analysis of enrichment in single tumors (Figures 6E and 6F). Inspection of single tumors revealed that false positives in the conventional analysis are caused by single outlier clones (Figure S7J). Together, our results demonstrate that correction for clonal drift strongly improves the resolution of pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screens in organoids. Our validated set of TSGs (15 gRNAs > 1 log2 fold) contained TGFBR2 and SMAD4 (both with 3 gRNAs each), as well as PIK3R1, ZC3H13, and FBXW7 that are all recurrently mutated in CRC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012Cancer Genome Atlas NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.Nature. 2012; 487: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5904) Google Scholar, Davoli et al., 2013Davoli T.

Although TP53 was not recovered, loss of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN2A (2 gRNAs) could result in a similar block of cell cycle arrest.

The opportunity to quantitatively measure clonal advantages prompted us to compare the effect of single TSGs on clone size and number. For this purpose, gRNAs targeting TGFBR2, TP53, and STK11 or a random control gRNA were individually coupled to a UMI library. In a competitive assay, AK organoids expressing test or control gRNA were then mixed, followed by tumor growth in NSG mice and barcode sequencing (Figure 7A; Tables S"
https://openalex.org/W3022225042,"Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) is an innate immune sensor of nucleic acids that regulates host defense responses and development. ZBP1 activation triggers inflammation and pyroptosis, necroptosis, and apoptosis (PANoptosis) by activating receptor-interacting Ser/Thr kinase 3 (RIPK3), caspase-8, and the NLRP3 inflammasome. ZBP1 is unique among innate immune sensors because of its N-terminal Zα1 and Zα2 domains, which bind to nucleic acids in the Z-conformation. However, the specific role of these Zα domains in orchestrating ZBP1 activation and subsequent inflammation and cell death is not clear. Here we generated Zbp1ΔZα2/ΔZα2 mice that express ZBP1 lacking the Zα2 domain and demonstrate that this domain is critical for influenza A virus–induced PANoptosis and underlies perinatal lethality in mice in which the RIP homotypic interaction motif domain of RIPK1 has been mutated (Ripk1mRHIM/mRHIM). Deletion of the Zα2 domain in ZBP1 abolished influenza A virus–induced PANoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, deletion of the Zα2 domain of ZBP1 was sufficient to rescue Ripk1mRHIM/mRHIM mice from perinatal lethality caused by ZBP1-driven cell death and inflammation. Our findings identify the essential role of the Zα2 domain of ZBP1 in several physiological functions and establish a link between Z-RNA sensing via the Zα2 domain and promotion of influenza-induced PANoptosis and perinatal lethality."

Assessing the interplay between the microbial community of the ISS and its crew is important for preventing biomedical and structural complications for long term human spaceflight missions. In this study, we describe one crewmember’s microbial profile from body swabs of mouth, nose, ear, skin and saliva that were collected at eight different time points pre-, during and post-flight. Additionally, environmental surface samples from eight different habitable locations in the ISS were collected from two flights. Environmental samples from one flight were collected by the crewmember and samples from the next flight were collected after the crewmember departed. The microbial composition in both environment and crewmember samples was measured using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and processed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit. Ordination of sample to sample distances showed that of the eight crew body sites analyzed, skin, nostril, and ear samples are more similar in microbial composition to the ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva samples; and that the microbial composition of the crewmember’s skin samples are more closely related to the ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember on the same flight than ISS surface samples collected by other crewmembers on different flights. In these collections, species alpha diversity in saliva samples appears to decrease during flight and rebound after returning to Earth. This is the first study to compare the ISS microbiome to a crewmember’s microbiome via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We observed that the microbiome of the surfaces inside the ISS resemble those of the crew’s skin. These data support future crew and ISS microbial surveillance efforts and the design of preventive measures to maintain crew habitat onboard spacecraft destined for long term space travel."
https://openalex.org/W3022883480,"Abstract Activator protein (AP)-1 transcription factors are essential elements of the pro-oncogenic functions of transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-SMAD signaling. Here we show that in multiple HER2+ and/or EGFR+ breast cancer cell lines these AP-1-dependent tumorigenic properties of TGFβ critically rely on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and expression of the ΔN isoform of transcriptional regulator p63. EGFR and ΔNp63 enabled and/or potentiated the activation of a subset of TGFβ-inducible invasion/migration-associated genes, e.g., ITGA2, LAMB3 , and WNT7A/B , and enhanced the recruitment of SMAD2/3 to these genes. The TGFβ- and EGF-induced binding of SMAD2/3 and JUNB to these gene loci was accompanied by p63-SMAD2/3 and p63-JUNB complex formation. p63 and EGFR were also found to strongly potentiate TGFβ induction of AP-1 proteins and, in particular, FOS family members. Ectopic overexpression of FOS could counteract the decrease in TGFβ-induced gene activation after p63 depletion. p63 is also involved in the transcriptional regulation of heparin binding (HB)-EGF and EGFR genes, thereby establishing a self-amplification loop that facilitates and empowers the pro-invasive functions of TGFβ. These cooperative pro-oncogenic functions of EGFR, AP-1, p63, and TGFβ were efficiently inhibited by clinically relevant chemical inhibitors. Our findings may, therefore, be of importance for therapy of patients with breast cancers with an activated EGFR-RAS-RAF pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3022225148,"Helicobacter pylori infection is the main risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. H. pylori colonizes the human gastric mucosa and persists for decades. The inflammatory response is ineffective in clearing the infection, leading to disease progression that may result in gastric adenocarcinoma. We have shown that polyamines are regulators of the host response to H. pylori, and that spermine oxidase (SMOX), which metabolizes the polyamine spermine into spermidine plus H2O2, is associated with increased human gastric cancer risk. We now used a molecular approach to directly address the role of SMOX, and demonstrate that Smox-deficient mice exhibit significant reductions of gastric spermidine levels and H. pylori-induced inflammation. Proteomic analysis revealed that cancer was the most significantly altered functional pathway in Smox−/− gastric organoids. Moreover, there was also less DNA damage and β-catenin activation in H. pylori-infected Smox−/− mice or gastric organoids, compared to infected wild-type animals or gastroids. The link between SMOX and β-catenin activation was confirmed in human gastric organoids that were treated with a novel SMOX inhibitor. These findings indicate that SMOX promotes H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis by causing inflammation, DNA damage, and activation of β-catenin signaling."

Cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to characterize the electrochemical catalysis of the biosensor: acetylcholinesterase/chitosan-transition metal carbides/graphene/glassy carbon electrode. With the joint modification of graphene and transition metal carbides, the biosensor has a good performance in detecting dichlorvos with a linear relationship from 11.31 μM to 22.6 nM and the limit of detection was 14.45 nM. Under the premise of parameter optimization, the biosensor showed a good catalytic performance for acetylcholine. Compared to the biosensors without modification, it expressed a better catalytic performance due to the excellent electrical properties, biocompatibility and high specific surface area of graphene, transition metal carbides. Finally, the biosensor exhibits good stability, which can be stored at room temperature for one month without significant performance degradation, and has practical potential for sample testing."

We found that each phospho-form of AKT1 has common and distinct substrate requirements. Compared with pAKT1T308, the addition of Ser-473 phosphorylation increased AKT1 activities on some, but not all of its substrates.

https://openalex.org/W3022508929,"A human molecular chaperone protein, DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B6 (DNAJB6), efficiently inhibits amyloid aggregation. This inhibition depends on a unique motif with conserved serine and threonine (S/T) residues that have a high capacity for hydrogen bonding. Global analysis of kinetics data has previously shown that DNAJB6 especially inhibits the primary nucleation pathways. These observations indicated that DNAJB6 achieves this remarkably effective and sub-stoichiometric inhibition by interacting not with the monomeric unfolded conformations of the amyloid-β symbol (Aβ) peptide but with aggregated species. However, these pre-nucleation oligomeric aggregates are transient and difficult to study experimentally. Here, we employed a native MS-based approach to directly detect oligomeric forms of Aβ formed in solution. We found that WT DNAJB6 considerably reduces the signals from the various forms of Aβ (1-40) oligomers, whereas a mutational DNAJB6 variant in which the S/T residues have been substituted with alanines does not. We also detected signals that appeared to represent DNAJB6 dimers and trimers to which varying amounts of Aβ are bound. These data provide direct experimental evidence that it is the oligomeric forms of Aβ that are captured by DNAJB6 in a manner which depends on the S/T residues. We conclude that, in agreement with the previously observed decrease in primary nucleation rate, strong binding of Aβ oligomers to DNAJB6 inhibits the formation of amyloid nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W3020328964,"Antenatal care (ANC) contacts have long been considered a critical component of the continuum of care for a pregnant mother along with the newborn baby. The latest maternal mortality survey in Bangladesh suggests that progress in reducing maternal mortality has stalled as only 37% of pregnant women have attended at least four ANC contacts. This paper aims to determine what factors are associated with ANC contacts for women in Bangladesh. We analysed the data, provided by Bangladesh demographic and health survey 2014, covering a nationally representative sample of 17,863 ever married women aged 15-49 years. A two-stage stratified cluster sampling was used to collect the data. Data derived from 4,475 mothers who gave birth in the three years preceding the survey. Descriptive, inferential, and multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyse the data. An overall 78.4% of women had ANC contacts, but the WHO recommended ≥8 ANC contacts and ANC contacts by qualified doctors were only 8% for each. The logistic regression analysis revealed that division, maternal age, women's education, husband's education, wealth index and media exposure were associated with the ANC contacts. Likewise, place of residence, women's education, religion, and wealth index were also found to be associated with the WHO recommended ANC contacts. Furthermore, the husband's education, division, religion and husband's employment showed significant associations with ANC contacts by qualified doctors. However, Bangladeshi women in general revealed an unsatisfactory level of ANC contacts, the WHO recommended as well as ANC contacts by qualified doctors. In order to improve the situation, it is necessary to follow the most recent ANC contacts recommended by the WHO and to contact the qualified doctors. Moreover, an improvement in education as well as access to information along with an increase of transports, care centres and reduction of service costs would see an improvement of ANC contacts in Bangladesh."

Although both growth factors exist as homodimers, recent evidence indicates that GDF9 and BMP15 can also heterodimerize to form the potent growth factor cumulin. Within the cumulin complex, BMP15 “activates” latent GDF9, enabling potent signaling in granulosa cells via type I receptors (i.e. activin receptor-like kinase-4/5 (ALK4/5)) and SMAD2/3 transcription factors. In the cumulin heterodimer, two distinct type I receptor interfaces are formed compared with homodimeric GDF9 and BMP15. Previous studies have highlighted the potential of cumulin to improve treatment of female infertility, but, as a noncovalent heterodimer, cumulin is difficult to produce and purify without contaminating GDF9 and BMP15 homodimers. In this study we addressed this challenge by focusing on the cumulin interface formed by the helix of the GDF9 chain and the fingers of the BMP15 chain. We demonstrate that unique BMP15 finger residues at this site (Arg301, Gly304, His307, and Met369) enable potent activation of the SMAD2/3 pathway. Incorporating these BMP15 residues into latent GDF9 generated a highly potent growth factor, called hereafter Super-GDF9. Super-GDF9 was >1000-fold more potent than WT human GDF9 and 4-fold more potent than cumulin in SMAD2/3-responsive transcriptional assays in granulosa cells.

https://openalex.org/W3019115200,"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a devastating motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease that leads to falls, reduced mobility, and decreased quality of life. Reliably eliciting FOG has been difficult in the clinical setting, which has limited discovery of pathophysiology and/or documentation of the efficacy of treatments, such as different frequencies of subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN DBS). In this study we validated an instrumented gait task, the turning and barrier course (TBC), with the international standard FOG questionnaire question 3 (FOG-Q3, r = 0.74, p < 0.001). The TBC is easily assembled and mimics real-life environments that elicit FOG. People with Parkinson’s disease who experience FOG (freezers) spent more time freezing during the TBC compared to during forward walking (p = 0.007). Freezers also exhibited greater arrhythmicity during non-freezing gait when performing the TBC compared to forward walking (p = 0.006); this difference in gait arrhythmicity between tasks was not detected in non-freezers or controls. Freezers’ non-freezing gait was more arrhythmic than that of non-freezers or controls during all walking tasks (p < 0.05). A logistic regression model determined that a combination of gait arrhythmicity, stride time, shank angular range, and asymmetry had the greatest probability of classifying a step as FOG (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.754). Freezers’ percent time freezing and non-freezing gait arrhythmicity decreased, and their shank angular velocity increased in the TBC during both 60 Hz and 140 Hz STN DBS (p < 0.05) to non-freezer values. The TBC is a standardized tool for eliciting FOG and demonstrating the efficacy of 60 Hz and 140 Hz STN DBS for gait impairment and FOG. The TBC revealed gait parameters that differentiated freezers from non-freezers and best predicted FOG; these may serve as relevant control variables for closed loop neurostimulation for FOG in Parkinson’s disease."

Methods T2 and FLAIR axial images with and without tubers were extracted from MRIs of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and controls, respectively. We trained three different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures on a training dataset and selected the one with the lowest binary cross-entropy loss in the validation dataset, which was evaluated on the testing dataset. We visualized image regions most relevant for classification with gradient-weighted class activation maps (Grad-CAM) and saliency maps. Results 114 patients with TSC and 114 controls were divided into a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. The InceptionV3 CNN architecture performed best in the validation set and was evaluated in the testing set with the following results: sensitivity: 0.95, specificity: 0.95, positive predictive value: 0.94, negative predictive value: 0.95, F1-score: 0.95, accuracy: 0.95, and area under the curve: 0.99. Grad-CAM and saliency maps showed that tubers resided in regions most relevant for image classification within each image. A stand-alone trained deep learning App was able to classify images using local computers with various operating systems. Conclusion This study shows that deep learning algorithms are able to detect tubers in selected MRI images, and deep learning can be prudently applied clinically to manually selected data in a rare neurological disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3021154796,"α-Synuclein (αsyn) is the primary component of proteinaceous aggregates termed Lewy bodies that pathologically define synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). αsyn is hypothesized to spread through the brain in a prion-like fashion by misfolded protein forming a template for aggregation of endogenous αsyn. The cell-to-cell release and uptake of αsyn are considered important processes for its prion-like spread. Rab27b is one of several GTPases essential to the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and is implicated in protein secretion and clearance, but its role in αsyn spread has yet to be characterized. In this study, we used a paracrine αsyn in vitro neuronal model to test the impact of Rab27b on αsyn release, clearance, and toxicity. shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of Rab27b increased αsyn-mediated paracrine toxicity. Rab27b reduced αsyn release primarily through nonexosomal pathways, but the αsyn released after Rab27b KD was of higher-molecular-weight species, as determined by size-exclusion chromatography. Rab27b KD increased intracellular levels of insoluble αsyn and led to an accumulation of endogenous light chain 3 (LC3)-positive puncta. Rab27b KD also decreased LC3 turnover after treatment with an autophagosome-lysosome fusion inhibitor, chloroquine, indicating that Rab27b KD induces a defect in autophagic flux. Rab27b protein levels were increased in brain lysates obtained from postmortem tissues of individuals with PD and DLB compared with healthy controls. These data indicate a role for Rab27b in the release, clearance, and toxicity of αsyn and, ultimately, in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W3021221751,"Core fucose is an N-glycan structure synthesized by α1,6-fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) localized to the Golgi apparatus and critically regulates the functions of various glycoproteins. However, how FUT8 activity is regulated in cells remains largely unclear. At the luminal side and uncommon for Golgi proteins, FUT8 has an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which is usually found in cytosolic signal transduction molecules and generally mediates protein-protein interactions in the cytosol. However, the SH3 domain has not been identified in other glycosyltransferases, suggesting that FUT8's functions are selectively regulated by this domain. In this study, using truncated FUT8 constructs, immunofluorescence staining, FACS analysis, cell-surface biotinylation, proteomics, and LC-electrospray ionization MS analyses, we reveal that the SH3 domain is essential for FUT8 activity both in cells and in vitro and identified His-535 in the SH3 domain as the critical residue for enzymatic activity of FUT8. Furthermore, we found that although FUT8 is mainly localized to the Golgi, it also partially localizes to the cell surface in an SH3-dependent manner, indicating that the SH3 domain is also involved in FUT8 trafficking. Finally, we identified ribophorin I (RPN1), a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, as an SH3-dependent binding protein of FUT8. RPN1 knockdown decreased both FUT8 activity and core fucose levels, indicating that RPN1 stimulates FUT8 activity. Our findings indicate that the SH3 domain critically controls FUT8 catalytic activity and localization and is required for binding by RPN1, which promotes FUT8 activity and core fucosylation."

This paper explores gender differences in mental health outcomes of individuals in Turkey. It aims to deliver additional evidence on associations between gender, income and mental health status by providing an empirical analysis from a developing country, Turkey. This study employs a nationally representative data set from Turkish Health Survey of 2016. It constructs an index for mental health at individual level by using polychoric principal component analysis. Conditional mixed process models are estimated for quantification of associations between gender, income and mental health measures. Empirical findings indicate that there is endogenous and positive relationship between household income level and mental health status of individuals in Turkey. Turkish females report lower mental health statuses than Turkish males. Furthermore, females are more likely to use mental health services in Turkey. Gender gaps in both mental health status and mental health service use are present in the Turkish case. Results of this study imply that mental health policies should avoid applying one-fit-all approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3020605214,"Monitoring universal health coverage in reproductive, maternal and child health requires appropriate indicators for assessing coverage and equity. In 2008, the composite coverage index (CCI)-a weighted average of eight indicators reflecting family planning, antenatal and delivery care, immunizations and management of childhood illnesses-was proposed. In 2017, the CCI formula was revised to update the family planning and diarrhea management indicators. We explored the implications of adding new indicators to the CCI.We analysed nationally representative surveys to investigate how addition of early breastfeeding initiation (EIBF), tetanus toxoid during pregnancy and post-natal care for babies affected CCI levels and the magnitude of wealth-related inequalities. We used Pearson's correlation coefficient to compare different formulations, and the slope index of inequalities [SII] and concentration index [CIX] to assess absolute and relative inequalities, respectively.47 national surveys since 2010 had data on the eight variables needed for the original and revised formulations, and on EIBF, tetanus vaccine and postnatal care, related to newborn care. The original CCI showed the highest average value (65.5%), which fell to 56.9% when all 11 indicators were included. Correlation coefficients between pairs of all formulations ranged from 0.93 to 0.99. When analysed separately, 10 indicators showed higher coverage with increasing wealth; the exception was EIBF (SII = -2.1; CIX = -0.5). Inequalities decreased when other indicators were added, especially EIBF-the SII fell from 24.8 pp. to 19.2 pp.; CIX from 7.6 to 6.1. The number of countries with data from two or more surveys since 2010 was 30 for the original and revised formulations and 15 when all the 11 indicators were included.Given the growing importance of newborn mortality, it would be desirable to include relevant coverage indicators in the CCI, but this would lead a reduction in data availability, and an underestimation of coverage inequalities. We propose that the 2017 version of the revised CCI should continue to be used."
https://openalex.org/W3018942177,"Neurons are input-output (I/O) devices-they receive synaptic inputs from other neurons, integrate those inputs with their intrinsic properties, and generate action potentials as outputs. To understand this fundamental process, we studied the interaction between synaptic inputs and intrinsic properties using whole-cell recordings from V1 neurons of awake, fixating macaque monkeys. Our measurements during spontaneous activity and visual stimulation reveal an intrinsic voltage-gated conductance that profoundly alters the integrative properties and visual responses of cortical neurons. This voltage-gated conductance increases neuronal gain and selectivity with subthreshold depolarization and linearizes the relationship between synaptic input and neural output. This intrinsic conductance is found in layer 2/3 V1 neurons of awake macaques, anesthetized mice, and acute brain slices. These results demonstrate that intrinsic conductances play an essential role in shaping the I/O relationship of cortical neurons and must be taken into account in future models of cortical computations."

The known risk factors for OSCCs are mainly alcohol consumption and tobacco use for at least 75–80% of cases. In addition to these risk factors, Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18, classified as high-risk (HR) HPV genotypes, are considered as risk factors for oropharyngeal cancers, but their role in the development of OSCC remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis of viral etiology in a series of 68 well-characterized OSCCs and 14 potentially malignant disorders (PMD) in non-smoking, non-drinking (NSND) patients using broad-range, sensitive molecular methodologies. Deep-sequencing of the transcriptome did not reveal any vertebrate virus sequences other than HPV transcripts, detected in only one case. In contrast, HPV DNA was detected in 41.2% (28/68) and 35.7% (5/14) of OSCC and PMD cases, respectively. Importantly, 90.9% (30/33) of these belonged to the Betapapillomavirus genus, but no viral transcripts were detected. Finally, high-throughput sequencing revealed reads corresponding to transcripts of the Trichomonas vaginalis virus (TVV), which were confirmed by RT-PCR in two OSCCs. Our results strongly suggest that Alphapapillomavirus genotypes classified as HR are not involved in the development of OSCCs in NSND patients and that known oncogenic infectious agents are absent in these specific OSCCs. Any possible direct or indirect role of Betapapillomavirus genus members and TVV in OSCCs remains speculative and requires further investigation."

However, the access of TLS polymerases to the replication machinery must be kept tightly in check to avoid excessive mutagenesis. Recruitment of DNA polymerase η (Pol η) and other Y-family TLS polymerases to damaged DNA relies on proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) monoubiquitylation and is regulated at several levels. Using a microscopy-based RNAi screen, here we identified an important role of the SUMO modification pathway in limiting Pol η interactions with DNA damage sites in human cells. We found that Pol η undergoes DNA damage- and protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1 (PIAS1)-dependent polySUMOylation upon its association with monoubiquitylated PCNA, rendering it susceptible to extraction from DNA damage sites by SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) activity. Using proteomic profiling, we demonstrate that Pol η is targeted for multisite SUMOylation, and that collectively these SUMO modifications are essential for PIAS1- and STUbL-mediated displacement of Pol η from DNA damage sites. These findings suggest that a SUMO-driven feedback inhibition mechanism is an intrinsic feature of TLS-mediated lesion bypass functioning to curtail the interaction of Pol η with PCNA at damaged DNA to prevent harmful mutagenesis.

https://openalex.org/W3019740466,"Mumps, a common childhood disease, has a high incidence in Guangzhou city, China. It has been proven that mumps is influenced by seasonality. However, the role of meteorological factors among children is yet to be fully ascertained. This study explored the association between meteorological factors and the incidence of mumps among children in Guangzhou. Distributed lag nonlinear models were used to evaluate the correlation between meteorological factors and the incidence of mumps among children from 2014-2018. The nonlinear lag effects of some meteorological factors were detected. Mean temperature, atmospheric pressure, and relative humidity were positively correlated with mumps incidence, contrary to that of wind speed. Extreme effects of temperature, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and relative humidity on the incidence of mumps among children in Guangzhou were evaluated in a subgroup analysis according to gender and age. Our preliminary results offered fundamental information to better understand the epidemic trends of mumps among children to develop an early warning system, and strengthen the intervention and prevention of mumps."
https://openalex.org/W3020593113,"Background Heart-fatty acid binding protein (HFABP) has been recognized as a highly heart-specific marker. However, it is currently unknown that its HFABP is also closely related to the severity of COVID-19. Methods We retrospectively screened 46 patients who met our inclusion criteria within 4 weeks. They were tested for HFABP after the diagnosis of COVID-19, and monitored for HFABP during their hospital stay. We tracked the patients during their hospital stay to determine if they had severe COVID-19 or mild-to-severe transition features. We calculated the chi-square test values found for HFABP to predict the correlation between HFABP levels and the severity of the COVID-19. Results Of these 46 cases, 16 cases with confirmed COVID-19 were tested for HFABP> 7 ng / mL upon admission; among them, 14 cases were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 within the hospitalization. The Odds ratio of the measured HFABP elevation was 6.81(95% confidence interval [CI] 5.23–8.40), and 3 patients with severe COVID-19 progressed in 5 patients with mild HFABP> 7 ng/mL. Conclusion These data indicate that the elevation of HFABP is closely related to the severity of COVID-19 in the patients, and the elevated HFABP may cause rapid development of patients with mild COVID-19 into severe COVID-19. But serum HFABP negative maybe make patients with mild COVID-19 safer, the current data show no effect on the all-cause mortality.

https://openalex.org/W3017969556,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death among infectious agents, ranking above HIV/AIDS. Though much effort has been done, Ethiopia remained one of those countries which share the greatest burden of TB. Evaluating the TB treatment outcome is one method of TB control measures. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess TB treatment outcome and its determinants under directly observed treatment short courses in Adama City, Central Ethiopia.An institutional based cross sectional study was conducted in all public and private health facilities of Adama city from March 1st 2016 to December 31st, 2016. The data were entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 21.0 statistical software. The results were presented using descriptive statistics. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression model was used to evaluate the potential determinants of unsuccessful treatment outcome.Among 281 patients evaluated, 90(32%) were cured, 137(48.8%) have completed the treatment, 4(1.4%) were treatment failure, 36(12.8%) were lost to follow up, and 14 (5%) died. The overall treatment success rate was 80.8%. Age 15-24 (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 4.97; 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.13-21.90), distance less than 5 kilometers from treatment center (AOR: 3.1; 95% CI: 1.42-6.77), being seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (AOR: 20.38; 95% CI: 7.80-53.24) were associated with successful TB treatment outcome.The treatment outcome of all forms tuberculosis patients in Adama city was unsatisfactory when referred with the national pooled estimate of 86% and WHO 2030 international target of ≥90%. Thus, enhancing client supervision, treatment monitoring; and working on provision TB treatment services at nearby health facilities should be a priority concern to improve the success rate of treatment outcome. Further studies are also recommended to explore important factors which were not examined by current study."
https://openalex.org/W3018797493,"AST-120 (Kremezin) is used to treat progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) by adsorbing uremic toxin precursors produced by gut microbiota, such as indole and phenols. In this study, we propose that AST-120 reduces indole level, consequently suppresses indole effects on induction of drug tolerance and virulence in Escherichia coli including enterohaemorrhagic strains. In experiments, AST-120 adsorbed both indole and tryptophan, a precursor of indole production, and led to decreased expression of acrD and mdtEF which encode drug efflux pumps, and elevated glpT, which encodes a transporter for fosfomycin uptake and increases susceptibility to aztreonam, rhodamine 6G, and fosfomycin. AST-120 also decreased the production of EspB, which contributes to pathogenicity of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, minocycline, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole were also adsorbed by AST-120. However, fosfomycin, in addition to rifampicin, colistin and amikacin were not adsorbed, thus AST-120 can be used together with these drugs for therapy to treat infections. These results suggest another benefit of AST-120, i.e., that it assists antibacterial chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3023578215,"Many bacteria possess enzymes that modify the essential cell-wall polymer peptidoglycan by O-acetylation. This modification occurs in numerous Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of human infections. O-Acetylation of peptidoglycan protects bacteria from the lytic activity of lysozyme, a mammalian innate immune enzyme, and as such is important for bacterial virulence. The O-acetylating enzyme in Gram-positive bacteria, O-acetyltransferase A (OatA), is a two-domain protein consisting of an N-terminal integral membrane domain and a C-terminal extracytoplasmic domain. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure at 1.71 A resolution and the biochemical characterization of the C-terminal domain of S. aureus OatA. The structure revealed that this OatA domain adopts an SGNH-hydrolase fold and possesses a canonical catalytic triad. Site-specific replacement of active-site amino acids revealed the presence of a water-coordinating aspartate residue that limits esterase activity. This residue, although conserved in staphyloccocal OatA and most other homologs, is not present in the previously characterized streptococcal OatA. These results provide insights into the mechanism of acetyl transfer in the SGNH/GDSL hydrolase family and highlight important evolutionary differences between homologous OatA enzymes. Furthermore, this study enhances our understanding of PG O-acetyltransferases, which could guide the development of novel antibacterial drugs to combat infections with multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3018921551,"Purpose Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional spinal structural deformity that occurs in otherwise normal individuals. Although curve progression and severity vary amongst individuals, AIS can lead to significant cosmetic and functional deformity. AIS etiology has been determined to be genetic, however, exact genetic and biological processes underlying this disorder remain unknown. Vestibular structure and function have potentially been related to the etiopathogenesis of AIS. Here, we aimed to characterize the anatomy of the semicircular canals (SCC) within the vestibular system through a novel approach utilizing T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). Methods Three dimensional, MRI-based models of the SCCs were generated from AIS subjects (n = 20) and healthy control subjects (n = 19). Linear mixed models were used to compare SCC morphological measurements in the two groups. We compared side-to-side differences in the SCC measurements between groups (group*side interaction). Results Side-to-side differences in the lateral SCC were different between the two groups [false discovery rate adjusted p-value: 0.0107]. Orientation of right versus left lateral SCC was significantly different in the AIS group compared to the control group [mean side-to-side difference: -4.1°, 95% CI: -6.4° to -1.7°]. Overall, among subjects in the AIS group, the left lateral SCC tended to be oriented in a more horizontal position than subjects in the control group. Significance Asymmetry within the SCCs of the vestibular system of individuals with AIS potentially results in abnormal efferent activity to postural muscles. Consequences of this muscular activity during periods of rapid growth, which often coincides with AIS onset and progression, warrant consideration."
https://openalex.org/W3018347653,"Background The future burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) depends on numerous factors such as population ageing, evolution of societal trends, behavioural and physiological risk factors of individuals (e.g. smoking, alcohol use, obesity, physical inactivity, and hypertension). This study aims to assess the burden of NCDs in Europe by 2050 under alternative scenarios. Methods This study combines qualitative and quantitative forecasting techniques to examine how population health in Europe may evolve from 2015 to 2050, taking into account future societal trends. Four scenarios were developed (one business-as-usual scenario, two response scenarios and one pessimistic scenario) and assessed against ‘best’ and ‘worst’-case scenarios. This study provides quantitative estimates of both diseases and mortality outcomes, using a microsimulation model incorporating international survey data. Findings Each scenario is associated with a different risk factor prevalence rate across Europe during the period 2015–2050. The prevalence and incidence of NCDs consistently increase during the analysed time period, mainly driven by population ageing. In more optimistic scenarios, diseases will appear in later ages, while in the pessimistic scenarios, NCDs will impair working-age people. Life expectancy is expected to grow in all scenarios, but with differences by up to 4 years across scenarios and population groups. Premature mortality from NCDs will be reduced in more optimistic scenarios but stagnate in the worst-case scenario. Interpretation Population ageing will have a greater impact on the spread of NCDs by 2050 compared to risk factors. Nevertheless, risk factors, which are influenced by living environments, are an important factor for determining future life expectancy in Europe."
https://openalex.org/W3019792120,"The use of endoscopic techniques to cure small sized, well differentiated early gastric cancer has been adopted worldwide. In the Eastern world, endoscopic resection is being increasingly utilized to treat small undifferentiated early gastric cancer according to the extended criteria proposed by the Japanese Gastric Cancer Associations. However, studies in the Western world reported in these tumors a rate of nodal metastasis ranging between 5% and 20%, that is higher of those observed in Eastern counterparts. A tool to predict the risk of nodal dissemination would be of great use to guide treatment toward endoscopic resection. In our study, we propose E-cadherin expression as a biological factor to predict lymph node involvement. We retrospectively reviewed the E-cadherin (E-cad) expression profile of all histological specimens of undifferentiated early gastric cancer from two Oncologic Departments and compared it with several tumor characteristics. A total of 39 patients with early gastric cancer met the inclusion criteria, of which 16 (41%) pT1a, and 23 (58.9%) pT1b SM1. Thirty-two patients (82%) underwent subtotal gastrectomy, whereas total gastrectomy was performed in only seven cases (17.9%). Patients were divided into two groups: low E-cad expression (E-cad 0/1+, 10 patients) and high E-cad expression (E-cad 2+/3+, 29 patients) according to the immunohistochemical assay (ICH). On univariate analysis, we found an association between low E-cad expression and low grading tumor (p = 0.019), pure undifferentiated histotype (PU-type) (p = 0.014), and lymph node involvement (N+) (p < 0.001). The association between low E-cad expression and lymph node metastasis was confirmed by multivariate analysis (OR = 14.5, 95% CI 3.46–60.76, p < 0.001). The loss of expression of E-cad may be a simple biological factor to predict lymph nodes metastasis in patients with undifferentiated early gastric cancer. Additional larger prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings."

This complex acts on DNA-bound, monoubiquitinated Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (FANCD2) protein in the Fanconi anemia pathway of the DNA damage response. Moreover, RAD51AP1 and UAF1 cooperate to enhance homologous DNA pairing mediated by the recombinase RAD51 in DNA repair via the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. However, whereas the DNA-binding activity of RAD51AP1 has been shown to be important for RAD51-mediated homologous DNA pairing and HR-mediated DNA repair, the role of DNA binding by UAF1 in these processes is unclear. We have isolated mutant UAF1 variants that are impaired in DNA binding and tested them together with RAD51AP1 in RAD51-mediated HR. This biochemical analysis revealed that the DNA-binding activity of UAF1 is indispensable for enhanced RAD51 recombinase activity within the context of the UAF1–RAD51AP1 complex. In cells, DNA-binding deficiency of UAF1 increased DNA damage sensitivity and impaired HR efficiency, suggesting that UAF1 and RAD51AP1 have coordinated roles in DNA binding during HR and DNA damage repair. Our findings show that even though UAF1's DNA-binding activity is redundant with that of RAD51AP1 in FANCD2 deubiquitination, it is required for efficient HR-mediated chromosome damage repair."

In addition to KWL1, 19 additional KWL paralogs have been identified in maize. Here, we investigated the structure and mechanism of the closest KWL1 homolog, KWL1-b (ZEAMA_GRMZM2G305329). We solved the Cmu1–KWL1-b complex to 2.75 Å resolution, revealing a highly symmetric Cmu1–KWL1-b heterotetramer in which each KWL1-b monomer interacts with a monomer of the Cmu1 homodimer. The structure also revealed that the overall architecture of the heterotetramer is highly similar to that of the previously reported Cmu1–KWL1 complex. We found that upon U. maydis infection of Z. mays, KWL1-b is expressed at significantly lower levels than KWL1 and exhibits differential tissue-specific expression patterns. We also show that KWL1-b inhibits Cmu1 activity similarly to KWL1. We conclude that KWL1 and KWL1-b are part of a redundant defense system that tissue-specifically targets Cmu1. This notion was supported by the observation that both KWL proteins are carbohydrate-binding proteins with distinct and likely tissue-related specificities.

We deployed a wrist worn activity monitor to record total daily physical activity during everyday living in the community-setting. Parkinsonism was assessed with 26 items of a modified motor portion of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). We used linear regression models, controlling for age and sex, to examine the association of physical activity with parkinsonism with and without indices of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) pathologies. In separate models, we added interaction terms to examine if physical activity modified the associations of brain pathologies with parkinsonism.Mean age at death was 90.9 (SD, 6.2), mean severity of parkinsonism was 14.1 (SD, 9.2, Range 0-59.4), and 350 (77%) had evidence of more than one ADRD pathologies. Higher total daily physical activity was associated with less severe parkinsonism (Estimate, -0.315, S.E., 0.052, p<0.001). The association of more physical activity with less severe parkinsonism persisted after adding terms for ten brain pathologies (Estimate, -0.283, S.E., 0.052, p<0.001). The associations of brain pathologies with more severe parkinsonism did not vary with the level of physical activity.The association of higher physical activity with less severe parkinsonism may be independent of the presence of ADRD brain pathologies. Further work is needed to identify mechanisms through which physical activity may maintain motor function in older adults."

We examined how children’s body mass index (BMI), physical activity and sedentary time at ages 9 and 11 are associated with blood pressure at age 11. Data were from 1283 children from Bristol, UK, who participated in the study aged 11 years, 797 of whom also participated in the study aged 9 years. Child height, weight and blood pressure were measured, and children wore accelerometers for five days, from which moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity and sedentary minutes per day were derived. Multiple imputation of missing data and adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used to examine associations. Child BMI at 11 years was cross-sectionally associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean difference [95% confidence interval]: 0.91 [0.32 to 1.50] mm Hg and 1.08 [0.54 to 1.62] mm Hg, respectively, per standard deviation (SD) of BMI). BMI at age 9 was also positively associated with diastolic blood pressure at age 11 (1.16 mmHg per two years [0.49 to 1.84], per SD of BMI). For girls, sedentary time at age 9 years was associated with increased odds of having high systolic blood pressure at age 11 (odds ratio: 1.08 [1.01 to 1.16], per 10 minutes per day). There was no evidence of associations between sedentary time and blood pressure among boys. Similarly, there was little evidence that physical activity was associated with blood pressure in either cross-sectional or prospective analyses. Effective strategies are needed to prevent excess bodyweight among children in order to reduce cardiovascular disease risk."

This model overcomes the weaknesses of multivariate and univariate methods that it does not require any external factors while achieving excellent interpretations. We applied the model to the case study collected from housing prices in Wuhan, China, from December 2016 to October 2018. To verify its reliability, we compared the results of the proposed model to those of the log-periodic power law model optimized by the standard genetic algorithm and simulated annealing, the results of which indicate that the proposed model performs best in terms of prediction. Efficiently predicting and analyzing the housing prices will help the government promulgate effective policies for regulating the real estate market and protect home buyers."

This paper investigates the associations of sickness absence, obtained from employer records as well as self-reports, with office type (cell offices and different sizes of open-plan offices). It additionally studies whether office type is associated with sickness presence.Employees from two private and one public sector organization were recruited to the study. Office type was ascertained by direct observation or from employee responses to an online survey. Control variables were gender, age, public/private sector and education level. Number of days and episodes of sickness absence were calculated from employer absence records and regressed on office type using negative binomial regression (n = 988). Self-reports of sickness absence and presence were regressed on office type using ordered logistic regression (n = 1237).Office type was generally not associated with employer records of number of episodes or days of sickness absence, except that the total number of days of leave was higher in flex offices compared to cell offices (IRR = 2.46, p = 0.007). In general, office type was not associated with self-reported days of sickness absence, apart from participants working in medium-sized open-plan offices who had 0.42 higher log-odds of absence than those working in cell offices (p = 0.004). Office type was not associated with self-reported sickness presence.Office type was not associated with sickness presence nor, in general, with sickness absence, whether obtained from self-reports or company records. It is not possible to conclude from this study that open-plan offices are associated with greater sickness absence or sickness presence compared to cell offices."

Using the NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates dataset, which includes over 298,000 respondents in the biological sciences, engineering, and physical sciences since 1977, we use logistic regression modelling to examine the likelihood of doctoral recipients having no offers at the time of graduation as a function of race, gender, family and funding variables. We find that across the fields of biology, engineering, and physical sciences, women and underrepresented minorities have a higher prevalence of having no job offers, but this relationship has notable interaction effects for family variables and doctoral program funding mechanism. Importantly, marital status accounts for differences in job offers between genders that deserves further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3021380617,"Epithelial cell–transforming sequence 2 (ECT2) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases that is overexpressed in many cancers and involved in signal transduction pathways that promote cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis. Recently, we demonstrated that a significant pool of ECT2 localizes to the nucleolus of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, where it binds the transcription factor upstream binding factor 1 (UBF1) on the promoter regions of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and activates rDNA transcription, transformed cell growth, and tumor formation. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which ECT2 engages UBF1 on rDNA promoters. Results from ECT2 mutagenesis indicated that the tandem BRCT domain of ECT2 mediates binding to UBF1. Biochemical and MS-based analyses revealed that protein kinase Cι (PKCι) directly phosphorylates UBF1 at Ser-412, thereby generating a phosphopeptide-binding epitope that binds the ECT2 BRCT domain. Lentiviral shRNA knockdown and reconstitution experiments revealed that both a functional ECT2 BRCT domain and the UBF1 Ser-412 phosphorylation site are required for UBF1-mediated ECT2 recruitment to rDNA, elevated rRNA synthesis, and transformed growth. Our findings provide critical molecular insight into ECT2-mediated regulation of rDNA transcription in cancer cells and offer a rationale for therapeutic targeting of UBF1- and ECT2-stimulated rDNA transcription for the management of NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3018992191,"Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, composed of PPR motifs repeated in tandem, are sequence-specific RNA binding proteins. Recent bioinformatic studies have shown that the combination of polar amino acids at positions 5 and last in each PPR motif recognizes RNA bases, and an RNA recognition code for PPR proteins has been proposed. Subsequent studies confirmed that the P (canonical length) and S (short) motifs bind to specific nucleotides according to this code. However, the contribution of L (long) motifs to RNA recognition is mostly controversial, owing to the presence of a nonpolar amino acid at position 5. The PLS-class PPR protein PpPPR_56 is a mitochondrial RNA editing factor in the moss Physcomitrella patens. Here, we performed in vitro RNA binding and in vivo complementation assays with PpPPR_56 and its variants containing mutated L motifs to investigate their contributions to RNA recognition. In vitro RNA binding assay showed that the original combination of amino acids at positions 5 and last in the L motifs of PpPPR_56 is not required for RNA recognition. In addition, an in vivo complementation assay with RNA editing factors PpPPR_56 and PpPPR_78 revealed the importance of nonpolar amino acids at position 5 of C-terminal L motifs for efficient RNA editing. Our findings suggest that L motifs function as non-binding spacers, not as RNA-binding motifs, to facilitate the formation of a complex between PLS-class PPR protein and RNA. As a result, the DYW domain, a putative catalytic deaminase responsible for C-to-U RNA editing, is correctly placed in proximity to C, which is to be edited."
https://openalex.org/W3020282708,"An alarming number of traffic-related deaths occur each year on European roads alone. Figures reveal that the vast majority of road-traffic accidents are caused by drivers themselves, and so further improvements in road safety require developments in driver training and rehabilitation. This study evaluated a novel approach to driver rehabilitation–specifically, empathy induction as a means of changing attitudes towards risky driving. To assess the effectiveness of this method, the present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare brain function before and after a short program of empathy induction in 27 drivers whose licenses had been revoked after serious traffic offences (rehabilitated drivers [RDs]). In an extension of our previous research, we first assessed whether neural responses to empathy-eliciting social stimuli changed in these RDs. In order to isolate the neurophysiological effects of empathy induction from any other potential influences, we compared these RDs to a sample of 27 age-, handedness- and driving experience-matched control drivers (CDs) who had no exposure to the program. We then performed dual-fMRI “hyperscanning” to evaluate whether empathy induction changed brain responses during real-world social interactions among drivers; namely, during co-operative and/or competitive exchanges. Our data reveal that RDs exhibited weaker brain responses to socio-emotional stimuli compared with CDs prior to the program, but this difference was reversed after empathy induction. Moreover, we observed differences between pre- and post-program assessments in patterns of brain responses in RDs elicited during competitive social exchanges, which we interpret to reflect a change in their proclivity to react to the perceived wrong-doing of other road users. Together, these findings suggest that empathy induction is an effective form of driver rehabilitation, and the utility of neuroscientific techniques for evaluating and improving rehabilitation programs."
https://openalex.org/W3020294674,"Multivariate geometric designs for mixture experiments and response surface methodology (RSM) were tested as a means of optimizing plant mixtures to support generalist predatory arthropods. The mixture design included 14 treatment groups, each comprised of six planters and having a proportion of 0.00, 0.17, 0.33, 0.66, or 1.00 of each plant species. The response variable was the frequency of predators trapped on sticky card traps placed in each group and replaced 2 times per week. The following plant species were used: Spring 2017: Euphorbia milii, E. heterophylla, and Phaseolus lunatus; Summer 2017: E. milii, Fagopyrum esculentum, and Chamaecrista fasciculata; and, Summer 2018: E. milii, F. esculentum, and Portulaca umbraticola. Predator occurrence was influenced by: 1) Linear mixture effects, which indicated that predator occurrence was driven by the amount of a single plant species in the mixture; or, 2) Nonlinear blending effects, which indicated that the plant mixture itself had emergent properties that contributed to predator occurrence. Predator abundance was highest in the Spring 2017 experiment and both linear mixture effects and nonlinear blending effects were observed. Predator occurrence decreased in subsequent experiments, which were conducted in the warmer summer months. In both Summer experiments, only linear mixture effects were observed, indicating that predator occurrence was driven by the amount of a single plant species in the test mixtures: Euphorbia milii in 2017 and Portulaca umbraticola in 2018. The results showed that not only did the species composition of a plant mixture drive predator occurrence but that proportionality of species contributed to the outcome as well. This suggests that, when formulating a plant mixture to aid in conservation biological control consideration should be given to the proportion of each plant species included in the mixture. RSM can be an important tool for achieving the goal of optimizing mixtures of plants for conservation biological control."
https://openalex.org/W3020648768,"In this paper, we develop a generator to propose new continuous lifetime distributions. Thanks to a simple transformation involving one additional parameter, every existing lifetime distribution can be rendered more flexible with our construction. We derive stochastic properties of our models, and explain how to estimate their parameters by means of maximum likelihood for complete and censored data, where we focus, in particular, on Type-II, Type-I and random censoring. A Monte Carlo simulation study reveals that the estimators are consistent. To emphasize the suitability of the proposed generator in practice, the two-parameter Fréchet distribution is taken as baseline distribution. Three real life applications are carried out to check the suitability of our new approach, and it is shown that our extension of the Fréchet distribution outperforms existing extensions available in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W3018156905,"Coplanar arcs are used with limited arc range to prevent direct beam entrance through the lens, which is challenging for satisfactory planning of hippocampal sparing in whole brain radiotherapy (HS-WBRT) with VMAT. We evaluated the dosimetric impact of applying a head-tilting technique during VMAT, which allows unrestricted use of the arc range.Twenty patients with multiple brain metastases who had received two computed tomography (CT)-simulation sessions between January 2016 and December 2018 were included. One session was delivered in a traditional supine position; the other was delivered with a tilting acrylic supine baseplate (MedTec, USA) to elevate the patients' head by 40°. For each patient, a VMAT without (sVMAT) and with head-tilting (htVMAT) plan was generated. Conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), and organ at risk (OAR) dose were evaluated. The Wilcoxon-signed test was used to compare the effect between two plans.The mean CI was 0.860±0.007 and 0.864±0.008 (p<0.05), and mean HI was 0.179±0.020 and 0.167±0.021 (p<0.05) for sVMAT and htVMAT, respectively. The mean dose to the hippocampus (9.91±0.30 Gy) was significantly lower in htVMAT than in sVMAT (10.36±0.29 Gy, P<0.05). htVMAT was associated with significantly reduced mean dose to the parotid gland, and right and left lens (4.77±1.97 Gy vs. 5.92±1.68 Gy, p<0.05; 3.29±0.44 Gy vs. 7.22±1.26 Gy, p<0.05; 3.33±0.45 Gy vs. 6.73±1.01 Gy, p<0.05, respectively).This is the first study to demonstrate that the head-tilting technique might be useful for HS-WBRT planning with VMAT. This method could remove the limitations associated with the arc range, resulting in improved dose distribution and conformity, while sparing healthy organs, including the hippocampus, lens, and parotid gland."
https://openalex.org/W3020441820,"Population monitoring is critical to effective conservation, but forest living taxa can be difficult to directly observe. This has been true of African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis), for which we have limited information regarding population size and social behavior despite their threatened conservation status. In this study, we estimated demographic parameters using genetic capture-recapture of forest elephants in the southern Industrial Corridor of the Gamba Complex of Protected Areas in southwestern Gabon, which is considered a global stronghold for forest elephants. Additionally, we examined social networks, predicting that we would find matrilineal structure seen in both savanna and forest elephants. Given 95% confidence intervals, we estimate population size in the sampled area to be between 754 and 1,502 individuals and our best density estimate ranges from 0.47 to 0.80 elephants per km2. When extrapolated across the entire Industrial Corridor, this estimate suggests an elephant population size of 3,033 to 6,043 based on abundance or 1,684 to 2,832 based on density, approximately 40–80% smaller than previously suggested. Our social network analysis revealed approximately half of network components included females with different mitochondrial haplotypes suggesting a wider range of variation in forest elephant sociality than previously thought. This study emphasizes the threatened status of forest elephants and demonstrates the need to further refine baseline estimates of population size and knowledge on social behavior in this taxon, both of which will aid in determining how population dynamics in this keystone species may be changing through time in relation to increasing conservation threats."
https://openalex.org/W3018373051,"To evaluate retinal vascular changes on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel 2) and to assess their correlation with visual acuity.Twenty-six patients (52 eyes) with MacTel 2 and 20 age-matched controls (40 eyes) were included. Fundus examinations, including fundus autofluorescence, swept-source optical coherence tomography, and OCTA, were performed. Differences in the vascular density in the fovea and parafovea, the area of the foveal avascular zone, and the diameter of the ellipsoid zone defect of the two groups were analyzed.The foveal vascular density of the superficial capillary plexus was significantly lower in the MacTel 2 group than in the control group (p = 0.027). The vascular density in the entire deep capillary plexus was also significantly less in the MacTel 2 group than in the control group (all p < 0.05). The mean diameter of ellipsoid-zone disruption on OCT in the MacTel 2 group was 634.6 ± 104.3 휇m. The foveal avascular zone areas of the superficial and deep capillary plexuses were significantly enlarged in the MacTel 2 group compared to those in the control group (0.45 ± 0.12 mm2 vs. 0.27 ± 0.08 mm2, p < 0.001; 0.56 ± 0.15 mm2 vs. 0.40 ± 0.14 mm2, p = 0.001). In addition, the enlarged foveal avascular zone of the superficial and deep plexus was negatively correlated with best corrected visual acuity (logMAR) in MacTel 2 patients (p = 0.013, r = -0.642 and p = 0.042, and r = -0.511, respectively).Retinal vascular density changes occur in the superficial fovea and in the entire deep capillary plexus of patients with MacTel 2. The enlarged foveal avascular zone areas of the superficial and deep plexuses were prominent in the MacTel 2 group, and this enlargement correlates with worsened visual acuity."
https://openalex.org/W3018788492,"Gentisic acid (GA), a metabolite of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and homogentisic acid (HGA), which is excreted at high levels in alkaptonuria, are divalent phenolic acids with very similar structures. Urine containing HGA is dark brown in color due to its oxidation. We recently reported a new oxidation method of HGA involving the addition of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with sodium hypochlorite pentahydrate (NaOCl·5H2O), which is a strong oxidant. In the present study, we attempted to oxidize GA, which has a similar structure to HGA, using our method. We herein observed color changes in GA solution and analyzed the absorption spectra of GA after the addition of NaOH with NaOCl·5H2O. We also examined the oxidation reaction of GA using a liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC/TOF-MS). The results obtained indicated that GA solution had a unique absorption spectrum with a peak at approximately 500 nm through an oxidation reaction following the addition of NaOH with NaOCl·5H2O. This spectrophotometric method enables GA to be detected in sample solutions without expensive analytical instruments or a complex method."
https://openalex.org/W3017539954,"Eradication of Plasmodium falciparum malaria will likely require a multivalent vaccine, but the development of a highly efficacious subunit-based formulation has been challenging. We previously showed that production and immunogenicity of two leading vaccine targets, PfMSP119 (blood-stage) and Pfs25 (sexual stage), could be enhanced upon genetic fusion to merozoite surface protein 8 (PfMSP8). Here, we sought to optimize a Pfs25-based formulation for use in combination with rPfMSP1/8 with the goal of maintaining the immunogenicity of each subunit.Comparative mouse studies were conducted to assess the effects of adjuvant selection (Alhydrogel vs. glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant-stable emulsion (GLA-SE)) and antigen dose (2.5 vs. 0.5 μg) on the induction of anti-Pfs25 immune responses. The antibody response (magnitude, IgG subclass profile, and transmission-reducing activity (TRA)) and cellular responses (proliferation, cytokine production) generated in response to each formulation were assessed. Similarly, immunogenicity of a bivalent vaccine containing rPfMSP1/8 and rPfs25/8 was evaluated.Alum-based formulations elicited strong and comparable humoral and cellular responses regardless of antigen form (unfused rPfs25 or chimeric rPfs25/8) or dose. In contrast, GLA-SE based formulations elicited differential responses as a function of both parameters, with 2.5 μg of rPfs25/8 inducing the highest titers of functional anti-Pfs25 antibodies. Based on these data, chimeric rPfs25/8 was selected and tested in a bivalent formulation with rPfMSP1/8. Strong antibody titers against Pfs25 and PfMSP119 domains were induced with GLA-SE based formulations, with no indication of antigenic competition.We were able to generate an immunogenic bivalent vaccine designed to target multiple parasite stages that could reduce both clinical disease and parasite transmission. The use of the same PfMSP8 carrier for two different vaccine components was effective in this bivalent formulation. As such, the incorporation of additional protective targets fused to the PfMSP8 carrier into the formulation should be feasible, further broadening the protective response."
https://openalex.org/W2911309096,"The red snapper Lutjanus campechanus is an exploited reef fish of major economic importance in the Gulf of Mexico region. Studies of genome wide genetic variation are needed to understand the structure of wild populations and develop breeding programs for aquaculture but interpretation of these genome scans is limited by the absence of reference genome. In this work, the first draft of a reference genome was developed and characterized for the red snapper. P-454 and Illumina sequencing were conducted to produce paired-end reads that were assembled into reference contigs and scaffolds. The current assembly spans over 770 Mb, representing an estimated 69% of the red snapper genome in 67,254 scaffolds (N50 = 16,803 bp). The genome contigs were applied to map double digest Restriction-Site Associated DNA Tags and characterize Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in five outbred full-sib families. The identified SNPs and 97 microsatellite loci were used to generate a high-density linkage map that includes 7,420 markers distributed across 24 linkage groups and spans 1,346.64 cM with an average inter–marker distance of 0.18 cM. Sex-specific maps revealed a 1.10:1 female to male map length ratio. A total of 4,422 genome contigs (10.5% of the assembly) were anchored to the map and used in a comparative genomic analysis of the red snapper and two model teleosts. Red snapper showed a high degree of chromosome level syntenic conservation with both medaka and spotted green puffer and a near one to one correspondence between the 24 red snapper linkage groups and corresponding medaka chromosomes was observed. This work established the first draft of a reference genome for a lutjanid fish. The obtained genomic resources will serve as a framework for the interpretation of genome scans during studies of wild populations and captive breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W3019913331,"Dyspnea is the most common symptom among hospitalized patients with heart failure (HF) but besides dyspnea questionnaires (which reflect the subjective patient sensation and are not fully validated in HF) there are no measurable physiological variables providing objective assessment of dyspnea in a setting of acute HF patients. Studies performed in respiratory patients suggest that the measurement of electromyographic (EMG) activity of the respiratory muscles with surface electrodes correlates well with dyspnea. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that respiratory muscles EMG activity is a potential marker of dyspnea severity in acute HF patients.Prospective and descriptive pilot study carried out in 25 adult patients admitted for acute HF. Measurements were carried out with a cardio-respiratory portable polygraph including EMG surface electrodes for measuring the activity of main (diaphragm) and accessory (scalene and pectoralis minor) respiratory muscles. Dyspnea sensation was assessed by means of the Likert 5 questionnaire. Data were recorded during 3 min of spontaneous breathing and after breathing at maximum effort for several cycles for normalizing data. An index to quantify the activity of each respiratory muscle was computed. This assessment was carried out within the first 24 h of admission, and at day 2 and 5.Dyspnea score decreased along the three measured days. Diaphragm and scalene EMG index showed a positive and significant direct relationship with dyspnea score (p<0.001 and p = 0.003 respectively) whereas pectoralis minor muscle did not.In our pilot study, diaphragm and scalene EMG activity was associated with increasing severity of dyspnea. Surface respiratory EMG could be a useful objective tool to improve assessment of dyspnea in acute HF patients."
