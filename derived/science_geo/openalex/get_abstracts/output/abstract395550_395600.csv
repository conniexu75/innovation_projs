https://openalex.org/W1966008305,"Neural induction of human pluripotent stem cells often yields heterogeneous cell populations that can hamper quantitative and comparative analyses. There is a need for improved differentiation and enrichment procedures that generate highly pure populations of neural stem cells (NSC), glia and neurons. One way to address this problem is to identify cell-surface signatures that enable the isolation of these cell types from heterogeneous cell populations by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).We performed an unbiased FACS- and image-based immunophenotyping analysis using 190 antibodies to cell surface markers on naïve human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and cell derivatives from neural differentiation cultures. From this analysis we identified prospective cell surface signatures for the isolation of NSC, glia and neurons. We isolated a population of NSC that was CD184(+)/CD271(-)/CD44(-)/CD24(+) from neural induction cultures of hESC and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). Sorted NSC could be propagated for many passages and could differentiate to mixed cultures of neurons and glia in vitro and in vivo. A population of neurons that was CD184(-)/CD44(-)/CD15(LOW)/CD24(+) and a population of glia that was CD184(+)/CD44(+) were subsequently purified from cultures of differentiating NSC. Purified neurons were viable, expressed mature and subtype-specific neuronal markers, and could fire action potentials. Purified glia were mitotic and could mature to GFAP-expressing astrocytes in vitro and in vivo.These findings illustrate the utility of immunophenotyping screens for the identification of cell surface signatures of neural cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells. These signatures can be used for isolating highly pure populations of viable NSC, glia and neurons by FACS. The methods described here will enable downstream studies that require consistent and defined neural cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2125676148,"A large number of proteins transferred by the Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm system have been identified by various strategies. With no exceptions, these strategies are based on one or more characteristics associated with the tested proteins. Given the high level of diversity exhibited by the identified proteins, it is possible that some substrates have been missed in these screenings. In this study, we took a systematic method to survey the L. pneumophila genome by testing hypothetical orfs larger than 300 base pairs for Dot/Icm-dependent translocation. 798 of the 832 analyzed orfs were successfully fused to the carboxyl end of β-lactamase. The transfer of the fusions into mammalian cells was determined using the β-lactamase reporter substrate CCF4-AM. These efforts led to the identification of 164 proteins positive in translocation. Among these, 70 proteins are novel substrates of the Dot/Icm system. These results brought the total number of experimentally confirmed Dot/Icm substrates to 275. Sequence analysis of the C-termini of these identified proteins revealed that Lpg2844, which contains few features known to be important for Dot/Icm-dependent protein transfer can be translocated at a high efficiency. Thus, our efforts have identified a large number of novel substrates of the Dot/Icm system and have revealed the diverse features recognizable by this protein transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2029490885,"Candida albicans frequently causes superficial infections by invading and damaging epithelial cells, but may also cause systemic infections by penetrating through epithelial barriers. C. albicans is an unusual pathogen because it can invade epithelial cells via two distinct mechanisms: induced endocytosis, analogous to facultative intracellular enteropathogenic bacteria, and active penetration, similar to plant pathogenic fungi. Here we investigated the molecular basis of C. albicans epithelial interactions. By systematically assessing the contributions of defined fungal pathways and factors to different stages of epithelial interactions, we provide an expansive portrait of the processes and activities involved in epithelial infection. We strengthen the concept that hyphal formation is critical for epithelial invasion. Importantly, our data support a model whereby initial epithelial invasion per se does not elicit host damage, but that C. albicans relies on a combination of contact-sensing, directed hyphal extension, active penetration and the expression of novel pathogenicity factors for further inter-epithelial invasion, dissemination and ultimate damage of host cells. Finally, we explore the transcriptional landscape of C. albicans during the early stages of epithelial interaction, and, via genetic analysis, identify ICL1 and PGA34 as novel oral epithelial pathogenicity factors."
https://openalex.org/W2034696724,"Adult mice are highly vocal animals, with both males and females vocalizing in same sex and cross sex social encounters. Mouse pups are also highly vocal, producing isolation vocalizations when they are cold or removed from the nest. This study examined patterns in the development of pup isolation vocalizations, and compared these to adult vocalizations. In three litters of CBA/CaJ mice, we recorded isolation vocalizations at ages postnatal day 5 (p5), p7, p9, p11, and p13. Adult vocalizations were obtained in a variety of social situations. Altogether, 28,384 discrete vocal signals were recorded using high-frequency-sensitive equipment and analyzed for syllable type, spectral and temporal features, and the temporal sequencing within bouts. We found that pups produced all but one of the 11 syllable types recorded from adults. The proportions of syllable types changed developmentally, but even the youngest pups produced complex syllables with frequency-time variations. When all syllable types were pooled together for analysis, changes in the peak frequency or the duration of syllables were small, although significant, from p5 through p13. However, individual syllable types showed different, large patterns of change over development, requiring analysis of each syllable type separately. Most adult syllables were substantially lower in frequency and shorter in duration. As pups aged, the complexity of vocal bouts increased, with a greater tendency to switch between syllable types. Vocal bouts from older animals, p13 and adult, had significantly more sequential structure than those from younger mice. Overall, these results demonstrate substantial changes in social vocalizations with age. Future studies are required to identify whether these changes result from developmental processes affecting the vocal tract or control of vocalization, or from vocal learning. To provide a tool for further research, we developed a MATLAB program that generates bouts of vocalizations that correspond to mice of different ages."
https://openalex.org/W2125900572,"Repairing trauma to the central nervous system by replacement of glial support cells is an increasingly attractive therapeutic strategy. We have focused on the less-studied replacement of astrocytes, the major support cell in the central nervous system, by generating astrocytes from embryonic human glial precursor cells using two different astrocyte differentiation inducing factors. The resulting astrocytes differed in expression of multiple proteins thought to either promote or inhibit central nervous system homeostasis and regeneration. When transplanted into acute transection injuries of the adult rat spinal cord, astrocytes generated by exposing human glial precursor cells to bone morphogenetic protein promoted significant recovery of volitional foot placement, axonal growth and notably robust increases in neuronal survival in multiple spinal cord laminae. In marked contrast, human glial precursor cells and astrocytes generated from these cells by exposure to ciliary neurotrophic factor both failed to promote significant behavioral recovery or similarly robust neuronal survival and support of axon growth at sites of injury. Our studies thus demonstrate functional differences between human astrocyte populations and suggest that pre-differentiation of precursor cells into a specific astrocyte subtype is required to optimize astrocyte replacement therapies. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show functional differences in ability to promote repair of the injured adult central nervous system between two distinct subtypes of human astrocytes derived from a common fetal glial precursor population. These findings are consistent with our previous studies of transplanting specific subtypes of rodent glial precursor derived astrocytes into sites of spinal cord injury, and indicate a remarkable conservation from rat to human of functional differences between astrocyte subtypes. In addition, our studies provide a specific population of human astrocytes that appears to be particularly suitable for further development towards clinical application in treating the traumatically injured or diseased human central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2017879166,"Autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms of Weill-Marchesani syndrome, an inherited connective tissue disorder, are caused by mutations in ADAMTS10 (encoding a secreted metalloprotease) and FBN1 (encoding fibrillin-1, which forms tissue microfibrils), respectively, yet they are clinically indistinguishable. This genetic connection prompted investigation of a potential functional relationship between ADAMTS10 and fibrillin-1. Specifically, fibrillin-1 was investigated as a potential ADAMTS10 binding partner and substrate, and the role of ADAMTS10 in influencing microfibril biogenesis was addressed. Using ligand affinity blotting and surface plasmon resonance, recombinant ADAMTS10 was found to bind to fibrillin-1 with a high degree of specificity and with high affinity. Two sites of ADAMTS10 binding to fibrillin-1 were identified, one toward the N terminus and another in the C-terminal half of fibrillin-1. Confocal microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy localized ADAMTS10 to fibrillin-1-containing microfibrils in human tissues. Furin-activated ADAMTS10 could cleave fibrillin-1, but innate resistance of ADAMTS10 zymogen to propeptide excision by furin was observed, suggesting that, unless activated, ADAMTS10 is an inefficient fibrillinase. To investigate the role of ADAMTS10 in microfibril biogenesis, fetal bovine nuchal ligament cells were cultured in the presence or absence of ADAMTS10. Exogenously added ADAMTS10 led to accelerated fibrillin-1 microfibril biogenesis. Conversely, fibroblasts obtained from a Weill-Marchesani syndrome patient with ADAMTS10 mutations deposited fibrillin-1 microfibrils sparsely compared with unaffected control cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that ADAMTS10 participates in microfibril biogenesis rather than in fibrillin-1 turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2051218026,"It was recently shown that cellular turnover occurs within the human adipocyte population. Through three independent experimental approaches--dilution of an inducible histone 2B-green fluorescent protein (H2BGFP), labeling with the cell cycle marker Ki67 and incorporation of BrdU--we characterized the degree of cellular turnover in murine adipose tissue. We observed rapid turnover of the adipocyte population, finding that 4.8% of preadipocytes are replicating at any time and that between 1-5% of adipocytes are replaced each day. In light of these findings, we suggest that adipose tissue turnover represents a possible new avenue of therapeutic intervention against obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2091654454,"In Candida glabrata, the transcription factor CgPdr1 is involved in resistance to azole antifungals via upregulation of ATP binding cassette (ABC)-transporter genes including at least CgCDR1, CgCDR2 and CgSNQ2. A high diversity of GOF (gain-of-function) mutations in CgPDR1 exists for the upregulation of ABC-transporters. These mutations enhance C. glabrata virulence in animal models, thus indicating that CgPDR1 might regulate the expression of yet unidentified virulence factors. We hypothesized that CgPdr1-dependent virulence factor(s) should be commonly regulated by all GOF mutations in CgPDR1. As deduced from transcript profiling with microarrays, a high number of genes (up to 385) were differentially regulated by a selected number (7) of GOF mutations expressed in the same genetic background. Surprisingly, the transcriptional profiles resulting from expression of GOF mutations showed minimal overlap in co-regulated genes. Only two genes, CgCDR1 and PUP1 (for PDR1 upregulated and encoding a mitochondrial protein), were commonly upregulated by all tested GOFs. While both genes mediated azole resistance, although to different extents, their deletions in an azole-resistant isolate led to a reduction of virulence and decreased tissue burden as compared to clinical parents. As expected from their role in C. glabrata virulence, the two genes were expressed as well in vitro and in vivo. The individual overexpression of these two genes in a CgPDR1-independent manner could partially restore phenotypes obtained in clinical isolates. These data therefore demonstrate that at least these two CgPDR1-dependent and -upregulated genes contribute to the enhanced virulence of C. glabrata that acquired azole resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1979801164,"Qinghai Lake in central China has been at the center of debate on whether wild birds play a role in circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. In 2005, an unprecedented epizootic at Qinghai Lake killed more than 6000 migratory birds including over 3000 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus). H5N1 subsequently spread to Europe and Africa, and in following years has re-emerged in wild birds along the Central Asia flyway several times.To better understand the potential involvement of wild birds in the spread of H5N1, we studied the movements of bar-headed geese marked with GPS satellite transmitters at Qinghai Lake in relation to virus outbreaks and disease risk factors. We discovered a previously undocumented migratory pathway between Qinghai Lake and the Lhasa Valley of Tibet where 93% of the 29 marked geese overwintered. From 2003-2009, sixteen outbreaks in poultry or wild birds were confirmed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the majority were located within the migratory pathway of the geese. Spatial and temporal concordance between goose movements and three potential H5N1 virus sources (poultry farms, a captive bar-headed goose facility, and H5N1 outbreak locations) indicated ample opportunities existed for virus spillover and infection of migratory geese on the wintering grounds. Their potential as a vector of H5N1 was supported by rapid migration movements of some geese and genetic relatedness of H5N1 virus isolated from geese in Tibet and Qinghai Lake.This is the first study to compare phylogenetics of the virus with spatial ecology of its host, and the combined results suggest that wild birds play a role in the spread of H5N1 in this region. However, the strength of the evidence would be improved with additional sequences from both poultry and wild birds on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where H5N1 has a clear stronghold."
https://openalex.org/W2089717527,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation and articular damage. Proinflammatory cytokines, antibodies, and matrix-degrading enzymes orchestrate the pathogenic events in autoimmune arthritis. Accordingly, these mediators of inflammation are the targets of several anti-arthritic drugs. However, the prolonged use of such drugs is associated with severe adverse reactions. This limitation has necessitated the search for less toxic natural plant products that possess anti-arthritic activity. Furthermore, it is imperative that the mechanism of action of such products be explored before they can be recommended for further preclinical testing. Using the rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model of human RA, we demonstrate that celastrol derived from Celastrus has potent anti-arthritic activity. This suppression of arthritis is mediated via modulation of the key proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17, IL-6, and IFN-γ) in response to the disease-related antigens, of the IL-6/IL-17-related transcription factor STAT3, of antibodies directed against cyclic citrullinated peptides and Bhsp65, and of the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and phospho-ERK. Most of the clinical and mechanistic attributes of celastrol are similar to those of Celastrus extract. Several studies have addressed the antitumor activity of celastrol. Our study highlights the anti-arthritic activity of Celastrus-derived celastrol and the underlying mechanisms. These results provide a strong rationale for further testing and validation of the use of celastrol and the natural plant extract from Celastrus as an adjunct (with conventional drugs) or alternative modality for the treatment of RA.

In contrast, our study highlights the anti-arthritic attribute of this compound and the immunological and biochemical mechanisms involved in this activity. Our results offer the scientific rationale for considering the preclinical testing of Celastrus and celastrol in RA patients. Male Lewis rats (LEW/Hsd, RT.11; 5–6 weeks old, ∼150–200 g) were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN) and housed in the vivarium of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. All experimental procedures on these rats were performed following the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Ethanol extract of the roots and stem of C. aculeatus Merrill (Celastrus) was prepared as described previously (23Tong L. Moudgil K.D. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2007; 9: R70Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the roots and stem of this plant were dried, powdered, and then extracted with 75% ethanol. The extract was collected and re-extracted with 75% ethanol. The final extract was concentrated and dried. The extract was subjected to reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The three major groups of compounds, namely triterpenes (celastrol), flavonoids (epiafzelechin) and sesquiterpenes (orbiculin F), were identified (23Tong L. Moudgil K.D. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2007; 9: R70Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Celastrol ((9β,13α,14β,20α)-3-hydroxy-9,13-dimethyl-2-oxo-24,25,26-trinoroleana-1(10),3,5,7-tetraen-29-oic acid), Mr = 450.6) is one of the bioactive components of Celastrus. Purified celastrol isolated from Celastrus scandens was purchased from Calbiochem. Heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Mtb) was obtained from Difco (Detroit, MI). Bhsp65 (mycobacterial heat shock protein 65) was prepared by transforming BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) with the pET23b-GroEL2 vector (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO) (30Kim H.R. Kim E.Y. Cerny J. Moudgil K.D. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6634-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ovalbumin and keyhole limpet hemocyanin were obtained from Sigma. Mtb was ground to a powder form and suspended in mineral oil (Sigma). Lewis rats were immunized subcutaneously with 200 μl of Mtb suspension (1.5 mg/rat) at the base of the tail. Following immunization, these rats were observed regularly for erythema, swelling, and induration in each paw. The severity of arthritis was graded on a scale of 0–4 as described previously (27Durai M. Gupta R.S. Moudgil K.D. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2795-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Moudgil K.D. Chang T.T. Eradat H. Chen A.M. Gupta R.S. Brahn E. Sercarz E.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The maximum attainable arthritic score per paw was 4 and per rat was 16. In a typical disease course of AA in Lewis rats, four different phases are evident: incubation, onset, peak, and recovery. Celastrus extract was finely suspended in water using a mortar and pestle and fed to Lewis rats (3 g/kg of body weight in a 2-ml volume) daily using a gavage needle (FNC-16-3, Kant Scientific Corp., Torrington, CT). Celastrus feeding was started from the onset of AA and then continued uninterrupted for the entire duration of the observation period. The control rats received vehicle (water). All rats were graded regularly for the severity of arthritis following Mtb challenge. A stock solution of celastrol (20 mg in 0.6 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma) was prepared and frozen at −20 °C in small aliquots until needed, following the method described previously (31Hu H. Straub A. Tian Z. Bassler N. Cheng J. Peter K. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2009; 54: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Yang H. Chen D. Cui Q.C. Yuan X. Dou Q.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4758-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The dose of celastrol (1 mg/kg) used in vivo in our study matched that used previously in different (non-arthritic) model systems (31Hu H. Straub A. Tian Z. Bassler N. Cheng J. Peter K. J.

Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4758-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The stock solution of celastrol was diluted in PBS (6-μl stock in 500 μl of PBS/rat) and injected intraperitoneally. Celastrol was administered daily to Mtb-challenged rats starting from the onset of AA and then continued uninterrupted for the entire duration of the observation period. The control rats received the vehicle, DMSO (1.2%), in PBS. All rats were observed and graded regularly for the signs of arthritis. Mtb-immunized Lewis rats treated with either Celastrus/celastrol or vehicle only were killed on day 19 of the disease course, and their draining lymph nodes (para-aortic, inguinal, and popliteal) were harvested. Thereafter, a single cell suspension of LNC was prepared, and the cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). These LNC were cultured (5 × 105 cells/well) in a flat-bottomed 96-well plate in HL-1 serum-free medium (Ventrex Laboratories, Portland, ME) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 (33Rajaiah R. Puttabyatappa M. Polumuri S.K. Moudgil K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2817-2825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cells were restimulated with Bhsp65 for 24 h. The specificity of the cytokine response induced by Bhsp65 was tested by showing the lack of response of Mtb-primed LNC to a control antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (supplemental Fig. 1). LNC were prepared from an untreated rat on day 19 after Mtb challenge. These cells were restimulated with Bhsp65 for 24 h in the presence or absence of different concentrations (0.05 and 0.1 μm) of celastrol. The dosage of celastrol used for the in vitro treatment of LNC was optimized such that there was no significant effect on cell viability as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (supplemental Fig. 2). LNC tolerated celastrol up to 0.5 μm without any effect on their viability. However, increasing the concentration of celastrol from 0.5 to 1 or 2 μm resulted in a decrease in percent viability of LNC to <60%. Spleens were harvested from experimental/control rats on day 19 of the disease course. A single cell suspension of spleen cells was prepared as described above for LNC. These spleen cells were placed in a 6-well plate (Corning, Corning, NY) at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. After 90 min, the non-adherent cells were removed by washing, yielding the SAC (27Durai M. Gupta R.S. Moudgil K.D. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2795-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These SAC (1.5–2.0 × 106 cells/well) were restimulated with sonicated Mtb (10 μg/ml) for 6 h. The specificity of the cytokine response induced by Mtb was tested by showing the lack of response of the SAC to a control antigen, ovalbumin (supplemental Fig. 1). SAC from untreated arthritic rats were restimulated for 6 h with sonicated Mtb in the presence or absence of different concentrations (0.05 and 0.1 μm) of celastrol. RNA was isolated from LNC and SAC using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and then cDNA was prepared from RNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The cDNA prepared was amplified in an ABI PRISM 7900HT cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by quantitative RT-PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and appropriate primers (33Rajaiah R. Puttabyatappa M. Polumuri S.K. Moudgil K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2817-2825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The primers for the detection of mRNAs for different cytokines and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase were designed using the Primer Express 2.0 Program (Applied Biosystems) and synthesized at the Biopolymer Genomics Core Facility of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. The mRNA levels of specific genes were normalized to those of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene, and the relative gene expression levels were determined (33Rajaiah R. Puttabyatappa M. Polumuri S.K. Moudgil K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2817-2825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as -fold increase. LNC obtained from Lewis rats treated with either Celastrus/celastrol or the corresponding vehicle were restimulated with antigen for 24 h in a 6-well plate. These cells were lysed using cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration of the lysate supernatant was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The proteins (20 μg) in the lysate supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–20%). Thereafter, the proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was first blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween, followed by probing with anti-phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3) or anti-ROR-γt antibodies (Abcam and Cell Signaling Technology) and then with secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce) (33Rajaiah R. Puttabyatappa M. Polumuri S.K. Moudgil K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2817-2825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The membrane probed with anti-pSTAT3 was reprobed with an antibody against total STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). GAPDH was used as a protein loading control. Protein bands were visualized with SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescent detection reagents (Pierce) following the manufacturer's directions. To study the in vitro effect of celastrol on pSTAT3 and ROR-γt, LNC obtained from Mtb-immunized Lewis rats were restimulated for 24 h with antigen in the presence or absence of celastrol. Cell lysates were used to study the level of STAT3 and ROR-γt using Western blotting as described above. Synovial fibroblasts (rat fibroblast-like synoviocytes) were cultured as described previously (33Rajaiah R. Puttabyatappa M. Polumuri S.K. Moudgil K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2817-2825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the cells in passage 4 were incubated in serum-free medium in a 6-well plate (2 × 105 cells/well). These cells were stimulated for 24 h with Mtb (10 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of celastrol. The culture supernatant was collected and used to analyze matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), IL-6, and VEGF by ELISA (Cytokine Core Facility, University of Maryland School of Medicine). MMP activity in the culture supernatants of synovial fibroblasts (rat fibroblast-like synoviocytes) stimulated with Mtb in the presence or absence of celastrol was determined using a gelatin zymogram assay as described previously (34Hembry R.M. Atkinson S.J. Murphy G. Methods Mol. Med. 2007; 135: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture supernatants were loaded onto a gelatin-coated precast polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. SDS was removed to renature the gel by incubation with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1–2 h, followed by three to four washings with water. The gel was then incubated overnight at 37 °C in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing CaCl2, NaCl, and Brij 35. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to visualize MMP activity. To study the effect of celastrol on signaling events, synovial fibroblasts (HFLS-RA (human fibroblast-like synoviocytes-rheumatoid arthritis), Cell Applications, Inc., San Diego, CA) were incubated for 6 h in serum-free DMEM, followed by stimulation with IL-1β in the presence or absence of celastrol for 30 min. Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer as described above and processed for Western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for phospho-p38, phospho-ERK (pERK), and phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling Technology). The membrane was reprobed with antibody against total p38, ERK, and JNK. GAPDH was used as a protein loading control. Protein bands were visualized with SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescent detection reagents following the manufacturer's directions. Control and test groups of Lewis rats were bled from the tail 1 day before Mtb immunization (day −1) and once a week (days 7, 14, 21, and 28) thereafter. Sera were separated and stored at −80 °C until used. The levels of serum aCCP antibodies were determined using commercial kits (CCP3 IgG ELISA kit, INOVA Diagnostics, Inc., San Diego, CA) with a minor modification of the procedure. Sera (diluted 1:75) were added to wells coated with CCP and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed thoroughly with washing buffer, followed by the addition to the wells of HRP-conjugated mouse anti-rat total Ig (1:1500) as the second antibody. The plate was incubated for 45 min at room temperature. After washing, color was developed, and the absorbance was read. Negative and positive controls for quality control as well as a 5-point standard curve for quantitation were also included in the assay. The results are expressed as unit values corresponding to 1:100 serum dilution following the manufacturer's instructions. An aCCP antibody level equal to or higher than 20 units was considered a positive response. The assay for antibodies against Bhsp65 was performed as described previously (30Kim H.R. Kim E.Y. Cerny J. Moudgil K.D. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6634-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HRP-conjugated mouse anti-rat total Ig was used as a secondary antibody (1:1500) in this assay. Two-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni post-test was carried out for in vivo clinical experiments. Student's t test was used to analyze cytokine mRNA expression data. A p value <0.05 was considered as significant. A group each of Mtb-immunized Lewis rats was fed daily with Celastrus extract or injected intraperitoneally with celastrol starting at the onset of AA and then continued for 25 days. The control rats received water orally or PBS/DMSO (1.2%) intraperitoneally. Both experimental groups of rats showed significant reduction in the severity of AA compared with the control rats (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, A–D). The mean arthritic scores of Celastrus-fed and control rats at the peak phase of the disease course were 1.6 and 5.9, respectively (Fig. 1A). In comparison, celastrol-treated and control rats displayed mean arthritic score of <1.0 and 6.2, respectively (Fig. 1B). The anti-arthritic activity of Celastrus and celastrol was further confirmed by histological examination of the hind paws (Fig. 1, E and F). Synovial mononuclear cell infiltration, pannus formation, and cartilage and bone destruction were significantly reduced in the joints of Celastrus- and celastrol-treated rats compared with the respective control rats. These results show that both Celastrus and its bioactive component, celastrol, have anti-arthritic activity and that the suppression effect of celastrol is much more pronounced than that of Celastrus extract. The draining LNC were harvested from Celastrus/celastrol-treated rats and then restimulated in vitro with the disease-related antigen Bhsp65. The expression of cytokines in LNC was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. There was a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the expression of IL-17 mRNA in Celastrus/celastrol-treated rats compared with their respective controls (Fig. 2, A and C). The expression of IL-17 mRNA was decreased by 3.4-fold in Celastrus-treated rats and 3.7-fold in celastrol-treated rats compared with the respective control groups. Similarly, the IFN-γ mRNA level was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in celastrol-treated rats. However, the decline in the IFN-γ mRNA level in Celastrus-treated rats was not significant. Furthermore, neither Celastrus nor celastrol had any measurable effect on the expression of IL-10. In parallel, SAC obtained from Celastrus/celastrol-treated rats were stimulated with sonicated Mtb, and the cytokine expression was measured. IL-6 mRNA expression in rats treated with Celastrus or celastrol was decreased by 2.8- or 7.3-fold, respectively, compared with their respective controls (Fig. 2, B and D). However, no significant change was observed in the expression of IL-23 and IL-27. These results show that both Celastrus and celastrol inhibit the expression of critical cytokines related to arthritis, namely IL-17, IFN-γ, and IL-6. To examine the effect of celastrol on the expression of cytokines in LNC in vitro, LNC were stimulated with Bhsp65 in the presence or absence of celastrol, and the cytokine expression was then measured. Celastrol decreased Bhsp65-induced expression of IL-17 mRNA by 2.1- and 2.5-fold when tested at concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 μm, respectively (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the IFN-γ mRNA level was reduced by 13.9- and 23.2-fold, respectively (p < 0.05). However, no significant change in the levels of IL-10 mRNA expression was observed. We also studied the effect of celastrol on the expression of cytokines in SAC in vitro. The cytokine expression was measured after stimulating SAC with sonicated Mtb in the presence or absence of celastrol. The results show that celastrol significantly decreases Mtb-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-27 mRNAs in SAC (Fig. 3B). Although there was a minor increase in the levels of IL-23 at 0.1 μm celastrol, the change was not significant. As described above, both Celastrus and celastrol suppress IL-17 and IFN-γ ex vivo as well as in vitro. To further validate suppression of the IL-17 response, LNC from Celastrus/celastrol-treated and control rats were cultured in the presence or absence of Bhsp65, and the expression of two Th17-related transcription factors (pSTAT3 and ROR-γt) was measured (Fig. 4A). Celastrus/celastrol-treated rats showed reduced expression of Bhsp65-induced pSTAT3 compared with their respective controls. A similar pattern was observed with LNC cultured without Bhsp65, showing the ex vivo expression profile of LNC. In the case of ROR-γt, the reduction was observed in LNC restimulated with Bhsp65 but not in unstimulated LNC from Celastrus-treated rats. The effect was less marked in the celastrol-treated group. Similar results were obtained when the effect of celastrol on LNC was tested in vitro (Fig. 4B). We further examined the effect of celastrol on the secretion of mediators of inflammation and tissue damage by rat fibroblast-like synoviocytes obtained from arthritic joints of Lewis rats. Celastrol significantly suppressed Mtb-induced IL-6 production in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). However, there was no significant change in the levels of the angiogenic factor VEGF. In addition, celastrol inhibited the secretion of MMP-9 induced by Mtb, whereas, the activity of pro-MMP-2 and MMP-2 was unaltered by Mtb as well as celastrol (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, celastrol reduced the levels of pERK (Fig. 5C). However, the levels of phosphorylated p38 and JNK remained unaltered (supplemental Fig. 3). All arthritic rats produced antibodies to Bhsp65 (Fig. 6A). Celastrol-treated rats had reduced levels of anti-Bhsp65 antibodies after treatment (on days 14, 21, and 28) compared with the control rats. However, no detectab"
https://openalex.org/W2164537043,"Social behavior is a defining mammalian feature that integrates emotional and motivational processes with external rewarding stimuli. It is thus an appropriate readout for complex behaviors, yet its neuronal and molecular bases remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of the mouse prefrontal area, particularly the involvement of β2-subunit nicotinic receptors (β2∗-nAChRs) in a paradigm of social behavior with concurrent motivations. We previously observed that mice lacking β2∗-nAChRs (β2-/-) display increased time in social contact and exaggerated approach movements toward the novel conspecific. Here, combining behavioral analysis, localized brain lesions, and lentiviral gene rescue, we found that c-Fos expression is specifically activated in the prelimbic (PrL) area of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice exposed to a novel conspecific; lesions of the PrL area in wild-type mice produce the same social pattern as in β2-/- mice; and virally mediated reexpression of the β2-subunit in the PrL area of β2-/- mice rescues behavioral components in the social interaction task up to normal levels. Together, these data reveal that social interactions particularly mobilize the PrL area of the mouse PFC and that the presence of functional PrL β2∗-nAChRs is necessary for this integrated behavior to emerge.—Avale, M.

https://openalex.org/W2039479591,"Background The nosocomial prevalence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Portugal remains one of the highest in Europe and is currently around 50%. Transmission of S. aureus, including MRSA, occurs principally by direct human-to-human skin contact. However, S. aureus can survive for long periods on inanimate objects, which may represent an important reservoir for dissemination as well. Methodology/Principal Findings Between May 2009 and February 2010, handrails of 85 public urban buses circulating in Oporto, Portugal, were screened for the occurrence of MRSA. Twenty-two (26%) buses showed MRSA contamination. The molecular characterization of a total of 55 MRSA, by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec typing, spa typing, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), clustered the isolates into three clonal types. However, the overwhelming majority (n = 50; 91%) of the isolates belonged to a single clone (PFGE A, spa types t747, t032, t025 or t020, ST22, SCCmec type IVh) that exhibits the characteristics of the pandemic EMRSA-15, currently the major lineage circulating in Portuguese hospitals, namely in the Oporto region. Two additional clones were found but in much lower numbers: (i) PFGE B, ST5, spa type t002, SCCmec IVa (n = 3), and (ii) PFGE C, spa type t008, ST8, SCCmec IVa (n = 2). None of the 55 isolates was PVL positive. Conclusions/Significance Public buses in Oporto seem to be an important reservoir of MRSA of nosocomial origin, providing evidence that the major hospital-associated MRSA clone in Portugal is escaping from the primary ecological niche of hospitals to the community environment. Infection control measures are urgently warranted to limit the spread of EMRSA-15 to the general population and future studies are required to assess the eventual increase of MRSA in the Portuguese community, which so far remains low."
https://openalex.org/W1965441318,"Background The pathogenesis of penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is not well understood, though risk factors include human papillomavirus (HPV). Disruption of HER/PTEN/Akt pathway is present in many cancers; however there is little information on its function in PSCC. We investigated HER family receptors and phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) in HPV-positive and negative PSCC and its impact on Akt activation using immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). Methodology/Principal Findings 148 PSCCs were microarrayed and immunostained for phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), HER2, HER3, HER4, phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), Akt1 and PTEN proteins. EGFR and PTEN gene status were also evaluated using FISH. HPV presence was assessed by PCR. pEGFR expression was detected significantly less frequently in HPV-positive than HPV-negative tumours (p = 0.0143). Conversely, HER3 expression was significantly more common in HPV-positive cases (p = 0.0128). HER4, pAkt, Akt and PTEN protein expression were not related to HPV. HER3 (p = 0.0054) and HER4 (p = 0.0002) receptors significantly correlated with cytoplasmic Akt1 immunostaining. All three proteins positively correlated with tumour grade (HER3, p = 0.0029; HER4, p = 0.0118; Akt1, p = 0.0001). pEGFR expression correlated with pAkt but not with tumour grade or stage. There was no EGFR gene amplification. HER2 was not detected. PTEN protein expression was reduced or absent in 62% of tumours but PTEN gene copy loss was present only in 4% of PSCCs. Conclusions/Significance EGFR, HER3 and HER4 but not HER2 are associated with penile carcinogenesis. HPV-negative tumours tend to express significantly more pEGFR than HPV-positive cancers and this expression correlates with pAkt protein, indicating EGFR as an upstream regulator of Akt signalling in PSCC. Conversely, HER3 expression is significantly more common in HPV-positive cases and positively correlates with cytoplasmic Akt1 expression. HER4 and PTEN protein expression are not related to HPV infection. Our results suggest that PSCC patients could benefit from therapies developed to target HER receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1968817279,"We have shown that cutaneous cooling-sensitive receptors can work as thermostats of skin temperature against cooling. However, molecule of the thermostat is not known. Here, we studied whether cooling-sensitive TRPM8 channels act as thermostats. TRPM8 in HEK293 cells generated output (y) when temperature (T) was below threshold of 28.4°C. Output (y) is given by two equations: At T >28.4°C, y = 0; At T <28.4°C, y = -k(T – 28.4°C). These equations show that TRPM8 is directional comparator to elicits output (y) depending on negative value of thermal difference (ΔT = T – 28.4°C). If negative ΔT-dependent output of TRPM8 in the skin induces responses to warm the skin for minimizing ΔT recursively, TRPM8 acts as thermostats against cooling. With TRPM8-deficient mice, we explored whether TRPM8 induces responses to warm the skin against cooling. In behavioral regulation, when room temperature was 10°C, TRPM8 induced behavior to move to heated floor (35°C) for warming the sole skin. In autonomic regulation, TRPM8 induced activities of thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) against cooling. When menthol was applied to the whole trunk skin at neutral room temperature (27°C), TRPM8 induced a rise in core temperature, which warmed the trunk skin slightly. In contrast, when room was cooled from 27 to 10°C, TRPM8 induced a small rise in core temperature, but skin temperature was severely reduced in both TRPM8-deficient and wild-type mice by a large heat leak to the surroundings. This shows that TRPM8-driven endothermic system is less effective for maintenance of skin temperature against cooling. In conclusion, we found that TRPM8 is molecule of thermostat of skin temperature against cooling."

Jarid2 knock-out mice exhibit cardiac defects including hypertrabeculation with noncompaction of the ventricular wall. However, molecular mechanisms underlying Jarid2-mediated cardiac development remain unknown. To determine the cardiac lineage-specific roles of Jarid2, we generated myocardial, epicardial, cardiac neural crest, or endothelial conditional Jarid2 knock-out mice using Cre-loxP technology. Only mice with an endothelial deletion of Jarid2 recapitulate phenotypic defects observed in whole body mutants including hypertrabeculation and noncompaction of the ventricle. To identify potential targets of Jarid2, combinatorial approaches using microarray and candidate gene analyses were employed on Jarid2 knock-out embryonic hearts. Whole body or endothelial deletion of Jarid2 leads to increased endocardial Notch1 expression in the developing ventricle, resulting in increased Notch1-dependent signaling to the adjacent myocardium. Using quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, Jarid2 was found to occupy a specific region on the endogenous Notch1 locus. We propose that failure to properly regulate Notch signaling in Jarid2 mutants likely leads to the defects in the developing ventricular chamber. The identification of Jarid2 as a potential regulator of Notch1 signaling has broad implications for many cellular processes including development, stem cell maintenance, and tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W2019005133,"X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) overexpression has been found to be associated with malignant cancer progression and aggression in individuals with many types of cancers. However, the molecular basis of XIAP in the regulation of cancer cell biological behavior remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that a deficiency of XIAP expression in human cancer cells by either knock-out or knockdown leads to a marked reduction in β-actin polymerization and cytoskeleton formation. Consistently, cell migration and invasion were also decreased in XIAP-deficient cells compared with parental wild-type cells. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the regulation of cell motility by XIAP depends on its interaction with the Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) via the XIAP RING domain. Furthermore, XIAP was found to negatively regulate RhoGDI SUMOylation, which might affect its activity in controlling cell motility. Collectively, our studies provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which XIAP regulates cancer invasion and offer a further theoretical basis for setting XIAP as a potential prognostic marker and specific target for treatment of cancers with metastatic properties.

https://openalex.org/W2140192506,"Tumor suppressor p53 is crucial for embryonic implantation through transcriptional up-regulation of uterine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This article reports that p53 and estrogen receptor α were activated in endometrial tissues during implantation to coordinately regulate LIF production. By using human p53 knockin (Hupki) mice carrying a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 72 (arginine/proline), the arginine allele was demonstrated to produce higher uterine LIF levels during implantation than the proline allele. In humans, the diversity of haplotypes of the p53 gene has decreased during evolution, because the arginine allele, existing in only a subset of haplotypes, is under positive selection. This observation is consistent with previous results showing that the proline allele is enriched in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Studies with p63- and p73-knockout mice have demonstrated the involvement of p63 and p73 in female reproduction and their roles in egg formation and apoptosis (p63) and spindle checkpoint (p73) in female mice. Here, the role of p63 and p73 in human reproduction was investigated. Selected alleles of SNPs in p63 and p73 genes were enriched in IVF patients. These findings demonstrate that the p53 family members are involved in several steps to regulate female reproduction in mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2171387325,"We report how rotational variations in transmembrane (TM) helix interactions participate in the activity states of the thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR), a type 1 cytokine receptor that controls the production of blood platelets. We also explore the mechanism of small-molecule agonists that do not mimic the natural ligand. We show, by a combination of cysteine cross-linking, alanine-scanning mutagenesis, and computational simulations, that the TpoR TM dimerizes strongly and can adopt 3 different stable, rotationally related conformations, which may correspond to specific states of the full-length receptor (active, inactive, and partially active). Thus, our data suggest that signaling and inactive states of the receptor are related by receptor subunit rotations, rather than a simple monomer-dimer transition. Moreover, results from experiments with and without agonists in vitro and in cells allow us to propose a novel allosteric mechanism of action for a class of small molecules, in which they activate TpoR by binding to the TM region and by exploiting the rotational states of the dimeric receptor. Overall, our results support the emerging view of the participation of mutual rotations of the TM domains in cytokine receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1979335914,"A number of enzymes become functional by binding to zinc during their journey through the early secretory pathway. The zinc transporters (ZnTs) located there play important roles in this step. We have previously shown that two zinc transport complexes, ZnT5/ZnT6 heterodimers and ZnT7 homo-oligomers, are required for the activation of alkaline phosphatases, by converting them from the apo- to the holo-form. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this activation. ZnT1 and ZnT4 expressed in chicken DT40 cells did not contribute to the activation of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). The reduced activity of TNAP in DT40 cells deficient in both ZnT complexes was not restored by zinc supplementation nor by exogenous expression of other ZnTs that increase the zinc content in the secretory pathway. Moreover, we showed that expression of ZnT5/ZnT6 heterodimers reconstituted with zinc transport-incompetent ZnT5 mutant failed to restore TNAP activity but could stabilize the TNAP protein as the apo-form, regardless of zinc status. These findings demonstrate that TNAP is activated not simply by passive zinc binding but by an elaborate two-step mechanism via protein stabilization followed by enzyme conversion from the apo- to the holo-form with zinc loaded by ZnT complexes in the early secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2081557029,"Self-awareness impairments are frequently mentioned as being responsible for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. However, the neural correlates of self-other distinction in this pathology are still poorly understood. In the present study, we developed an fMRI procedure in order to examine self-other distinction during speech exchange situations. Fifteen subjects with schizophrenia were compared to 15 matched controls. The results revealed an increased overlap between the self and non-self cortical maps in schizophrenia, in the medial frontal and medial parietal cortices, as well as in the right middle temporal cortex and the right inferior parietal lobule. Moreover, these neural structures showed less BOLD amplitude differences between the self and non-self conditions in the patients. These activation patterns were judged to be independent of mirror-like properties, familiarity or body-ownership processing. Significantly, the increase in the right IPL signal was found to correlate positively with the severity of first-rank symptoms, and thus could be considered a “state-marker” of schizophrenia, whereas temporal and medial parieto-frontal differences appear to be “trait-markers” of the disease. Such an increased overlap between self and non-self cortical maps might be considered a neuro-physiological signature of the well established self-awareness impairment in people suffering from schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W1978531449,"The 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus continues to circulate among the human population as the predominant H1N1 subtype. Epidemiological studies and airborne transmission studies using the ferret model have shown that the transmission efficiency of 2009 H1N1 viruses is lower than that of previous seasonal strains and the 1918 pandemic H1N1 strain. We recently correlated this reduced transmission efficiency to the lower binding affinity of the 2009 H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) to α2→6 sialylated glycan receptors (human receptors). Here we report that a single point mutation (Ile219→Lys; a base pair change) in the glycan receptor-binding site (RBS) of a representative 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus, A/California/04/09 or CA04/09, quantitatively increases its human receptor-binding affinity. The increased human receptor-affinity is in the same range as that of the HA from highly transmissible seasonal and 1918 pandemic H1N1 viruses. Moreover, a 2009 H1N1 virus carrying this mutation in the RBS (generated using reverse genetics) transmits efficiently in ferrets by respiratory droplets thereby reestablishing our previously observed correlation between human receptor-binding affinity and transmission efficiency. These findings are significant in the context of monitoring the evolution of the currently circulating 2009 H1N1 viruses."

Notably at the percolation threshold the semantic space is characterised by scale-free behaviour at different levels of complexity and this relates the semantic space to a wide range of biological, social and linguistics phenomena. In particular we find that the cluster size distribution, representing the size of different semantic areas, is scale-free. Moreover the topology of the resulting semantic space is scale-free in the connectivity distribution and displays small-world properties. However its statistical properties do not allow a classical interpretation via a generative model based on a simple multiplicative process. After giving a detailed description and interpretation of the topological properties of the semantic space, we introduce a stochastic model of content-based network, based on a copy and mutation algorithm and on the Heaps' law, that is able to capture the main statistical properties of the analysed semantic space, including the Zipf's law for the word frequency distribution."

To better understand their roles in various biological processes, identification of genes targeted by microRNAs is necessary. Although prediction tools have significantly helped with this task, experimental approaches are ultimately required for extensive target search and validation. We employed two independent yet complementary high throughput approaches to map a large set of mRNAs regulated by miR-122, a liver-specific microRNA implicated in regulation of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism, hepatitis C infection, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The combination of luciferase reporter-based screening and shotgun proteomics resulted in the identification of 260 proteins significantly down-regulated in response to miR-122 in at least one method, 113 of which contain predicted miR-122 target sites. These proteins are enriched for functions associated with the cell cycle, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Among these miR-122-sensitive proteins, we identified a large group with strong connections to liver metabolism, diseases, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional analyses, including examination of consensus binding motifs for both miR-122 and target sequences, provide further insight into miR-122 function.

https://openalex.org/W1966818564,"Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays a critical role in tissue remodeling under both physiological and pathological conditions. Although MMP-9 expression is low in most cells and is tightly controlled, the mechanism of its regulation is poorly understood. We utilized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that were nullizygous for the catalytic α subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a key regulator of energy homeostasis, to identify AMPK as a suppressor of MMP-9 expression. Total AMPKα deletion significantly elevated MMP-9 expression compared with wild-type (WT) MEFs, whereas single knock-out of the isoforms AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 caused minimal change in the level of MMP-9 expression. The suppressive role of AMPK on MMP-9 expression was mediated through both its activity and presence. The AMPK activators 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside and A769662 suppressed MMP-9 expression in WT MEFs, and AMPK inhibition by the overexpression of dominant negative (DN) AMPKα elevated MMP-9 expression. However, in AMPKα−/− MEFs transduced with DN AMPKα, MMP-9 expression was suppressed. AMPKα−/− MEFs showed increased phosphorylation of IκBα, expression of IκBα mRNA, nuclear localization of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB compared with WT. Consistently, selective NF-κB inhibitors BMS345541 and SM7368 decreased MMP-9 expression in AMPKα−/− MEFs. Overall, our results suggest that both AMPKα isoforms suppress MMP-9 expression and that both the activity and presence of AMPKα contribute to its function as a regulator of MMP-9 expression by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.

Under normal circumstances, the degradation of the ECM by MMP-9 is a tightly controlled process involved in physiological wound healing and embryo development (1Van den Steen P.E. Dubois B.

Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3240) Google Scholar). Conversely, aberrant degradation of ECM by excess MMP-9 expression results in the pathologic destruction of connective tissue seen in cancer, arterial sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (1Van den Steen P.E.

Chakraborti T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 253: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Therefore, under physiological conditions, regulated MMP-9 expression is low (1Van den Steen P.E. Dubois B. Nelissen I. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 37: 375-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms behind this are obscure. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase, which regulates energy homeostasis and metabolic stress (4Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). AMPK acts as a sensor of cellular energy status and maintains the balance between ATP production and consumption. In mammals, AMPK exists as a heterotrimer with α, β, and γ subunits, each of which is encoded by two or three genes (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2, and γ3). The α subunit possesses catalytic activity, whereas the β and γ subunits are regulatory and maintain the stability of the heterotrimer complex. The importance of AMPKα is illustrated by the fact that dual deficiency of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 is embryonic lethal (5Viollet B. Athea Y. Mounier R. Guigas B. Zarrinpashneh E. Horman S. Lantier L. Hebrard S. Devin-Leclerc J. Beauloye C. Foretz M. Andreelli F. Ventura-Clapier R. Bertrand L. Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 19-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that AMPK has a much wider range of functions, including the regulation of cell growth, cell proliferation, cell polarity, and autophagy (6Wang W. Guan K.L. Acta Physiol. 2009; 196: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 7Theodoropoulou S. Kolovou P.E. Morizane Y. Kayama M. Nicolaou F. Miller J.W. Gragoudas E. Ksander B.R. Vavvas D.G. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 2620-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because these functions are closely linked to the pathology of MMP-9-related diseases, including cancer, arterial sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, we hypothesized that AMPK regulates MMP-9 expression. To address this, in the present study, we utilized AMPKα-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to investigate the effect of the genetic deletion and activation of AMPK on MMP-9 expression. All antibodies, except for MMP-9 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and AMPKα2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Recombinant mouse TNF-α, MMP-9, and MMP-2 proteins were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Pharmacological activators of AMPK, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside (AICAR), and A769662 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO), respectively. The inhibitors for IKK (BMS345541), NF-κB (SM7368), and JNK (SP600125) were purchased from Calbiochem. The origins of primary and SV40-immortalized WT, AMPKα1 subunit single knock-out (AMPKα1−/−), ΑΜPKα2 subunit single knock-out (AMPKα2−/−), and double knock-out of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 subunit (AMPKα−/−) MEFs have been described previously (8Laderoute K.R. Amin K. Calaoagan J.M. Knapp M. Le T. Orduna J. Foretz M. Viollet B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5336-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). MEFs were cultured in DMEM-high glucose (D6429; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For all experiments, cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Experiments were performed on cells below passage 10 grown to 80–90% confluence. Cells were rinsed in ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and then scraped and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.05% Brij35) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 2 mm Na3VO4) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell suspensions were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected as whole cell lysates. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (7Theodoropoulou S. Kolovou P.E. Morizane Y. Kayama M. Nicolaou F. Miller J.W. Gragoudas E. Ksander B.R. Vavvas D.G. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 2620-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Singh S. Saunders G.F. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Conditioned media from cultured cells were collected and subjected to gelatin zymography. After cells reached 90% confluence, they were rinsed twice, and the medium was replaced with serum-free medium with or without TNF-α (1–100 ng/ml). After 24-h incubation, the conditioned media were collected and concentrated 3-fold using an Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter device (Millipore) with a 30,000-molecular mass cutoff. The amount of concentrated media was normalized to the amount of protein in the cell lysate, then loaded on a Zymogram 10% gel (Invitrogen). Recombinant mouse MMP-2 and MMP-9 were used as positive controls. After renaturing and developing the gels according to the manufacturer's instructions, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 solution (Bio-Rad). The intensities of bands were quantified using ImageJ software. Western blotting was carried out according to standard protocols. Densitometric analysis of bands was performed using ImageJ software. Analysis of accumulated MMP-9 in cell culture medium was performed using a quantitative ELISA kit (R&D Systems). After cells reached 90% confluence, they were rinsed twice, and fresh DMEM with or without reagent was added. The media were collected 12 or 24 h later, and assays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Obtained values were normalized to cell lysate protein levels. The DNA-binding activity of NF-κB p50, p52, p65, and RelB was determined by the Trans AMTM NF-κB family assay kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above, and 15-μg nuclear extracts were used for the detection of DNA binding following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was harvested from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated with the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR was carried out using the following mouse TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems): AMPKα1 (Mm01296695_m1), AMPKα2 (Mm01264788_m1), MMP-9 (Mm00442991_m1), IκBα (Mm00477798_m1), and β-actin (Mm00607939_s1). All reactions were prepared following the manufacturer's protocol and carried out using the StepOneTM Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The adenovirus vector for the dominant negative (DN) form of AMPKα2 (Ad-DN) with an inactivating mutation in the kinase domain (K45R substitution) has been described previously (10Aguilar V. Alliouachene S. Sotiropoulos A. Sobering A. Athea Y. Djouadi F. Miraux S. Thiaudière E. Foretz M. Viollet B. Diolez P. Bastin J. Benit P. Rustin P. Carling D. Sandri M. Ventura-Clapier R. Pende M. Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 476-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The Ad-DN contained GFP as a marker, and the adenovirus vector 5 with GFP (Ad-GFP) (Vector BioLabs, Philadelphia, PA) was used as a control. MEFs were transduced with the adenovirus vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 300 for 48 h. The medium was then changed, and cell extracts and medium were harvested after 12 h. Under these conditions, the infection efficiency was >90%. All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. All data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical differences between two groups were analyzed by the unpaired Student's t test. Multiple group comparison was performed by one-way analysis of variance with Scheffe's test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. To study the role of AMPK in fibroblast expression of MMP-9, we utilized SV40-immortalized WT MEFs and MEFs that were nullizygous for both AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 subunits (AMPKα−/− MEFs). We examined the gelatinolytic activity of culture medium using gelatin zymography. As shown in Fig. 1A, the base-line gelatinolytic activity of pro-MMP-9 (under nonstimulatory conditions) of WT MEFs was barely detectable. By contrast, AMPKα−/− MEFs showed MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity that was 4.3 ± 0.9 times higher than that of WT MEFs (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 between the two cell types. To determine the magnitude of AMPK deletion in fibroblast MMP-9 expression, we next treated both MEFs with the major inducible factor of MMP-9, TNF-α (1Van den Steen P.E. Dubois B. Nelissen I. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 37: 375-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). TNF-α increased the MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity of both WT and AMPKα−/− MEFs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Notably, the MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity of unstimulated AMPKα−/− ΜΕFs was equal to the maximum gelatinolytic activity of WT MEFs with TNF-α treatment. Furthermore, the MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity of AMPKα−/− ΜΕFs with each dose of TNF-α was two to three times higher than that of WT MEFs treated in the same way. The results of gelatin zymography were confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Collectively, these results demonstrate that deletion of both AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 subunits leads to constitutive expression of MMP-9 and augmentation of the effect of TNF-α on MMP-9 expression. SV40 immortalization is known to inactivate the function of the cancer suppressor genes Rb and p53 (11Stahl H. Knippers R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 910: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Moens U. Seternes O.M. Johansen B. Rekvig O.P. Virus Genes. 1997; 15: 135-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To exclude the effects of SV40 immortalization on MMP-9 expression, we cultured primary MEFs of WT and AMPKα−/− and analyzed the level of MMP-9 protein in their culture media by Western blotting and ELISA. Fig. 2A shows a representative result of confirmatory Western blotting for the deletion of AMPKα in AMPKα−/− MEFs. The ability of antibody to detect phosphorylated acetylcoenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), which is a downstream target of AMPK, was taken as an indicator of AMPK activation. In accordance with the results for SV40-immortalized MEFs, both Western blotting and the ELISA showed that MMP-9 expression from primary AMPKα−/− MEFs was significantly higher than that of primary WT MEFs (7.8 ± 0.9 times higher in the ELISA, p < 0.01, Fig. 2, B and C). These results show that SV40 immortalization does not affect differences in MMP-9 expression between WT and AMPKα−/− MEFs. Hereafter, all experiments were performed with SV40-immortalized MEFs unless otherwise noted. The AMPKα catalytic subunit has two isoforms, AMPKα1 and AMPKα2, which show differential tissue-specific expression (4Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). To determine the role of both isoforms in the expression of MMP-9, we utilized MEFs nullizygous for AMPKα1 (AMPKα1−/− MEFs) and AMPKα2 (AMPKα2−/− MEFs). As shown in Fig. 3A, the protein amount of pan-AMPKα subunit (AMPKα1 + α2) decreased considerably in AMPKα1−/− MEFs, but not in AMPKα2−/− MEFs. This indicates that the majority of AMPKα subunit in MEF is AMPKα1 (8Laderoute K.R. Amin K. Calaoagan J.M. Knapp M. Le T. Orduna J. Foretz M. Viollet B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5336-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). AMPKα1−/− MEFs showed a significant up-regulation of MMP-9 expression (5.1 ± 0.02 times higher than WT MEFs, p < 0.01, Fig. 3B), but the level of MMP-9 up-regulation was less than that seen in AMPKα−/− MEFs. By contrast, MMP-9 expression from AMPKα2−/− MEFs was similar to that seen in WT MEFs, consistent with the minimal change in the pan-AMPKα amount. These results were confirmed at the mRNA level by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3C), suggesting that complete deletion of both AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 isoforms is required to cause maximum overexpression of MMP-9 in MEFs. The finding that AMPKα deletion leads to the constitutive expression of MMP-9 prompted us to examine whether the kinase activity of AMPK is involved in the regulation of MMP-9 expression. To this end, we first treated WT and AMPKα−/− MEFs with a pharmacological activator of AMPK, AICAR (13Göransson O. McBride A. Hawley S.A. Ross F.A. Shpiro N. Foretz M. Viollet B. Hardie D.G.

IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). AICAR activated AMPK signaling in WT MEFs in a dose-dependent manner, but not in AMPKα−/− MEFs (Fig. 4A). MMP-9 expression from WT MEFs decreased dose-dependently by 11 and 52% following 0.25 mm and 0.5 mm AICAR treatment, respectively (Fig. 4B). By contrast, 0.25 mm AICAR treatment of AMPKα−/− MEFs did not alter MMP-9 expression. With 0.5 mm AICAR treatment, MMP-9 expression in AMPKα−/− MEFs decreased minimally (by 10%, p < 0.01, Fig. 4B). Although AICAR is used extensively as an AMPK activator, it has been shown to regulate other AMP-sensitive enzymes (13Göransson O. McBride A. Hawley S.A. Ross F.A. Shpiro N. Foretz M. Viollet B.

Hue L. IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AICAR has been reported to inhibit cellular respiration by an AMPK-independent mechanism and decrease intracellular ATP (15Guigas B. Bertrand L. Taleux N. Foretz M. Wiernsperger N. Vertommen D. Andreelli F. Viollet B. Hue L. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Mukhtar M.H. Payne V.A. Arden C. Harbottle A. Khan S. Lange A.J. Agius L. Am. J.

J. 2007; 404: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These could account for the suppressive effects seen on MMP-9 expression in AMPKα−/− MEFs at the higher levels of AICAR (0.5 mm). In addition, we tested the more specific AMPK activator, A769662 (13Göransson O. McBride A. Hawley S.A. Ross F.A. Shpiro N. Foretz M. Viollet B. Hardie D.G. Sakamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32549-32560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 14Guigas B. Sakamoto K. Taleux N. Reyna S.M. Musi N. Viollet B. Hue L. IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A769662 activated AMPK signaling in WT MEFs in a dose-dependent manner, but not in AMPKα−/− MEFs (Fig. 4C). In accordance with the results from AICAR-treated MEFs, 25 and 50 μm A769662 decreased MMP-9 expression from WT MEFs dose-dependently by 20 and 30%, respectively (Fig. 4D). By contrast, A769662 did not alter expression of MMP-9 from AMPKα−/− MEFs in either concentration used (Fig. 4D). Next, we investigated the effects of AMPK inhibition on MMP-9 expression by overexpressing the DN form of AMPKα in WT MEFs. Western blotting of Ad-DN-transduced WT MEF cell lysates showed a decrease in ACC phosphorylation, indicating inhibition of AMPK activity (Fig. 4E). The MMP-9 level of Ad-DN-transduced WT MEFs was 1.85 ± 0.19 times higher than that of Ad-GFP-transduced WT MEFs (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these results indicate the importance of AMPK kinase activity for the inhibition of MMP-9 expression from MEFs. It has been reported that protein kinase including AMPK can bind to different protein and regulates signal transduction independently of its kinase catalytic activity (19Bronner M. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Kim S. Kim S.F. Maag D. Maxwell M.J. Resnick A.C. Juluri K.R. Chakraborty A. Koldobskiy M.A. Cha S.H. Barrow R. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This suggests that not only the kinase activity but also the presence of AMPK may play an important role in the regulation of MMP-9 expression. To address this, we transduced AMPKα−/− MEFs with the Ad-DN. Transduction was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). Western blotting showed inhibition of ACC phosphorylation in Ad-GFP- and Ad-DN-transduced AMPKα−/− MEFs. It also revealed the up-regulation of AMPKβ1 in Ad-DN-transduced AMPKα−/− MEFs. Interestingly, ELISA revealed that the MMP-9 protein level of Ad-DN-transduced AMPKα−/− MEFs was significantly lower than that of Ad-GFP-transduced AMPKα−/− MEFs (p < 0.01, Fig. 5B). These results, in addition to the previous experiments mentioned above, indicate the importance of both the activity and the presence of AMPK in inhibiting MMP-9 expression in MEFs. MMP-9 expression is largely controlled by transcription of the gene, although mRNA stability and translational efficiency also play a role in regulating protein levels (1Van den Steen P.E. Dubois B.

To investigate which of these transcription factors are involved in the up-regulation of MMP-9 expression in AMPKα−/− MEFs, we used Western blotting to examine the effects of AMPKα deletion on the phosphorylation of c-Jun, major subunits of AP-1, and its upstream MAPKs (i.e. ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK), and the nuclear translocation of c-Jun and NF-κB. As shown in Fig. 6A, the phosphorylation of JNK was increased in AMPKα−/− ΜEFs, whereas there was no change in the phosphorylation of ERK. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was down-regulated in AMPKα−/− ΜΕFs. Nuclear extracts from WT and AMPKα−/− ΜΕFs showed an increase in the phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of c-Jun, indicating that it is activated through the activation of JNK (Fig. 6B). Western blotting of the nuclear extract also revealed nuclear translocation of NF-κΒ p65 and p52 in AMPKα−/− ΜΕFs, indicating that both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways are activated in AMPKα−/− ΜEFs (Fig. 6B). To determine whether the activation of c-Jun and NF-κB pathways is responsible for the up-regulation of MMP-9 expression in AMPKα−/− MEFs, we treated them with IKK inhibitor (BMS345541), NF-κB inhibitor (SM7368), or JNK inhibitor (SP600125) and evaluated MMP-9 protein levels by ELISA. Treatment with both BMS345541 and SM7368 significantly suppressed MMP-9 expression by 51 and 34%, respectively (both p < 0.01), whereas application of SP600125 did not. This indicates that the NF-κB pathway is partially responsible for the up-regulation of MMP-9 expression in AMPKα−/− MEFs (Fig. 6C). AMPKα deletion (comparing WT versus AMPKα−/− MEFs) increases MMP-9 expression by about 5-fold (Fig. 6C), but as shown previously, activation of endogenous AMPKα only suppresses MMP-9 in WT MEFs by about 50% (Fig. 4, B and D). This would suggest that endogenous AMPKα activity is sufficient to suppress MMP-9 expression tonically. Indeed, when NF-κB inhibitors BMS345541 and/or SM7368 were given in WT MEFs, they markedly suppressed endogenous MMP-9 expression by 71 and 61%, respectively (both p < 0.01, Fig. 6C). Together, these results highlight the importance of the AMPKα/NF-κB pathway in MMP-9 expression. To investigate whether the AMPKα deletion causes the constitutive activation of the NF-κΒ pathway in MEFs, we next investigated the phosphorylation and mRNA expression of IκBα (p-IκBα). Western blotting showed that IκBα phosphorylation was markedly higher in AMPKα−/− MEFs than in WT MEFs (Fig. 6D). The expression level of IκBα mRNA in AMPKα−/− MEFs was also significantly higher than in WT MEFs (p < 0.01, Fig. 6E). As IκBα is degraded by the ubiquitin process after phosphorylation (24Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4085) Google Scholar, 25Gilmore T.D.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6685-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that IκBα might undergo chronic degradation and resynthesis in AMPKα−/− ΜΕFs and that the AMPKα deletion causes constitutive activation of the NF-κΒ pathway in MEFs (27Reiley W.W. Jin W. Lee A.J. Wright A. Wu X. Tewalt E.F. Leonard T.O. Norbury C.C. Fitzpatrick L. Zhang M. Sun S.C. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To confirm activation of the NF-κB pathways further, we next evaluated the binding activity of nuclear extracts to NF-κΒ subunits of p65, p52, p50, and RelB by ELISA. We found that the binding activities of all NF-κB subunits were up-regulated in AMPKα−/− MEFs (p < 0.01, Fig. 6F), indicating that both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways are activated. Collectively, these results suggest that the AMPK deletion leads to the constitutive activation of the NF-κB pathway, which is at least partly responsible for the up-regulation of MMP-9 expression. MMP-9 plays a critical role in tissue remodeling under both physiological and pathological conditions. Its expression is low in most cells and is tightly controlled. Although many factors have been identified as stimulators of MMP-9 expression, only integrin α1 and transgelin have been shown to inhibit MMP-9 expression in normal cells under physiological conditions (28Pozzi A.

However, the latter studies used cell lines such as HT-1080, prostate cancer cells, pancreatic cancer cells, and NMuMG which, in contrast to normal cells and MEFs, express MMP-9 constitutively at high levels.

In TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation of pluripotent C3H10T1/2 progenitors, we found that TGF-β did not significantly induce Myocd mRNA expression until 18 h of stimulation. On the other hand, early SMC markers such as SM α-actin, SM22α, and SM calponin were detectable beginning 2 or 4 h after TGF-β treatment. These results suggest that Myocd expression is blocked during the initiation of TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation. Consistent with its endogenous expression, Myocd promoter activity was not elevated until 18 h following TGF-β stimulation. Surprisingly, Smad signaling was inhibitory to Myocd expression because blockade of Smad signaling enhanced Myocd promoter activity. Overexpression of Smad3, but not Smad2, inhibited Myocd promoter activity. Conversely, shRNA knockdown of Smad3 allowed TGF-β to activate the Myocd promoter in the initial phase of induction. Myocd was activated by PI3 kinase signaling and its downstream target Nkx2.5. Interestingly, Smad3 did not affect PI3 kinase activity. However, Smad3 physically interacted with Nkx2.5. This interaction blocked Nkx2.5 binding to the Myocd promoter in the early stage of TGF-β induction, leading to inhibition of Myocd mRNA expression.

By using various simple, ring-constrained spacers connecting the d-Trp-Phe-d-Trp motif with the important C-terminal carboxyamide group, 40 nm agonism potency was obtained and also in one case (wFw-Isn-NH2, where Isn is isonipecotic acid) ∼80% efficacy. However, in contrast to all previously reported ghrelin receptor agonists, the piperidine-constrained wFw-Isn-NH2 was found to be a functionally biased agonist. Thus, wFw-Isn-NH2 mediated potent and efficacious signaling through the Gαq and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, but in contrast to all previous ghrelin receptor agonists it did not signal through the serum response element, conceivably the Gα12/13 pathway. The recognition pattern of wFw-Isn-NH2 with the ghrelin receptor also differed significantly from that of all previously characterized unbiased agonists. Most importantly, wFw-Isn-NH2 was not dependent on GluIII:09 (Glu3.33), which otherwise is an obligatory TM III anchor point residue for ghrelin agonists. Molecular modeling and docking experiments indicated that wFw-Isn-NH2 binds in the classical agonist binding site between the extracellular segments of TMs III, VI, and VII, interacting closely with the aromatic cluster between TMs VI and VII, but that it does so in an opposite orientation as compared with, for example, the wFw peptide agonists. It is concluded that the novel peptide-mimetic ligand wFw-Isn-NH2 is a biased ghrelin receptor agonist and that the selective signaling pattern presumably is due to its unique receptor recognition pattern lacking interaction with key residues especially in TM III.

Ghrelin is a neuroendocrine hormone that differs from other peptide hormones by a fatty acid modification, which is crucial for both the binding and activation of its receptor (1Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7260) Google Scholar). Ghrelin is synthesized mainly in the gastrointestinal tract, where the gene coding for the peptide sequence is expressed together with the enzyme responsible for the acylation of the fatty acid to the ghrelin peptide sequence (2Kirchner H. Gutierrez J.A. Solenberg P.J. Pfluger P.T. Czyzyk T.A. Willency J.A. Schürmann A. Joost H.G. Jandacek R.J. Hale J.E. Heiman M.L. Tschöp M.H. Nat.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10750-10755Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Multiple functions have been described for ghrelin since it was discovered. Initially it was believed that growth hormone secretion induced by ghrelin receptors in the hypothalamus and the pituitary was the primary function of ghrelin (4Kojima M. Hosoda H. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 118-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). However, the function of ghrelin in the hypothalamus, and in particular in the arcuate nucleus, has become the focus of attention over the last decade. In the arcuate nucleus, ghrelin is responsible for increased activity in the NPY (neuropeptide Y) and AGRP (Agouti-related protein) neurones leading to increased appetite, decreased energy expenditure, and fat accumulation (5Tschöp M. Smiley D.L. Heiman M.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar, 6Nakazato M. Murakami N. Date Y. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Matsukura S. Nature. 2001; 409: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar). High receptor expression is also observed in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the function in this area has been proposed to be orexigenic based on the regulation of fatty acid metabolism (7López M. Lage R. Saha A.K. Pérez-Tilve D. Vázquez M.J. Varela L. Sangiao-Alvarellos S. Tovar S. Raghay K. Rodríguez-Cuenca S. Deoliveira R.M. Castañeda T. Datta R. Dong J.Z. Culler M. Sleeman M.W.

More recently it has been demonstrated that ghrelin is also involved in reward-seeking behavior such as alcohol and cocaine abuse or intake of palatable food through interaction with the dopaminergic system in the ventral tegmental area and the substantia niagra (8Egecioglu E.

The development of drugs that modulate the signaling of the ghrelin receptor system has been pursued by the pharmaceutical industry for the last three decades. Agonist compounds were developed as so-called growth hormone secretagogues even before it was realized that they worked through the ghrelin receptor and its cloning. Such compounds, for example MK-677, were used in clinical trials both for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency and for the treatment of the frail elderly. However, these compounds never reached the market, mainly because of a lack of efficacy (11Murphy M.G. Weiss S. McClung M. Schnitzer T. Cerchio K. Connor J. Krupa D. Gertz B.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Today non-peptide ghrelin receptor agonists and ghrelin analogues are being developed in attempts to treat, for example, various forms of cachexia and malnourishment in hospitalized patients (13Lundholm K.

Antagonists or inverse agonists of the ghrelin receptor have been proposed as a potential treatment for obesity, diabetes, and also more recently alcohol abuse; but these are still in early development (14Holst B.

In the case of the ghrelin receptor, a biased agonist could potentially act as a functionally specific agonist, i.e. able to modulate energy expenditure and food intake without affecting growth hormone secretion or vice versa. The structural understanding of biased signaling has been addressed only to a limited degree, and information is primarily based on mutations that selectively decouple one signaling pathway and not the other (18Holst B.

Through structure-function analysis of the first inverse agonist for the ghrelin receptor, [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11] substance P (20Holst B. Cygankiewicz A. Jensen T.H. Ankersen M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2201-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), we have previously identified the carboxyamidated, C-terminal pentapeptide (d-Trp-Phe-d-Trp-Leu-Leu) as the essential core peptide, which by itself displays a characteristic biphasic dose-response curve, i.e. combined agonism and inverse agonism (Fig. 1) (21Holst B. Lang M. Brandt E. Bach A. Howard A. Frimurer T.M. Beck-Sickinger A. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). By the addition of a single amino acid at its N terminus this pentapeptide could, depending on the type of N-terminal residue, be converted into either a pure agonist or a pure inverse agonist (21Holst B. Lang M. Brandt E. Bach A. Howard A. Frimurer T.M. Beck-Sickinger A. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Holst B. Mokrosinski J. Lang M.

Importantly, the characteristic essential d-Trp-Phe-d-Trp (wFw) motif strongly restricts the conformational freedom of this type of peptide ligand because essentially the wFw motif is found in only two different dominating conformations (22Holst B. Mokrosinski J. Lang M. Brandt E. Nygaard R. Frimurer T.M. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15799-15811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The structure-activity relationship analysis indicated that the more flexible C-terminal Leu-Leu dipeptide functions mainly as a spacer or linker between the wFw core and the functionally highly important C-terminal carboxyamide moiety. Thus, one aim of the present study was to try to exchange the Leu-Leu part of wFw ligands with a non-peptide linker structure (Fig. 1). In this way novel, potent, ghrelin receptor ligands could in fact be generated. However, in contrast to all previously characterized peptide and non-peptide ligands, these novel wFw peptide-mimetic ligands were found to be biased agonists in respect to their ability to activate signaling through the classical Gαq pathway but not through the Gα12/13 SRE signaling pathway. Importantly, mutational mapping of important receptor residues for the function of the most efficacious biased agonists, wFw-Isn-amide, demonstrated a novel receptor interaction mode. This lacked a crucial, charged anchor point in TM III, GluIII:09, which is shared by all of the unbiased ghrelin receptor agonists. Ghrelin was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Swicherland). The non-peptide compound MK-677 (L-163,191) was kindly provided by Andrew Howard (Merck Research Laboratories). γ-Amino butyric acid (Abu), 3-aminobenzoic acid (3Abz), 4-aminobenzoic acid (4Abz), (1R,4S)-(+)-4-amino-2-cyclopentene-1-carboxylic acid (Acp), 4-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine-1-ylacetic acid (Aep), β-alanine (βAla), 3-aminomethylbenzoic acid (3Amb), 4-aminomethylbenzoic acid (4Amb), isonipecotic acid (Isn), and aminohexanoic acid (Ahx) were purchased from Fluka or Sigma-Aldrich. The peptides were synthesized by solid-phase technique on an automated multiple peptide synthesizer (Syro; MultiSynTech, Bochum, Germany) by using Rink amide resin (30 mg, resin loading 0.6 mmol/g) as described recently (23Lang M.

The non-natural amino acids Abu, 3Abz, 4Abz, Acp, Aep, βAla, 3Amb, 4Amb, Isn, and Ahx were coupled manually directly at the Rink amide resin (30 mg, resin loading 0.6 mmol/g) after removal of the Fmoc group with 30% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide twice for 20 min. The coupling reaction was performed twice with four equivalents of the Fmoc-protected un-natural amino acids, which were activated by 4 equivalents of 2-(1H-7-Azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate methanaminium and 8 equivalents of N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamin for 1 h. Completeness of the reaction was analyzed by a ninhydrin assay (24Kaiser E. Colescott R.L. Bossinger C.D. Cook P.I. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (3510) Google Scholar).

The peptide mimetics were cleaved from the resin in one step using trifluoroacetic acid, precipitated from ice-cold diethyl ether, washed, and finally lyophilized. Purification of the peptides was achieved by preparative HPLC on an RP C18 column (Vydac, 250 × 25 mm, 10 μm) with a gradient of 20–60% B in A (A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; B = 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) over a 60-min time span at a flow rate of 10 ml/min (λ = 220 nm). The peptides were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry on an Voyager-DE RP work station (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) and by analytical reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac RP-18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) using linear gradients of 10–60% B in A over 30 min and a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min (λ = 220 nm). The observed masses were in full agreement with the calculated masses, and the purity of all peptides was >95% accordingly to analytical HPLC. The human ghrelin/receptor cDNA was cloned by PCR from a human brain cDNA library. The cDNA was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV-Tag2B made by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) for epitope tagging of proteins. Mutations were constructed by PCR using the overlap expression method (25Holst B. Zoffmann S. Elling C.E. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction endonucleases (BamHI and EcoRI), purified, and cloned into the pCMV-Tag2B vector. All PCR experiments were performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. All mutations were verified by restriction endonuclease mapping and subsequent DNA sequence analysis using an automated sequencer (ABI PRISM 310; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 1885 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 180 units/ml penicillin, and 45 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method with chloroquine added. The amount of cDNA (20 μg/75 cm2) resulting in maximal basal signaling was used for the dose-response curves. HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium adjusted to contain 4500 mg/liter glucose (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, 180 units/ml penicillin, and 45 μg/ml streptomycin at 10% CO2 and 37 °C. Stably transfected HEK-293 cells were grown in the same medium. One day after transfection, COS-7 cells were incubated for 24 h with 5 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.3 ml of medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 180 units/ml penicillin, and 45 μg/ml streptomycin/well. Cells were washed twice in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum) and incubated in 0.5 ml of buffer supplemented with 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C for 30 min. After stimulation with various concentrations of peptide and/or non-peptides for 45 min at 37 °C, cells were extracted with 10 mm formic acid followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was purified on anion exchange resin (AG 1-X8; Bio-Rad) to isolate the negatively charged inositol phosphates. After application of the cell extract to the column, the content was washed twice with washing buffer (60 mm sodium formate and 5 mm sodium tetraborate decahydrate) to remove glycerophosphoinositol. Inositol phosphates were eluded by the addition of elution buffer (1 m ammonium formate and 100 mm formic acid), and eluates were added to 10 ml of Wallac Optiphase HiSafe 3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Determinations were made in duplicates. The columns containing AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin were regenerated by the addition of 3 ml of regeneration buffer (3 m ammonium formate and 100 mm formic acid) and 10 ml of water. Cells were transfected and seeded out in parallel with those used for inositol phosphate accumulation assay. The cells were washed twice, fixed, and incubated in blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline and 3% dry milk) for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were kept at room temperature for all subsequent steps. Cells were incubated for 2 h with anti-FLAG (M2) antibody (Sigma) at a 1:300 dilution. After three washes, cells were incubated for 2 h with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences)-conjugated antibody at a dilution of 1:4000. After extensive washing, the immunoreactivity was revealed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions. EC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression using Prism version 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The basal constitutive activity is expressed as a percentage of the ghrelin-induced activation for each mutant construct of the ghrelin receptor.

Open table in a new tab HEK-293 cells (30,000 cells/well) seeded in 96-well plates were transiently transfected with a mixture of SRE-Luc (PathDetect SRE Cis reporting system; Stratagene) and the indicated amounts of receptor DNA. After transfection, cells were maintained in low serum (2.5%) throughout the experiments and treated with the respective inhibitor of the intracellular signaling pathways. One day after transfection, cells were treated with the respective ligands in an assay volume of 100 μl of medium for 5 h. The assay was terminated by washing the cells twice with PBS and adding 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (LucLite; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Luminescence was measured in a TopCount NXT (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) microplate scintillation and luminescence counter for 5 s. Luminescence values are given as relative light units. COS-7 cells (seeding density, 150,000 cells/well) were transfected in the assay plates. Two days after transfection, the indicated concentrations of ligand were added to the assay medium without any serum and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by removal of the medium and two washing steps with ice-cold PBS. The cells were lysed in sample buffer and separated on SDS-10% PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose, and Western blot analysis was carried out using a 1:5000 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total ERK protein was determined using a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were probed using anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences), and quantified by densitometric analysis. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was normalized according to the loading of protein by expressing the data as a ratio of phospho-ERK1/2 over total ERK1/2. Results were expressed as a percentage of the value obtained in nonstimulated, mock-transfected cells. Transfected COS-7 cells were transferred to culture plates 1 day after transfection at a density of ∼5000 cells/well, aiming at 5–8% binding of the radioactive ligand. Two days after transfection competition binding experiments were performed for 3 h at 4 °C using ∼25 pm 35S-labeled MK-677 (provided by Andrew Howard, Merck). Binding assays were performed in 0.1 ml of a 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 40 μg/ml bacitracin. Nonspecific binding was determined as the binding in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled ghrelin. Cells were washed twice in 0.1 ml of ice-cold buffer; 50 μl of lysis buffer/scintillation fluid (30% ethoxylated alkylphenol and 70% diisopropylnaphthalene isomers) was added, and the bound radioactivity was counted. Determinations were made in triplicate. Initial experiments showed that steady state binding was reached with the radioactive ligand under these conditions. Stably transfected HEK-293TR cells (Invitrogen) overexpressed the ghrelin receptor cDNA modified with an N-terminal SNAP tag (New England Biolabs) and under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Cells were seeded into poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well imaging plates (Greiner 655090; Greiner Bio-One, Gloucester, UK), and receptor expression was initiated by tetracycline treatment (100 ng/ml) for 18–21 h. Cell surface ghrelin receptors were first labeled with membrane-impermeant SNAP-Surface AF488 (0.1 μm in DMEM, New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, and treated with ligands at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% BSA and 5 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated transferrin (Invitrogen). Incubations were terminated by fixation (3% paraformaldehyde), and cell nuclei were also labeled (H33342, 1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). Images at four sites/well were then acquired using the IX Ultra confocal plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA; 40× ELWD objective) with the appropriate excitation and emission filters for nuclei labeling (405 nm excitation), SNAP-Surface AF488-labeled ghrelin receptors (488 nm), and transferrin (633 nm). Automated translocation analysis of plate reader images (MetaXpress 2.0, Molecular Devices) quantified the fluorescence intensity of labeled ghrelin receptors within 3-μm-diameter internal compartments identified by transferrin labeling, which the predominant destination of internalized ghrelin receptors. Individual concentration response curves performed in triplicate were normalized to vehicle (0%) and 1 μm ghrelin (100%) controls. Pooled data were used to obtain EC50 values with GraphPad Prism (sigmoidal fit, nH 0.9–1.0). GTP-Rho and activated Rho of RC-4B/C cell lysates were assessed by a pulldown assay according to the manufacturer's description (catalog No. BK036, Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO). In short, cells were grown to 60–80% confluency and incubated in serum-free media. The cells were subjected to 10 min of stimulation by ghrelin, Isn-wFw-NH2, or solute. The cells were washed in PBS and lysed. After protein quantification, 500–800 μg of total protein in the lysates was precipitated by rhotekin beads. Precipitates were loaded onto a NuPAGE 10% bis-tris gel (Invitrogen), transferred to a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen) in a transfer buffer (40 mm glycine, 50 mm Trizma base, 1.3 mm SDS, and 20% ethanol (v/v)), blocked with TBST (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Trizma base, and 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% BSA, and immunoblotted using anti-RhoA monoclonal antibody (Cytoskeleton, Inc., primary) and secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, Thermo Scientific), both in TBST. The membranes were washed, and SuperSignal (Thermo Scientific) was added for visualization. The PVDF membranes were analyzed on a FluorChem HD2 (Alpha Innotech). 12 Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic, Ejby, Denmark) were stereotaxically implanted with a stainless steel cannula (Holm Finmekanik AS, Copenhagen, Denmark) aimed at the right lateral ventricle (1 mm caudal, 1.5 mm lateral to the bregma, and 4 mm ventral to the cranium externa). The cannula and supporting bolts were secured with dental cement (Poly-F Plus, Dentsply). The animals were anesthetized with Hypnorm/Dormicum, 0.2 ml/kg body weight (fentanyl citrate, 0.07875 mg/ml; fluanisone, 2.5 mg/ml; and midazolam, 1.25 mg/ml). Pre- and post-surgery rats received analgesic treatment (Rimadyl (Pfizer), 5 mg/kg). Rats were handled daily during the recovery week and were housed in feeding cages for adaptation. After recovery, cannula placement was confirmed by measuring the drinking response to administration of angiotensin II (100 nmol/rat in 4 μl of saline; data not shown). Rats that showed a positive drinking response were used in the study. Injection with ghrelin, Isn-wFw-NH2, or ve"

We report prevalence of abnormal renal function at baseline and factors associated with abnormal renal function from a community cohort in Lesotho. Methods We calculated changes in CrCl from baseline for patients initiated on TDF at 6 and 12 months and the proportion of patients initiated on TDF who developed renal impairment. Screening algorithms were developed using risk factors determined by multivariate analysis. Results Among 933 adults for whom baseline creatinine was available, 176 (18.9%) presented with a baseline CrCl <50 ml/min. Renal function improved during follow-up. 19 patients who developed renal toxicity during follow up remained on TDF; renal function improved (CrCl≥50 ml/min) in all but 3 of these patients. Among 15 patients with a baseline CrCl <50 ml/min were started in error, none developed severe renal impairment. Conclusion In this setting TDF-associated renal toxicity is rare and mainly transient. Further studies to assess TDF safety at lower CrCl thresholds are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W1973930872,"Background Linear regression of efficiency (LRE) introduced a new paradigm for real-time qPCR that enables large-scale absolute quantification by eliminating the need for standard curves. Developed through the application of sigmoidal mathematics to SYBR Green I-based assays, target quantity is derived directly from fluorescence readings within the central region of an amplification profile. However, a major challenge of implementing LRE quantification is the labor intensive nature of the analysis. Findings Utilizing the extensive resources that are available for developing Java-based software, the LRE Analyzer was written using the NetBeans IDE, and is built on top of the modular architecture and windowing system provided by the NetBeans Platform. This fully featured desktop application determines the number of target molecules within a sample with little or no intervention by the user, in addition to providing extensive database capabilities. MS Excel is used to import data, allowing LRE quantification to be conducted with any real-time PCR instrument that provides access to the raw fluorescence readings. An extensive help set also provides an in-depth introduction to LRE, in addition to guidelines on how to implement LRE quantification. Conclusions The LRE Analyzer provides the automated analysis and data storage capabilities required by large-scale qPCR projects wanting to exploit the many advantages of absolute quantification. Foremost is the universal perspective afforded by absolute quantification, which among other attributes, provides the ability to directly compare quantitative data produced by different assays and/or instruments. Furthermore, absolute quantification has important implications for gene expression profiling in that it provides the foundation for comparing transcript quantities produced by any gene with any other gene, within and between samples."
https://openalex.org/W2020382690,"Lipid rafts reportedly have a role in coalescing key signaling molecules into the immunological synapse during T cell activation, thereby modulating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling activity. Recent findings suggest that a correlation may exist between increased levels of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) in the lipid rafts of T cells and a heightened response of those T cells toward activation. Here, we show that lowering the levels of GSLs in CD4+ T cells using a potent inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (Genz-122346) led to a moderation of the T cell response toward activation. TCR proximal signaling events, such as phosphorylation of Lck, Zap70 and LAT, as well as early Ca2+ mobilization, were attenuated by treatment with Genz-122346. Concomitant with these events were significant reductions in IL-2 production and T cell proliferation. Similar findings were obtained with CD4+ T cells isolated from transgenic mice genetically deficient in GM3 synthase activity. Interestingly, lowering the GSL levels in CD4+ T cells by either pharmacological inhibition or disruption of the gene for GM3 synthase also specifically inhibited the differentiation of T cells to the Th17 lineage but not to other Th subsets in vitro. Taken together with the recently reported effects of Raftlin deficiency on Th17 differentiation, these results strongly suggest that altering the GSL composition of lipid rafts modulates TCR signaling activity and affects Th17 differentiation.

Salicylate and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit VSMC proliferation by an unknown mechanism unrelated to anti-inflammatory activity. In search for this mechanism, we have studied the effects of salicylate and other NSAIDs on subcellular Ca2+ homeostasis and Ca2+-dependent cell proliferation in rat aortic A10 cells, a model of neointimal VSMCs. We found that A10 cells displayed both store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and voltage-operated Ca2+ entry (VOCE), the former being more important quantitatively than the latter. Inhibition of SOCE by specific Ca2+ released-activated Ca2+ (CRAC/Orai) channels antagonists prevented A10 cell proliferation. Salicylate and other NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, indomethacin, and sulindac, inhibited SOCE and thereby Ca2+-dependent, A10 cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2031211927,"The C2-WW-HECT-type ubiquitin ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2 play a critical role in embryogenesis and adult bone homeostasis via regulation of bone morphogenetic protein, Wnt, and RhoA signaling pathways. The intramolecular interaction between C2 and HECT domains autoinhibits the ligase activity of Smurf2. However, the role of the Smurf1 C2 domain remains elusive. Here, we show that the C2-HECT autoinhibition mechanism is not observed in Smurf1, and instead its C2 domain functions in substrate selection. The Smurf1 C2 domain exerts a key role in localization to the plasma membrane and endows Smurf1 with differential activity toward RhoA versus Smad5 and Runx2. Crystal structure analysis reveals that the Smurf1 C2 domain possesses a typical anti-parallel β-sandwich fold. Examination of the sulfate-binding site analysis reveals two key lysine residues, Lys-28 and Lys-85, within the C2 domain that are important for Smurf1 localization at the plasma membrane, regulation on cell migration, and robust ligase activity toward RhoA, which further supports a Ca(2+)-independent localization mechanism for Smurf1. These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified role of the Smurf1 C2 domain in substrate selection and cellular localization."
https://openalex.org/W2022087502,"Until recently, effector T helper (Th) cells have been classified into two subsets, Th1 and Th2 cells. Since the discovery of Th17 cells, which produce IL-17, much attention has been given to Th17 cells, mainly because they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. We have performed transcriptome analysis combined with factor analysis and revealed that the expression level of c-Maf, which is considered to be important for Th2 differentiation, increases significantly during the course of Th17 differentiation. The IL-23 receptor (IL-23R), which is important for Th17 cells, is among putative transcriptional targets of c-Maf. Interestingly, the analysis of c-Maf transgenic Th cells revealed that the overexpression of c-Maf did not lead to the acceleration of the early stage of Th17 differentiation but rather to the expansion of memory phenotype cells, particularly with Th1 and Th17 traits. Consistently, mouse wild-type memory Th cells expressed higher mRNA levels of c-Maf, IL-23R, IL-17, and IFN-γ than control cells; in contrast, Maf(-/-) memory Th cells expressed lower mRNA levels of those molecules. Thus, we propose that c-Maf is important for the development of memory Th cells, particularly memory Th17 cells and Th1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2094720399,"Selenoproteins are expressed in many organisms, including bacteria, insects, fish, and mammals. Yet, it has remained obscure why some organisms rely on selenoproteins while others, like yeast and plants, express Cys-containing homologues. This study addressed the possible advantage of selenocysteine (Sec) vs. Cys in the essential selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), using 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen-inducible Cre-excision of loxP-flanked GPx4 alleles in murine cells. Previously, it was shown that GPx4 disruption caused rapid cell death, which was prevented by α-to-copherol. Results presented herein demonstrate that the expression of wild-type (WT) GPx4 and its Sec/Cys (U46C) mutant rescued cell death of GPx4 cells, whereas the Sec/Ser (U46S) mutant failed. Notably, the specific activity of U46C was decreased by ~90% and was indistinguishable from U46S-expressing and mocktransfected cells. Hence, the U46C mutant prevented apoptosis despite hardly measurable in vitro activity. Doxycycline-inducible expression revealed that minute amounts of either U46C or WT GPx4 prevented cell death, albeit WT GPx4 was more efficient. Interestingly, at the same expression level, proliferation was promoted in U46C-expressing cells but attenuated in WT-expressing cells. In summary, both catalytic efficiency and the expression level of GPx4 control the balance between cell survival and proliferation.—Mannes, A. M., Seiler, A., Bosello, V., Maiorino, M., Conrad, M.

https://openalex.org/W2078974072,"Cancer cells secreting excess latent TGF-β are often resistant to TGF-β induced growth inhibition. We observed that RNAi against TGF-β1 led to apoptotic death in such cell lines with features that were, paradoxically, reminiscent of TGF-β signaling activity and that included transiently enhanced SMAD2 and AKT phosphorylation. A comprehensive search in Hela cells for potential microRNA drivers of this mechanism revealed that RNAi against TGF-β1 led to induction of pro-apoptotic miR-34a and to a globally decreased oncomir expression. The reduced levels of the oncomirs miR-18a and miR-24 accounted for the observed derepression of two TGF-β1 processing factors, thrombospondin-1, and furin, respectively. Our data suggest a novel mechanism in which latent TGF-β1, thrombospondin 1, and furin form a microRNA-mediated regulatory feedback loop. For cells with high levels of latent TGF-β, this provides a potentially widespread mechanism of escape from TGF-β-mediated growth arrest at the earliest point in the signaling pathway, TGF-β processing."
https://openalex.org/W2092518790,"Plant diurnal oscillation is a 24-hour period based variation. The correlation between diurnal genes and biological pathways was widely revealed by microarray analysis in different species. Rice (Oryza sativa) is the major food staple for about half of the world's population. The rice flag leaf is essential in providing photosynthates to the grain filling. However, there is still no comprehensive view about the diurnal transcriptome for rice leaves. In this study, we applied rice microarray to monitor the rhythmically expressed genes in rice seedling and flag leaves. We developed a new computational analysis approach and identified 6,266 (10.96%) diurnal probe sets in seedling leaves, 13,773 (24.08%) diurnal probe sets in flag leaves. About 65% of overall transcription factors were identified as flag leaf preferred. In seedling leaves, the peak of phase distribution was from 2:00am to 4:00am, whereas in flag leaves, the peak was from 8:00pm to 2:00am. The diurnal phase distribution analysis of gene ontology (GO) and cis-element enrichment indicated that, some important processes were waken by the light, such as photosynthesis and abiotic stimulus, while some genes related to the nuclear and ribosome involved processes were active mostly during the switch time of light to dark. The starch and sucrose metabolism pathway genes also showed diurnal phase. We conducted comparison analysis between Arabidopsis and rice leaf transcriptome throughout the diurnal cycle. In summary, our analysis approach is feasible for relatively unbiased identification of diurnal transcripts, efficiently detecting some special periodic patterns with non-sinusoidal periodic patterns. Compared to the rice flag leaves, the gene transcription levels of seedling leaves were relatively limited to the diurnal rhythm. Our comprehensive microarray analysis of seedling and flag leaves of rice provided an overview of the rice diurnal transcriptome and indicated some diurnal regulated biological processes and key functional pathways in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2115142224,"Insulin release by pancreatic β-cells is regulated by diverse intracellular signals, including changes in Ca(2+) concentration resulting from Ca(2+) entry through voltage-gated (Ca(V)) channels. It has been reported that the Rab3 effector RIM1 acts as a functional link between neuronal Ca(V) channels and the machinery for exocytosis. Here, we investigated whether RIM1 regulates recombinant and native L-type Ca(V) channels (that play a key role in hormone secretion) and whether this regulation affects insulin release. Whole-cell patch clamp currents were recorded from HEK-293 and insulinoma RIN-m5F cells. RIM1 and Ca(V) channel expression was identified by RT-PCR and Western blot. RIM1-Ca(V) channel interaction was determined by co-immunoprecipitation. Knockdown of RIM1 and Ca(V) channel subunit expression were performed using small interference RNAs. Insulin release was assessed by ELISA. Co-expression of Ca(V)1.2 and Ca(V)1.3 L-type channels with RIM1 in HEK-293 cells revealed that RIM1 may not determine the availability of L-type Ca(V) channels but decreases the rate of inactivation of the whole cell currents. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed association of the Ca(V)β auxiliary subunit with RIM1. The lack of Ca(V)β expression suppressed channel regulation by RIM1. Similar to the heterologous system, an increase of current inactivation was observed upon knockdown of endogenous RIM1. Co-immunoprecipitation showed association of Ca(V)β and RIM1 in insulin-secreting RIN-m5F cells. Knockdown of RIM1 notably impaired high K(+)-stimulated insulin secretion in the RIN-m5F cells. These data unveil a novel functional coupling between RIM1 and the L-type Ca(V) channels via the Ca(V)β auxiliary subunit that contribute to determine insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1966023465,"Protocadherins are a group of transmembrane proteins with homophilic binding activity, members of the cadherin superfamily. Apart from their role in adhesion, the cellular functions of protocadherins are essentially unknown. Protocadherin (PCDH)12 was previously identified in invasive trophoblasts and endothelial and mesangial cells in the mouse. Invalidation studies revealed that the protein was required for optimal placental development. In this article, we show that its human homolog is abundantly expressed in various trophoblast subtypes of the human placenta and at lower levels in endothelial cells. We demonstrate that PCDH12 is shed at high rates in vitro. The shedding mechanism depends on ADAM10 and results in reduced cellular adhesion in a cell migration assay. PCDH12 is subsequently cleaved by the γ-secretase complex, and its cytoplasmic domain is rapidly degraded by the proteasome. PCDH12 shedding is regulated by interlinked intracellular pathways, including those involving protein kinase C, PI3K, and cAMP, that either increase or inhibit cleavage. In endothelial cells, VEGF, prostaglandin E2, or histamine regulates PCDH12 shedding. The extracellular domain of PCDH12 was also detected in human serum and urine, thus providing evidence of PCDH12 shedding in vivo. Importantly, we observed an increase in circulating PCDH12 in pregnant women who later developed a pre-eclampsia, a frequent pregnancy syndrome and a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In conclusion, we speculate that, like in mice, PCDH12 may play an important role in human placental development and that proteolytic cleavage in response to external factors, such as cytokines and pathological settings, regulates its activity.

The cadherin superfamily is composed of membrane proteins with Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion properties and homologous sequence repeats located in their extracellular domains (1Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 207-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 2Junghans D. Haas I.G. Kemler R. Curr. Opin.

These repeats are responsible for the homophilic adhesive behavior of members of the cadherin family. Four groups of cadherins have been identified so far: the “classical” type I and type II cadherins; the desmosomal cadherins; and the most recently discovered protocadherin family. Protocadherins were initially discovered by PCR cloning using cadherin homology sequences (4Sano K. Tanihara H. Heimark R.L. Obata S. Davidson M. St John T. Taketani S. Suzuki S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). With genome sequencing, more than 70 different protocadherin genes have been identified altogether. This makes protocadherins the largest subgroup within the cadherin superfamily (5Wu Q. Maniatis T. Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Most protocadherin genes are clustered in three loci: protocadherin (Pcdh) 3The abbreviations used are: PCDH or PcdhprotocadherinCTFC-terminal fragmentFskforskolinHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellPEpre-eclampsiaPGE2prostaglandin E2PMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateCterC-terminalECendothelial cell(s). α, β, and γ.

The functions of classical cadherins in cell-cell adhesion, their links to the cytoskeleton, and their participation in intracellular signaling have all been extensively studied (1Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 207-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In contrast, the function(s) of protocadherins remain elusive. Although all of the protocadherins studied so far were found to display homophilic adhesion properties, their cytoplasmic domains do not interact with the cytoskeleton or do so very weakly (2Junghans D. Haas I.G. Kemler R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 3Morishita H. Yagi T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). What is known of their functions derives mainly from in vivo studies. Protocadherins have been shown to be involved in cellular migration and cell sorting (6Kuroda H. Inui M. Sugimoto K. Hayata T. Asashima M. Dev.

This is the case for PCDH15, mutations of which cause Usher syndrome type 1F (16Ahmed Z.M. Riazuddin S. Ahmad J. Bernstein S.L. Guo Y. Sabar M.F. Sieving P. Riazuddin S. Griffith A.J. Friedman T.B.

However, the cellular and molecular functions of protocadherins are essentially unknown and are suspected to be highly variable between protocadherins. In this paper, we focus on PCDH12 (also called VE-cadherin 2). This protein was originally described in mouse endothelioma cell lines where it concentrates at cell-cell junctions (20Telo' P. Breviario F. Huber P. Panzeri C. Dejana E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17565-17572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Its extracellular domain contains five cadherin domain repeats that promote homophilic adhesion. Its cytoplasmic domain is not homologous to classical cadherins or other protocadherin family members and does not interact with the cytoskeleton. Unlike classical cadherins, Pcdh12 ectopic expression was unable to inhibit cell migration from a confluent monolayer of transfected cells (20Telo' P. Breviario F. Huber P. Panzeri C. Dejana E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17565-17572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the mouse, Pcdh12 is highly expressed in several cell types: (i) in a specific type of trophoblast called the “glycogen cells” that emerge in the placenta and invade the maternal decidua; (ii) in the mesangial cells of kidney glomeruli; and (iii) in angiogenic endothelial cells, whereas its expression is reduced in resting endothelium (21Rampon C. Prandini M.H. Bouillot S. Pointu H. Tillet E. Frank R. Vernet M. Huber P. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 302: 48-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Bouillot S. Rampon C. Tillet E. Huber P. Placenta. 2006; 27: 882-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pcdh12-deficient mice were alive and fertile but showed alterations in placental development that resulted in embryonic growth retardation (23Rampon C. Bouillot S. Climescu-Haulica A. Prandini M.H. Cand F. Vandenbrouck Y. Huber P. Physiol. Genomics. 2008; 34: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the absence of Pcdh12, placentas were smaller and showed limited angiogenesis and mis-segregation of the labyrinthine and intermediate layers, likely attributable to cell migration defects. In the present study, we characterized human PCDH12. We observed its expression in several tissues and organs, including villous and extravillous trophoblasts. In transfected CHO cells, we observed a high degradation rate caused by a cascade of proteolytic events. This proteolysis was initiated by the cleavage of PCDH12 by ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) metalloprotease, resulting in shedding of its extracellular domain. Shedding was followed by secondary cleavage by the γ-secretase complex and the subsequent proteasomal degradation of its cytoplasmic domain. We were able to show that PCDH12 shedding in endothelial cells was regulated by VEGF, histamine, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) probably through PKC and cAMP pathways. PCDH12 degradation has functional implications because it modulates the cell migration rate in a monolayer wound assay. In addition, we provide evidence that these phenomena are also in play in vivo, as evidenced by the detection of circulating PCDH12 in both serum and urine. We found that seric levels of PCDH12 were up-regulated in pre-eclampsia (PE), which is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity that complicates 2–8% of pregnancies (24Cetin I. Huppertz B. Burton G. Cuckle H. Gonen R. Lapaire O. Mandia L. Nicolaides K. Redman C. Soothill P. Spencer K. Thilaganathan B. Williams D. Meiri H.

Lancet. 2005; 365: 785-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). Altogether, our results indicate that PCDH12 cell surface expression is highly dependent on protease-dependent shedding, a process regulated by cytokines and probably modified in pathological pregnancies. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), the γ-secretase inhibitor L685,458, 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, LY294002, genistein, forskolin (Fsk), PGE2, and histamine were from Sigma-Aldrich. VEGF was from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 was from BioMol (Villeurbanne, France). The ADAM inhibitors GI254023X and GW280264X were generous gifts from Prof. Andreas Ludwig (Aachen, Germany). CHO cells were grown in α-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FCS (Lonza, Levallois-Perret, France). HEK-293 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% FCS. HUVECs were purchased from Lonza, grown in complete EBM-2 medium (Lonza), and used at passages 3–5. All of the pharmacological molecules were solubilized in Me2SO, which was added at similar concentrations in control experiments. Molecules were applied on confluent cells in serum-free medium. The human PCDH12 cDNA, obtained from ImaGenes (Berlin, Germany), was cut by SpeI and NheI and inserted into pCDNA3.1 Hygro (Invitrogen) linearized by XbaI. The resulting construct was transfected into CHO cells. Stable transfectants were selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin, and individual clones were picked. For production of anti-PCDH12 EC antibody, the entire extracellular domain of human PCDH12 (amino acids 1–718) was produced in 293-EBNA cells according to described procedures (26Tillet E. Ruggiero F. Nishiyama A. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10769-10776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and injected into rabbits. Briefly, PCDH12 cDNA was amplified by PCR, which allowed the addition of a sequence coding for six C-terminal histidine residues and cloned into the episomal PCEP4 expression vector. After transfection, the cells were selected with hygromycin, and conditioned serum-free medium was collected for PCDH12 EC purification using DEAE ion exchange followed by nickel affinity chromatography. After immunization, PCDH12 antibodies were purified from antisera using antigen affinity chromatography. For production of PCDH12 Cter antibody, a peptide (KSRGSSSSSRCL), corresponding to PCDH12 C terminus sequence, was coupled to ovalbumin and injected into rabbits. PCDH12 Cter antibodies were purified using peptide affinity chromatography. β-Catenin antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. N-cadherin antibodies for immunoprecipitation (clone 32) and for Western blot (3B9) were from BD Biosciences (Pont de Claix, France) and from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), respectively. Tubulin antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich. ADAM10 antibodies were from Merck-Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). C3 polyclonal antibodies were a generous gift from MB Villiers. Cell or tissue extracts were obtained using a lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Protein concentration was measured using the MicroBCA kit from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). Cell supernatants were collected after culture of confluent cells in serum-free medium. HUVEC supernatants were concentrated on Amicon Ultra 4 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using standard procedures. Briefly, proteins were extracted from placenta (1 mg) or CHO-PCDH12 (300 μg) with 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate. The extracts were incubated with 4 μg of PCDH12 Cter or N-cadherin antibodies, and the complex was coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). The proteins were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Dot blots were performed with a PR600 from Hoefer Scientific Instruments (San Francisco, CA). The membranes were incubated in presence of primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Suffolk, UK). Antibody interactions were revealed using the luminol substrate ECL-Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Signals were revealed by autoradiography, films were scanned, and signal intensity was measured using Bio-Profil software from Vilber Lourmat (Marne-la-Vallée, France). Alternatively, signals were captured with a Fusion-FX7 camera from Vilber-Lourmat. 12-week-old placentas from nonpathological abortions were obtained from Grenoble University Hospital after full consent of the patients and approval of the university hospital ethics committee. The placentas were embedded in OCT compound and snap frozen. 10-μm cryosections were prepared using a cryomicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The cells were grown on coverslips. Tissue sections or cells were fixed with formaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100 0.5%, saturated with 2% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with primary antibodies and Cy3- or alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories and Molecular Probes (Cergy Pontoise, France), respectively. The samples were further incubated for 3 min in Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) for nuclear staining. Fluorescent slides were mounted in Fluorsave reagent (Calbiochem). Immunofluorescence labeling was observed with an Axioplan 2 Zeiss microscope or a confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems TCS SP2). For RNA interference of ADAM10 expression, the following siRNAs from Dharmacon were used: 5′-GAAGGAAGCUUUAGUCAUG-3′, 5′-CCAAAGUCUCUCAUAUUA-3′, 5′-GCAGAGAGAUACAUUAAAG-3′, and 5′-GAAUUGCCCUGAUCAUGUU-3′ as an equimolar mixture of all. For negative control, an siRNA was used that does not target any known mammalian gene (5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA-3′). CHO-PCDH12 were transfected with 1.6 μg of siRNA using nucleofection (Amaxa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells and conditioned media were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Lipid raft isolation was performed using established procedures. Briefly, CHO-PCDH12 cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100. After a brief centrifugation, the lysates were adjusted to 40% sucrose, placed at the bottom of a 5–30% sucrose gradient, and centrifuged for 17 h at 40,000 rpm. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PCDH12 Cter and anti-flotillin antibodies. Assay was performed as described previously (27Wallez Y. Cand F. Cruzalegui F. Wernstedt C. Souchelnytskyi S. Vilgrain I. Huber P. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Confluent cells were scratched, and either Me2SO or GM6001 was added to complete medium. Phase contrast images were obtained under a Cell-R inverted microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) with controlled temperature and CO2, and using 10× objective. Measurement of cell invasion in the wounded area was performed with ImageJ software. Statistic differences were established through Student's t test. Human sera of healthy donors were obtained from the Grenoble blood center (Etablissement Français du Sang). Sera were depleted in albumin using the Vivapure anti-human serum albumin, affinity resin from Sartorius (Aubagne, France). Urine from a healthy donor was concentrated 40 times, using Amicon ultrafiltration devices; retentate was subjected to two cycles of dilution with water and reconcentration to remove salts. Sera from pregnant women were collected at Grenoble University Hospital and kept frozen until use. The study protocol was approved by the university hospital ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Serum samples were obtained once the legal conservatory period of the sanitary bank of maternal serum markers was ended (see Table 1 for clinical records). PE was defined as systolic pressure of ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg, occurring beyond the 20th week of amenorrhea associated with a proteinuria (>0.3 g/24 h) also arising beyond the 20th week of amenorrhea.TABLE 1Clinical characteristics of normal and pathological pregnanciesMaternal characteristicsNormal gestations (n = 27)Pre-eclamptic pregnancies (n = 13)aSee “Experimental Procedures” for a description of criteria for PE symptoms.Maternal age (years)29.9 (19–41)30.9 (23–44)Gestation age at sampling (weeks+days)15+5 (12+5- to 18+1)15+5 (14+2 to 18+3)Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg)110 (90–130)157 (145–170)Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)80 (50–90)97 (90–110)Proteinuria (g/24 h)01.52 (0.42–3.97)a See “Experimental Procedures” for a description of criteria for PE symptoms. Open table in a new tab Human PCDH12 was characterized in various tissues at the mRNA (supplemental Fig. S1), as well as the protein levels (supplemental Fig. S2), using antibodies directed either against its extracellular domain “PCDH12 EC” or against the 12-amino acid C-terminal peptide “PCDH12 Cter.” Both antibodies revealed a single band at 145 kDa in PCDH12-transfected cells; no reactivity was observed in control cells, as expected (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). PCDH12 was detectable in HUVECs (endothelial cells) by both Western blot and RT-PCR (supplemental Fig. S2, C and D) but not by immunofluorescence (not shown). These results indicate that PCDH12 is only weakly expressed by this cell type. PCDH12 expression was not detectable by RT-PCR or Western blotting in other cell types of epithelial origin, including MCF7, HeLa, and Caco2 cells (supplemental Fig. S2D and data not shown). PCDH12 was also detected in human term placenta (supplemental Fig. S2E). Cryosections of 12-week human placenta were strongly immunostained, in particular at the borders of syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells, which make up the outer layer of placental microvilli (Fig. 1, A and B). A more diffuse staining pattern was detected in extravillous trophoblasts, forming cell columns at the end of placental villi (Fig. 1, A and C). Some rare intravillous vessels were also labeled (Fig. 1B). As opposed to the mouse, human PCDH12 could not be detected by immunofluorescence in either glomeruli or endothelium of the kidney (not shown). Altogether, PCDH12 appeared to be weakly expressed by endothelial cells and strongly by syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts. In PCDH12-transfected CHO cells (CHO-PCDH12), PCDH12 was located at cell-cell junctions, in membrane ruffles, or in intercellular filopodia (supplemental Fig. S3A). This is consistent with the homophilic binding activity of cadherin superfamily members. PCDH12 stability was investigated by incubating CHO-PCDH12 with the translation blocking drug cycloheximide. Our data revealed a very short half-life in the range of 1.35–1.39 h (Fig. 2, A and B), thereby suggesting a very high degradation rate. Because PCDH12 instability at the cell membrane may be related to external proteolytic cleavage, we analyzed the release of its extracellular domain into cell supernatants. Fig. 2C shows that PCDH12 extracellular domain was indeed detected in CHO-PCDH12-conditioned medium. A similar fragment was also observed in HUVEC supernatants but only after concentration, indicating that it is present at very low levels (Fig. 2C). The apparent molar mass of the protein (90 kDa) revealed by PCDH12 EC antibody indicates that the protein is probably cleaved close to the membrane. Release of PCDH12 extracellular domain into the cell culture medium was significantly inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 (Fig. 2, D and E). In addition, incubation of CHO-PCDH12 with either GM6001 or the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin resulted in a striking enhancement of PCDH12 immune labeling in these cells (Fig. 2F). Thus, these data suggest that PCDH12 is cleaved by metalloproteases and that the proteasome plays a role in its degradation. The γ-secretase complex may also play a role in PCDH12 degradation. It is known to cleave target proteins within their transmembrane domain, liberating the cytoplasmic domain into the cytosol, where it is subsequently degraded by the proteasome (28De Strooper B. Annaert W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 235-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To determine the precise molecular mechanisms of PCDH12 cleavage, the cells were incubated with inhibitors of metalloproteases (GM6001), of γ-secretase (L685,458), and of the proteasome (lactacystin), either separately or in combination (Fig. 3A). Two clones of CHO-PCDH12 with different PCDH12 expression levels were used. Protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with PCDH12 Cter antibody to detect C-terminal fragments (CTFs). Lactacystin blocked the degradation of a 50-kDa fragment (CTF2), which probably corresponds to the entire PCDH12 cytoplasmic tail. When γ-secretase was inhibited, two larger fragments were detected at 60 (CTF1) and 80 (CTF0) kDa. The electrophoretic pattern for these fragments was identical with or without lactacystin treatment. It is therefore likely that these fragments escaped degradation by the proteasome because they were still embedded in the membrane. Thus, γ-secretase converts the 80-kDa (CTF0) and 60-kDa (CTF1) fragments to a 50-kDa (CTF2) fragment that can then be rapidly degraded in the proteasome. Inhibition of metalloproteases alone did not modify the electrophoretic profile of C terminus-containing fragments compared with untreated cells. However, when γ-secretase and metalloprotease inhibitors were added together, CTF0 intensities remained similar, but CTF1 levels were significantly reduced compared with when cells were treated by the γ-secretase inhibitor alone. Thus, metalloprotease cleavage mainly yields CTF1, whereas CTF0 is due to a different cleavage mechanism; nevertheless, both fragments are substrates for γ-secretase. Results on PCDH12 cleavage are summarized in Fig. 3B. Activation of PKC by phorbol esters has been shown to promote shedding of several transmembrane proteins. This shedding seems to be a characteristic of metalloproteases from the ADAM family (29Huovila A.P. Turner A.J. Pelto-Huikko M. Kärkkäinen I. Ortiz R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 30Edwards D.R. Handsley M.M. Pennington C.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 258-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). PMA treatment enhanced PCDH12 release into the cell supernatant (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, PMA rapidly and transiently reduced the cellular PCDH12 concentration in CHO-PCDH12 (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, activation of PKC increases PCDH12 proteolytic cleavage. Among metalloproteases, ADAM10 and ADAM17 are the principal sheddases (29Huovila A.P. Turner A.J. Pelto-Huikko M. Kärkkäinen I. Ortiz R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 30Edwards D.R. Handsley M.M. Pennington C.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 258-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). To test whether these proteases might be responsible for PCDH12 shedding, we used two selective pharmacological inhibitors: GW280264X, which has been shown to block both ADAM10 and ADAM17; and GI254023X, which specifically inhibits ADAM10 (31Hundhausen C. Misztela D. Berkhout T.A. Broadway N. Saftig P. Reiss K. Hartmann D. Fahrenholz F. Postina R. Matthews V. Kallen K.J. Rose-John S. Ludwig A. Blood. 2003; 102: 1186-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Both inhibitors dramatically inhibited PCDH12 release into the cell supernatant (Fig. 5, A and B), which suggests that PCDH12 metalloprotease cleavage is mainly mediated by ADAM10. To further demonstrate the participation of ADAM10 in PCDH12 cleavage, we transfected cells with siRNAs to knock down ADAM10 expression. PCDH12 stability in cell extracts and its release into cell supernatants were then analyzed. ADAM10 siRNAs dramatically decreased ADAM10 expression levels compared with control siRNAs (Fig. 5C). This correlated with an increase in PCDH12 levels in cell extracts (Fig. 5C) and a decrease of PCDH12 EC in cell supernatants (Fig. 5D). Therefore, ADAM10 knockdown strikingly improves PCDH12 stability. ADAM17 is sequestered in lipid rafts, and its substrates seem to be restricted to proteins present in these microdomains. In contrast, the majority of ADAM10 is excluded from lipid rafts (32Kojro E. Gimpl G. Lammich S. Marz W. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5815-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the membrane localization of PCDH12 by subcellular fractionation using sucrose density gradients.

We speculated that some genetic variants that influence exercise phenotypes could be associated with exceptional survival (i.e. reaching ≥100years of age). Owing to its effects on muscle structure/function, a potential candidate is the Arg(R)577Ter(X) polymorphism (rs1815739) in ACTN3, the structural gene encoding the skeletal muscle protein α-actinin-3. We compared the ACTN3 R577X genotype/allele frequencies between the following groups of ethnically-matched (Spanish) individuals: centenarians (cases, n = 64; 57 female; age range: 100–108 years), young healthy controls (n = 283, 67 females, 216 males; 21±2 years), and humans who are at the two end-points of exercise capacity phenotypes, i.e. muscle endurance (50 male professional road cyclists) and muscle power (63 male jumpers/sprinters). Although there were no differences in genotype/allele frequencies between centenarians (RR:28.8%; RX:47.5%; XX:23.7%), and controls (RR:31.8%; RX:49.8%; XX:18.4%) or endurance athletes (RR:28.0%; RX:46%; XX:26.0%), we observed a significantly higher frequency of the X allele (P = 0.019) and XX genotype (P = 0.011) in centenarians compared with power athletes (RR:47.6%; RX:36.5%;XX:15.9%). Notably, the frequency of the null XX (α-actinin-3 deficient) genotype in centenarians was the highest ever reported in non-athletic Caucasian populations. In conclusion, despite there were no significant differences with the younger, control population, overall the ACTN3 genotype of centenarians resembles that of world-class elite endurance athletes and differs from that of elite power athletes. Our preliminary data would suggest a certain ‘survival’ advantage brought about by α-actinin-3 deficiency and the ‘endurance’/oxidative muscle phenotype that is commonly associated with this condition."
https://openalex.org/W2093286098,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs that are negative regulators in a crescent number of physiological and pathological processes. However, their role in haemostasis, a complex physiological process involving multitude of effectors, is just beginning to be characterized. We evaluated the changes of expression of miRNAs in livers of neonates (day one after birth) and adult mice by microarray and qRT-PCR trying to identify miRNAs that potentially may also be involved in the control of the dramatic change of hepatic haemostatic protein levels associated with this transition. Twenty one out of 41 miRNAs overexpressed in neonate mice have hepatic haemostatic mRNA as potential targets. Six of them identified by two in silico algorithms potentially bind the 3′UTR regions of F7, F9, F12, FXIIIB, PLG and SERPINC1 mRNA. Interestingly, miR-18a and miR-19b, overexpressed 5.4 and 8.2-fold respectively in neonates, have antithrombin, a key anti-coagulant with strong anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory roles, as a potential target. The levels of these two miRNAs inversely correlated with antithrombin mRNA levels during development (miR-19b: R = 0.81; p = 0.03; miR-18a: R = 0.91; p<0.001). These data suggest that miRNAs could be potential modulators of the haemostatic system involved in developmental haemostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2057258986,"Neural systems underlying conflict processing have been well studied in the cognitive realm, but the extent to which these overlap with those underlying emotional conflict processing remains unclear. A novel adaptation of the AX Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT), a stimulus-response incompatibility paradigm, was examined that permits close comparison of emotional and cognitive conflict conditions, through the use of affectively-valenced facial expressions as the response modality.Brain activity was monitored with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of the emotional AX-CPT. Emotional conflict was manipulated on a trial-by-trial basis, by requiring contextually pre-cued facial expressions to emotional probe stimuli (IAPS images) that were either affectively compatible (low-conflict) or incompatible (high-conflict). The emotion condition was contrasted against a matched cognitive condition that was identical in all respects, except that probe stimuli were emotionally neutral. Components of the brain cognitive control network, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), showed conflict-related activation increases in both conditions, but with higher activity during emotion conditions. In contrast, emotion conflict effects were not found in regions associated with affective processing, such as rostral ACC.These activation patterns provide evidence for a domain-general neural system that is active for both emotional and cognitive conflict processing. In line with previous behavioural evidence, greatest activity in these brain regions occurred when both emotional and cognitive influences additively combined to produce increased interference."
https://openalex.org/W1973859314,"Extensive economic and environmental damage has been caused by invasive exotic plant species in many ecosystems worldwide. Many comparative studies have therefore attempted to predict, from biological traits, which species among the pool of naturalized non-natives become invasive. However, few studies have investigated which species establish and/or become pests from the larger pool of introduced species and controlled for time since introduction. Here we present results from a study aimed at quantifying predicting three classes of invasive species cultivated in Hawaii. Of 7,866 ornamental species cultivated in Hawaii between 1840 and 1999, 420 (5.3%) species naturalized, 141 (1.8%) have been classified as weeds, and 39 (0.5%) were listed by the state of Hawaii as noxious. Of the 815 species introduced >80 years ago, 253 (31%) have naturalized, 90 (11%) are classed as weeds, and 22 (3%) as noxious by the state of Hawaii. Using boosted regression trees we classified each group with nearly 90% accuracy, despite incompleteness of data and the low proportion of naturalized or pest species. Key biological predictors were seed mass and highest chromosome number standardized by genus which, when data on residence time was removed, were able to predict all three groups with 76–82% accuracy. We conclude that, when focused on a single region, screening for potential weeds or noxious plants based on a small set of biological traits can be achieved with sufficient accuracy for policy and management purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2009494530,"The development of computational models for simulating tumor growth and response to treatment has gained significant momentum during the last few decades. At the dawn of the era of personalized medicine, providing insight into complex mechanisms involved in cancer and contributing to patient-specific therapy optimization constitute particularly inspiring pursuits. The in silico oncology community is facing the great challenge of effectively translating simulation models into clinical practice, which presupposes a thorough sensitivity analysis, adaptation and validation process based on real clinical data. In this paper, the behavior of a clinically-oriented, multiscale model of solid tumor response to chemotherapy is investigated, using the paradigm of nephroblastoma response to preoperative chemotherapy in the context of the SIOP/GPOH clinical trial. A sorting of the model's parameters according to the magnitude of their effect on the output has unveiled the relative importance of the corresponding biological mechanisms; major impact on the result of therapy is credited to the oxygenation and nutrient availability status of the tumor and the balance between the symmetric and asymmetric modes of stem cell division. The effect of a number of parameter combinations on the extent of chemotherapy-induced tumor shrinkage and on the tumor's growth rate are discussed. A real clinical case of nephroblastoma has served as a proof of principle study case, demonstrating the basics of an ongoing clinical adaptation and validation process. By using clinical data in conjunction with plausible values of model parameters, an excellent fit of the model to the available medical data of the selected nephroblastoma case has been achieved, in terms of both volume reduction and histological constitution of the tumor. In this context, the exploitation of multiscale clinical data drastically narrows the window of possible solutions to the clinical adaptation problem."
https://openalex.org/W1981682592,"Besides being a marker of various somatic stem cells in mammals, prominin-1 (CD133) plays a role in maintaining the photoreceptor integrity since mutations in the PROM1 gene are linked with retinal degeneration. In spite of that, little information is available regarding its distribution in eyes of non-mammalian vertebrates endowed with high regenerative abilities. To address this subject, prominin-1 cognates were isolated from axolotl, zebrafish and chicken, and their retinal compartmentalization was investigated and compared to that of their mammalian orthologue. Interestingly, prominin-1 transcripts--except for the axolotl--were not strictly restricted to the outer nuclear layer (i.e., photoreceptor cells), but they also marked distinct subdivisions of the inner nuclear layer (INL). In zebrafish, where the prominin-1 gene is duplicated (i.e., prominin-1a and prominin-1b), a differential expression was noted for both paralogues within the INL being localized either to its vitreal or scleral subdivision, respectively. Interestingly, expression of prominin-1a within the former domain coincided with Pax-6-positive cells that are known to act as progenitors upon injury-induced retino-neurogenesis. A similar, but minute population of prominin-1-positive cells located at the vitreal side of the INL was also detected in developing and adult mice. In chicken, however, prominin-1-positive cells appeared to be aligned along the scleral side of the INL reminiscent of zebrafish prominin-1b. Taken together our data indicate that in addition to conserved expression of prominin-1 in photoreceptors, significant prominin-1-expressing non-photoreceptor retinal cell populations are present in the vertebrate eye that might represent potential sources of stem/progenitor cells for regenerative therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1983127231,"In humans, cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most significant infectious cause of intrauterine infections that cause congenital anomalies of the central nervous system. Currently, it is not known how this process is affected by the timing of infection and the susceptibility of early-gestational-period cells. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are more resistant to CMV than most other cell types, although the mechanism responsible for this resistance is not well understood. Using a plaque assay and evaluation of immediate-early 1 mRNA and protein expression, we found that mouse ES cells were resistant to murine CMV (MCMV) at the point of transcription. In ES cells infected with MCMV, treatment with forskolin and trichostatin A did not confer full permissiveness to MCMV. In ES cultures infected with elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) promoter-green fluorescent protein (GFP) recombinant MCMV at a multiplicity of infection of 10, less than 5% of cells were GFP-positive, despite the fact that ES cells have relatively high EF-1α promoter activity. Quantitative PCR analysis of the MCMV genome showed that ES cells allow approximately 20-fold less MCMV DNA to enter the nucleus than mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) do, and that this inhibition occurs in a multi-step manner. In situ hybridization revealed that ES cell nuclei have significantly less MCMV DNA than MEF nuclei. This appears to be facilitated by the fact that ES cells express less heparan sulfate, β1 integrin, and vimentin, and have fewer nuclear pores, than MEF. This may reduce the ability of MCMV to attach to and enter through the cellular membrane, translocate to the nucleus, and cross the nuclear membrane in pluripotent stem cells (ES/induced pluripotent stem cells). The results presented here provide perspective on the relationship between CMV susceptibility and cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2058309099,"Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), a member of the family Anelloviridae, is a single-stranded, circular DNA virus, widely distributed in swine populations. Presently, two TTSuV genogroups are recognized: Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2). TTSuV genomes have been found in commercial vaccines for swine, enzyme preparations and other drugs containing components of porcine origin. However, no studies have been made looking for TTSuV in cell cultures. In the present study, a search for TTSuV genomes was carried out in cell culture lineages, in sera used as supplement for cell culture media as well as in trypsin used for cell disaggregation. DNA obtained from twenty-five cell lineages (ten from cultures in routine multiplication and fifteen from frozen ampoules), nine samples of sera used in cell culture media and five batches of trypsin were examined for the presence of TTSuV DNA. Fifteen cell lineages, originated from thirteen different species contained amplifiable TTSuV genomes, including an ampoule with a cell lineage frozen in 1985. Three cell lineages of swine origin were co-infected with both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2. One batch of trypsin contained two distinct TTSuV1 plus one TTSuV2 genome, suggesting that this might have been the source of contamination, as supported by phylogenetic analyses of sequenced amplicons. Samples of fetal bovine and calf sera used in cell culture media did not contain amplifiable TTSuV DNA. This is the first report on the presence of TTSuV as contaminants in cell lineages. In addition, detection of the viral genome in an ampoule frozen in 1985 provides evidence that TTSuV contamination is not a recent event. These findings highlight the risks of TTSuV contamination in cell cultures, what may be source for contamination of biological products or compromise results of studies involving in vitro multiplied cells."

This study addresses the molecular mechanisms underlying this cytokine pattern in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. The transcriptional regulation of il23a, one of the chains of IL-23, depended on the activation of c-Rel and histone H3 phosphorylation, as judged from the association of c-Rel with the il23a promoter and the correlation between IL-23 production and Ser-10-histone H3 phosphorylation. Consistent with its reduced ability to produce IL-12 p70, zymosan induced a transient occupancy of the il12a promoter by c-Rel, blocked the production of IL-12 p70 and the transcription of il12a induced by other stimuli, and triggered the expression and nuclear translocation of the transcriptional repressors of the Notch family hairy and enhancer of split (Hes)-1, Hes5, hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein (Hey)-1, and transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE). Zymosan also induced the interaction of Hes1 and TLE with histone H3 phosphorylated on Ser-10 and deacetylated on Lys-14.

Addressing whether the effect of zymosan occurs via inhibition of il12a transcription or through a sole stimulation of il23a transactivation has pathophysiological relevance, because IL-23 takes part in the defense against pathogens and in the development of autoimmunity. Several hypotheses can be put forward to explain the distinct IL-12/IL-23 balances elicited by different stimuli as follows. (i) il23a induction could be explained through the activation of transcription factors of the family ATF-2/CREB. In fact, competition between CRE-binding protein (CREB) and NF-κB for the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) explains the IL-12 p70+/−/IL-10+++ pattern induced by zymosan in dendritic cells (DC) (17Alvarez Y. Municio C. Alonso S. Sánchez Crespo M. Fernández N. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A corollary to this finding is that stimuli with a strong ability to activate CREB should produce a parallel reduction of κB-dependent transcription. In keeping with this mechanism, enhancement of IL-23 production by chemicals acting on the protein kinase A (PKA)/CREB route has been reported (18Sheibanie A.F. Yen J.H. Khayrullina T. Emig F.

(ii) Differential activation of NF-κB family elements could explain differences in IL-12 p70 and IL-23 production. For instance, c-Rel-p50 complexes regulate genes involved in T cell function, including IL-12 p70, whereas the RelA/p65 subunit regulates genes encoding inflammatory cytokines (20Wang J. Wang X. Hussain S. Zheng Y. Sanjabi S. Ouaaz F. Beg A.A. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 6777-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This can be explained by different promoter κB-site sequences, but it may also depend on additional factors such as the capacity of RelA to be phosphorylated by PKA and to interact with CBP (21Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 22Yoon C. Korade Z. Carter B.D. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3738-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which allows acetylation of Lys-310, a site critical for transcriptional activity (23Chen L.F. Mu Y. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6539-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), or the unique ability of c-Rel/c-Rel homodimers to bind with high affinity to a broader range of NF-κB recognition sequences than do RelA-p65-containing complexes. This fact seems to be specially relevant regarding the transcriptional regulation of il12a in DC stimulated with LPS (24Sanjabi S. Williams K.J. Saccani S. Zhou L. Hoffmann A. Ghosh G. Gerondakis S. Natoli G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2138-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, a differential combination of NF-κB subunits could explain the occurrence of distinct transcriptional programs because activation of the β-glucan receptor dectin-1 allows for the formation of inactive RelA-RelB complexes (25Gringhuis S.I. den Dunnen J. Litjens M. van der Vlist M. Wevers B. Bruijns S.C. Geijtenbeek T.B. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and an exchange of dimers allows fine-tuning of the response over time (26Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1563-1574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Whether the reported enhancement of IL-23 production by cyclic AMP is associated with NF-κB signaling should be experimentally tested, taking into account that Ser-276 phosphorylation of p65 can also be elicited by mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK1) (27Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Vanden Berghe W. Haegeman G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), thus suggesting alternative mechanisms of activation. (iii) TLR and Notch routes cooperate in the activation of canonical Notch target genes. However, TLR- and Notch-induced hairy and enhancer of split (Hes)-1 and hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein (Hey)-1 also attenuate IL-6 and IL-12 p70 production via a feedback inhibitory loop that is abrogated by IFN-γ (28Hu X. Chung A.Y. Wu I. Foldi J. Chen J. Ji J.D. Tateya T. Kang Y.J. Han J. Gessler M. Kageyama R. Ivashkiv L.B. Immunity. 2008; 29: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). After testing all of these hypotheses, we have observed the unique involvement of c-Rel in the regulation of both il12a and il23a. Whereas LPS produced binding of c-Rel to both promoters, zymosan induced binding and early histone H3 phosphorylation of the il23a promoter as well as a transient binding of c-Rel to il12a promoter. The production of IL-23 correlated with the extent of histone H3 phosphorylation and was highly sensitive to H89, an inhibitor of the nucleosomal response (29Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Addition of zymosan prior to the stimulation with LPS and IFN-γ induced a near complete inhibition of IL-12 p70 production. Zymosan inhibited IFN-γ signaling at different steps and also induced the expression of the transcriptional repressors Hes1, Hes5, Hey1, and the corepressor transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE), which may bind the set of N- and E-boxes in the il12a promoter. In addition, zymosan induced the association of TLE and Hes1 with histone H3 showing increased Ser-10 phosphorylation and reduced Lys-14 acetylation. These data indicate that zymosan stimulates il23a transcription via c-Rel and histone H3 phosphorylation and activates transcriptional repressors of il12a that ultimately produce Lys-14-histone H3 deacetylation. Zymosan, mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, curdlan from Alcaligenes faecalis, H89, and the catalytic subunit of PKA were from Sigma. Depleted zymosan from S. cerevisiae was from InvivoGen (San Diego). Endotoxin levels in the reagents were below 1 ng/ml as determined by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Cambrex Bio Sciences, Walkersville, MD). Moreover, addition of 200 μg/ml polymyxin B did not modify the effect of the different stimuli. This negates the possible involvement of LPS in the responses studied. IL-12 p70 and IL-6 were assayed with reagents from Thermo Scientific Pierce and IL-23 with reagents from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). IFN-β was assayed with reagents from PBL InterferonSource (Piscataway, NJ). Recombinant histone H3.3 was from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Recombinant active MSK1, anti-Ser(P)-10-histone H3 (catalog no. 04-817), anti-Ac-Lys-14-histone H3 (catalog no. 07-353), anti-histone H3 (catalog no. 05-928), and PKA inhibitor peptide were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). DC were obtained from human monocytes as reported previously (15Valera I. Fernández N. Trinidad A.G. Alonso S. Brown G.D. Alonso A. Crespo M.S. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 5727-5736Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Bone marrow-derived DC from mice were obtained by culture in the presence of murine recombinant GM-CSF. Because deletion of hes1 in mice results in embryonic or neonatal lethality (30Ishibashi M. Ang S.L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), hes1 conditional knock-out mice were generated by crossing hes1flox/flox animals, kindly provided by Dr. Ryoichiro Kageyama, with Mx1-Cre transgenic mice (the Jackson Laboratory). Littermates with hes1flox/flox:Mx1-Cre (KO) or hes1+/+:Mx1-Cre (WT control) genotypes were intraperitoneally injected with 200 μg/mouse of poly(I:C) three times in 5 days to induce deletion, and mice were used for experiments 2 weeks later. hey1-null mice were kindly provided by Dr. Manfred Gessler (31Fischer A. Schumacher N. Maier M. Sendtner M. Gessler M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), and hey1+/+ and hey1−/− littermates were used for experiments. Unless otherwise stated, LPS was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, zymosan at 1 mg/ml, and IFNs at 1000 units/ml. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were used for immunodetection of c-Rel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-70), RelB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-226), p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7178), RelA/p65 (Millipore catalog no. 06-418), Ser(P)-276-p65 (Cell Signaling catalog no. 3031), Ser(P)-536-p65 (Cell Signaling catalog no. 3037), Stat1 (Cell Signaling catalog no. 9172), Tyr(P)-701-Stat1 (Cell Signaling catalog no. 9171S), Ser(P)-727-Stat1 (Cell Signaling catalog no. 9177), Hes1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-25392), Hes5 (Millipore, AB5708), and TLE (pan-TLE goat polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-13373). Quantitation of the blots was carried out using Quantity One gel imaging software (Bio-Rad). For immunoblots directed to assay nuclear proteins, the nuclear extracts were obtained by using a nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Purified RNA was depleted of genomic DNA by treatment with DNase (Turbo-DNA freeTM, Ambion) and used for RT reactions. The sets of primers for PCRs are shown in Table 1. Cycling conditions were adapted to each set of primers. gapdh was used as a housekeeping gene to assess the relative abundance of the different mRNA, using the comparative CT (cycle threshold) method. In the case of reactions directed to assay the il12a promoter and TLE 1, the PCR medium was supplemented with 1 mm betaine in view of the high GC content of the amplified sequences.TABLE 1Primers used for ChIP and real time RT-PCRil12a S5′-AGGCCTGTTTACCATTGGA-3′il12a AS5′-TCAAGGGAGGATTTTTGTGG-3′il23a S5′-CATGGGCCTTCATGCTATTT-3′il23a AS5′-TTTGCATTGTCAGGTTTCCA-3′IFNβ S5′-TCTAGCACTGGCTGGAATGAG-3′IFNβ AS5′-GTTTCGGAGGTAACCTGTAAG-3′IRF1S5′-TTCCCTCTTCCACTCGGAGT-3′IRF1 AS5′-GATATCTGGCAGGGAGTTCA-3′IRF8 S5′-GCTGATCAAGGAGCCTTCTG-3′IRF8 AS5′-ACCAGTCTGGAAGGAGCTGA-3′Hes1 S5′-TGAGCCAGCTGAAAACACTG-3′Hes1 AS5′-GTCACCTCGTTCATGCACTC-3′Hes1 S5′-GAGAAGCAGGGATCTGCTAA-3′Hey1 AS5′-CCCAAACTCCGATAGTCCAT-3′il12a ChIP S5′-GGCAATTTGTCCACGTCACT-3′il12a ChIP AS5′-TGATTTCCTGGGGAGAACAG-3′il23a ChIP S5′-CTGGGTTTCCGATTTTCTCA-3′il23a ChIP AS5′-CCCATGTGACGAAATGACTG-3′GAPDH S5′-GTCAGTGGTGGACCTGACCT-3′GAPDH AS5′-AGGGGAGATTCAGTGTGGTG-3′c-Rel S5′-ATTGTCGACTTATGGCCTCCGGTGCGTATAA-3′c-Rel AS5′-TTAGCGGCCGCTTATTCTACGTGATCCTGGCACAG-3′TLE1 S5′-AGCCAGCACGCCTGTTCTGA-3′TLE1 AS5′-TCAGCTCGCCGTTCATGCCA-3′ Open table in a new tab Nuclear extracts of DC were obtained from cell cultures grown in 10-cm tissue culture dishes by using a nuclear extract kit. Levels of transcription factor binding activity of IRF-3 in the nuclear extracts were quantitated with TransAMTM (Active Motif) and expressed as the absorbance at 450 nm. ChIP assays were conducted with reagents and Ab from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), as reported previously (17Alvarez Y. Municio C. Alonso S. Sánchez Crespo M. Fernández N. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PCRs were carried out with primers designed from both the il23a and il12a promoters (Table 1). The RHD of human c-Rel(1–309) was constructed by PCR from a full-length c-Rel cDNA construct provided by Dr. Tse-Hua Tan (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) using PfuUltra® II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and fused in-phase to the N-terminal histidine tag using SalI-NotI sites of a pET-28a vector. The mutant S267A was constructed by overlap mutagenesis using primers forward 5′-gcagttgcggagacctgctgaccaggaagttag-3′ and reverse 5′-ctaacttcctggtcagcaggtctccgcaactgc-3′. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 5 h at 37 °C. His tag proteins were purified with nickel beads and used for in vitro kinase assays. A 1-μg aliquot of substrate proteins was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in reaction buffer (12 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% glycerol, 0.01 Brij-35, and 0.1 mg BSA) containing 15 ng of PKAc or active MSK1 and supplemented with 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 20 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer, and the phosphorylated substrate proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 15% acrylamide. Phosphate incorporation was analyzed using PhosphorImager technology. Phosphorylation of c-Rel was also assayed by Western blot using anti-Ser(P)276-p65 phosphospecific antibody. Coimmunoprecipitation of TLE, Hes1, Ser(P)10-histone H3, and Ac-Lys-14-histone H3 was carried out using the nuclear complex Co-IP kit (Active Motif). The clarified lysates were preabsorbed on protein G-Sepharose and then incubated overnight with anti-pan-TLE precipitating goat Ab or anti-Hes1 rabbit Ab, followed by 2 h of incubation with protein A/G Plus-agarose beads. Immune complexes were extensively washed, suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Blots were stained to assess the input protein and the coimmunoprecipitation of Ser(P)-10- and Ac-Lys-14-histone H3. Zymosan and LPS were strong stimuli of IL-23 production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, whereas ovalbumin/anti-ovalbumin equivalence immune complexes and IFN-γ were inactive (Fig. 1A). Zymosan induced a higher production of IL-23 than LPS, but no significant differences were found. Maximal response to zymosan was observed with concentrations higher than 0.5 mg/ml (Fig. 1B), thus agreeing with previous results showing that optimal production is obtained with concentrations higher than 0.2 mg/ml and that different dose-response patterns can be observed for each cytokine (7Gerosa F. Baldani-Guerra B. Lyakh L.A. Batoni G. Esin S. Winkler-Pickett R.T. Consolaro M.R. De Marchi M. Giachino D. Robbiano A. Astegiano M. Sambataro A. Kastelein R.A. Carra G. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1447-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In line with recent reports stressing that ultrapure LPS does not consistently induce detectable quantities of IL-12 and IL-23 from human DC (32Napolitani G. Rinaldi A. Bertoni F. Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 33Goodall J.C. Wu C. Zhang Y. McNeill L. Ellis L. Saudek V. Gaston J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 17698-17703Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), LPS response was not saturated with concentrations as high as 20 μg/ml (Fig. 1C), thus suggesting that the process of differentiation of monocytes into DC, which is associated with a decrease of the surface display of CD14, might explain these findings. Alternatively, optimal response to LPS might depend on the concomitant presence of signals elicited by other agonists, for instance IFNs (4Gautier G. Humbert M. Deauvieau F. Scuiller M. Hiscott J.

Immunol. 1998; 10: 1593-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Because zymosan is a β-glucan polymer that also contains mannose moieties, experiments were conducted with mannan, the pure β-glucan curdlan, and a combination thereof. Similar to zymosan, curdlan induced a predominant production of IL-23 (Fig. 1D), which was also observed with combinations of stimuli. Maximal concentrations of cytokines were observed at 24 h, with a trend of IL-23 production to decrease after this time when zymosan or combination of curdlan and mannan were employed (Fig. 1, E and F). Attempts to ascertain whether the induction of cytokines is transcriptionally regulated were carried out by real time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, all of the stimuli induced the mRNA of il23a, without significant differences in the amounts elicited by LPS and zymosan (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the increase of il12a mRNA induced by LPS was 66-fold as high as that elicited by zymosan (Fig. 2C). The induction of il12/23b mRNA elicited by LPS was 10-fold as high as that produced by zymosan and 5-fold as high as that observed in response to a combination of curdlan and mannan when the time points of maximal induction were considered (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2Effect of different stimuli on the expression of the mRNA encoding IL-19 (A and B), IL-12 p35 (C), and IL-12 p40 (D), and pharmacological modulation of IL-23 production. DC were stimulated for different times with the indicated stimuli and collected for the extraction of total RNA and real time RT-PCR. GADPH was used for normalization of the data. The effect of the pharmacological modulation of NF-κB, p38 MAPK, and PKA on IL-23 production by zymosan is shown in E and F. DC were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of the indicated additions and then stimulated with 1 mg/ml zymosan or 10 μg of LPS for 24 h (F). IL-23 was assayed in the supernatants.

Involvement of the cyclic AMP/PKA route in the regulation of IL-23 stems from two different types of observations. First, the regulation of NF-κB transactivating activity by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-276-RelA (21Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) and, likely, a similar consensus sequence in c-Rel (see below). Second, the enhancement of IL-23 production by agents that increase intracellular cyclic AMP levels (18Sheibanie A.F. Yen J.H. Khayrullina T. Emig F. Zhang M. Tuma R. Ganea D. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 8138-8147Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 19Lemos H.P. Grespan R. Vieira S.M. Cunha T.M. Verri Jr., W.A. Fernandes K.S. Souto F.O. McInnes I.B. Ferreira S.H. Liew F.Y. Cunha F.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5954-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The PKA and nucleosomal response inhibitor H89 produced an almost complete inhibition of IL-23 production in response to zymosan and LPS (Fig. 2F). In contrast, the cell-permeable analog 8-bromo-cAMP and activation of adenylyl cyclase with prostaglandin E2 did not increase IL-23 production (data not shown). This finding is consistent with an effect of H89 on c-Rel and/or RelA phosphorylation or on another target, rather than on the PKA/CREB system, because the catalytic subunit of PKA is tightly bound to IκB and RelA and does not require prior dissociation from its regulatory subunit by cyclic AMP to become active (21Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), but it differs from results reported in Schwann cells, where both Ser-276-RelA/p65 phosphorylation and κB-dependent transcriptional activity were induced by treatment with forskolin and dibutyryl-cAMP (22Yoon C. Korade Z. Carter B.D. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3738-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Zymosan induced a rapid and lasting translocation of c-Rel, RelA/p65, and RelB into nuclear fractions, which increased up to at least 4 h, and a similar result was observed with the combination of mannan and curdlan (Fig. 3A). In contrast, p50 levels in nuclear fractions did not show significant changes upon cell stimulation (Fig. 3B), which ag"
https://openalex.org/W1977369187,"Background The pathophysiology of HFE-derived Hereditary Hemochromatosis and the function of HFE protein in iron homeostasis remain uncertain. Also, the role of alternative splicing in HFE gene expression regulation and the possible function of the corresponding protein isoforms are still unknown. The aim of this study was to gain insights into the physiological significance of these alternative HFE variants. Methodology/Principal Findings Alternatively spliced HFE transcripts in diverse human tissues were identified by RT-PCR, cloning and sequencing. Total HFE transcripts, as well as two alternative splicing transcripts were quantified using a real-time PCR methodology. Intracellular localization, trafficking and protein association of GFP-tagged HFE protein variants were analysed in transiently transfected HepG2 cells by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. Alternatively spliced HFE transcripts present both level- and tissue-specificity. Concerning the exon 2 skipping and intron 4 inclusion transcripts, the liver presents the lowest relative level, while duodenum presents one of the highest amounts. The protein resulting from exon 2 skipping transcript is unable to associate with β2M and TfR1 and reveals an ER retention. Conversely, the intron 4 inclusion transcript gives rise to a truncated, soluble protein (sHFE) that is mostly secreted by cells to the medium in association with β2M. Conclusions/Significance HFE gene post-transcriptional regulation is clearly affected by a tissue-dependent alternative splicing mechanism. Among the corresponding proteins, a sHFE isoform stands out, which upon being secreted into the bloodstream, may act in remote tissues. It could be either an agonist or antagonist of the full length HFE, through hepcidin expression regulation in the liver or by controlling dietary iron absorption in the duodenum."

Here, we describe the identification of an RNA inhibitor or aptamer by an in vitro evolution approach and a characterization of its mechanism of inhibition on the sites of interaction by equilibrium binding and on the receptor channel opening rate by a laser-pulse photolysis technique. Our results show that the aptamer is a noncompetitive inhibitor that selectively inhibits the GluA2Qflip AMPA receptor subunit without any effect on other AMPA receptor subunits or kainate or NMDA receptors. On the GluA2 subunit, this aptamer preferentially inhibits the flip variant. Furthermore, the aptamer preferentially inhibits the closed-channel state of GluA2Qflip with a KI = 1.5 μm or by ∼15-fold over the open-channel state. The potency and selectivity of this aptamer rival those of small molecule inhibitors. Together, these properties make this aptamer a promising candidate for the development of water-soluble, highly potent, and GluA2 subunit-selective drugs.

Together, these properties make this aptamer a promising candidate for the development of water-soluble, highly potent, and GluA2 subunit-selective drugs. Developing inhibitors to selectively target a single subunit among a multisubunit protein or receptor family is a worthy effort for the following reasons. First, the role of the single subunit can be uniquely tested in a complex biological background, such as in vivo, leaving other subunits untouched. Such a test can be carried out at any particular time if the target function changes during development. In this scenario, the function of this subunit can be inhibited in a reversible, graded fashion in that the degree of inhibition of the protein function can be manipulated by the amount and the time of exposure when the inhibitor is applied, and such an inhibition can be reversibly relieved when the inhibitor is removed. Second, if the inhibitor is a drug candidate, selectivity is generally a desired property. A drug with higher selectivity may have a higher therapeutic effect when the excessive activity of a single protein subunit to which the drug molecule binds is linked to the pathogenesis of a disease. Third, development of an inhibitor to differentiate exclusively its binding to and inhibition of one subunit can provide valuable insights into the structural and functional differences of the subunit from all other subunits of the same family. As such, the most effective way to probe the structure of a particular subunit and to regulate the function of that subunit may be found. Guided by these reasons, we set out to find an inhibitor uniquely selective to a single subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) 3The abbreviations used are: AMPAα-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acidNMDAN-methyl-d-aspartateBDZ-f1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepineNBQX6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dioneCaged glutamateγ-O-(α-carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl)glutamateDMSOdimethyl sulfoxide. receptors. α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid N-methyl-d-aspartate 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine 6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione γ-O-(α-carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl)glutamate dimethyl sulfoxide. AMPA receptors are one of the three subtypes of glutamate ion channels that also include kainate and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtypes (1Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev.

AMPA receptors mediate most of fast synaptic neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system, and their function and regulation are critical for synaptic plasticity (4Palmer C.L. Cotton L.

GluA1–4 (previously known as GluR1–4 or GluRA–D) encode four subunits of mammalian AMPA receptors. The primary molecular architecture of AMPA receptor subunits is most likely similar, given the fact that all subunits have ∼900 amino acids and share 70% homology of the encoding genes, although the genes are alternatively spliced and edited (1Hollmann M.

Science. 1990; 249: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), whereas GluA4 is mainly expressed early during development (8Kawahara Y. Ito K. Sun H. Aizawa H. Kanazawa I. Kwak S. Nature. 2004; 427: 801Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 9Zhu J.J. Esteban J.A. Hayashi Y. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1098-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although GluA1–4 can form homomeric channels individually (10Mosbacher J. Schoepfer R. Monyer H. Burnashev N. Seeburg P.H. Ruppersberg J.P. Science. 1994; 266: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 11Boulter J. Hollmann M. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Hartley M. Deneris E. Maron C. Heinemann S. Science. 1990; 249: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), each subunit has some distinct functional properties. For examples, in response to the binding of glutamate, each of the GluA2–4 homomeric receptors opens the channel with a kinetic rate constant about severalfold larger than GluA1 does, yet all AMPA receptors close their channels with roughly a similar rate (12Pei W. Huang Z. Wang C. Han Y. Park J.S. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 3767-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Li G. Sheng Z. Huang Z. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5835-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Given these similarities and differences among various AMPA receptor subunits, it would be useful to develop subunit-selective inhibitors of AMPA receptors. To develop subunit-selective inhibitors, we needed to choose an unconventional methodology. The main, conventional approach to find inhibitors is synthetic chemistry, which produces small molecule inhibitors, the most common type of molecular agents and drug candidates (14Dixon S.J. Stockwell B.R. Curr Opin. Chem. Biol. 2009; 13: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Marcaurelle L.A. Johannes C.W. Prog. Drug Res. 2008; 66 (189): 187-216PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hruby V.J. J. Org. Chem. 2009; 74: 9245-9264Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In fact, a large number of small molecule inhibitors that target AMPA receptors have been synthesized (17Zappalà M. Grasso S. Micale N. Polimeni S. De Micheli C. Mini. Rev. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Sólyom S. Tarnawa I. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 913-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Weiser T. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2005; 4: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To date, however, no inhibitor is known to be capable of selectively inhibiting a single AMPA receptor subunit. Therefore, from the outset, we did not have a structural template of either a synthetic or a natural product inhibitor alike that might be most obvious to modify and/or improve upon to generate a subunit-selective inhibitor. The approach we took was based on an in vitro evolution for isolating RNA inhibitors or aptamers from an RNA library (20Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8161) Google Scholar, 21Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1990; 346: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (7728) Google Scholar). This approach relies on RT-PCR to “breed” desired RNA molecules by exponential enrichment of their sequences over background, through multiple iteration cycles, against a specific target protein or receptor. The useful RNA molecules are selected because they are the best fits to the protein target based on geometrical complementarity. Therefore, this approach does not require prior knowledge of the structure of the protein target or the existence of any lead compounds (22Nimjee S.M. Rusconi C.P. Sullenger B.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 2005; 56: 555-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). For this study, we chose to identify aptamers that would selectively inhibit the GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit. We chose this subunit not just for a proof of principle but for a high utility of having a GluA2 subunit-selective inhibitor. GluA2 controls key functional properties of heteromeric AMPA receptors, such as Ca2+ permeability, single-channel conductance, and rectification (23Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Höger T. Geiger J.R. Kuner T. Monyer H. Higuchi M. Bach A. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 24Kuner T. Beck C. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4162-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These properties of GluA2 are attributed to Arg607, a residue at the glutamine/arginine (or Q/R) site introduced into the pore loop by RNA editing (23Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Höger T. Geiger J.R. Kuner T. Monyer H. Higuchi M. Bach A. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 24Kuner T. Beck C. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4162-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Q/R editing is exclusive to GluA2 in AMPA receptors, and the editing is extremely efficient (i.e. >99% of GluA2 in adult brain is in the edited, R isoform) (25Sommer B. Köhler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Editing defect in GluA2, however, leads to generation of the highly Ca2+ permeable Q isoform through which excessive Ca2+ ions enter the cell. Consequently, intracellular calcium overload causes cell death, which underlines various neurological disorders such as stroke (26Oguro K. Oguro N. Kojima T. Grooms S.Y. Calderone A. Zheng X. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9218-9227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (27Kwak S. Kawahara Y. J. Mol. Med. 2005; 83: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus, GluA2 subunit-selective aptamers are potential drug candidates. These aptamers could be also used as structural probes. To find GluA2-selective aptamers, we chose the closed-channel receptor conformation as the target of selection, rather than the open channel or a mixture of the closed- and the open-channel conformations. (For the purpose of this work, the closed-channel conformation is defined as the unliganded, resting form of the receptor; this is “A” as in a general mechanism of channel opening in the “Experimental Procedures.”) The choice of this conformation was based on our earlier hypothesis that the closed-channel conformation is more flexible or more modifiable in the context of inhibitor binding/inhibition (28Ritz M. Micale N. Grasso S. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, the closed-channel conformation would be a better structural scaffold for geometrical complementarity selection (29Wilson D.S. Szostak J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). As such, an RNA aptamer, selected to uniquely recognize one conformation of a subunit, is not expected to bind avidly to either other receptor subunits or even other conformations of the same subunit due to incorrect or imperfect molecular recognition, thereby producing subunit discrimination and selectivity. To maximize our chance of success in finding subunit-selective inhibitors, we did not select competitive inhibitor type, despite the fact that there is abundant, structural information available for competitive inhibitors and the agonist binding sites (30Ahmed A.H. Thompson M.D. Fenwick M.K. Romero B. Loh A.P. Jane D.E. Sondermann H. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 3894-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Ahmed A.H. Wang Q. Sondermann H. Oswald R.E. Proteins. 2009; 75: 628-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Lunn M.L. Hogner A. Stensbøl T.B. Gouaux E. Egebjerg J. Kastrup J.S. J. Med.

Instead, we selected noncompetitive inhibitors (or noncompetitive aptamers). Because noncompetitive inhibitors bind to regulatory sites, distinct to the site agonist binds, they are generally considered more selective or less promiscuous in differentiating isoforms. By applying these mechanism-based design principles, together with the use of an in vitro evolution approach, we have successfully isolated, and report here, an aptamer that is not only potent but also exclusively selective to the GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit. The cDNAs encoding various subunits of glutamate ion channels were used for transient receptor expression in HEK-293S cells (35Huang Z. Pei W. Jayaseelan S. Shi H. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12648-12655Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cell culture, transfection, and preparation of membrane lipids containing functional, intact GluA2Qflip receptors for aptamer selection were carried out according to the protocols reported previously (35Huang Z. Pei W. Jayaseelan S. Shi H. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12648-12655Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The preparation of the RNA library with ∼1015 random sequences and the running of in vitro selection of aptamers against GluA2Qflip in membrane lipids were described previously (35Huang Z. Pei W. Jayaseelan S. Shi H. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12648-12655Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (see also supplemental Fig. S1). For binding at each selection cycle, the RNA library was dissolved in the extracellular buffer, which contained:145 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The final concentration of membrane-bound receptor for binding was 8 nm, determined by [3H]AMPA binding (35Huang Z. Pei W. Jayaseelan S. Shi H. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12648-12655Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The binding mixture was incubated at 22 °C for 50 min in the presence of 0.3 units/μl RNase inhibitor. For elution, 1 mm (final concentration) of (−)1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine, which we designated as BDZ-f, was used. The eluted RNAs were subject to RT-PCR (supplemental Fig. S1). To suppress enrichment of nonspecific RNAs bound to any unwanted “targets,” such as lipids, we also ran three negative selections at rounds 4, 8, and 13 in which plain HEK-293 cell membrane fragments lacking only GluA2Qflip receptors were used to absorb nonspecific RNAs. For identifying consensus sequences, the DNA pools from rounds 12 and 14 (i.e. 14 was the final round) were cloned separately into the pGEM-T easy vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The 5′-end 32P-labeled aptamers, AF44 and AF42, were prepared as described (35Huang Z. Pei W. Jayaseelan S. Shi H. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12648-12655Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An aliquot of 10 nm of 32P-labeled (hot) aptamer was mixed with a series of concentrations (i.e. 0–400 nm, final concentration) of the unlabeled (cold) aptamer. The final concentration of the receptor and hot aptamer was 0.4 and 0.1 nm. The same concentrations of the receptor and the hot aptamer were used when kainate (1 mm, final concentration) was included to assess aptamer binding to the receptor in the presence of kainate. The receptor/library mixture was incubated at 22 °C for 1 h for binding, followed by filtering and centrifugation (35Huang Z. Pei W. Jayaseelan S. Shi H. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12648-12655Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The radioactivity on the filter was quantified with the use of a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter LS6500). The nonspecific binding was estimated by Equation 1 (36Swillens S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1197-1203PubMed Google Scholar). The specific binding was calculated as the difference between the total binding in cpm and the estimated nonspecific cpm. The specific binding was normalized to the percentage without the unlabeled AF44/AF42. Assuming a one-site binding model, the Kd of an aptamer was estimated by Equation 1 (36Swillens S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1197-1203PubMed Google Scholar), Y=Bmax×[Hot][Hot]+[Cold]+Kd+NSB(Eq. 1) where [Hot]/[Cold] are the concentrations of unbound, hot aptamer/cold aptamer, respectively; NSB represents nonspecific binding. Bmax is the maximal number of binding sites. 6-Nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) was mixed (200 μm, final concentration) with hot aptamer/GluA2Qflip to assess whether NBQX bound to the same site with AF44 or AF42 as well as AF1422. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used for initially dissolving NBQX. Hot AF44 or AF42 of 0.1 nm (final concentration) mixed with the receptor was incubated with DMSO alone (as a blank control) or NBQX/DMSO at 22 °C for 1 h. The binding in the absence and presence of DMSO and NBQX/DMSO was quantified the same way as in homologous competitive binding. The procedure for whole-cell current recording to assay putative aptamers was described previously (35Huang Z. Pei W. Jayaseelan S. Shi H. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12648-12655Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All recordings were at −60 mV and 22 °C. The recording electrode was filled with the buffer: 110 mm CsF, 30 mm CsCl, 4 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted by CsOH). The extracellular buffer composition was provided under “Aptamer Selection.” All other buffers used were described previously (35Huang Z. Pei W. Jayaseelan S. Shi H. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12648-12655Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The whole-cell current was recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier at a cutoff frequency of 2–20 kHz by a built-in, four-pole Bessel filter and digitized at 5–50 kHz sampling frequency using a Digidata 1322A (Molecular Devices). pClamp 8 (Molecular Devices) was used for data acquisition. The laser-pulse photolysis technique was used to characterize the mechanism of inhibition by measuring the effect of an aptamer on the channel-opening kinetics (28Ritz M. Micale N. Grasso S. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, γ-O-(α-carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl)glutamate (caged glutamate) (37Wieboldt R. Gee K.R. Niu L. Ramesh D. Carpenter B.K. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 8752-8756Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (Invitrogen) with or without aptamer dissolved in the extracellular buffer was applied to a cell using a flow device (28Ritz M. Micale N. Grasso S. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Huang Z. Pei W. Jayaseelan S. Shi H. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12648-12655Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A single, 355-nm laser pulse with a pulse length of 8 ns and pulse energy of 200–800 μJ, generated from a pulsed Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Continuum), was used for photolyzing the caged glutamate. To calibrate the concentration of released glutamate, we applied two solutions of free glutamate with known concentrations to the same cell using the same flow device before and after a laser flash (38Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The current amplitudes obtained from this calibration were compared with the amplitude from the laser measurement with reference to the dose-response relationship for GluA2Qflip (39Li G. Pei W. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12358-12366Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The opening of the GluA2Qflip channel in response to glutamate binding was described kinetically in a general mechanism (Scheme 1; 39Li G. Pei W. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12358-12366Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A represents the closed, unliganded form of the receptor, L represents the ligand, ALn represents the closed-channel forms bound with ligands, ALn represents the open-channel state, K1 represents the intrinsic dissociation constant of activating ligand, and Φ represents the channel opening equilibrium constant; n is the number of the ligand molecules that bind to the receptor to open the channel (i.e. n = 1–4). Based on this mechanism and also the assumption that the ligand binding rate was fast as compared with the channel-opening rate, the observed rate constant of channel opening (kobs) was written as Equation 2. kobs=kcl+kop(LK1+L)n(Eq. 2) lt=lmax(1−exp(−kobst))(Eq. 3) In Equation 2, kcl and kop are the channel-closing and channel-opening rate constants, respectively. Furthermore, kobs was calculated from Equation 3, where Imax is the maximum current amplitude and It is the current amplitude at time t. Our previous studies of AMPA receptors, including a mutant AMPA receptor, for their channel-opening kinetic mechanisms led us to conclude that binding of two glutamate molecules per receptor (i.e. n = 2) was sufficient to open the channel (40Pei W. Ritz M. McCarthy M. Huang Z. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22731-22736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Using the laser-pulse photolysis technique, we previously determined the kop of (8.0 ± 0.49) × 104 s−1 and the kcl of (2.6 ± 0.20) × 103 s−1, respectively, for the channel-opening kinetic constants of the GluA2Qflip receptor (39Li G. Pei W. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12358-12366Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The noncompetitive mechanism of inhibition was established by measuring the effect of AF44/AF42 on the channel-opening rate constants (41Niu L. Hess G.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3831-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 42Niu L. Abood L.G. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 12008-12012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By this mechanism (see Scheme 2 below), an inhibitor binds to both the closed- and open-channel states through a regulatory site, and the binding results in inhibition of kobs as in Equation 4, where I is the molar concentration of the inhibitor (other symbols have been defined earlier). kobs=kop(LL+K1)n(KlKl+l)+kcl(K¯lK¯l+l)(Eq. 4) In deriving Equation 4, one inhibitory site was assumed. At low concentrations of glutamate (L ≪ K1), kobs reflected kcl because the contribution of the kop portion in Equation 4 to the overall rate, kobs, was negligible. Thus, Equation 4 was reduced into Equation 5, and the effect of the inhibitor on kcl could be assessed (28Ritz M. Micale N. Grasso S. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) by using Equation 5. kobs=kcl(K¯lK¯l+l)(Eq. 5) When kobs > kcl, the effect of AF44/AF42 on kop was measured at a series of high glutamate concentrations. By noncompetitive inhibition, AF44/AF42 would affect kop (Equation 6), as was observed (Fig. 5D, right panel). kobs−kcl(K¯lK¯l+l)=kop(LL+K1)n(KlKl+l)(Eq. 6) Because the magnitude of kcl reflects the lifetime (τ) of the open channel (i.e. τ = 1/kcl), the effect of an inhibitor on kcl reveals whether or not it inhibits the open-channel conformation or state (28Ritz M. Micale N. Grasso S. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, kop reflects the closed-channel state, the effect on kop, therefore, reveals whether the inhibitor is effective on the closed-channel state (28Ritz M. Micale N. Grasso S. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Experimentally, we established that for GluA2Qflip, at 100 μm photolytically released glutamate, which we set as the low glutamate concentration, kcl was measured (28Ritz M. Micale N. Grasso S. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 43Li G. Oswald R.E. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12367-12375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In other words, under this condition or L ≪ K1, Equation 2 is reduced to kobs ≈ kcl (28Ritz M. Micale N. Grasso S. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 43Li G. Oswald R.E. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12367-12375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, kop could be determined at a glutamate concentration of about 300 μm (28Ritz M. Micale N. Grasso S. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 43Li G. Oswald R.E. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12367-12375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, the effect of an aptamer on kcl and kop could be characterized separately. The ratio of the whole-cell current amplitude in the absence and presence of a putative aptamer or A/A(I) as a function of aptamer concentration was used to independently measure inhibition constants (28Ritz M. Micale N. Grasso S. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), as illustrated in Equations 7 and 8 (28Ritz M. Micale N. Grasso S. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These equations were derived based on the same general mechanism of channel opening described earlier. KI,app is the apparent inhibition constant for the inhibitor; other terms have been defined previously. AA(l)=1+l(AL¯2)Kl,app(Eq. 7) (AL¯2)=AL¯2A+AL+AL2+AL¯2=L2L2(1+Φ)+2K1LΦ+K12Φ(Eq. 8) According to Equation 7, at low glutamate concentrations (i.e. L ≪ K1), the majority of the receptors were in a closed-channel population. Thus, the inhibition constant for the closed-channel conformation or state was determined from A/A(I) versus inhibitor concentration by Equations 7 and 8. Likewise, at a saturating ligand concentration (i.e. L ≫ K1), the majority of the receptors were in the open-channel state. Thus, the inhibition constant for the open-channel state was determined. In the case of GluA2Qflip, because the EC50 of GluA2Qflip with glutamate is 1.3 mm and the channel-opening probability of GluA2Qflip is near unity (39Li G. Pei W. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12358-12366Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), 100 μm glutamate concentration corresponds to the majority of the channels (i.e. ∼96%) being in the closed-channel state (39Li G. Pei W. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12358-12366Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At 3 mm glutamate concentration, which is a saturating concentration (39Li G. Pei W. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12358-12366Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), almost all of the channels are in the open state (39Li G. Pei W. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12358-12366Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the KI value of an aptamer for the open- and closed-channel states of GluA2Qflip was determined using these two glutamate concentrations. Unless noted otherwise, each data point was an average of at least three measurements. Each of the whole-cell recording data point was collected from at least three cells. Uncertainties reported refer to S.D. Origin software (version 7) was used for data analysis and plotting. To ensure that the aptamers to be identified would recognize the functional GluA2Qflip AMPA receptors, we transiently expressed the intact GluA2Qflip receptors in HEK-293 cells and used the cellular membrane harboring the receptor for aptamer selection (35Huang Z. Pei W. Jayaseelan S. Shi H. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12648-12655Crossref Pu"
https://openalex.org/W2119303797,"The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is involved in transformation, survival, mitogenesis and differentiation. It is overexpressed in many tumors and a validated target for anticancer therapy. In cell-free systems, polypyrimidic peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) can form triplex-like structures with messenger RNAs and halt the ribosomal machinery during the translation elongation. A 17-mer PNA that formed a PNA(2):mRNA complex with a purine-rich sequence located in the coding region of IGF-1R mRNA induced the synthesis of a truncated IGF-1R in vitro. This PNA down-regulated expression of the receptor by 70-80% in prostate cancer cells without affecting insulin receptor expression that exhibits high homology with IGF-1R. Inhibition occurs at the translational level, since the IGF-1R mRNA level measured by quantitative RT-PCR was not affected by PNA treatment. In addition, IGF-1R knockdown by PNA led to an attenuation of phosphorylation of downstream signaling pathways, PI3K/AKT and MAPK, involved in survival and mitogenesis and also to a decrease in cell transformation. Of the steric blockers tested, which included phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers and locked nucleic acids, PNA was unique in its ability to form triplex structures with mRNA and to arrest translation elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1967030362,"Many single-gene knockouts result in increased phenotypic (e.g., morphological) variability among the mutant's offspring. This has been interpreted as an intrinsic ability of genes to buffer genetic and environmental variation. A phenotypic capacitor is a gene that appears to mask phenotypic variation: when knocked out, the offspring shows more variability than the wild type. Theory predicts that this phenotypic potential should be correlated with a gene's knockout fitness and its number of negative genetic interactions. Based on experimentally measured phenotypic capacity, it was suggested that knockout fitness was unimportant, but that phenotypic capacitors tend to be hubs in genetic and physical interaction networks.We re-analyse the available experimental data in a combined model, which includes knockout fitness and network parameters as well as expression level and protein length as predictors of phenotypic potential. Contrary to previous conclusions, we find that the strongest predictor is in fact haploid knockout fitness (responsible for 9% of the variation in phenotypic potential), with an additional contribution from the genetic interaction network (5%); once these two factors are taken into account, protein-protein interactions do not make any additional contribution to the variation in phenotypic potential.We conclude that phenotypic potential is not a mysterious ""emergent"" property of cellular networks. Instead, it is very simply determined by the overall fitness reduction of the organism (which in its compromised state can no longer compensate for multiple factors that contribute to phenotypic variation), and by the number (and presumably nature) of genetic interactions of the knocked-out gene. In this light, Hsp90, the prototypical phenotypic capacitor, may not be representative: typical phenotypic capacitors are not direct ""buffers"" of variation, but are simply genes encoding central cellular functions."
