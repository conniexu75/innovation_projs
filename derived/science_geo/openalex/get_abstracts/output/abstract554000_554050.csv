https://openalex.org/W2281478543,"In vitro generation of functional gametes is a promising approach for treating infertility, although faithful replication of meiosis has proven to be a substantial obstacle to deriving haploid gamete cells in culture. Here we report complete in vitro meiosis from embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived primordial germ cells (PGCLCs). Co-culture of PGCLCs with neonatal testicular somatic cells and sequential exposure to morphogens and sex hormones reproduced key hallmarks of meiosis, including erasure of genetic imprinting, chromosomal synapsis and recombination, and correct nuclear DNA and chromosomal content in the resulting haploid cells. Intracytoplasmic injection of the resulting spermatid-like cells into oocytes produced viable and fertile offspring, showing that this robust stepwise approach can functionally recapitulate male gametogenesis in vitro. These findings provide a platform for investigating meiotic mechanisms and the potential generation of human haploid spermatids in vitro."

Here, we investigated whether synaptic forces promote the destruction of target cells. CTLs kill by secreting toxic proteases and the pore forming protein perforin into the synapse. Biophysical experiments revealed a striking correlation between the magnitude of force exertion across the synapse and the speed of perforin pore formation on the target cell, implying that force potentiates cytotoxicity by enhancing perforin activity. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that increasing target cell tension augmented pore formation by perforin and killing by CTLs. Our data also indicate that CTLs coordinate perforin release and force exertion in space and time. These results reveal an unappreciated physical dimension to lymphocyte function and demonstrate that cells use mechanical forces to control the activity of outgoing chemical signals."

To gain insight into the underlying molecular and cellular pathogenesis, we conducted a multi-region transcriptome analysis of DS and euploid control brains spanning from mid-fetal development to adulthood. We found genome-wide alterations in the expression of a large number of genes, many of which exhibited temporal and spatial specificity and were associated with distinct biological processes. In particular, we uncovered co-dysregulation of genes associated with oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination that were validated via cross-species comparison to Ts65Dn trisomy mice. Furthermore, we show that hypomyelination present in Ts65Dn mice is in part due to cell-autonomous effects of trisomy on oligodendrocyte differentiation and results in slower neocortical action potential transmission. Together, these results identify defects in white matter development and function in DS, and they provide a transcriptional framework for further investigating DS neuropathogenesis.

Trisomy for human chromosome 21 (HSA21) causes Down syndrome (DS) in one of every 732 live births (Canfield et al., 2006Canfield M.A. Honein M.A. Yuskiv N. Xing J. Mai C.T. Collins J.S. Devine O.

While it is clear that trisomy of HSA21 is the root cause of DS, which biological processes are affected and which HSA21 and non-HSA21 genes are associated with those processes are not fully understood. Furthermore, the extent to which human postmortem neuropathology is reflected in the mouse models (and vice versa) remains one of the key problems hampering further understanding of DS brain development and function. Transcriptome profiling has provided insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental brain disorders (Mitchell and Mirnics, 2012Mitchell A.C. Mirnics K.

Primary and secondary transcriptional effects in the developing human Down syndrome brain and heart.Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R107Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), these studies are limited by sparse genome coverage, numbers of samples or developmental time points, and potential variances between in vitro and in vivo gene regulation. We therefore set out to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene expression in the DS and matched euploid brains and, subsequently, to decipher the biological processes affected over the course of prenatal and postnatal development. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling was performed in different regions of male and female postmortem brains spanning from mid-fetal development to adulthood. This approach uncovered a highly dynamic disruption of the DS transcriptome across all chromosomes, with alterations in gene expression in different brain regions over time. Bioinformatic analysis revealed genes and gene networks for which expression was affected throughout the DS brain, revealing key molecular and cellular processes previously implicated in neurological dysfunction in DS as well as many that had not been well characterized in DS brains. Notably, we found transcriptome differences indicating that oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination are altered in DS. We further identified cell-autonomous deficits in oligodendrocyte differentiation and the production of neocortical myelin, which were accompanied by slower action potential transmission between cerebral hemispheres. Altogether, the data illustrate disruption of distinct gene co-expression networks in DS, providing an extensive framework to identify, prioritize, and test gene candidates and biological processes underlying the neuropathophysiology of DS. To facilitate the usefulness and accessibility of the DS transcriptome, we also have generated an internet database (http://medicine.yale.edu/lab/sestan/resources/). We used the Affymetrix exon array platform, which features comprehensive genome-wide coverage of the human transcriptome across entire transcripts and each individual exon, to characterize gene expression in different regions of DS brains over the course of development (see Experimental Procedures). Transcriptome profiling was performed using total RNA extracted from 11 regions, including multiple regions of the cerebral neocortex, the hippocampus (HIP), and the cerebellar cortex (CBC), using a standardized protocol from high-quality postmortem human brains of DS and clinically and anatomically unremarkable euploid controls (for details on tissue dissections, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures, Figure S1, and Tables S1 and S2). We collected 58 paired tissue samples from 15 euploid control and 15 DS brains ranging in age from 14 post conception weeks (pcw) to 42 years old (Table S2), and we then allocated them into groups based on a previously described timeline that divides human brain development and adulthood into 15 periods (Kang et al., 2011Kang H.J. Kawasawa Y.I. Cheng F. Zhu Y. Xu X. Li M. Sousa A.M. Pletikos M. Meyer K.A. Sedmak G. et al.Spatio-temporal transcriptome of the human brain.Nature. 2011; 478: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Principal component analysis showed segregation between DS and control samples; however, brain regions and age (developmental periods) contributed more to the global differences in gene expression than disease status (Figure S2), indicating that gene expression in the human brain has a high degree of spatial variability (Table S2). We chose dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex (DFC) and CBC for our analyses, because both regions have been implicated in DS neuropathology (Hartley et al., 2015Hartley D. Blumenthal T. Carrillo M.

Sestan N. The developmental transcriptome of the human brain: implications for neurodevelopmental disorders.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2014; 27: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Of 17,557 mRNA genes profiled, 842 (4.8%) and 571 (3.25%) genes in DFC and CBC, respectively, were defined as significantly differentially expressed (DEX) between paired DS and euploid samples across all periods (Table S3) (false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.1; see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). As expected, the percentage of DEX genes on HSA21 was higher than other chromosomes (Figures 1A and S3). While 19.5% (DFC) and 13.9% (CBC) of the genes localized on HSA21 were DEX genes, a median of 4.4% (DFC) and 3.0% (CBC) DEX genes were found on other chromosomes in DS compared to their matched control. However, the majority of DEX genes were non-HSA21 genes (1,337 genes versus 76 genes on HSA21) (Figure 1B). We also found that, while all HSA21 DEX genes were upregulated in DS samples, only 47.7% (DFC) and 45.2% (CBC) of non-HSA21 DEX genes were upregulated. Conversely, 52.3% (DFC) and 54.8% (CBC) of non-HSA21 genes were downregulated (Figure 1C), indicating that the triplication of HSA21 leads to both positive and negative regulation of genes on other chromosomes (Figure S4). This directionality of HSA21 gene expression profiles suggests that upregulation of genes on HSA21, some of which function as trans factors, is followed by up- and downregulation of genes distributed throughout the genome. Strikingly, we found that gene expression across all chromosome locations was altered even from 14 pcw, indicating early and widespread changes to the DS transcriptome. A combination of sliding window, paired t test, and permutation tests was used to investigate temporal dynamics in transcriptional differences between DS and control brains (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This analysis revealed that the number of DEX genes in DFC increased in an age-dependent manner, with significantly more DEX genes emerging over postnatal development and adulthood (periods 8–14) (Figure 1D; Table S4). A completely different temporal picture emerged in the CBC, where the number of DEX genes remained constant over development and adulthood (Figure 1E; Table S4). This dichotomy between the DFC and CBC temporal gene expression profiles extended throughout the genome, with more variability across all chromosomes over developmental time in DFC samples (Figure S3). Gene ontology enrichment analysis indicated potential dysregulated biological categories, including transmission of nerve impulse (Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted [BHA] p = 2.9 × 10−8), synaptic transmission (BHA p = 1.4 × 10−5), cell morphogenesis (BHA p = 1.4 × 10−5), cell-cell signaling (BHA p = 6.7 × 10−5), and axon ensheathment (BHA p = 4.8 × 10−2) (Table S5). Together, these studies demonstrate that many genes throughout the genome are altered in DS, confirming and extending previous findings that non-HSA21 genes may contribute significantly to trisomy 21 phenotypes (Letourneau et al., 2014Letourneau A. Santoni F.A. Bonilla X. Sailani M.R. Gonzalez D. Kind J. Chevalier C. Thurman R. Sandstrom R.S.

Most importantly, our results clearly show that many of these DEX genes display dynamic temporal and spatial differences in expression, and they highlight specific biological processes potentially disrupted in the developing DS brain. To integrate the expression differences observed between DS and matched control samples from all 58 paired samples and each brain region into a systems-level context, we performed weighted-gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) (Zhang and Horvath, 2005Zhang B. Horvath S. A general framework for weighted gene co-expression network analysis.Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2005; 4 (Article17)Crossref PubMed Scopus (3369) Google Scholar) and identified modules of co-expressed genes. We defined 60 gene modules exhibiting altered expression during DS brain development in the CBC, HIP, and multiple neocortical regions (Tables S6 and S7). We then carried out gene ontology enrichment analysis of each module to gain insight into the biological significance of these clusters of co-expressed genes (Table S6). This analysis confirmed a number of cellular and molecular processes previously found to be altered in DS or mouse model brains, including cell morphogenesis (Module [M] 24; Figure S5A), RNA processing (M31), gene transcription (M52), immune responses (M54; Figure S5B), neuronal differentiation (M4 and M45; Figures S6A and S6D), synaptic transmission and regulation (M10 and M34; Figures S6B and S6C), and electron transport (M14) (Table S6; Bahn et al., 2002Bahn S.

WGCNA also identified co-expression modules enriched for genes associated with biological processes previously not well characterized in DS. Notably, a module of co-expressed genes, number 43 (M43), was enriched for gene ontology categories related to regulation of action potential (BHA p = 1.7 × 10−2) and axon ensheathment (BHA p = 3.7 × 10−2), and it was markedly downregulated throughout the DS neocortex and in the HIP over development (Figures 2A and 2B ; Table S6). Differences in this module accelerated over the course of DS neocortical development (Figures 2A and 2B), coinciding with the onset and progression of myelination. Note that the absence of an M43 expression phenotype in the CBC of DS brains (Figures 2A and 2B) is likely because the most numerous cells in CBC, granule cells, have unmyelinated axons. To further characterize M43 genes, we investigated whether they were associated with the developmental program of specific neural cell types (i.e., astrocytes, endothelial cells, microglia, neurons, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, newly formed oligodendrocytes, or myelinating oligodendrocytes). We queried whether M43 genes that were highly expressed (fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads [FPKM] > 20) in different populations of neural cell types purified from mouse cerebral cortex (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang Y. Chen K. Sloan S.A. Bennett M.L. Scholze A.R. O’Keeffe S. Phatnani H.P. Guarnieri P. Caneda C. Ruderisch N. et al.An RNA-sequencing transcriptome and splicing database of glia, neurons, and vascular cells of the cerebral cortex.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 11929-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (2943) Google Scholar; see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We found that, of the 121 mouse homologs of genes in M43, 67 met this cutoff for high expression (FPKM > 20) and 82.1% (55/67) of this subset were found to be highly expressed by oligodendrocyte lineage cells (gene names labeled in red in Figures 2B–2D). Importantly, eight of the top ten genes with highest intramodular connectivity (hub genes) in M43 were primarily expressed by mature oligodendrocytes and tightly correlated with other oligodendrocyte-associated M43 genes (Figure 2C). To ensure that DEX genes were not detected due to variability in tissue dissections, we analyzed genes highly enriched in astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang Y. Chen K. Sloan S.A. Bennett M.L. Scholze A.R. O’Keeffe S. Phatnani H.P. Guarnieri P. Caneda C. Ruderisch N. et al.An RNA-sequencing transcriptome and splicing database of glia, neurons, and vascular cells of the cerebral cortex.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 11929-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (2943) Google Scholar; see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We found that intra-individual gene expression for these three cell types was highly correlated in all samples (see Table S8). We further found by pairwise analysis that gene expression levels for markers of all three cell types were highly correlated for the same brain regions in all control (r > 0.94) or DS individuals (r > 0.95), indicating uniform tissue collection procedures. However, in agreement with our DEX analysis, expression of oligodendrocyte-specific genes was less correlated and significantly different between DS and control DFC (r = 0.89, p = 0.018 Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Table S8). We analyzed individual expression trajectories of several genes within the M43 module known to be expressed in oligodendrocytes and involved in myelination. Lower levels of gene expression spanning from birth to adulthood for myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG; Figure 3A) and from mid-fetal development to early childhood for myelin basic protein (MBP; Figure 3B) were observed. To validate the MAG and MBP exon array data, we assayed the expression of these white matter-associated genes and their gene products in the same neocortical samples using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) (Figure 3C) and immunoblotting (Figures 3D–3F). Together, both DEX and WGCNA analyses provide evidence for alterations in neocortical oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in developing DS brains at transcript and protein levels. Given these substantial changes in oligodendrocyte lineage genes and proteins, we sought to confirm previous reports of reduced myelination in the DS forebrain. We imaged tissue sections of the DFC from five pairs of human DS and matched control specimens, ranging in age from 1 to 70 years old, using the spectral confocal reflectance microscopy (SCoRe) technique (Schain et al., 2014Schain A.J. Hill R.A. Grutzendler J. Label-free in vivo imaging of myelinated axons in health and disease with spectral confocal reflectance microscopy.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, we found that the overall density of myelinated fibers is reduced in DS brain across all ages (Figures S6A and S6B). In addition, we found that myelinated axons in control brains form a grid-like lattice that resembles a rectilinear grid, as described previously (Ang et al., 2003Ang Jr., E.S. Haydar T.F. Gluncic V. Rakic P. Four-dimensional migratory coordinates of GABAergic interneurons in the developing mouse cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5805-5815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Wedeen et al., 2012Wedeen V.J.

The geometric structure of the brain fiber pathways.Science. 2012; 335: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar; Figure S6C). However, DS brains did not exhibit evidence of grid-like myelinated fiber orientations, suggesting reduced complexity of fiber pathways in the trisomic human brain. To determine whether the protein- and cellular-level consequences of altered oligodendrocyte/myelination-associated gene expression in DS also are reflected in mouse models, we examined oligodendrocyte lineage progression, myelination, and neuronal conductivity over development in the Ts65Dn mouse brain. This commonly used DS model is trisomic for ∼100 orthologs of the 364 genes on HSA21 and displays many DS-specific phenotypes, including delays in brain development and cognitive defects (Rueda et al., 2012Rueda N. Flórez J. Martínez-Cué C. Mouse models of Down syndrome as a tool to unravel the causes of mental disabilities.Neural Plast. 2012; 2012: 584071Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, changes in white matter have not been previously described in the Ts65Dn mouse brain. By immunoblotting of neocortex tissue samples (n = 10) (Figure 3G) and immunostaining of the anterior cingulate cortex and underlying corpus callosum (n = 9) (Figure 3H), we found a reduction of MAG (Figures 3G and 3H) and MBP (Figures 3I and 3J) protein levels and immunostaining intensity in postnatal day (P)30 Ts65Dn mice. Reduced immunostaining intensity for 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′ phosphodiesterase (CNP), an oligodendrocyte- and myelin-associated protein, also was observed in the P60 neocortex in Ts65Dn brains (Figure S7). Importantly, these cellular and biochemical changes are first detected during the period of myelin development and refinement and are maintained at later ages (e.g., P60). Alterations in white matter-associated proteins measured within the trisomic human and mouse brains indicate possible changes in the amount or allocation of myelin. We tested this hypothesis with ultrastructural and immunofluorescent studies in Ts65Dn and euploid mice at P60. Electron microscopy revealed that axon profiles in the Ts65Dn corpus callosum are on average larger than in controls (Figures 4A and 4B ), and there was a trend for fewer myelinated axons in the body of the Ts65Dn corpus callosum (p = 0.1, n = 6; Figure 4C). Furthermore, when myelinated axons were binned by axon area, we found a significant decrease in the number of small-bore myelinated axons (0–0.5 μm2, p = 0.046; Figure 4D). We also found that myelinated axons in Ts65Dn brains have significantly thinner myelin sheaths (g ratio, p < 0.011; Figures 4E and 4F). Axons were then binned by size to determine whether a correlation exists between axon diameter and myelin sheath thickness. Specifically, small-bore myelinated Ts65Dn axons within 0–0.5 and 0.5–1 μm2 have thinner myelin sheaths than corresponding controls (p = 0.084"
https://openalex.org/W2290288831,"Some autistic individuals exhibit abnormal development of the caudate nucleus and associative cortical areas, suggesting potential dysfunction of cortico-basal ganglia (BG) circuits. Using optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches in mice, we identified a narrow postnatal period that is characterized by extensive glutamatergic synaptogenesis in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and a concomitant increase in corticostriatal circuit activity. SPNs during early development have high intrinsic excitability and respond strongly to cortical afferents despite sparse excitatory inputs. As a result, striatum and corticostriatal connectivity are highly sensitive to acute and chronic changes in cortical activity, suggesting that early imbalances in cortical function alter BG development. Indeed, a mouse model of autism with deletions in Shank3 (Shank3B(-/-)) shows early cortical hyperactivity, which triggers increased SPN excitatory synapse and corticostriatal hyperconnectivity. These results indicate that there is a tight functional coupling between cortex and striatum during early postnatal development and suggest a potential common circuit dysfunction that is caused by cortical hyperactivity."

Fu J.D. Delgado-Olguin P. Vedantham V. Hayashi Y. Bruneau B.G. Srivastava D.

Lineage reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into hepatocytes has been achieved in vitro by ectopic expression of HNF4A plus Foxa1, Foxa2 or Foxa3 or by the combination of Gata4, Hnf1a, and Foxa3 and inactivation of p19(Arf) in culture (Huang et al., 2011Huang P.

Recently, two other groups independently reprogrammed human fibroblasts into hepatocytes by forced ectopic expression of FOXA3, HNF1A, and HNF4A or the combination of HNF1A, HNF4A, and HNF6 together with the maturation factors ATF5, PROX1, and CEBPA (Du et al., 2014Du Y.

The direct conversion of fibroblasts into hepatocyte-like cells in vivo remains to be investigated, and the question needs to be addressed whether such an approach could also ameliorate the degree of fibrosis in damaged livers. Based on previously reported results (Huang et al., 2011Huang P. He Z. Ji S. Sun H. Xiang D. Liu C. Hu Y. Wang X. Hui L.

Direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells by defined factors.Nature. 2011; 475: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), we screened TFs (FOXA1, FOXA2, FOXA3, GATA4, HNF1A, HNF4A, and CEBPA) for direct reprogramming of myofibroblasts derived from primary hepatic stellate cells into hepatocytes. FOXA3, GATA4, HNF1A, and HNF4A transcription factors (4TFs) were selected for further experiments, since the absence of each of these TFs substantially reduced albumin secretion and CYP3A activity in our screening experiments (Figure 1A). To overexpress the selected 4TFs simultaneously, we cloned the cDNAs into a polycistronic lentiviral vector (henceforth referred to as LV.4TF) (Figure 1B). In response to persistent inflammatory injuries large numbers of stellate cells, which have undergone “activation” to pro-fibrogenic myofibroblasts, accumulate in the liver. To harness the potential therapeutic effects of direct reprogramming in chronic liver disease, we first tested whether forced expression of 4TFs would induce a hepatocyte phenotype in cultured myofibroblasts (Figure 1C). The expression of 4TFs in transduced myofibroblasts was confirmed on day 4 by qRT-PCR (Figure S1A). Within 14 days after transduction, we observed profound changes in morphology of the transduced cells now resembling an epithelial phenotype (Figure 1D). To confirm the generation of hepatocytes from myofibroblasts, we transduced cells at day 10 with a reporter lentiviral vector, which expressed dTomato under transcriptional control of the albumin promoter (Figure 1B). Approximately 12% of the cells expressed dTomato, indicating the generation of iHeps (Figures 1E and 1F). We enriched dTomato protein expressing iHeps by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for further characterization (Figures 1G–1K). The iHeps showed expression, albeit at lower levels, of typical primary hepatocyte (Pr. Hc, cultured for 24 hr) markers and the downregulation of fibroblast genes (Figures 1G, 1H, and S1B). Our principal-component analysis (PCA) analyses suggested that although iHeps acquired a hepatic gene expression profile, they remained a distinct cell type when compared to primary hepatocytes cultured for 24 hr. Importantly, iHeps exhibited functional characteristics of hepatocytes as they stored glycogen, showed uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), secreted albumin, and acquired cytochrome P450 (CYP1A2 and 3A) activities (Figures 1I and 1J). Genomic integrity was confirmed by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis (Figure 1K). Thus, ectopic expression of FOXA3, GATA4, HNF1A, and HNF4A converts myofibroblasts into iHeps in vitro. We next examined whether 4TFs expression would facilitate iHep formation in vivo. To investigate 4TFs-mediated lineage reprogramming in vivo, we developed a mouse model to detect iHeps derived from non-parenchymal cells (Figure 2A). We used (Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP) mice (henceforth referred to as mT/mG). All cells including hepatocytes and non-parenchymal liver cells from these mT/mG mice express membrane-targeted tdTomato (mT) before Cre-mediated recombination (Muzumdar et al., 2007Muzumdar M.D. Tasic B. Miyamichi K. Li L. Luo L. A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse.Genesis. 2007; 45: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). To label endogenous hepatocytes, adult mT/mG mice were injected intrasplenically with 4 × 1011 adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 8 particles expressing Cre recombinase under transcriptional control of the liver-specific transthyretin (Ttr) promoter (Malato et al., 2011Malato Y. Naqvi S. Schürmann N. Ng R. Wang B. Zape J. Kay M.A. Grimm D. Willenbring H. Fate tracing of mature hepatocytes in mouse liver homeostasis and regeneration.J. Clin.

MicroRNA-221 regulates FAS-induced fulminant liver failure.Hepatology. 2011; 53: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As a result, membranous EGFP fluorescence in hepatocytes and tdTomato membranous fluorescence in non-parenchymal cells of the liver were expressed four weeks after AAV-Ttr-Cre injection (Figure 2C). Then, we induced myofibroblasts in the liver of AAV-Ttr-Cre-injected mT/mG mice by intraperitoneal injections of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) twice per week for a total of 8 weeks. These mice developed extensive fibrosis (Figure 2D) and accumulated myofibroblasts in the tissue. Notably, in these fibrotic livers, all non-parenchymal cells including myofibroblasts expressed tdTomato, whereas hepatocytes expressed EGFP (Figure 2E). To overexpress 4TFs in myofibroblasts, we designed a p75NTRp- tagged recombinant adenoviral vector (serotype 5), which expressed all 4TFs from a polycistronic transgene cassette. The adenoviral vector was modified to target mouse myofibroblasts through coupling of adenoviral fiber knobs with a peptide (single-chain antibody fragment) of the nerve growth factor (NGFp), which was selected for specific and high-affinity binding to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) present on hepatic stellate cells and myofibroblasts (Reetz et al., 2013Reetz J. Genz B. Meier C. Kowtharapu B.S. Timm F. Vollmar B. Herchenröder O. Abshagen K. Pützer B.M. Development of adenoviral delivery systems to target hepatic stellate cells in vivo.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e67091Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Efficiency of vector targeting was tested in cell culture, as previously published (Reetz et al., 2013Reetz J. Genz B. Meier C. Kowtharapu B.S. Timm F. Vollmar B. Herchenröder O. Abshagen K. Pützer B.M. Development of adenoviral delivery systems to target hepatic stellate cells in vivo.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e67091Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Figure S2A). In vivo targeting of myofibroblasts by Ad.GFP-S11-NGFp was tested by injecting 5 × 109 adenoviral particles via the portal vein of fibrotic wild-type BALB/c mice as shown previously (Reetz et al., 2013Reetz J. Genz B. Meier C. Kowtharapu B.S. Timm F. Vollmar B. Herchenröder O. Abshagen K. Pützer B.M. Development of adenoviral delivery systems to target hepatic stellate cells in vivo.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e67091Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The amount of injected virus particles was sufficient to transduce ∼30% of stellate cells in normal and ∼20% of myofibroblasts in CCl4-induced fibrotic livers of BALB/c mice. Predominantly, myofibroblasts were found to express EGFP in the liver of mice injected with Ad.GFP-S11-NGFp (Figure 2F), whereas control adenovirus vector injected mice showed transduction of hepatocytes (Figure 2G). Co-staining of EGFP with albumin (hepatocyte marker), desmin (myofibroblast marker), cytokeratin (CK) 19 (bile duct and liver stem/progenitor cell marker), F4/80 (Kupffer cell marker), CD31 (endothelial cell marker), and CD45 (hematopoietic cell marker) revealed preferential transduction of myofibroblasts, but not of hepatocytes (except <0.05% rare double-positive cells), Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, bile duct cells, or liver/stem progenitor cells (undetected) (Figure S2B). Therefore, injection of Ad.GFP-S11-NGFp allows preferential targeting of myofibroblasts. Accordingly, one week after cessation of the CCl4 treatment, we injected 5 × 109 p75NTRp-tagged Ad5.FOXA3.GATA4.HNF1A.HNF4A (henceforth referred to as Ad.4TF) via the portal vein of AAV-Ttr-Cre injected fibrotic wild-type BALB/c mice. This led to successful overexpression of 4TFs in sorted myofibroblasts from these mice within 4 days after injection (Figure 2H). Importantly, Ad.4TF administration in normal BALB/c mice neither affected liver function tests nor histology (Figure 2I). After establishing a model that faithfully identifies iHep formation, we examined iHep formation in mT/mG mice injected with AAV-Ttr-Cre followed by CCl4 injections and subsequent administration of Ad.4TF. The control animals were treated exactly in the same manner, except for injection with empty adenoviral vector instead of Ad.4TF. In our lineage-tracing model, the endogenous hepatocytes would express membranous EGFP, while the iHeps could be detected by tdTomato positive membrane fluorescence (Figure 2J). To identify iHeps and distinguish them from endogenous hepatocytes, we stained liver tissues 30 days after Ad.4TF injection for albumin, major urinary protein (MUP), fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), and HNF4A, all characteristic hepatocyte markers in the liver. Immunofluorescence analyses of the liver harvested at 30 days after Ad.4TF injection showed albumin, MUP, FAH, AAT, and HNF4A expression mainly in endogenous hepatocytes with EGFP-positive membranes (Figures 2K and S2C). However, few cells with tdTomato-positive membranes also stained positive for albumin, MUP, FAH, AAT, and HNF4A in the liver of Ad.4TF-injected mice. These tdTomato-positive cells that also stained positive for hepatocyte markers, either in clusters or as single cells, indicate the presence of iHeps. The control animals (n = 10), injected with empty adenoviral vector, did not express albumin, MUP, FAH, and AAT in any of the tdTomato-positive cells. The efficiency of direct reprogramming in vivo was calculated from the average of tdTomato-expressing cells, which stained positive for albumin, MUP, FAH, AAT, and HNF4A relative to the total hepatocyte population (n = 10 mice). The percentage of in-vivo-generated iHeps among the total hepatocyte population ranged from 0.2% to 1.2% in Ad.4TF-injected mice, whereas control mice did not show any reprogrammed cells (Figure 2L). Of note, we did not detect iHeps when Ad.4TF was administered in uninjured mice (data not shown). Since the number of myofibroblasts in fibrotic livers at 1 week after cessation of 8 weeks of CCL4 treatment is between 15.4% and 21.7% of the total number of liver cells (Figure S2D), it can be estimated that 0.2% to 1.2% of iHeps detected in AD.4TF-injected mice is equivalent to a reprogramming efficiency of less than 4%. It is noteworthy to mention that reprogramming efficiency may be even lower than 4% if iHeps proliferate between the time when they appear and 30 days after Ad.4TF administration. Thus, our data indicate that expression of 4TFs in myofibroblasts facilitates the formation of iHeps in chronic liver disease. One of the prerequisites for in-vivo-generated iHeps to be considered as hepatocytes is to possess the functions of mature hepatocytes. To characterize iHeps at the functional level, we isolated iHeps by Percoll density-gradient centrifugation followed by FACS from the liver of Ad.4TF-injected mice (Figures 3A and 3B ). We did not find iHeps in control mice by FACS as well (Figure S2E). We specifically sorted for single-tdTomato-positive cells, because double-positive cells may represent endogenous cells that have not silenced tdTomato completely. The iHeps that were tdTomato positive, cultured for 24 hr, showed albumin secretion and urea synthesis similar to EGFP-positive endogenous hepatocytes (eHeps) (Figures 3C and 3D). The iHeps showed the ability to uptake indocyanine green (ICG); stained positive for oil red O, indicating the presence of triglycerides and lipids; stained positive for PAS, thus demonstrating the ability to store glycogen (Figure 3E); and exhibited cytochrome activity (CYP3A, 1A1, 2C9, and 1A2) similar to eHeps (Figure 3f). Furthermore, we tested whether isolated iHeps are drug inducible. The treatment of iHeps with phenobarbital and rifampicin led to induction of Cyp1a1 (phase 1), Ugt1a1 (phase 2), Abcc2, and Oatp (Figure 3G). Importantly, the in-vivo-generated iHeps showed chromosomes with no obvious numerical or structural aberrations (Figure S2F) and the absence of exogenous 4TFs (Figure S2G), thus indicating the stable reprogramming of myofibroblasts into iHeps. In addition, Ki67 staining indicated that iHeps have the ability to proliferate in response to two-thirds partial hepatectomy in vivo (Figure S2H). Therefore, our thorough characterization suggests that in-vivo-generated iHeps possess functional properties of hepatocytes. To examine whether in vivo reprogramming ameliorates chronic liver disease, we determined the extent of liver fibrosis in CCl4-injected mice. First, qPCR showed lower levels of Col1a1 in the liver of Ad.4TF-injected mice, suggesting less liver fibrosis compared to respective controls (Figure 3H). Second, we performed hydroxyproline assay, which measures the entire collagen content of a liver. The Ad.4TF-injected mice showed significantly reduced levels of hydroxyproline, indicating decreased liver fibrosis (Figure 3I). In addition, histological grading of fibrosis, Sirius red staining, immunohistochemical staining of desmin and p75NTR, as well as serum levels of aminotransferases confirmed decreased liver fibrosis in Ad.4TF-injected mice compared to control mice (Figures 3J–3L). In addition, an 8-month follow-up study of mice injected with Ad.4TF showed normal histology and no signs of liver tumors (Figure 3M). Next, we tested whether injection of Ad.4TF during ongoing liver injury can lead to in vivo iHep formation and a reduction of liver fibrosis (Figure 4A). Indeed, we detected the presence of iHeps and less liver fibrosis in mice injected with Ad.4TF during an ongoing injury (Figures 4B–4E). Hence, our results indicate that 4TFs-induced in vivo reprogramming ameliorates liver fibrosis in mice injected with CCl4 for 8 weeks. CCl4 administration for up to 8 weeks induces a significant amount of liver fibrosis; however, it is still reversible. We therefore examined whether the forced expression of 4TF is capable of ameliorating liver injury in mice injected for 12 weeks with CCl4 resembling an irreversible cirrhosis model (Figure S3A). Although, we detected the presence of iHeps, a beneficial effect on liver fibrosis was not observed in mice injected with Ad.4TF (Figures S3B–S3F). This might be due to the fact that the number of Ad.4TF reprogrammed iHeps in mice injected for 12 weeks with CCl4 remained similar to those in mice injected for 8 weeks, whereas total myofibroblast numbers further increased after prolonged CCl4 administration. This phenomenon can be explained, at least in part, by a modest but similar number of myofibroblasts transduced by Ad.4TF vector in both 8-week and 12-week CCl4 models, but these were most likely outnumbered by the massive increase of fibrotic cells in the 12-week CCl4 model. To further prove the hepatic lineage identity of in vivo iHeps, we performed mRNA microarrays after pooling several livers isolated from different animals and compared them with myofibroblasts, myofibroblast-derived iHeps in vitro, and endogenous hepatocytes (eHeps, serving as positive control) in vivo. In silico analyses, such as hierarchical clustering and PCA, demonstrated that in vivo iHeps are more similar to eHeps than to in vitro iHeps (Figures 5A and 5B ). This suggests that the in vivo hepatic environment further contributes to the maturation of in vivo iHeps. The identity of reprogrammed cells can be faithfully determined by the CellNet platform with very high accuracy (Cahan et al., 2014Cahan P. Li H. Morris S.A. Lummertz da Rocha E. Daley G.Q.

We therefore extracted a list of genes comprising either the liver-typical or fibroblast-typical gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from CellNet and compared our in vivo or in vitro myofibroblast-derived iHeps (Figure 5C). In iHeps derived from myofibroblasts in vitro, 1,281 genes were upregulated by more than 4-fold and 1,576 genes were downregulated by more than 4-fold compared to 24-hr-cultured primary mouse hepatocytes. 22 (of 1,281) upregulated genes and 128 (of 1,576) downregulated genes were in common with the set of genes comprising the CellNet liver GRN. To assess genetic memory of myofibroblasts, we compared in vitro myofibroblast-derived iHeps with fibroblast GRN. Deregulated genes common with the fibroblast GRN included 184 (156 upregulated and 28 downregulated) genes. When in vivo iHeps were compared to in vivo eHeps (endogenous hepatocytes), a total of 426 genes were upregulated by more than 4-fold and 43 were downregulated by more than 4-fold. Only 8 (of 426) upregulated genes and 5 (of 43) downregulated genes were in common with the set of genes comprising the CellNet liver GRN. Deregulated genes common with the fibroblast GRN include 94 (94 upregulated and 0 downregulated) genes. Deregulated genes (>4-fold up or down) in the in vitro iHeps derived from myofibroblasts thus represent 35% of the CellNet listed genes comprising the liver GRN. In contrast to the in-vitro-generated iHeps, the in vivo iHeps show only 3.3% deregulated genes among the genes comprising the liver GRN. From these data, together with our thorough analyses of various liver metabolic functions, we conclude that the in vivo iHeps provide a similar liver GRN with only minor differences in 13 of 421 genes. In addition, we also provide evidence for (limited) genetic memory in a number of (myo)fibroblast GRNs. Although, the AAV-Ttr-Cre-injected mT/mG model in combination with Ad.4TF is an appropriate model to detect iHeps in vivo, we examined the generation of iHeps in a second independent mouse model. To specifically detect myofibroblast-derived iHeps, we used mice expressing Cre under the transcriptional control of the lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (Lrat) promoter, which also contain the mT/mG transgenes (Figure 6A). LratCre-based lineage tracing has been shown to effectively trace myofibroblasts derived from the hepatic stellate cell (HSC) lineage (Mederacke et al., 2013Mederacke I. Hsu C.C. Troeger J.S.

To address this issue, we focally lowered the temperature of distinct cortical regions in awake neurosurgical patients, and we relate this perturbation to changes in produced speech sequences. Using this method, we confirm that speech is highly lateralized, with the vast majority of behavioral effects seen on the left hemisphere. We then use this approach to demonstrate a clear functional dissociation between nearby cortical speech sites. Focal cooling of pars triangularis/pars opercularis (Broca's region) and the ventral portion of the precentral gyrus (speech motor cortex) resulted in the manipulation of speech timing and articulation, respectively.

These results demonstrate that movement-related sensory information is not required to drive spatially informative low-frequency hippocampal oscillations during navigation and suggest a specific function in memory-related spatial updating. A consistent observation across studies of spatial navigation is the presence of low-frequency oscillations in the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) (for a review, see Buzsáki, 2005Buzsáki G.

Multifaceted roles for low-frequency oscillations in bottom-up and top-down processing during navigation and memory.Neuroimage. 2014; 85: 667-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One set of models hypothesizes that these oscillations are related to sensorimotor processing, a position consistent with the observation that low-frequency power is modulated by running speed (McFarland et al., 1975McFarland W.L.

According to these models, low-frequency oscillations are present either because they serve to coordinate sensory input in service of producing the correct motor output (Bland and Oddie, 2001Bland B.H.

A second set of models, which emphasize the mnemonic role of these oscillations, hypothesize that low-frequency oscillations organize the firing of neural ensembles related to encoding and retrieval of memories (Hasselmo et al., 2002Hasselmo M.E.

Although there is evidence that low-frequency power differs as a function of mnemonic success in nonspatial tasks (for a review, see Nyhus and Curran, 2010Nyhus E. Curran T. Functional role of gamma and theta oscillations in episodic memory.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2010; 34: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), little is known about how these oscillations might contribute to memory during navigation. A third idea recently put forth hypothesizes that the hippocampal LFP recorded during navigation contains signals associated with both bottom-up movement-related processing and top-down memory-related processing but that these signals may manifest at different frequencies (Ekstrom and Watrous, 2014Ekstrom A.D.

Sci. 2014; 369: 20130304Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To better understand the conditions that elicit low-frequency hippocampal oscillations during navigation, we directly recorded hippocampal EEG activity from human patients while they navigated a virtual environment containing teleporters. Critically, this manipulation allowed us to test whether low-frequency oscillations are present when sensory feedback has been removed and explicit motor signals are absent. If sensorimotor processing is the primary driver of low-frequency hippocampal oscillations, then they should be disrupted or greatly attenuated during virtual teleportation. In contrast, if this oscillatory signal is important for memory-related spatial coding, then low-frequency oscillations should persist during teleportation. To test our primary hypothesis that hippocampal oscillations are sustained during virtual movement in the absence of visual and self-motion cues (e.g., optic flow, vestibular input, and proprioception), we recorded intracranial hippocampal EEG activity in three human patients undergoing seizure monitoring while they navigated a virtual plus (+) maze (Figure 1). During navigation, patients were instructed to find one of four different stores, each of which was located at the end of one of four different arms of the maze. After finding the target store, participants entered one of two kinds of teleporters (short or long distance), which transported them to the center of the maze. Critically, teleportation allowed patients to experience movement to a known location in space in the absence of any sensory feedback because they remained seated on a hospital bed and viewed a black screen during this time. Inspection of the raw hippocampal traces provided clear evidence that low-frequency oscillations are indeed sustained during teleportation (Figures 2A and 4). To confirm this observation, we quantified the proportion of time that oscillations were present immediately before, during, and immediately after teleportation using PEpisode (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures, available online). Because patients were actively navigating toward the teleporter in the preteleportation (Pre) period (mean speed, 13.7 ± 0.3 U/s) but were moving slowly (patient 2 [P2], mean speed, 3.3 ± 0.2 U/s) or were stationary (patients 1 and 3 [P1&3], mean speed, 0.1 ± 0.03 U/s) during the postteleportation (Post) period when they were reading the cue for the next trial, this analysis allowed us to compare activity during teleportation (Tele) to that during both active and still periods with full visual cues. Consistent with the raw traces, these analyses revealed that low-frequency PEpisode during teleportation was similar to that during active navigation (Figures 2B and S1), an effect present independently in all three patients (Table S2; Figure S2). Low-frequency oscillations on 38/42 electrodes did not significantly change when patients transitioned from navigating to teleporting. Only 4/42 electrodes showed significant decreases in delta-theta (<8 Hz) PEpisode upon entering the teleporter (Pre > Tele, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), a proportion which was not higher than that expected by chance (pcorrected = 0.6). In fact, we tended to observe higher low-frequency PEpisode during teleportation relative to the still period after teleportation (Tele > Post, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; 6/42 electrodes, pcorrected = 0.07), but this effect was only observed in electrodes from one patient (Table S2). Although low-frequency oscillatory activity across the population of electrodes was largely unaffected by entering and exiting the teleporter, higher-frequency oscillations in the gamma band (>30 Hz) were sensitive to this manipulation, exhibiting significantly higher PEpisode upon entering (7/42 electrodes, pcorrected = 0.02) and exiting (8/42 electrodes, pcorrected = 0.002) the teleporter. Thus, these data suggest that low-frequency oscillations were not significantly attenuated by teleportation. As a positive control, we confirmed attenuation of low-frequency oscillations when participants viewed a black screen but did not experience virtual movement. We measured low-frequency oscillations immediately after patients completed the free exploration portion of the experiment and immediately after patients completed the final spatial memory trial. During these time periods, participants viewed a black screen as they did during teleportation, but memory and movement-related processing were minimal. Thus, we would expect reduced low-frequency oscillations during these control periods relative to teleportation and navigation. Consistent with predictions, when patients viewed a black screen but did not experience virtual movement, low-frequency oscillations were significantly attenuated compared to both teleportation (Wilcoxon signed-rank, z = −4.6, pcorrected < < 0.001) and visually guided navigation (z = −4.6, pcorrected < < 0.001) (Figure S2). These findings further support the idea that memory and/or movement-related processing can sustain hippocampal low-frequency oscillations in the absence of visual and self-motion cues. An alternative explanation for the observation that low-frequency oscillations were unaffected by teleportation, however, is that the low-frequency oscillations just prior to entering the teleporter were themselves different from those elicited during normal, uninterrupted navigation. For example, this time period could involve anticipation and predictions about the teleportation event, which could reduce its validity as a comparison condition. To more completely explore whether low-frequency oscillations before, during, and after teleportation differed from those elicited during uninterrupted navigation, we created three epochs of equal duration during the preceding part of the trial when patients were in the correct arm of the maze and actively navigating to the target store (see Figure 1). We then tested whether PEpisode was higher during these epochs than during the matched teleportation epochs. Consistent with the previous results, 0/42 electrodes showed a significant difference in the delta-theta band during the preteleportation period (teleportation epoch 1 versus navigation epoch 1), and only one electrode showed significantly lower PEpisode in this frequency band during teleportation (teleportation epoch 2 versus navigation epoch 2) (Figure 2C), providing further evidence that activity during teleportation was similar to that during visually guided active navigation. A significant proportion of electrodes (10/42, pcorrected < 0.001) did show significantly lower delta-theta PEpisode during the postteleportation epoch (teleportation epoch 3 versus navigation epoch 3), an effect that was also observed in the alpha band (8–12 Hz) (8/42 electrodes, pcorrected = 0.004), and which was present for 2/3 patients (Table S2). Because movement speed was reduced during the postteleportation epoch, this reduced oscillatory activity is consistent with previous work showing lower delta-theta activity during still compared to movement periods in the human hippocampus (Ekstrom et al., 2005Ekstrom A.D. Caplan J.B. Ho E. Shattuck K. Fried I. Kahana M.J. Human hippocampal theta activity during virtual navigation.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, Watrous et al., 2011Watrous A.J. Fried I. Ekstrom A.D. Behavioral correlates of human hippocampal delta and theta oscillations during navigation.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 1747-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, these results are consistent with previous data, suggesting a sense of movement is important for driving hippocampal low-frequency oscillations. When patients received full visual cues but were stationary, low-frequency oscillations were overall less prevalent than during active navigation. In contrast, when patients received no visual cues but “moved” via teleportation, low-frequency oscillations were similar to those elicited during visually guided active navigation. Although we did not observe a decrease in the prevalence of low-frequency oscillations during teleportation, it is still possible that ongoing oscillations attenuated and/or reset when entering the teleporter. To test whether oscillations attenuated after entering the teleporter, we first identified oscillations that crossed the time point of teleporter entry (or an artificially imposed boundary during active navigation; see Figures 1 and 2A). We then tested whether the postentry oscillation duration was reduced in the teleporter relative to a matched uninterrupted navigation epoch. No electrodes (0/35) exhibited significantly attenuated delta-theta oscillation durations during teleportation relative to active navigation (mean duration of navigation oscillations, 528 ± 25 ms; mean duration of teleportation oscillations, 518 ± 15 ms), indicating that the removal of visual information did not disrupt ongoing low-frequency oscillations (Figure 3). To test whether entering the teleporter induced a phase reset, we performed Rayleigh tests for phase consistency at each time point in the first 500 ms after teleporter entry and defined a phase reset event as significant phase consistency at all samples throughout a two-cycle interval at a given frequency (Rizzuto et al., 2003Rizzuto D.S. Madsen J.R. Bromfield E.B. Schulze-Bonhage A. Seelig D. Aschenbrenner-Scheibe R. Kahana M.J. Reset of human neocortical oscillations during a working memory task.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 7931-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Although we observed some evidence of phase reset events at higher frequencies, we did not observe any instances of significant phase reset in the delta-theta frequency band in any electrode (Figure S3). Taken together, these findings suggest that delta-theta oscillations were not interrupted or reset by teleportation. Because the prevalence and duration of delta-theta oscillations did not change as a result of teleportation, one possible explanation is that they carried no navigationally relevant information. An alternative possibility is that they may have carried spatial information that could potentially support spatial updating (Watrous et al., 2011Watrous A.J. Fried I. Ekstrom A.D. Behavioral correlates of human hippocampal delta and theta oscillations during navigation.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 1747-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) during teleportation. To adjudicate between these two possibilities, we tested whether the frequency-wise pattern of low-frequency PEpisode could distinguish between short- and long-distance teleportation events. Because the teleporters were in fixed locations and always transported the patient to the same position on every trial, patients were able to predict the distance they would travel (either short or long; see Figure 1). Importantly, because we randomly varied the duration of the teleportation events (1,830 ms or 2,830 ms), patients could not predict when they would exit the teleporter. This manipulation thus disentangled spatial distance from temporal duration and velocity, ensuring that knowledge about spatial distance did not derive from time in the teleporter or perceived velocity. We extracted trial-wise PEpisode values at each frequency in the delta-theta band during short- and long-distance teleportation epochs (Figure 4, left and center panels) and submitted these values to binary classification with a linear support vector machine (Figure 4, right panels). We found that the pattern of low-frequency PEpisode provided significant classification of distance teleported in far more electrodes than would be expected by chance (data for short-duration trials model are as follows: 11/23 electrodes, pcorrected < 0.001; data for long-duration trials model are as follows: 9/23 electrodes, pcorrected < 0.001; data for all trials model are as follows: 8/23 electrodes, pcorrected < 0.001) and in each individual patient (Table S2). This ability to classify distance was likely due to overall higher PEpisode during long relative to short-distance events (data for long distance are as follows: 16.2% ± 1.2%; data for short distance are as follows: 14.8% ± 1.1%), an effect that was present across the group of electrodes exhibiting significant classification (Wilcox signed-rank test, z = 2.6, pcorrected = 0.006), as well as the entire population of electrodes (z = 4.3, pcorrected < < 0.001). Thus, even though patients were looking at a blank screen during teleportation and therefore received no visual or idiothetic cues about their virtual movement, hippocampal low-frequency oscillatory activity reliably varied according to the distance teleported. Because the classifier was trained to generalize over multiple starting positions (i.e., two short-distance and two long-distance teleporters) and because we randomly varied the temporal duration of the teleportation events (1,830 ms versus 2,830 ms), these decoding results cannot be explained by representations of teleporter position, time spent in the teleporter, or perceived velocity. Instead, our results suggest that higher prevalence of low-frequency oscillations during the long- versus short-distance teleportation events may have related to the updating of position during teleportation. To explore in more detail the idea that patients remained spatially oriented during teleportation and successfully updated their position, we analyzed patients’ behavior immediately upon exiting the teleporter. Specifically, we tested whether patients turned the optimal direction to face the next target store upon exiting the teleporter (i.e., a 90° turn rather than 270° turn), which would be consistent with the idea that they remained oriented upon exiting the teleporter. Note that there were no external cues to indicate the optimal turn direction; only the patients’ knowledge about their current position and orientation could support this behavior. For this analysis, we excluded trials for which the target landmark was straight ahead (1/3 of trials) and “error” trials in which the patient first went down an incorrect arm of the maze, indicating a cue-landmark association retrieval error (percent of “error” trials was as follows: P1, 34%; P2 session 1, 11%; P2 session 2, 0%; P3 session 1, 2%; P3 session 2, 0%). All patients turned the optimal direction more often than the suboptimal direction (overall selection of correct turn direction across patients was as follows: 75%; P1, 59%; P2 session 1, 73%; P2 session 2, 70%; P3 session 1, 80%; P3 session 2, 91%), consistent with the idea that patients correctly maintained their expected position and orientation during teleportation. The principal finding of this study is that low-frequency hippocampal oscillations elicited during navigation are sustained when humans experience virtual movement to a known location in space in the absence of visual and idiothetic cues. Furthermore, the low-frequency oscillations elicited under these conditions carried meaningful spatial information, as demonstrated by our ability to decode the distance traveled. These results therefore demonstrate that movement-related sensory information is not required to drive spatially informative low-frequency oscillations in the human hippocampus during navigation. Overall, our findings support the idea that low-frequency oscillations in humans do not require sensory input during navigation and still carry important memory-related signals in the absence of visual or idiothetic cues. Our first main result is that low-frequency hippocampal oscillations are sustained during virtual movement even when sensory feedback is not available. Previous studies in rodents have measured navigation-elicited oscillations when some, but not all, forms of sensory feedback are eliminated and have largely implicated proprioceptive cues in driving these low-frequency oscillations. Hippocampal oscillations are present when rodents navigate in total darkness (Gavrilov et al., 1996Gavrilov V.V. Wiener S.I. Berthoz A. Whole-body rotations enhance hippocampal theta rhythmic slow activity in awake rats passively transported on a mobile robot.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1996; 781: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, Chen et al., 2011Chen C.Y. Yang C.C. Lin Y.Y. Kuo T.B. Locomotion-induced hippocampal theta is independent of visual information in rats during movement through a pipe.Behav. Brain Res. 2011; 216: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or when they navigate in a head-fixed recording device (thereby eliminating vestibular cues) (Chen et al., 2013Chen G. King J.A. Burgess N. O’Keefe J. How vision and movement combine in the hippocampal place code.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) but are significantly reduced when animals are wrapped in a towel and passively moved through space (Foster et al., 1989Foster T.C.

How vision and movement combine in the hippocampal place code.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although these proprioceptive cues seem to be important for driving oscillations in the rodent hippocampus, the same cannot be true for humans, as low-frequency hippocampal oscillations have been observed in multiple virtual navigation paradigms (Ekstrom et al., 2005Ekstrom A.D. Caplan J.B. Ho E. Shattuck K. Fried I. Kahana M.J. Human hippocampal theta activity during virtual navigation.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, Watrous et al., 2011Watrous A.J. Fried I. Ekstrom A.D. Behavioral correlates of human hippocampal delta and theta oscillations during navigation.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 1747-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), none of which involve meaningful proprioceptive or vestibular feedback because the patient is confined to his or her hospital bed. Thus, in these tasks patients primarily use visual cues to navigate and build spatial representations. Although the available set of cues during virtual navigation is impoverished compared to real-world navigation (Taube et al., 2013Taube J.S. Valerio S. Yoder R.M. Is navigation in virtual reality with FMRI really navigation?.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2013; 25: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it is perhaps not surprising that visual cues can drive human hippocampal oscillations because such cues are critically important for successful human navigation, whereas they seem to be less important for rodent navigation (Ekstrom, 2015Ekstrom A.D. Why vision is important to how we navigate.Hippocampus. 2015; 25: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here, we show for the first time that even when these visual cues are removed, low-frequency hippocampal oscillations persist when humans experience virtual movement through space. This strongly suggests that, at least in humans, internally generated spatial memory representations are sufficient to drive this oscillatory activity and that sensorimotor processing is not required. This result is broadly consistent with theories that implicate hippocampal oscillations in the encoding and retrieval of spatial and nonspatial information in memory (Hasselmo et al., 2002Hasselmo M.E. Bodelón C. Wyble B.P. A proposed function for hippocampal theta rhythm: separate phases of encoding and retrieval enhance reversal of prior learning.Neural Comput. 2002; 14: 793-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, Buzsáki, 2006Buzsáki G. Rhythms of the Brain. Oxford University Press, 2006Crossref Scopus (3343) Google Scholar) and with recent work in rodents indicating that internally generated memory processing can drive sequential firing within an ensemble of neurons even when sensory cues are held relatively constant (Wang et al., 2015Wang Y. Romani S. Lustig B. Leonardo A. Pastalkova E. Theta sequences are essential for internally generated hippocampal firing fields.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Our second main result confirms that spatial representations, in some form, are indeed elicited when patients experience virtual teleportation: the pattern of low-frequency hippocampal oscillations present during teleportation was sufficient to distinguish short- and long-distance teleportation events, and these oscillations were significantly attenuated when patients viewed a blank screen with no task-related memory demands. Previous efforts to identify spatial codes in the human hippocampus have largely focused on the activity of single neurons and have revealed representations of position, direction, and other spatial variables (Ekstrom et al., 2003Ekstrom A.D. Kahana M.J. Caplan J.B. Fields T.A. Isham E.A. Newman E.L. Fried I. Cellular networks underlying human spatial navigation.Nature. 2003; 425: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, Jacobs et al., 2010Jacobs J. Kahana M.J. Ekstrom A.D. Mollison M.V.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In contrast, past studies of hippocampal LFPs, which represent the summation of the activity of thousands of neurons, have struggled to identify a clear behavioral correlate of low-frequency oscillations during navigation (Buzsáki, 2005Buzsáki G. Theta rhythm of navigation: link between path integration and landmark navigation, episodic and semantic memory.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that rodent hippocampal LFPs contain information sufficient to decode spatial position (Agarwal et al., 2014Agarwal G. Stevenson I.H. Berényi A. Mizuseki K. Buzsáki G. Sommer F.T. Spatially distributed local fields in the hippocampus encode rat position.Science. 2014; 344: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and human hippocampal LFPs can distinguish between the retrieval of spatial and temporal information (Watrous et al., 2013Watrous A.J. Tandon N. Conner C.R. Pieters T. Ekstrom A.D. Frequency-specific network connectivity increases underlie accurate spatiotemporal memory retrieval.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In contrast to this previous work, which has leveraged the spatial distribution of LFP activity using either multielectrode recordings (Agarwal et al., 2014Agarwal G. Stevenson I.H. Berényi A. Mizuseki K. Buzsáki G. Sommer F.T. Spatially distributed local fields in the hippocampus encode rat position.Science. 2014; 344: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or the coherence in LFP activity between multiple recording sites (Watrous et al., 2013Watrous A.J. Tandon N. Conner C.R. Pieters T. Ekstrom A.D. Frequency-specific network connectivity increases underlie accurate spatiotemporal memory retrieval.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), here we show that the pattern of oscillatory activity recorded at a single macroelectrode can distinguish between short and long distances. What kind of neural code could give rise to the distance decoding we observed? Though there is to date little evidence in humans for an oscillatory neural code in the “strong” sense (e.g., modulation of neural firing via ephaptic coupling), previous work using stimulation paradigms that artificially impose oscillations suggests that they may indeed contribute to neural representations (Polanía et al., 2012Polanía R. Nitsche M.A. Korman C. Batsikadze G. Paulus W. The importance of timing in segregated theta phase-coupling for cognitive performance.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 1314-1318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, Wimber et al., 2012Wimber M. Maaß A. Staudigl T. Richardson-Klavehn A. Hanslmayr S. Rapid memory reactivation revealed by oscillatory entrainment.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 1482-1486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We speculate that the ability of these low-frequency oscillations to distinguish between short and long distances may reflect differences in the degree of spatial updating required, with more spatial updating inducing more persistent oscillations. This explanation is consistent with our behavioral analysis of patient turn preference upon exiting the teleporter, which showed that patients remained spatially oriented after teleportation. We do not believe that the distance decoding can be explained by other variables (e.g., duration, velocity) that are often highly correlated with distance in real-world environments because we specifically designed the virtual environment and experimental paradigm to disentangle these variables. Although more work will be needed to determine the precise neural codes supported by low-frequency hippocampal oscillations during navigation, the 3-fold decrease in low-frequency oscillations when patients viewed a black screen with no task-related memory demands strongly links the prevalence of these oscillations to cognitive processing in support of memory during navigation. In sum, we have shown that human hippocampal low-frequency oscillations elicited during navigation can be sustained when visual and idiothetic cues are removed and the only available spatial information is internally generated from memory. We have further shown that the frequency-wise pattern of these oscillations was sufficient to decode the distance traveled under these conditions. Thus, these results expand our understanding of the conditions necessary to generate low-frequency hippocampal oscillations in humans and highlight the need for future research that characterizes the precise types of information coded by this oscillatory activity.

https://openalex.org/W2291138244,"Objectives To investigate the teaching of antimicrobial stewardship (AS) in undergraduate healthcare educational degree programmes in the United Kingdom (UK). Participants and Methods Cross-sectional survey of undergraduate programmes in human and veterinary medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and nursing in the UK. The main outcome measures included prevalence of AS teaching; stewardship principles taught; estimated hours apportioned; mode of content delivery and teaching strategies; evaluation methodologies; and frequency of multidisciplinary learning. Results 80% (112/140) of programmes responded adequately. The majority of programmes teach AS principles (88/109, 80.7%). ‘Adopting necessary infection prevention and control precautions’ was the most frequently taught principle (83/88, 94.3%), followed by 'timely collection of microbiological samples for microscopy, culture and sensitivity’ (73/88, 82.9%) and ‘minimisation of unnecessary antimicrobial prescribing’ (72/88, 81.8%). The ‘use of intravenous administration only to patients who are severely ill, or unable to tolerate oral treatment’ was reported in ~50% of courses. Only 32/88 (36.3%) programmes included all recommended principles. Discussion Antimicrobial stewardship principles are included in most undergraduate healthcare and veterinary degree programmes in the UK. However, future professionals responsible for using antimicrobials receive disparate education. Education may be boosted by standardisation and strengthening of less frequently discussed principles."

https://openalex.org/W2285746460,"Numerous studies have shown that neuronal responses are modulated by stimulus properties, and also by the state of the local network. However, little is known about how activity fluctuations of neuronal populations modulate the sensory tuning of cells and affect their encoded information. We found that fluctuations in ongoing and stimulus-evoked population activity in primate visual cortex modulate the tuning of neurons in a multiplicative and additive manner. While distributed on a continuum, neurons with stronger multiplicative effects tended to have less additive modulation, and vice versa. The information encoded by multiplicatively-modulated neurons increased with greater population activity, while that of additively-modulated neurons decreased. These effects offset each other, so that population activity had little effect on total information. Our results thus suggest that intrinsic activity fluctuations may act as a ""traffic light"" that determines which subset of neurons are most informative."

In this study, 16S rRNA analysis of total metagenomic DNA from the water column of Lough Neagh has revealed a high proportion of Cyanobacteria and low levels of Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. The planktonic virome of Lough Neagh has been sequenced and 2,298,791 2×300 bp Illumina reads analysed. Comparison with previously characterised lakes demonstrates that the Lough Neagh viral community has the highest level of sequence diversity. Only about 15% of reads had homologs in the RefSeq database and tailed bacteriophages (Caudovirales) were identified as a major grouping. Within the Caudovirales, the Podoviridae and Siphoviridae were the two most dominant families (34.3% and 32.8% of the reads with sequence homology to the RefSeq database), while ssDNA bacteriophages constituted less than 1% of the virome. Putative cyanophages were found to be abundant. 66,450 viral contigs were assembled with the largest one being 58,805 bp; its existence, and that of another 34,467 bp contig, in the water column was confirmed. Analysis of the contigs confirmed the high abundance of cyanophages in the water column."
https://openalex.org/W2279872549,"Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels adopt different gating modes to fine-tune signaling at central synapses. At glutamatergic synapses, high and low activity of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) is observed when pore-forming subunits coassemble with or without auxiliary subunits, respectively. Whether a common structural pathway accounts for these different gating modes is unclear. Here, we identify two structural motifs that determine the time course of AMPAR channel activation. A network of electrostatic interactions at the apex of the AMPAR ligand-binding domain (LBD) is essential for gating by pore-forming subunits, whereas a conserved motif on the lower, D2 lobe of the LBD prolongs channel activity when auxiliary subunits are present. Accordingly, channel activity is almost entirely abolished by elimination of the electrostatic network but restored via auxiliary protein interactions at the D2 lobe. In summary, we propose that activation of native AMPAR complexes is coordinated by distinct structural pathways, favored by the association/dissociation of auxiliary subunits."

Dividing cells rely on the “conditionally essential” amino acid glutamine (Q) as an anaplerotic carbon source for TCA cycle intermediates and as a nitrogen source for nucleotide biosynthesis. We previously reported that while non-transformed cells arrest in the latter portion of G1 upon Q deprivation, mutant KRas-driven cancer cells bypass the G1 checkpoint, and instead, arrest in S-phase. In this study, we report that the arrest of KRas-driven cancer cells in S-phase upon Q deprivation is due to the lack of deoxynucleotides needed for DNA synthesis. The lack of deoxynucleotides causes replicative stress leading to activation of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)-mediated DNA damage pathway, which arrests cells in S-phase. The key metabolite generated from Q utilization was aspartate, which is generated from a transaminase reaction whereby Q-derived glutamate is converted to α-ketoglutarate with the concomitant conversion of oxaloacetate to aspartate. Aspartate is a critical metabolite for both purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. This study identifies the molecular basis for the S-phase arrest caused by Q deprivation in KRas-driven cancer cells that arrest in S-phase in response to Q deprivation.

Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42748) Google Scholar). Cancer cells are highly dependent on aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect (2.Vander Heiden M.G. Cantley L.C. Thompson C.B.

To meet the higher nutrient requirements of proliferation cancer cells rely on glutamine (Q) 2The abbreviations used are: Qglutamineα-KGα-ketoglutarateAOAaminooxyacetateATMataxia telangiectasia-mutatedATRataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-relatedCMcomplete mediumdNSsdeoxynucleosidesGOTglutamate oxaloacetate transaminasePPATphosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferaseTdRthymine deoxyribose. as a carbon and nitrogen source to support cell growth and promote survival (3.DeBerardinis R.J.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19345-19350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). Q, which is considered as “conditionally essential” amino acid, is the most significant amino acid for providing carbon for TCA cycle intermediates as well as nitrogen for nucleotide and non-essential amino acid synthesis (4.Wise D.R. Thompson C.B. Glutamine addiction: a new therapeutic target in cancer.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Q donates its amide nitrogen directly into the purine and pyrimidine ring structures during nucleotide biosynthesis and is converted into glutamate (5.Zhang J. Fan J. Venneti S. Cross J.R. Takagi T.

Glutamate further undergoes a transamination reaction with oxaloacetate catalyzed by glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) yielding α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), which can enter into the TCA cycle, and aspartate, which is a key intermediate for both purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. glutamine α-ketoglutarate aminooxyacetate ataxia telangiectasia-mutated ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related complete medium deoxynucleosides glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase thymine deoxyribose.

Cells have checkpoints late in G1 that check for sufficient nutrients prior to committing to replicating the genome and dividing into two cells (6.Foster D.A. Yellen P. Xu L. Saqcena M.

Amino acids and mTOR mediate distinct metabolic checkpoints in mammalian G1 cell cycle.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e74157Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition to nutrient sensing checkpoints, there are also checkpoints that monitor genomic integrity and DNA damage. When the DNA is damaged, the cell cycle is halted at late G1, S-phase and prior to cytokinesis (10.Goodarzi A.A. Block W.D. Lees-Miller S.P. The role of ATM and ATR in DNA damage-induced cell cycle control.Prog Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 393-411PubMed Google Scholar). The S-phase checkpoints are mediated by two protein kinases: ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) (11.Gaillard H. García-Muse T. Aguilera A. Replication stress and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The outcome of activating these pathways is either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. We have recently distinguished a series of late G1 nutrient sensing checkpoints that are distinct from the mid-G1 growth factor-dependent restriction point (9.Saqcena M. Menon D. Patel D. Mukhopadhyay S. Chow V. Foster D.A. Amino acids and mTOR mediate distinct metabolic checkpoints in mammalian G1 cell cycle.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e74157Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One of the nutrient-sensing checkpoints is for Q (9.Saqcena M. Menon D. Patel D. Mukhopadhyay S. Chow V. Foster D.A. Amino acids and mTOR mediate distinct metabolic checkpoints in mammalian G1 cell cycle.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e74157Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Significantly, KRas-driven cancer cells deprived of Q override the G1 checkpoint and instead arrest in S-phase (9.Saqcena M. Menon D. Patel D. Mukhopadhyay S. Chow V. Foster D.A.

This finding has important therapeutic implications for KRas-driven cancers because cells in S-phase can be selectively killed by chemotherapeutic agents such as capecitabine and rapamycin (9.Saqcena M.

In this study, we have investigated the mechanism for the S-phase arrest observed in KRas-driven cancer calls in response to Q deprivation. We report here that the S-phase arrest in response to Q deprivation is due to a lack of aspartate generated by the transamination reaction between glutamate and oxaloacetate. The lack of aspartate impairs nucleotide biosynthesis and the shortage of nucleotides generates single-stranded DNA that activates the ATR DNA damage pathway and arrests cells in S-phase. The human cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, Calu-1, and BJ-hTERT cells were obtained from the American Tissue Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma D6429) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma F4135). Reagents were obtained from the following sources: Antibodies against, phospho-Chk1 (Ser-345) (2348), phospho-Chk-2 (Thr-68) (2197), Chk-1 (2360), Chk-2 (2662), and actin (8457) were obtained from Cell Signaling; Antibody against PPAT (HPA036092) was obtained from Atlas Antibodies; anti-mouse and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Promega.

MK-8776 (sc364611) was obtained from Santa-Cruz Biotechnology. Negative control scrambled siRNA (d-001206-13-05), siRNAs targeted against Chk-1(M-003255-04-0005), and siRNAs targeted against phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT) (M-006003-01–0005) was obtained from Dharmacon. dNSs (ES-008-D) were purchased from EMD Millipore. Ultima Gold scintillation fluid (6013681) and [3H]thymidine deoxyribose (TdR) (20 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml) (NET-027E) were obtained from PerkinElmer. Cells were plated in 6-well plates in medium containing 10% FBS. The next day, transfections with siRNAs (100 nm) in Lipofectamine RNAiMAX were performed. After 6 h, reagents were replaced with fresh 10% FBS, and cells were allowed to incubate for indicated times as explained in the experiments. Cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry as described previously (9.Saqcena M. Menon D. Patel D. Mukhopadhyay S. Chow V. Foster D.A.

Briefly, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, stained using propidium iodide, and passed through 70-μm meshes to remove cell aggregates. Fluorescence intensity corresponding to DNA content in different phase of cell cycle was measured by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson), and analyzed using WinCycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems). Each experiment was performed in duplicate and two-way ANOVA tests were performed in all statistical analyses. p values for the S-phase population in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and BJ-hTERT and Calu-1 cells, across the samples are expressed relative to control Q. Raw data for flow cytometry experiments are provided as supplemental figures. Proteins were extracted from cultured cells in M-PER (Thermo Scientific 78501). Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on polyacrylamide separating gels. Electrophoresed proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After transfer, membranes were blocked in an isotonic solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies as described in the text. The dilutions were used per vendors instructions. Depending on the origin of the primary antibody, either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated IgG was used for detection using ECL system (Thermo Scientific 34080). Cells were labeled with 1μCi/ml [3H]thymine deoxyribose (TdR). At indicated times, cells were washed twice with 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline, and then precipitated twice with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.5% SDS/0.5 M NaOH solution, and the extent of TdR incorporation was quantified using 75 μl of sample and 3 ml of scintillation fluid. Each experiment was performed in duplicate, and one-way ANOVA tests were performed in all statistical analyses. Since Q provides nitrogen for purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis (14.Wasa M. Bode B.P. Abcouwer S.F. Collins C.L. Tanabe K.K. Souba W.W. Glutamine as a regulator of DNA and protein biosynthesis in human solid tumor cell lines.Ann.

To test this hypothesis, we subjected KRas-driven MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, non-KRas-driven MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and non-cancerous BJ-hTERT fibroblasts to Q deprivation for 48 h. As observed previously (9.Saqcena M. Menon D. Patel D. Mukhopadhyay S. Chow V. Foster D.A.

Apoptotic effects of high-dose rapamycin occur in S-phase of the cell cycle.Cell Cycle. 2015; 14: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the MDA-MB-231 cells arrested in S-phase, whereas the MCF7 and BJ-hTERT cells arrested in G1-phase upon Q deprivation (Fig. 1A). After 48 h of Q deprivation, a mixture of deoxynucleosides was added exogenously, and cell cycle progression was monitored by flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Fig, 1A, we were able to reverse the S-phase cell cycle arrest caused by Q deprivation with the addition of nucleosides to the MDA-MB-231 cells. The deoxynucleoside mixture had no effect on the G1-arrested MCF7 and BJ-hTERT cells (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that the S-phase arrest of the KRas-driven MDA-MB-231 cells induced by Q deprivation was due to the depletion of deoxynucleotides needed for DNA synthesis. We next examined whether the deoxynucleosides promoted cell proliferation in the MDA-MB-231 cells deprived of Q. As shown in Fig. 1B, addition of deoxynucleosides promoted cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231, but not in MCF7 or BJ-hTERT cells, which were arrested in G1 upon glutamine starvation. This finding demonstrates that providing deoxynucleosides not only allows progression through S-phase, but allows cells to undergo mitosis as well. The lack of an effect on the MCF7 and BJ-hTERT cells suggests that the Q requirement for nucleotide biosynthesis is restricted to S-phase arrest only. To further establish that the deoxynucleosides were restoring DNA synthesis we examined the impact of deoxynucleosides on DNA synthesis as indicated by the incorporation of [3H]thymine deoxyribose (TdR). KRas-driven MDA-MB-231 breast and Calu-1 lung cancer cells along with the non-KRas-driven MCF7 breast cancer cells and the BJ-hTERT cells were subjected to Q deprivation for 48 h and then treated with the deoxynucleoside mix for 24 h as indicated. [3H]TdR was added for the last 2 h at which time, the cells were harvested, and the level of [3H]TdR incorporation was determined. As shown in Fig. 1C, Q deprivation resulted in the suppression of 80% of the [3H]TdR incorporation in all cell lines. When deoxynucleosides were provided, [3H]TdR incorporation was restored in the S-phase arrested MDA-MB-231 and Calu-1 cells, but not in the G1-arrested MCF-7 and BJ-hTERT cells. These data demonstrate that DNA synthesis was restored by the presence of deoxynucleosides in Q-deprived KRas-driven cancer cells. We previously reported that we could mimic Q-deprivation with the transaminase inhibitor AOA (12.Saqcena M. Mukhopadhyay S. Hosny C. Alhamed A. Chatterjee A. Foster D.A. Blocking anaplerotic entry of glutamine into the TCA cycle sensitizes K-Ras mutant cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which blocks the conversion of Q-derived glutamate to α-KG in KRas-driven cancer cells (16.Son J. Lyssiotis C.A. Ying H. Wang X. Hua S. Ligorio M. Perera R.M. Ferrone C.R. Mullarky E. Shyh-Chang N. Kang Y. Fleming J.B. Bardeesy N. Asara J.M. Haigis M.C. DePinho R.A. Cantley L.C. Kimmelman A.C. Glutamine supports pancreatic cancer growth through a KRAS-regulated metabolic pathway.Nature. 2013; 496: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Importantly, the conversion of glutamate to α-KG is coupled with the conversion of oxaloacetate to aspartate by the enzyme GOT. Thus, inhibition of GOT with AOA suppresses the production of both α-KG and aspartate. KRas-driven MDA-MB-231 and Calu-1 cells were treated with AOA for 48 h and as reported previously (12.Saqcena M. Mukhopadhyay S. Hosny C. Alhamed A. Chatterjee A. Foster D.A. Blocking anaplerotic entry of glutamine into the TCA cycle sensitizes K-Ras mutant cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13.Saqcena M. Patel D. Menon D. Mukhopadhyay S. Foster D.A. Apoptotic effects of high-dose rapamycin occur in S-phase of the cell cycle.Cell Cycle. 2015; 14: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the cells arrested in the S- and G2-phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 2B). As was observed with Q deprivation in Fig. 1a, the S-phase arrest induced by AOA could be reversed with deoxynucleosides (Fig. 2A). Thus, the S-phase arrest in KRas-driven cancer cells induced by inhibiting Q utilization with AOA can be reversed by providing deoxynucleosides. Of significance, aspartate is a critical metabolite in the synthesis of both purines and pyrimidines. We therefore examined whether the AOA-induced S-phase arrest could be reversed by providing cell permeable analogs of α-KG and/or aspartate, the products of GOT. As shown in Fig. 2B, aspartate especially reversed AOA-induced suppression of [3H]TdR in MDA-MB-231 and Calu-1 cells, whereas α-KG had very little effect. In contrast, both aspartate and α-KG could reverse the suppression of [3H]TdR incorporation in MCF7 cells. Similar results were obtained using flow cytometry where aspartate could reverse the S-phase arrest seen in the KRas-driven cancer cells, whereas both α-KG and aspartate could only partially reverse the G1 arrest seen in MCF7 cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, it appears that suppression of aspartate production by the transaminase reaction catalyzed by GOT is a key factor for inducing S-phase arrest in response to Q deprivation. Since aspartate is a metabolite in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, deprivation of aspartate could reduce the pool of nucleotides needed for DNA synthesis and cause S-phase arrest. The data in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 suggest that the S-phase arrest observed in the absence of Q is due the lack of Q-derived precursors for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis. We therefore investigated whether suppressing de novo purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways would, like Q deprivation, also lead to S-phase arrest in KRas-driven cancer cells. A rate-limiting step in the de novo biosynthetic pathway for purine nucleotides is conversion of 5-phosphoribosyl-α-pyrophosphate and Q into glutamate and β-5-phosphoribosylamine, which is catalyzed by phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT). Thus, knockdown of PPAT should block the utilization of Q for purine nucleotide biosynthesis and mimic Q deprivation. We therefore used siRNA targeted against PPAT to suppress its expression in the KRas-driven cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and Calu-1. As shown in Fig. 3A, complete knockdown of PPAT was observed after 72 h treatment with the siRNA. At this point MDA-MB-231, Calu-1, and MCF7 cells showed increased S-phase cell populations (Fig. 3B). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Q deprivation disrupts nucleotide biosynthesis and leads to S-phase arrest. During DNA replication, cells are on high alert for DNA abnormalities such as strand breaks or base modifications that interfere with replicating the genome. Throughout this process, if anything is wrong, checkpoints mediated by DNA damage are activated, and cell cycle progression stops (17.Abraham R.T. Cell cycle checkpoint signaling through the ATM and ATR kinases.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar, 18.Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Essential and dispensable roles of ATR in cell cycle arrest and genome maintenance.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We postulated that since Q-deprived KRas mutant cells lack sufficient nucleotides to replicate the genome, stretches of single-stranded DNA would be generated from unreplicated DNA caused by the lack of deoxynucleotides. Single-stranded DNA stimulates the ATR pathway whereas double strand breaks caused by ionizing radiation stimulate the ATM pathway. In response to unreplicated single-stranded DNA, ATR phosphorylates checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1); and in response double strand breaks, ATM phosphorylates Chk2 (19.Reinhardt H.C. Yaffe M.B. Kinases that control the cell cycle in response to DNA damage: Chk1, Chk2, and MK2.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the impact of Q deprivation on the phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2 in cells harboring KRas mutations and those without KRas mutations. As shown in Fig. 4A, both Q deprivation and AOA stimulated a robust increase in Chk1, but not Chk2 phosphorylation in the KRas-driven MDA-MB-231 and Calu-1 cells. Neither Q deprivation nor AOA was able to induce Chk1 phosphorylation in the MCF7 or BJ-hTERT cells that are arrested in G1 by the treatments (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that in K-Ras mutant cells, glutamine starvation leads to replication stress due to insufficient precursors for deoxynucleotide synthesis, which in turn causes stretches of single-stranded DNA that activates the ATR-mediated DNA damage pathway and causes S-phase arrest. The stimulation of Chk1 phosphorylation by Q deprivation could be overcome with the addition of deoxynucleosides (Fig. 4B). These data implicate the ATR-mediated DNA damage pathway in the S-phase arrest that occurs in KRas-driven cancer cells deprived of Q. To further establish that the S-phase arrest observed in KRas-driven cancer cells upon Q deprivation was dependent of the ATR-Chk1 stress response pathway, we investigated whether suppression of Chk1 phosphorylation of Chk1 expression could reverse the S-phase arrest seen with Q deprivation. We first examined the effect of the ATR kinase inhibitor MK-8776 (20.Dai Y. Chen S. Kmieciak M. Zhou L. Lin H. Pei X.Y. Grant S. The novel Chk1 inhibitor MK-8776 sensitizes human leukemia cells to HDAC inhibitors by targeting the intra-S checkpoint and DNA replication and repair.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2013; 12: 878-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and as shown in Fig. 4C, this compound suppressed the phosphorylation of Chk1 induced by Q deprivation and reduced the S-phase population of both MDA-MB-231 and Calu-1 cells. The treatment with this compound for 48 h did not result in significant cell death (data not shown). We also examined the impact of suppressing Chk1 expression with siRNA. As shown in Fig. 4D, suppressed Chk1 expression also reduced the population of cells with S-phase DNA content in both the MDA-MB-231 and Calu-1 cells when deprived of Q. These data further demonstrate that the S-phase arrest in KRas-driven cancer cells observed with Q deprivation is dependent on the ATR-Chk1 stress pathway. We previously reported that KRas-driven cancers bypass a distinct Q-dependent late G1 checkpoint and arrest in S-phase in response to Q deprivation (9.Saqcena M. Menon D. Patel D. Mukhopadhyay S. Chow V. Foster D.A. Amino acids and mTOR mediate distinct metabolic checkpoints in mammalian G1 cell cycle.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e74157Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Significantly, the cells arrested in S-phase are selectively killed by rapamycin (13.Saqcena M. Patel D. Menon D. Mukhopadhyay S. Foster D.A. Apoptotic effects of high-dose rapamycin occur in S-phase of the cell cycle.Cell Cycle. 2015; 14: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and other cytotoxic agents (12.Saqcena M. Mukhopadhyay S. Hosny C. Alhamed A. Chatterjee A. Foster D.A. Blocking anaplerotic entry of glutamine into the TCA cycle sensitizes K-Ras mutant cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the observation that KRas-driven cancer cells arrest in S-phase in response to Q deprivation has important clinical implications, in that KRas itself has been considered undruggable (21.Cox A.D. Fesik S.W. Kimmelman A.C. Luo J. Der C.J. Drugging the undruggable RAS: Mission possible?.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2014; 13: 828-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified the mechanism for S-phase arrest observed with Q deprivation. The lack of Q led to reduced levels of precursors needed for nucleotide biosynthesis, which induced replicative stress leading to an ATR and Chk1-mediated S-phase arrest. The ATR/Chk1 stress response pathway responds to stretches of single-stranded DNA caused by insufficient deoxynucleotides. Q, a conditionally essential amino acid, serves a critical anaplerotic agent that feeds the TCA cycle when citrate is shuttled out of the mitochondria for generating cytosolic acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis in dividing cells. Q can be deamidated to glutamate and then deaminated to generate the TCA cycle intermediate α-KG, which is just downstream from citrate in the TCA cycle (Fig. 5). However, in KRas-driven cancer cells, the conversion of glutamate to α-KG is accompanied by the conversion of oxaloacetate to aspartate in the transamination reaction catalyzed by GOT2 (12.Saqcena M. Mukhopadhyay S. Hosny C. Alhamed A. Chatterjee A. Foster D.A. Blocking anaplerotic entry of glutamine into the TCA cycle sensitizes K-Ras mutant cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16.Son J. Lyssiotis C.A. Ying H. Wang X. Hua S. Ligorio M. Perera R.M. Ferrone C.R. Mullarky E. Shyh-Chang N. Kang Y. Fleming J.B. Bardeesy N. Asara J.M. Haigis M.C. DePinho R.A. Cantley L.C. Kimmelman A.C. Glutamine supports pancreatic cancer growth through a KRAS-regulated metabolic pathway.Nature. 2013; 496: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Significantly, the S-phase arrest induced by inhibition of GOT2 could be overcome largely with aspartate. α-KG had little effect on the S-phase arrest induced by suppression of GOT2. Aspartate exits the mitochondria via the malate-aspartate shuttle that is usually used for shuttling electrons into the mitochondria, but is also important for generating cytosolic aspartate that can contribute to redox balance and amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis (Fig. 5) (22.Van Vranken J.G. Rutter J. You Down With ETC? Yeah, You Know D!.Cell. 2015; 162: 471-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is also of interest that the deamidation reaction catalyzed by PPAT generates cytosolic glutamate from Q. This is important because it generates cytosolic glutamate that can be used to facilitate mitochondrial export of aspartate via the malate-aspartate shuttle where the exit of aspartate is coupled to the uptake of glutamate. Aspartate is a critical metabolite for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Several recent reports have similarly identified aspartate derived from several metabolic pathways as being critical in dividing cells for nucleotide biosynthesis including fatty acid metabolism (23.Schoors S. Bruning U. Missiaen R. Queiroz K.C. Borgers G. Elia I. Zecchin A. Cantelmo A.R. Christen S. Goveia J. Heggermont W. Goddé L. Vinckier S. Van Veldhoven P.P. Eelen G. Schoonjans L. Gerhardt H.

Consistent with this role for aspartate, the S-phase arrest of KRas-driven cancer cells caused by inhibition of GOT could also be reversed with deoxynucleosides and mimicked with suppression of nucleotide biosynthesis. Collectively, the data provided here reveal that the S-phase arrest observed in KRas-driven cancer cells deprived of Q is due to replicative stress created by the lack of aspartate needed for deoxynucleotide biosynthesis. Thus, strategies for targeting aspartate synthesis pathways may be an effective means to sensitize KRas-driven cancer cells to drugs that are specific for S-phase-arrested cells.

https://openalex.org/W2290476238,"One of the main drivers of tropical forest loss is their conversion to oil palm, soy or cacao plantations with low biodiversity and greatly reduced carbon storage. Southeast Asian cacao plantations are often established under shade tree cover, but are later converted to non-shaded monocultures to avoid resource competition. We compared three co-occurring cacao cultivation systems (3 replicate stands each) with different shade intensity (non-shaded monoculture, cacao with the legume Gliricidia sepium shade trees, and cacao with several shade tree species) in Sulawesi (Indonesia) with respect to above- and belowground biomass and productivity, and cacao bean yield. Total biomass C stocks (above- and belowground) increased fivefold from the monoculture to the multi-shade tree system (from 11 to 57 Mg ha-1), total net primary production rose twofold (from 9 to 18 Mg C ha-1 yr-1). This increase was associated with a 6fold increase in aboveground biomass, but only a 3.5fold increase in root biomass, indicating a clear shift in C allocation to aboveground tree organs with increasing shade for both cacao and shade trees. Despite a canopy cover increase from 50 to 93%, cacao bean yield remained invariant across the systems (variation: 1.1–1.2 Mg C ha-1 yr-1). The monocultures had a twice as rapid leaf turnover suggesting that shading reduces the exposure of cacao to atmospheric drought, probably resulting in greater leaf longevity. Thus, contrary to general belief, cacao bean yield does not necessarily decrease under shading which seems to reduce physical stress. If planned properly, cacao plantations under a shade tree cover allow combining high yield with benefits for carbon sequestration and storage, production system stability under stress, and higher levels of animal and plant diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2290662239,"It is increasingly clear that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are involved in immune regulation, and that their activation can protect against inflammatory diseases. Previous data have shown that nicotine diminishes the numbers of peripheral monocytes and macrophages, especially those of the pro-inflammatory phenotype. The goal of the present study was to determine if nicotine modulates the production of bone marrow -derived monocytes/macrophages. In this study, we first found that murine bone marrow cells express multiple nAChR subunits, and that the α7 and α9 nAChRs most predominant subtypes found in immune cells and their precursors. Using primary cultures of murine bone marrow cells, we then determined the effect of nicotine on monocyte colony-stimulating factor and interferon gamma (IFNγ)-induced monocyte production. We found that nicotine lowered the overall number of monocytes, and more specifically, inhibited the IFNγ-induced increase in pro-inflammatory monocytes by reducing cell proliferation and viability. These data suggested that nicotine diminishes the ratio of pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory monocyte produced in the bone marrow. We thus confirmed this hypothesis by measuring cytokine expression, where we found that nicotine inhibited the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1β and IL-12, while stimulating the secretion of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Finally, nicotine also reduced the number of pro-inflammatory monocytes in the bone marrow of LPS-challenged mice. Overall, our data demonstrate that both α7 and α9 nAChRs are involved in the regulation of pro-inflammatory M1 monocyte numbers."
https://openalex.org/W2289602204,"We sought to determine whether the orexigenic hormone, ghrelin, is involved in the intrinsic regulation of food choice in rats. Ghrelin would seem suited to serve such a role given that it signals hunger information from the stomach to brain areas important for feeding control, including the hypothalamus and reward system (e.g. ventral tegmental area, VTA). Thus, in rats offered a choice of palatable foods (sucrose pellets and lard) superimposed on regular chow for 2 weeks, we explored whether acute central delivery of ghrelin (intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intra-VTA) is able to redirect their dietary choice. The major unexpected finding is that, in rats with high baseline lard intake, acute ICV ghrelin injection increased their chow intake over 3-fold, relative to vehicle-injected controls, measured at both 3 hr and 6 hr after injection. Similar effects were observed when ghrelin was delivered to the VTA, thereby identifying the VTA as a likely contributing neurobiological substrate for these effects. We also explored food choice after an overnight fast, when endogenous ghrelin levels are elevated, and found similar effects of dietary choice to those described for ghrelin. These effects of fasting on food choice were suppressed in models of suppressed ghrelin signaling (i.e. peripheral injection of a ghrelin receptor antagonist to rats and ghrelin receptor (GHSR) knock-out mice), implicating a role for endogenous ghrelin in the changes in food choice that occur after an overnight fast. Thus, in line with its role as a gut-brain hunger hormone, ghrelin appears to be able to acutely alter food choice, with notable effects to promote “healthy” chow intake, and identify the VTA as a likely contributing neurobiological substrate for these effects."
https://openalex.org/W2292253123,"Although the role of metastatic cancer stem cells (mCSCs) in tumor progression has been well documented, our study reveals a hitherto unidentified role of tumorigenic intrinsic CSCs (iCSCs) in breast cancer metastasis. We show that unlike highly migratory mCSCs residing in the breast tumor disseminating/peripheral regions, iCSCs populate the inner mass of the tumor and are non-migratory. However iCSCs, via paracrine signaling, induce conversion of non-stem cancer cells to CSCs that (i) are identical to the previously reported mCSCs, and (ii) in contrast to iCSCs, express chemokine receptor, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4), which is crucial for their metastatic potential. These mCSCs also demonstrate high in vivo tumorigenicity. Physical non-participation of iCSCs in metastasis is further validated in vivo, where only mCSCs are found to exist in the metastatic sites, lymph nodes and bone marrow, whereas the primary tumor retains both iCSCs and mCSCs. However, iCSCs ensure metastasis since their presence is crucial for deliverance of highly metastatic CXCR4+ mCSCs to the migrating fraction of cells. Cumulatively, these results unveil a novel role of iCSCs in breast cancer metastasis as parental regulators of CXCR4+ mCSCs, and highlight the therapeutic requisite of targeting iCSCs, but not CXCR4+ mCSCs, to restrain breast cancer metastasis from the root by inhibiting the generation of mCSCs from iCSCs. Considering the pivotal role of iCSCs in tumor metastasis, the possibility of metastasis to be a ‘stem cell phenomena’ is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2274719353,"A pilot study about the effectiveness of a universal school-based programme, ""The Little Prince is Depressed"", for preventing depression in Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong was conducted and reported previously. This study used a larger sample to examine the effectiveness and sustainability of the programme.This study used quasi-experimental design. Twelve schools enrolled in ""The Little Prince is Depressed"" programme either as an intervention or a control condition. The intervention schools carried out the 12-session programme in two phases: the professional-led first phase and the teacher-led second phase. All participants were required to complete a questionnaire at three time points measuring their (1) depressive, anxiety, and stress levels; (2) knowledge of mental health; (3) attitudes towards mental illness; (4) perceived social support; and (5) help-seeking behaviours.A total of 3,391 students participated in the study. The level of depressive symptoms did not reduce significantly at post-intervention; however, a delayed effect was observed at follow-up assessment for the participants of the teacher-led group in reducing anxiety and stress levels. Also, the knowledge of mental health and attitudes towards mental illness of the intervention-group participants significantly improved at post-test, and the outcomes were maintained at 4 to 5 months after the intervention in both the professional-led and the teacher-led conditions (p<.05). A preference among schoolchildren for whom to seek help from was identified.The universal depression prevention programme was effective in enhancing knowledge of mental health and promoting a more positive attitude towards mental illness among adolescents in Hong Kong. In particular, the teacher-led group showed better outcomes than the professional-led group in reducing students' anxiety and stress at follow-up period. The programme can achieve sustainability in schools if teachers are provided with adequate support."

We assessed the genes expressed in blood cells by microarray and found that the expression levels of 3,066 probes were state-dependently changed in the blood cells of patients with LOD. To select potential candidates from those probes, we assessed the genes expressed in the blood of an animal model of depression, ovariectomized female mice exposed to chronic ultra-mild stress, by microarray and cross-matched the differentially expressed genes between the patients and the model mice. We identified 14 differentially expressed genes that were similarly changed in both patients and the model mice. By assessing statistical significance using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), the following 4 genes were selected as candidates: cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (CIDEC), ribonuclease 1 (RNASE1), solute carrier family 36 member-1 (SLC36A1), and serine/threonine/tyrosine interacting-like 1 (STYXL1). The discriminating ability of these 4 candidate genes was evaluated in an independent cohort that was validated. Among them, CIDEC showed the greatest discriminant validity (sensitivity 91.3% and specificity 87.5%). Thus, these 4 biomarkers should be helpful for properly diagnosing LOD."

The genetic selection program is necessary and urgent for the sustainable development of this industry, requiring more and more genome background knowledge. Transcriptome sequencing is an excellent alternative way to identify transcripts involved in specific biological processes and exploit a considerable quantity of molecular makers when no genome sequences are available. In this study, a comprehensive transcript dataset for major tissues of S. maximus was produced on basis of an Illumina platform.Total RNA was isolated from liver, spleen, kidney, cerebrum, gonad (testis and ovary) and muscle. Equal quantities of RNA from each type of tissues were pooled to construct two cDNA libraries (male and female). Using the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology, nearly 44.22 million clean reads in length of 100 bp were generated and then assembled into 106,643 contigs, of which 71,107 were named unigenes with an average length of 892 bp after the elimination of redundancies. Of these, 24,052 unigenes (33.83% of the total) were successfully annotated. GO, KEGG pathway mapping and COG analysis were performed to predict potential genes and their functions. Based on our sequence analysis and published documents, many candidate genes with fundamental roles in sex determination and gonad differentiation (dmrt1), growth (ghrh, myf5, prl/prlr) and immune response (TLR1/TLR21/TLR22, IL-15/IL-34), were identified for the first time in this species. In addition, a large number of credible genetic markers, including 21,192 SSRs and 8,642 SNPs, were identified in the present dataset.This informative transcriptome provides valuable new data to increase genomic resources of Scophthalmus maximus. The future studies of corresponding gene functions will be very useful for the management of reproduction, growth and disease control in turbot aquaculture breeding programs. The molecular markers identified in this database will aid in genetic linkage analyses, mapping of quantitative trait loci, and acceleration of marker assisted selection programs."

The product of the reaction is the essential amino acid l-lysine, which is an important precursor for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan cell wall, housekeeping proteins, and virulence factors of bacteria. Accordingly, the enzyme is a promising antibacterial target. Previous structural studies demonstrate that DAPDC exists as monomers, dimers, and tetramers in the crystal state. However, the active oligomeric form has not yet been determined. We show using analytical ultracentrifugation, small angle x-ray scattering, and enzyme kinetic analyses in solution that the active form of DAPDC from Bacillus anthracis, Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Vibrio cholerae is a dimer. The importance of dimerization was probed further by generating dimerization interface mutants (N381A and R385A) of V. cholerae DAPDC. Our studies indicate that N381A and R385A are significantly attenuated in catalytic activity, thus confirming that dimerization of DAPDC is essential for function.

https://openalex.org/W2288836743,"Epidemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) imposes an increasing impact on public health. Due to multi-antibiotics resistance in MRSA strains, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics such as effective monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against MRSA infections. Staphylococcus aureus surface protein A (SasA), a large surface-located protein (~240 kDa), is one of MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) and a potential target for immunotherapeutic approaches against S. aureus infections. In the present study, we analyzed the sequence of SasA with bioinformatics tools and generated a protective monoclonal antibody (2H7) targeting the conserved domain of SasA. 2H7 was shown to recognize wild-type S. aureus and promote opsonophagocytic killing of S. aureus. In both sepsis and peritoneal infection models, prophylactic administration of 2H7 improved the survival of BALB/c mice challenged by S. aureus strain USA300 and ST239 (prevalent MRSA clones in North America and Asian countries, respectively) and enhanced bacterial clearance in kidneys. Additionally, 2H7 prophylaxis prevented the formation of intraperitoneal abscess in a murine model of peritoneal infection and therapeutic administration of 2H7 showed protective efficacy in a murine sepsis model. Our results presented here provide supporting evidences that an anti-SasA mAb might be a potential component in an antibody-based immunotherapeutic treatment of MRSA infections."
https://openalex.org/W2284367127,"Background “The Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC) is important, but we don’t use it adequately” is a well-suited statement that reflects the SSC's application in hospitals. Our aim was to follow up on our initial study on compliance (2014) by analysing differences between individual perception and compliance with the SSC. Methods We conducted a follow-up online survey to assess healthcare professionals’ individual perception of, as well as satisfaction and compliance with the SSC three years following its thorough implementation. Results 171 (19.5%) of 875 operating team members completed the online survey. 99.4% confirmed using the SSC. Self-estimated subjective knowledge about the intention of the checklist was high, whereas objective knowledge was moderate, but improved as compared to 2014. According to an independent audit the SSC was used in 93.1% of all operations and among the SSCs used the completion rate was 57.2%. The use of the SSC was rated as rather easy [median (IQR): 7 (6–7)], familiar [7 (6–7)], generally important [7 (7–7)], and good for patients [7 (6–7)] as well as for employees [7 (7–7)]. Only comfort of use was rated lower [6 (5–7)]. Conclusion There is a gap between individual perception and actual application of the SSC. Despite healthcare professionals confirming the importance of the SSC, compliance was moderate. The introduction of SSCs in the health care sector remains a constant challenge and requires continuous re-evaluation as well as a sensible integration into existing workflows in hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W2290443998,"Mangroves occur along the coastlines throughout the tropics and sub-tropics, supporting a wide variety of resources and services. In order to understand the responses of future climate change on this ecosystem, we need to know how mangrove species have responded to climate changes in the recent past. This study aims at exploring the climatic influences on the radial growth of Heritiera fomes from a local to global scale. A total of 40 stem discs were collected at breast height position from two different zones with contrasting salinity in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh. All specimens showed distinct tree rings and most of the trees (70%) could be visually and statistically crossdated. Successful crossdating enabled the development of two zone-specific chronologies. The mean radial increment was significantly higher at low salinity (eastern) zone compared to higher salinity (western) zone. The two zone-specific chronologies synchronized significantly, allowing for the construction of a regional chronology. The annual and monsoon precipitation mainly influence the tree growth of H. fomes. The growth response to local precipitation is similar in both zones except June and November in the western zone, while the significant influence is lacking. The large-scale climatic drivers such as sea surface temperature (SST) of equatorial Pacific and Indian Ocean as well as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) revealed no teleconnection with tree growth. The tree rings of this species are thus an indicator for monsoon precipitation variations in Bangladesh. The wider distribution of this species from the South to South East Asian coast presents an outstanding opportunity for developing a large-scale tree-ring network of mangroves."

Besides SUMO E3 ligases, homeostasis of intracellular sumoylation is also regulated by SUMO isopeptidases, which catalyze the removal of SUMO from its targets. Two SUMO isopeptidases Ulp1 and Ulp2 have been identified in S. cerevisiae (8.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M.

This role of Ulp2 in chromosome segregation appears to be conserved in higher eukaryotes including Caenorhabditis elegans and human cells, although its targets are poorly known (13.Mukhopadhyay D.

Consistent with its nuclear function, Ulp2 has been shown to localize throughout the nucleus and occasionally the nucleolus (15.Kroetz M.B. Su D. Hochstrasser M.

On the other hand, Ulp1 is essential for cell viability and localizes at the nuclear periphery via the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (8.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M.

These studies suggest that localization of Ulp1 at the nuclear periphery has an important role in protecting genome integrity, possibly by preventing Ulp1 from desumoylating nucleoplasmic proteins yet to be determined. The distinct localization patterns of Ulp1 and Ulp2 likely contribute to their substrate selectivity in cells, which has been poorly understood. In this study we first characterized the function of Ulp1 and Ulp2 in preventing the accumulation of GCRs and identified a genetic basis for the essential function of Ulp1. To identify the substrates of Ulp1 and Ulp2, we applied quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to analyze the effect of ulp1 and ulp2 mutations on intracellular sumoylation. These studies led to the finding that Ulp2 has highly specific desumoylation activity in vivo, whereas Ulp1 has a broader specificity toward many substrates. Interestingly, loss of Ulp1 or its mislocalization from the nuclear periphery causes specific and aberrant desumoylation of Ulp2 targets, including the essential replicative MCM helicase (22.Bell S.D. Botchan M.R. The minichromosome maintenance replicative helicase.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a012807Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mms21, the E3 ligase with a major role in preventing the accumulation of GCRs (6.Albuquerque C.P. Wang G. Lee N.S. Kolodner R.D. Putnam C.D. Zhou H. Distinct SUMO ligases Cooperate with Esc2 and Slx5 to suppress duplication-mediated genome rearrangements.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), preferentially catalyzes sumoylation of specific MCM subunits. All yeast strains used for MS and biochemical experiments were derived from the HF-SMT3 (HF-SUMO) strain, in which a His6-3×FLAG tag was integrated into the N terminus of SMT3 in its chromosomal locus (6.Albuquerque C.P. Wang G. Lee N.S. Kolodner R.D. Putnam C.D. Zhou H. Distinct SUMO ligases Cooperate with Esc2 and Slx5 to suppress duplication-mediated genome rearrangements.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The strains used to study GCRs were derived from RDKY6678, which contains the yel072w::CAN1/URA3 assay (23.Putnam C.D. Hayes T.K. Kolodner R.D. Specific pathways prevent duplication-mediated genome rearrangements.Nature. 2009; 460: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All tagged MCM strains and the indicated mutations were integrated into the chromosomal locus of the gene of interest (supplemental Table 1) using standard yeast genetic methods unless otherwise noted. The yeast strains used here also have their 2-μm circles removed, according to a previous study (24.Chen X.L. Reindle A. Johnson E.S. Misregulation of 2-μm circle copy number in a SUMO pathway mutant.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fluctuation analysis of GCRs was performed as previously described (25.Putnam C.D. Kolodner R.D. Determination of gross chromosomal rearrangement rates.Cold Spring Harb Protoc. 2010; 2010 (pdb.prot5492)Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). At least 16 isolates were examined per mutant to calculate the median rate of accumulating GCRs. Error bars in the graph represent the upper and lower limits determined by the 95% confidence intervals of the median. (epilab Course Materials). p values were calculated using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test as previously described (26.Putnam C.D. Pallis K. Hayes T.K. Kolodner R.D. DNA repair pathway selection caused by defects in TEL1, SAE2, and de novo telomere addition generates specific chromosomal rearrangement signatures.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004277Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For quantitative MS analysis, each mutant strain was grown in synthetic media containing either light or heavy stable isotope-labeled lysine and arginine. A 2-liter culture was used for each strain, which was grown to an optical density (600 nm) near 0.5 and then harvested. Cell pellets of the two yeast strains to be compared were combined and used to purify sumoylated proteins under denaturing conditions using methods described previously (6.Albuquerque C.P. Wang G. Lee N.S. Kolodner R.D. Putnam C.D. Zhou H. Distinct SUMO ligases Cooperate with Esc2 and Slx5 to suppress duplication-mediated genome rearrangements.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The methods used in the MS experiments and data analysis have been described previously (6.Albuquerque C.P. Wang G. Lee N.S. Kolodner R.D. Putnam C.D. Zhou H. Distinct SUMO ligases Cooperate with Esc2 and Slx5 to suppress duplication-mediated genome rearrangements.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The complete list of sumoylated proteins and their abundance changes are shown in supplemental Tables 2–9. Each sumoylated protein was quantified based on the median of the abundance ratios of at least three unique peptides per protein. To detect Net1 and MCM sumoylation, the same denaturing method using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and anti-FLAG affinity resins was used to purify sumoylated proteins from the same amount (200 ml) of yeast culture during logarithmic growth (6.Albuquerque C.P. Wang G. Lee N.S. Kolodner R.D. Putnam C.D. Zhou H. Distinct SUMO ligases Cooperate with Esc2 and Slx5 to suppress duplication-mediated genome rearrangements.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After cell lysis, a Bradford assay was used to ensure the same amount of total proteins was used to purify sumoylated proteins. To elute sumoylated proteins from anti-FLAG affinity resins, buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS was added to the anti-FLAG resins, which were heated to 100 °C for 10 min. The eluted sample was analyzed using an appropriate antibody as indicated. Typically, half of the eluted sample was analyzed to detect sumoylated MCM. To induce DNA replication stress, 0.1 m hydroxyurea was added to a logarithmic growing YPD culture (optical density at 0.5) for 2 h. For cells growing in synthetic media, 0.1 m hydroxyurea was added for 3 h. To analyze Mcm3 and Mcm6 sumoylation during the cell cycle, Mcm6-His6-3HA cells (Bar1-deficient) were arrested by adding either 30 nm α-factor (G1 arrest) or 7.5 μg/ml nocodazole (M-phase arrest) for 3 h at 26 °C. To prepare S-phase cells, G1-arrested cells were washed with fresh YPD and then released into fresh YPD media for 40 min at 26 °C.

Hayes T.K. Kolodner R.D. Specific pathways prevent duplication-mediated genome rearrangements.Nature. 2009; 460: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The smt3GG mutation supplies cells with mature SUMO (8.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. A new protease required for cell-cycle progression in yeast.Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), whereas the 4R-smt3GG mutation additionally eliminates the bulk of poly-SUMO chains (11.Bylebyl G.R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44113-44120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Both smt3GG and 4R-smt3GG mutations caused a modest change in the rate of accumulating GCRs (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the removal of poly-SUMO chains does not appreciably affect the accumulation of GCRs. Next we examined the effect of ulp2Δ mutation and found that the loss of Ulp2 has a minimal effect on the rate of accumulating GCRs in wild type and smt3GG and 4R-smt3GG mutants. Thus, neither the accumulation of poly-SUMO chains in cells lacking Ulp2 nor the lack of poly-SUMO chains appreciably alters the accumulation of GCRs measured by the yel072w::URA3/CAN1 assay. The essential function of Ulp1 has been attributed to its role in SUMO maturation and desumoylating other proteins in cells whose identities have been unknown (8.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. A new protease required for cell-cycle progression in yeast.Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the latter function of Ulp1 could be bypassed by mutations that down-regulate intracellular sumoylation. Because Siz1 and Siz2 are known to have a major role in intracellular sumoylation (3.Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A.

Distinct SUMO ligases Cooperate with Esc2 and Slx5 to suppress duplication-mediated genome rearrangements.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we tested whether loss of Siz1 and/or Siz2 could suppress the lethality of ulp1Δ by performing tetrad dissection of diploid cells containing heterozygous ulp1Δ, siz1Δ, and siz2Δ mutations as well as a homozygous smt3GG mutation to supply mature Smt3. As shown in Fig. 1B, deletion of SIZ1 and SIZ2, but neither one alone, suppresses the lethality of ulp1Δ. In contrast, loss of Mms21 E3 ligase activity did not rescue the lethality of ulp1Δ (Fig. 1B). This suggests that an essential function of Ulp1 is to desumoylate the bulk of intracellular sumoylation, catalyzed by Siz1 and Siz2. Interestingly, the loss of Ulp1 in the siz1Δ siz2Δ mutant caused a significant increase in the rate of accumulating GCRs, which was comparable with that of an mms21-CH mutant and was considerably higher than that of the siz1Δ siz2Δ mutant (Fig. 1C). By comparison, the loss of Ulp2 in the siz1Δ siz2Δ mutant caused a smaller increase in the rate of accumulating GCRs. Thus Ulp1 has a more important role than Ulp2 in suppressing GCRs, albeit in cells lacking Siz1 and Siz2. To avoid the complication of deleting Siz1 and Siz2, we chose to analyze the hypomorphic ulp1 mutant further. The ulp1-N338Δ mutation has been shown to compromise the localization of Ulp1 at the nuclear periphery without affecting cell viability (17.Panse V.G. Küster B. Gerstberger T. Hurt E. Unconventional tethering of Ulp1 to the transport channel of the nuclear pore complex by karyopherins.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18.Li S.-J.

Mlp-dependent anchorage and stabilization of a desumoylating enzyme is required to prevent clonal lethality.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We found this ulp1-N338Δ mutation causes a significant increase in the rate of accumulating GCRs comparable with that of the mms21-CH mutant and is independent of Ulp2 (Fig. 1C). This suggests that mislocalized Ulp1 could either directly desumoylate Mms21 targets or indirectly down-regulate Mms21 activity to cause accumulation of GCRs. Distinguishing these possibilities would require knowledge of Ulp1 and Ulp2 targets and how they are regulated by the localization of Ulp1. To identify the in vivo targets of Ulp1 and Ulp2, we chose to use our quantitative MS approach as previously described (6.Albuquerque C.P. Wang G. Lee N.S. Kolodner R.D. Putnam C.D. Zhou H. Distinct SUMO ligases Cooperate with Esc2 and Slx5 to suppress duplication-mediated genome rearrangements.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this approach, after purification of sumoylated proteins, Ulp1 is used to elute sumoylated proteins for MS analysis. This approach provides information on the amount of sumoylated proteins but does not distinguish whether they are poly-sumoylated or mono-sumoylated at one or more lysines, which can be studied using alternative methods. Using this quantitative MS approach, we found that deletion of ULP2 in the HF-4R-smt3GG strain caused substantial increases in three protein complexes located in distinct chromosomal regions, including rDNA (the RENT complex), centromere (inner kinetochore complex), and origins of DNA replication (the MCM complex) (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table 2). Among them, loss of Ulp2 caused accumulation of ∼20-fold more sumoylated Net1, Cdc14, and Tof2, subunits of the RENT complex in the nucleolus (28.Straight A.F. Shou W. Dowd G.J. Turck C.W.

Similarly, the loss of Ulp2 also caused accumulation of ∼20-fold more sumoylated Ame1, Mcm21, Okp1, Mcm16, and Mcm22, which are components of the inner kinetochore complex (30.Ortiz J. Stemmann O. Rank S. Lechner J.

This drastic accumulation of sumoylated RENT and inner kinetochore complexes is consistent with them being Ulp2 targets. Loss of Ulp2 also causes significant accumulations of sumoylated subunits of the MCM complex, the essential replicative DNA helicase (33.Maine G.T. Sinha P. Tye B.K.

By Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, we have demonstrated that the amyloid transformation of wild-type β2-microglobulin can be induced by the variant only after its complete fibrillar conversion. Our current findings are consistent with preliminary data in which we have shown a seeding effect of fibrils formed from D76N or the natural truncated form of β2-microglobulin lacking the first six N-terminal residues. Interestingly, the hybrid wild-type/variant fibrillar material acquired a thermodynamic stability similar to that of homogenous D76N β2-microglobulin fibrils and significantly higher than the wild-type homogeneous fibrils prepared at neutral pH in the presence of 20% trifluoroethanol. These results suggest that the surface of D76N β2-microglobulin fibrils can favor the transition of the wild-type protein into an amyloid conformation leading to a rapid integration into fibrils. The chaperone crystallin, which is a mild modulator of the lag phase of the variant fibrillogenesis, potently inhibits fibril elongation of the wild-type even once it is absorbed on D76N β2-microglobulin fibrils."

Here, we employed the cAMP/cGMP modulators, forskolin, IBMX, and cilostamide, during IVM to unravel the role of high cAMP in early embryonic development produced from prepubertal and adult bovine oocytes. Oocytes were collected via transvaginal aspiration and randomly assigned to three experimental groups: TCM24 (24h IVM/control), cAMP30 (2h pre-IVM (forskolin-IBMX), 30h IVM-cilostamide), and DMSO30 (Dimethyl Sulfoxide/vehicle control). After IVM, oocytes were fertilized in vitro and zygotes were cultured in vitro to blastocysts. Meiotic progression, cAMP levels, mRNA abundance of selected genes and DNA methylation were evaluated in oocytes. Blastocysts were used for gene expression or DNA methylation analyses. Blastocysts from the cAMP30 groups were transferred to recipients. The cAMP elevation delayed meiotic progression, but developmental rates were not increased. In immature oocytes, mRNA abundance of PRKACA was higher for cAMP30 protocol and no differences were found for PDE3A, SMAD2, ZAR1, PRDX1 and SLC2A8. EGR1 gene was up-regulated in prepubertal cAMP30 immature oocytes and down-regulated in blastocysts from all in vitro treatments. A similar gene expression profile was observed for DNMT3b, BCL2L1, PRDX1 and SLC2A8 in blastocysts. Satellite DNA methylation profiles were different between prepubertal and adult oocytes and blastocysts derived from the TCM24 and DMSO30 groups. Blastocysts obtained from prepubertal and adult oocytes in the cAMP30 treatment displayed normal methylation profiles and produced offspring. These data indicate that cAMP regulates IVM in prepubertal and adult oocytes in a similar manner, with impact on the establishment of epigenetic marks and acquisition of full developmental competency."

Since there is no effective vaccine against the dengue virus, prevention of disease transmission depends entirely on regulating the vector (Aedes aegypti) or interrupting human-vector contact. The aim of this study was to assess the oviposition deterrent activity of essential oils of three cultivars of torch ginger (Etlingera elatior, Zingiberaceae) against the dengue mosquito. Analysis of the oils by gas chromatography (GC)—mass spectrometry revealed the presence of 43 constituents, of which α-pinene, dodecanal and n-dodecanol were the major components in all cultivars. Solutions containing 100 ppm of the oils exhibited oviposition deterrent activities against gravid Ae. aegypti females. GC analysis with electroantennographic detection indicated that the oil constituents n-decanol, 2-undecanone, undecanal, dodecanal, trans-caryophyllene, (E)-β-farnesene, α-humulene, n-dodecanol, isodaucene and dodecanoic acid were able to trigger antennal depolarization in Ae. aegypti females. Bioassays confirmed that solutions containing 50 ppm of n-dodecanol or dodecanal exhibited oviposition deterrent activities, while a solution containing the alcohol and aldehyde in admixture at concentrations representative of the oil presented an activity similar to that of the 100 ppm oil solution. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations verified that the interaction energies of the long-chain oil components and Ae. aegypti odorant binding protein 1 were quite favorable, indicating that the protein is a possible oviposition deterrent receptor in the antenna of Ae. aegypti."

This self-report instrument evaluates nine cognitive emotion regulation strategies that can be used by children after experiencing a negative life event. The CERQ-Ck was evaluated in a sample of 1403 elementary students between the ages of 9 and 11 by using cluster sampling. All the item-correlation coefficients for CERQ-Ck were above 0.30. The internal consistencies of the nine factors suggested moderate reliability (0.66 to 0.73). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated that the current version had the same structure as the original instrument (Tucker-Lewis index = 0.912, comparative fit index = 0.922, root mean square error of approximation = 0.032, standardized root mean square residual = 0.044). A second-order factor and a third-order factor structure were also found. Test-retest correlations (0.53 to 0.70, ps < 0.01) over a period of 1 month, which ranged from acceptable to moderately strong were obtained from a random and stratified subsample of elementary students (N = 76). In addition, we analyzed convergent validity in relation to CERQ-Ck and the Chinese version of the Children's Depression Inventory model dimensions with a subsample of 1083 elementary students. Multiple-group CFA confirmed the measurement invariance for both the male and female groups (ΔCFI < 0.01, ΔRMSEA < 0.015). Overall, results indicate that CERQ-Ck has similar psychometric properties to the original instrument as well as with adequate reliability and validity to investigate the nine cognitive emotion regulation strategies during late childhood developmental periods."

Subclinical hypothyroid patients were treated with L-thyroxine for 3 months. Psychophysiological olfactory testing was performed using odor dispensers similar to felt-tip pens (“Sniffin’ Sticks”, Burghart, Wedel, Germany). Taste function tests were made using ""Taste Strips"" (Burghart, Wedel, Germany) which are basically tastant adsorbed filter paper strip. Patients scored lower on psychophysical olfactory tests than controls (odor thresholds:8.1±1.0 vs 8.9±1.1, p = 0.007; odor discrimination:12.4±1.3 vs 13.1±0.9, p = 0.016; odor identification:13.1±0.9 vs 14.0±1.1, p = 0.001; TDI score: 33.8±2.4 vs 36.9±2.1, p = 0.001). In contrast, results from psychophysical gustatory tests showed only a decreased score for “bitter” in patients, but not for other tastes (5.9±1.8 vs 6.6±1.0, p = 0.045). Three month after onset of treatment olfactory test scores already indicated improvement (odor thresholds:8.1±1.0 vs 8.6±0.6, p<0.001; odor discrimination:12.4±1.31 vs 12.9±0.8, p = 0.011; odor identification:13.1±0.9 vs 13.9±0.8, p<0.001; TDI scores:33.8±2.4 vs 35.5±1.7, p<0.001) respectively. Taste functions did not differ between groups for sweet, salty and, sour tastes but bitter taste was improved after 3 months of thyroxin substitution (patients:5.9±1.8 vs 6.6±1.2, p = 0.045). Correlation of changes in smell and taste, with thyroid function test were also evaluated. TSH, fT4 were found have no correlation with smell and taste changes with treatment. However bitter taste found positively correlated with T3 with treatment(r: 0.445, p: 0.018). Subclinical hypothyroid patients exhibited a significantly decreased olfactory sensitivity; in addition, bitter taste was significantly affected.

https://openalex.org/W2285654202,"The most commonly used locomotor strategy in rodents is left-right limb alternation. Mutation of the axon guidance molecule EphA4 profoundly alters this basic locomotor pattern to synchrony. Here we report that conditional mutation of EphA4 in spinal interneurons expressing the transcription factor Lbx1 degrades the robustness in the expression of left-right alternating gait during development. Lbx1 EphA4 conditional mice exhibit alternating gait when walking on ground, but synchronous gait in environments with decreased weight-load, like swimming and airstepping. Using cell-type-specific, transient pharmacogenetic silencing approaches, we attribute this behavioral gait switch to neuronal activity of dorsal Lbx1 spinal interneurons. We also found that in Lbx1 EphA4 conditional mice these dorsal interneurons form aberrant bilateral connections to motor neurons, thereby indirectly transmitting received unilateral proprioceptive sensory information to both spinal sides. Together, our findings reveal the behavioral and circuit-level impact of conditional EphA4 mutation in a transcriptionally defined spinal interneuron subpopulation."
https://openalex.org/W2291794748,"Objective The uremic toxin Indoxyl-3-sulphate (IS), a ligand of Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), raises in blood during early renal dysfunction as a consequence of tubular damage, which may be present even when eGFR is normal or only moderately reduced, and promotes cardiovascular damage and monocyte-macrophage activation. We previously found that patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) have higher CD14+CD16+ monocyte frequency and prevalence of moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) than age-matched control subjects. Here we aimed to evaluate the IS levels in plasma from AAA patients and to investigate in vitro the effects of IS concentrations corresponding to mild-to-moderate CKD on monocyte polarization and macrophage differentiation. Methods Free IS plasma levels, monocyte subsets and laboratory parameters were evaluated on blood from AAA patients and eGFR-matched controls. THP-1 monocytes, treated with IS 1, 10, 20 μM were evaluated for CD163 expression, AhR signaling and then induced to differentiate into macrophages by PMA. Their phenotype was evaluated both at the stage of semi-differentiated and fully differentiated macrophages. AAA and control sera were similarly used to treat THP-1 monocytes and the resulting macrophage phenotype was analyzed. Results IS plasma concentration correlated positively with CD14+CD16+ monocytes and was increased in AAA patients. In THP-1 cells, IS promoted CD163 expression and transition to macrophages with hallmarks of classical (IL-6, CCL2, COX2) and alternative phenotype (IL-10, PPARγ, TGF-β, TIMP-1), via AhR/Nrf2 activation. Analogously, AAA sera induced differentiation of macrophages with enhanced IL-6, MCP1, TGF-β, PPARγ and TIMP-1 expression. Conclusion IS skews monocyte differentiation toward low-inflammatory, profibrotic macrophages and may contribute to sustain chronic inflammation and maladaptive vascular remodeling."

https://openalex.org/W2291906476,"Background Precision medicine aims to combat the variability of the therapeutic response to a given medicine by delivering the right medicine to the right patient. However, the application of precision medicine is predicated on a prior quantitation of the variance of the reference range of normality. Airway pathophysiology provides a good example due to a very variable first line of defence against airborne assault. Humans differ in their susceptibility to inhaled pollutants and pathogens in part due to the magnitude of trans-epithelial resistance that determines the degree of epithelial penetration to the submucosal space. This initial ‘set-point’ may drive a sentinel event in airway disease pathogenesis. Epithelia differentiated in vitro from airway biopsies are commonly used to model trans-epithelial resistance but the ‘reference range of normality’ remains problematic. We investigated the range of electrophysiological characteristics of human airway epithelia grown at air-liquid interface in vitro from healthy volunteers focusing on the inter- and intra-subject variability both at baseline and after sequential exposure to drugs modulating ion transport. Methodology/Principal Findings Brushed nasal airway epithelial cells were differentiated at air-liquid interface generating 137 pseudostratified ciliated epithelia from 18 donors. A positively-skewed baseline range exists for trans-epithelial resistance (Min/Max: 309/2963 Ω·cm2), trans-epithelial voltage (-62.3/-1.8 mV) and calculated equivalent current (-125.0/-3.2 μA/cm2; all non-normal, P<0.001). A minority of healthy humans manifest a dramatic amiloride sensitivity to voltage and trans-epithelial resistance that is further discriminated by prior modulation of cAMP-stimulated chloride transport. Conclusions/Significance Healthy epithelia show log-order differences in their ion transport characteristics, likely reflective of their initial set-points of basal trans-epithelial resistance and sodium transport. Our data may guide the choice of the background set point in subjects with airway diseases and frame the reference range for the future delivery of precision airway medicine."

ERPs associated with emotional processing of cannabis users, and non-using controls, were recorded and compared during an implicit and explicit emotional expression recognition and empathy task. Comparisons in P3 component mean amplitudes were made between cannabis users and controls. Results showed a significant decrease in the P3 amplitude in cannabis users compared to controls. Specifically, cannabis users showed reduced P3 amplitudes for implicit compared to explicit processing over centro-parietal sites which reversed, and was enhanced, at fronto-central sites. Cannabis users also showed a decreased P3 to happy faces, with an increase to angry faces, compared to controls. These effects appear to increase with those participants that self-reported the highest levels of cannabis consumption. Those cannabis users with the greatest consumption rates showed the largest P3 deficits for explicit processing and negative emotions. These data suggest that there is a complex relationship between cannabis consumption and emotion processing that appears to be modulated by attention."
https://openalex.org/W2288456928,"This paper presents the extension of a meta-model (MAM5) and a framework based on the model (JaCalIVE) for developing intelligent virtual environments. The goal of this extension is to develop augmented mirror worlds that represent a real and virtual world coupled, so that the virtual world not only reflects the real one, but also complements it. A new component called a smart resource artifact, that enables modelling and developing devices to access the real physical world, and a human in the loop agent to place a human in the system have been included in the meta-model and framework. The proposed extension of MAM5 has been tested by simulating a light control system where agents can access both virtual and real sensor/actuators through the smart resources developed. The results show that the use of real environment interactive elements (smart resource artifacts) in agent-based simulations allows to minimize the error between simulated and real system."
https://openalex.org/W2289743033,"Wild meat trade constitutes a threat to many animal species. Understanding the commodity chain of wild animals (hunting, transportation, trade, consumption) can help target conservation initiatives. Wild meat commodity chain research has focused on the formal trade and less on informal enterprises, although informal enterprises contribute to a large portion of the wild meat trade in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the formal and informal components of these commodity chains by focusing on the mammalian wild meat trade in Madagascar. Our objectives were to: (1) identify hunting strategies used to capture different wild mammals; (2) analyze patterns of movement of wild meat from the capture location to the final consumer; (3) examine wild meat prices, volumes, and venues of sale; and (4) estimate the volume of wild meat consumption. Data were collected in May-August 2013 using semi-structured interviews with consumers (n = 1343 households, 21 towns), meat-sellers (n = 520 restaurants, open-air markets stalls, and supermarkets, 9 towns), and drivers of inter-city transit vehicles (n = 61, 5 towns). We found that: (1) a wide range of hunting methods were used, though prevalence of use differed by animal group; (2) wild meat was transported distances of up to 166 km to consumers, though some animal groups were hunted locally (<10 km) in rural areas; (3) most wild meat was procured from free sources (hunting, gifts), though urban respondents who consumed bats and wild pigs were more likely to purchase those meats; and (4) wild meat was consumed at lower rates than domestic meat, though urban respondents consumed wild meat twice as much per year compared to rural respondents. Apart from the hunting stage, the consumption and trade of wild meat in Madagascar is also likely more formalized than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2290305175,"Market impact cost is the most significant portion of implicit transaction costs that can reduce the overall transaction cost, although it cannot be measured directly. In this paper, we employed the state-of-the-art nonparametric machine learning models: neural networks, Bayesian neural network, Gaussian process, and support vector regression, to predict market impact cost accurately and to provide the predictive model that is versatile in the number of variables. We collected a large amount of real single transaction data of US stock market from Bloomberg Terminal and generated three independent input variables. As a result, most nonparametric machine learning models outperformed a-state-of-the-art benchmark parametric model such as I-star model in four error measures. Although these models encounter certain difficulties in separating the permanent and temporary cost directly, nonparametric machine learning models can be good alternatives in reducing transaction costs by considerably improving in prediction performance."

Thirty-five species represented by 132 samples of Goodyera were analyzed, along with other 27 genera/48 species, using Pterostylis longifolia and Chloraea gaudichaudii as outgroups. Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods were used to reveal the intrageneric relationships of Goodyera and its intergeneric relationships to related genera. The results indicate that: 1) Goodyera is not monophyletic; 2) Goodyera could be divided into four sections, viz., Goodyera, Otosepalum, Reticulum and a new section; 3) sect. Reticulum can be further divided into two subsections, viz., Reticulum and Foliosum, whereas sect. Goodyera can in turn be divided into subsections Goodyera and a new subsection."
https://openalex.org/W2345028776,"Earlier findings have identified the requirement of insulin signaling on maturation and the translocation of serotonin (5-HT) transporter, SERT to the plasma membrane of the trophoblast in placenta. Because of the defect on insulin receptor (IR) in the trophoblast of the gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)-associated placenta, SERT is found entrapped in the cytoplasm of the GDM-trophoblast. SERT is encoded by the same gene expressed in trophoblast and platelets. Additionally, alteration in plasma 5-HT levels and the 5-HT uptake rates are associated with the aggregation rates of platelets. Therefore, here, we investigated a novel hypothesis that GDM-associated defects in platelet IR should change their 5-HT uptake rates, and this should be a leading factor for thrombosis in GDM maternal blood. The maternal blood and the placentas were obtained at the time of cesarean section from the GDM and non-diabetic subjects (n = 6 for each group), and the platelets and trophoblasts were isolated to determine the IR activity, surface level of SERT, and their 5-HT uptake rates.Interestingly, no significant differences were evident in IR tyrosine phosphorylation or the downstream elements, AKT and S6K in platelets and their aggregation rates in both groups. Furthermore, insulin stimulation up-regulated 5-HT uptake rates of GDM-platelets as it does in the control group. However, the phosphorylation of IR and the downstream elements were significantly lower in GDM-trophoblast and showed no response to the insulin stimulation while they showed 4-fold increase to insulin stimulation in control group. Similarly, the 5-HT uptake rates of GDM-trophoblast and the SERT expression on their surface were severalfold lower compared with control subjects. IR is expressed in all tissues, but it is not known if diabetes affects IR in all tissues equally.

Consequently, identifying the mechanisms regulating post-translational modifications are critical for understanding SERT conformations and oligomerization in biological processes and diseases. As reported earlier, we demonstrated that insulin receptor (IR) in the trophoblast of GDM-placentas is impaired. Consequently, SERT which requires insulin signaling to dissociate from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins is entrapped at ER. Therefore, the 5-HT uptake rates of trophoblast cells in GDM are decreased (38Li Y. Hadden C. Singh P. Mercado C.P. Murphy P. Dajani N.K. Lowery C.L. Roberts D.J. Maroteaux L. Kilic F.

Kilic, manuscript in review. The present study was aimed to investigate whether SERT in platelets is differentially regulated in platelet by determining the 5-HT system and the platelet function in GDM. First the platelet aggregation rates in GDM and non-diabetic maternal blood were analyzed. Interestingly, GDM-platelets responded to their insulin treatment, and the 5-HT uptake rates were up-regulated suggesting the differential regulation of SERT trafficking in trophoblast versus platelets. Additional studies on the GDM-associated defect in phosphorylation of IR and the downstream elements was only found in placental trophoblast, but not in the maternal platelets. Here, for the first time we show that in GDM-trophoblast and in GDM-platelets the IR exhibits a differentially response to the impaired insulin level; perhaps due to the cell-type specific binding properties of IR. Placentas, cord, and maternal blood samples from 18-year-old or older pregnant women with normal (n = 5) or diagnosed with GDM (n = 5) were recruited for this study. Our study was carried out after an approval from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) IRB, which included these procedures, and for which subjects had previously provided written informed consent form. The health conditions of subjects were followed by their physicians (38Li Y. Hadden C. Singh P. Mercado C.P. Murphy P. Dajani N.K. Lowery C.L. Roberts D.J. Maroteaux L. Kilic F.

Briefly, each cotyledon of a placenta has been dissected, collected, and rinsed with sterile 0.9% NaCl solution. Placenta tissues were digested with DNase, Dispase, and Trypsin containing CMF Hank’s. Trophoblasts were then purified under 5–70% gradient solution. Human HLA class I ABC Ab containing Dynabeads were incubated with trophoblast to negatively purify contaminations. Trophoblast cell purify is determined via intracellular cytokeratin-7 (CK-7) Ab and trophoblast membrane protein NDOG1 Ab. Maternal blood sample has been obtained from University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) OBGYN department. Blood were maintained in 3.8% sodium citrate solution tube to avoid platelet aggregation and activation. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by adding 1/2 volume of Tyrode’s HEPES buffer to maternal blood and centrifuged at 1.0 × 103 rpm for 10 min. In each assay, a dilution of 100,000/μl of platelet in blood was applied. For aggregation assays, platelets in plasma were prepared, and platelet counts were normalized (300,000/μl) using a Hemavet 950 (Drew Scientific, Waterbury, CT). The response to collagen (3 μg/ml) as a platelet agonist was monitored by light transmittance (Chrono-log Corp., Havertown, PA) (55Ziu E. Mercado C.P. Li Y. Singh P. Ahmed B.A. Freyaldenhoven S.

The level of platelet activation was assessed using FITC-labeled P-selectin Ab (BD Pharmingen, Cat 553744). Platelets (300,000/μl) were incubated in Ab and at the end of the incubation, 300 μl of 2% formaldehyde in PBS was added to stop the reaction. The level of SERT proteins on the PM of platelets (300,000 platelets/assay) was determined using a special Ab, which is designed by our group and generated by Proteintech Group, Inc. (Chicago, IL) against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of SERT (38Li Y. Hadden C. Singh P. Mercado C.P. Murphy P. Dajani N.K. Lowery C.L. Roberts D.J. Maroteaux L.

The samples were gated for single platelets based on forward and side scatter profiles, and 20,000 events were recorded and read at the UAMS Flow Cytometry Core Facility. Trophoblast (1.5 × 106 cells per IP assay) were lysed in IP buffer (55 mm triethylamine (pH 7.5), 111 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm EDTA, 0.44% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and protease inhibitor mixture (PIM) as previously described (38Li Y.

Initially, the cell lysate was incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads to eliminate nonspecific interaction (preclear). Anti-SERT monoclonal (Mab technology, Stone Mountain, GA) Ab, was conjugated to protein A beads for 2 h prior to incubating together with pre-cleared cell lysates overnight at 4 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2277940486,"Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) is unusual among aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in having a tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing activity. Alongside the typical bacterial IleRS (such as Escherichia coli IleRS), some bacteria also have the enzymes (eukaryote-like) that cluster with eukaryotic IleRSs and exhibit low sensitivity to the antibiotic mupirocin. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the ileS1 and ileS2 genes of contemporary bacteria are the descendants of genes that might have arisen by an ancient duplication event before the separation of bacteria and archaea. We present the analysis of evolutionary constraints of the synthetic and editing reactions in eukaryotic/eukaryote-like IleRSs, which share a common origin but diverged through adaptation to different cell environments. The enzyme from the yeast cytosol exhibits tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing analogous to E. coli IleRS. This argues for the presence of this proofreading in the common ancestor of both IleRS types and an ancient origin of the synthetic site-based quality control step. Yet surprisingly, the eukaryote-like enzyme from Streptomyces griseus IleRS lacks this capacity; at the same time, its synthetic site displays the 10(3)-fold drop in sensitivity to antibiotic mupirocin relative to the yeast enzyme. The discovery that pre-transfer editing is optional in IleRSs lends support to the notion that the conserved post-transfer editing domain is the main checkpoint in these enzymes. We substantiated this by showing that under error-prone conditions S. griseus IleRS is able to rescue the growth of an E. coli lacking functional IleRS, providing the first evidence that tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing in IleRS is not essential for cell viability."

We examined whether the American Heart Association's 7 ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) metrics were independently associated with disability in a nationally representative cohort.Adults age ≥20 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2012 were included. Ideal CVH was calculated as a composite of 7 measures, each scored 0-2. Primary predictors were number of ideal CVH metrics and score of CVH metrics. The outcome was a dichotomous score from 20 activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADLs. Unadjusted and adjusted weighted logistic models estimated associations between ideal CVH and disability. The data were analyzed in 2015.Among 22692 participants, mean age was 46.9 years. Cardiac disease and stroke were present in 6.6% and 2.8%; 90.3% had poor physical activity and 89.9% poor diet. Among 3975 individuals with full CVH data, in fully adjusted models, OR for disability was 0.90 (95% CI 0.83-0.98) per point increase in ideal CVH score, and 0.84 (0.73-0.97) per additional number of ideal CVH metrics.CVH metrics were strongly and significantly associated with reduced odds of disability independently of vascular and non-vascular conditions. Poorer CVH may cause subclinical vascular disease resulting in disability."
https://openalex.org/W2290701523,"In previous work, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) in hemocytes of Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis was found to be up-regulated post-white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection using proteomic approach. However, the role of SUMO in viral infection is still unclear. In the present work, full length cDNAs of SUMO (FcSUMO) and SUMO-conjugating enzyme E2 UBC9 (FcUBC9) were cloned from F. chinensis using rapid amplification of cDNA ends approach. The open reading frame (ORF) of FcSUMO encoded a 93 amino acids peptide with the predicted molecular weight (M.W) of 10.55 kDa, and the UBC9 ORF encoded a 160 amino acids peptide with the predicted M.W of 18.35 kDa. By quantitative real-time RT-PCR, higher mRNA transcription levels of FcSUMO and FcUBC9 were detected in hemocytes and ovary of F. chinensis, and the two genes were significantly up-regulated post WSSV infection. Subsequently, the recombinant proteins of FcSUMO and FcUBC9 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and employed as immunogens for the production of polyclonal antibody (PAb). Indirect immunofluorescence assay revealed that the FcSUMO and UBC9 proteins were mainly located in the hemocytes nuclei. By western blotting, a 13.5 kDa protein and a 18.7 kDa protein in hemocytes were recognized by the PAb against SUMO or UBC9 respectively. Furthermore, gene silencing of FcSUMO and FcUBC9 were performed using RNA interference, and the results showed that the number of WSSV copies and the viral gene expressions were inhibited by knockdown of either SUMO or UBC9, and the mortalities of shrimp were also reduced. These results indicated that FcSUMO and FcUBC9 played important roles in WSSV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2291341925,"Living organisms need to regulate their gene expression in response to environmental signals and internal cues. This is a computational task where genes act as logic gates that connect to form transcriptional networks, which are shaped at all scales by evolution. Large-scale mutations such as gene duplications and deletions add and remove network components, whereas smaller mutations alter the connections between them. Selection determines what mutations are accepted, but its importance for shaping the resulting networks has been debated.To investigate the effects of selection in the shaping of transcriptional networks, we derive transcriptional logic from a combinatorially powerful yet tractable model of the binding between DNA and transcription factors. By evolving the resulting networks based on their ability to function as either a simple decision system or a circadian clock, we obtain information on the regulation and logic rules encoded in functional transcriptional networks. Comparisons are made between networks evolved for different functions, as well as with structurally equivalent but non-functional (neutrally evolved) networks, and predictions are validated against the transcriptional network of E. coli.We find that the logic rules governing gene expression depend on the function performed by the network. Unlike the decision systems, the circadian clocks show strong cooperative binding and negative regulation, which achieves tight temporal control of gene expression. Furthermore, we find that transcription factors act preferentially as either activators or repressors, both when binding multiple sites for a single target gene and globally in the transcriptional networks. This separation into positive and negative regulators requires gene duplications, which highlights the interplay between mutation and selection in shaping the transcriptional networks."
