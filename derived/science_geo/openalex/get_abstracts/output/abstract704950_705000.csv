https://openalex.org/W4283718061,"The unique topology and physics of chiral superlattices make their self-assembly from nanoparticles highly sought after yet challenging in regard to (meta)materials1–3. Here we show that tetrahedral gold nanoparticles can transform from a perovskite-like, low-density phase with corner-to-corner connections into pinwheel assemblies with corner-to-edge connections and denser packing. Whereas corner-sharing assemblies are achiral, pinwheel superlattices become strongly mirror asymmetric on solid substrates as demonstrated by chirality measures. Liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy and computational models show that van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between nanoparticles control thermodynamic equilibrium. Variable corner-to-edge connections among tetrahedra enable fine-tuning of chirality. The domains of the bilayer superlattices show strong chiroptical activity as identified by photon-induced near-field electron microscopy and finite-difference time-domain simulations. The simplicity and versatility of substrate-supported chiral superlattices facilitate the manufacture of metastructured coatings with unusual optical, mechanical and electronic characteristics. Chiroptically active pinwheel assemblies on substrates are formed by tetrahedral gold nanoparticles from the effective ‘compression’ of a perovskite-like, low-density phase, thereby enabling the manufacture of metastructured coatings with special chiroptical characteristics as identified by photon-induced near-field electron microscopy and chirality measures."
https://openalex.org/W4310155672,"CRISPR-associated transposons (CAST) are programmable mobile genetic elements that insert large DNA cargos using an RNA-guided mechanism1-3. CAST elements contain multiple conserved proteins: a CRISPR effector (Cas12k or Cascade), a AAA+ regulator (TnsC), a transposase (TnsA-TnsB) and a target-site-associated factor (TniQ). These components are thought to cooperatively integrate DNA via formation of a multisubunit transposition integration complex (transpososome). Here we reconstituted the approximately 1 MDa type V-K CAST transpososome from Scytonema hofmannii (ShCAST) and determined its structure using single-particle cryo-electon microscopy. The architecture of this transpososome reveals modular association between the components. Cas12k forms a complex with ribosomal subunit S15 and TniQ, stabilizing formation of a full R-loop. TnsC has dedicated interaction interfaces with TniQ and TnsB. Of note, we observe TnsC-TnsB interactions at the C-terminal face of TnsC, which contribute to the stimulation of ATPase activity. Although the TnsC oligomeric assembly deviates slightly from the helical configuration found in isolation, the TnsC-bound target DNA conformation differs markedly in the transpososome. As a consequence, TnsC makes new protein-DNA interactions throughout the transpososome that are important for transposition activity. Finally, we identify two distinct transpososome populations that differ in their DNA contacts near TniQ. This suggests that associations with the CRISPR effector can be flexible. This ShCAST transpososome structure enhances our understanding of CAST transposition systems and suggests ways to improve CAST transposition for precision genome-editing applications."

https://openalex.org/W4310353098,"Although some human studies have reported gut microbiome changes in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), gut microbiome alterations in preclinical AD, i.e., cerebral amyloidosis without cognitive impairment, is largely unknown.We aimed to identify gut microbial alterations associated with preclinical AD by comparing cognitively normal (CN) older adults with cerebral Aβ deposition (Aβ+ CN) and those without cerebral Aβ deposition (Aβ- CN).Seventy-eight CN older participants (18 Aβ+ CN and 60 Aβ- CN) were included, and all participants underwent clinical assessment and Pittsburg compound B-positron emission tomography. The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene of genomic DNA extracted from feces was amplified and sequenced to establish the microbial community.Generalized linear model analysis revealed that the genera Megamonas (B = 3.399, q<0.001), Serratia (B = 3.044, q = 0.005), Leptotrichia (B = 5.862, q = 0.024) and Clostridium (family Clostridiaceae) (B = 0.788, q = 0.034) were more abundant in the Aβ+ CN group than the Aβ- CN group. In contrast, genera CF231 (B = -3.237, q< 0.001), Victivallis (B = -3.447, q = 0.004) Enterococcus (B = -2.044, q = 0.042), Mitsuokella (B = -2.119, q = 0.042) and Clostridium (family Erysipelotrichaceae) (B = -2.222, q = 0.043) were decreased in Aβ+ CN compared to Aβ- CN. Notably, the classification model including the differently abundant genera could effectively distinguish Aβ+ CN from Aβ- CN (AUC = 0.823).Our findings suggest that specific alterations of gut bacterial taxa are related to preclinical AD, which means these changes may precede cognitive decline. Therefore, examining changes in the microbiome may be helpful in preclinical AD screening."
https://openalex.org/W4310150078,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is widely recognized as an effective treatment for end-stage knee osteoarthritis (OA). Compared with conventional TKA, robotic-arm assisted TKA may improve patients' functionality and resulting quality of life by more accurate and precise component placement. Currently, the literature on cost-effectiveness of robotic-arm assisted TKA in the US is limited. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of robotic-arm assisted TKA relative to TKA in the Medicare-aged population including exploring the impact of hospital volume on cost-effectiveness outcomes.We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate the costs, health outcomes, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of robotic-arm assisted TKA vs TKA in Medicare population with OA. We evaluated cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). We sourced costs from the literature including episode-of-care (EOC) costs from a Medicare study. We assessed cost-effectiveness of robotic-arm assisted TKA by hospital procedure volume and conducted deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA).For the average patient treated in a hospital with an annual volume of 50 procedures, robotic-arm assisted TKA resulted in a total QALY of 6.18 relative to 6.17 under conventional TKA. Total discounted costs per patient were $32,535 and $31,917 for robotic-arm assisted TKA and conventional TKA, respectively. Robotic-arm assisted TKA was cost-effective in the base case with an ICER of $41,331/QALY. In univariate DSA, cost-effectiveness outcomes were most sensitive to the annual hospital procedure volume. Robotic-arm assisted TKA was cost-effective at a WTP of $50,000/QALY only when hospital volume exceeded 49 procedures per year. In PSA, robotic-arm assisted TKA was cost-effective at a $50,000/QALY WTP threshold in 50.4% of 10,000 simulations.Despite high robotic purchase costs, robotic-arm assisted TKA is likely to be cost-effective relative to TKA in the Medicare population with knee OA in high-volume hospitals through lowering revision rates and decreasing post-acute care costs. Higher-volume hospitals may deliver higher value in performing in robotic-arm assisted TKA."

https://openalex.org/W4310337197,"Background Smartphone addiction is very prevalent among college students, especially Chinese college students, and it can cause many psychological problems for college students. However, there is no valid research instrument to evaluate Chinese college students’ smartphone addiction. Objective This study aimed to translate the Smartphone Addiction Scale—Short Version (SAS-SV) into Chinese and evaluate the psychometric characteristics of the Smartphone Addiction Scale- Chinese Short version (SAS-CSV) among Chinese college students. Methods The SAS-SV was translated into Chinese using the forward-backward method. The SAS-CSV was completed by 557 Chinese college students (sample 1: n = 279; sample 2: n = 278). 62 college students were randomly selected from the 557 Chinese college students to be meas- ured twice, with an interval of two weeks. The reliability of the SAS-CSV was evaluated by internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability, and the validity of the SAS-CSV was evaluated by content validity, structural validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Results The SAS-CSV presented good content validity, high internal consistency (sample 1: α = 0.829; sample 2: α = 0.881), and good test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.975; 95% CI: 0.966–0.985). After one exploratory factor analysis, three components (tolerance, withdrawal, and negative effect) with eigenvalues greater than 1 were obtained, and the cumulative variance contribution was 50.995%. The results of confirmatory factor analysis indicated that all the fit indexes reached the standard of good model fit (χ 2 /df = 1.883, RMSEA = 0.056, NFI = 0.954, RFI = 0.935, IFI = 0.978, TLI = 0.969, CFI = 0.978). The SAS-CSV presented good convergent validity for the factor loading of all the items ranged from 0.626 to 0.892 (higher than 0.50), the three latent variables’ AVE ranged from 0.524 to 0.637 (higher than 0.50), and the three latent variables’ CR ranged from 0.813 to 0.838 (higher than 0.70). Moreover, the square roots of the AVE of component 1 (tolerance), component 2 (withdrawal) and component 3 (negative effect) were 0.724, 0.778, and 0.798, respectively, higher than they were with other correlation coefficients, indicating that the SAS-CSV had good discrimination validity. Conclusion The SAS-CSV is a valid instrument for measuring smartphone addiction among Chinese college students."
https://openalex.org/W4310089686,"Calculating the importance of influential nodes and ranking them based on their diffusion power is one of the open issues and critical research fields in complex networks. It is essential to identify an attribute that can compute and rank the diffusion power of nodes with high accuracy, despite the plurality of nodes and many relationships between them. Most methods presented only use one structural attribute to capture the influence of individuals, which is not entirely accurate in most networks. The reason is that network structures are disparate, and these methods will be inefficient by altering the network. A possible solution is to use more than one attribute to examine the characteristics aspect and address the issue mentioned. Therefore, this study presents a method for identifying and ranking node’s ability to spread information. The purpose of this study is to present a multi-attribute decision making approach for determining diffusion power and classification of nodes, which uses several local and semi-local attributes. Local and semi-local attributes with linear time complexity are used, considering different aspects of the network nodes. Evaluations performed on datasets of real networks demonstrate that the proposed method performs satisfactorily in allocating distinct ranks to nodes; moreover, as the infection rate of nodes increases, the accuracy of the proposed method increases."
https://openalex.org/W4310351974,"The sorghum-sudangrass hybrid is a vital annual gramineous herbage. Few reports exist on its ultra-high-density genetic map. In this study, we sought to create an ultra-high-density genetic linkage map for this hybrid to strengthen its functional genomics research and genetic breeding. We used 150 sorghum-sudangrass hybrid F 2 individuals and their parents (scattered ear sorghum and red hull sudangrass) for high-throughput sequencing on the basis of whole genome resequencing. In total, 1,180.66 Gb of data were collected. After identification, filtration for integrity, and partial segregation, over 5,656 single nucleotide polymorphism markers of high quality were detected. An ultra-high-density genetic linkage map was constructed using these data. The markers covered approximately 2,192.84 cM of the map with average marker intervals of 0.39 cM. The length ranged from 115.39 cM to 264.04 cM for the 10 linkage groups. Currently, this represents the first genetic linkage map of this size, number of molecular markers, density, and coverage for sorghum-sudangrass hybrid. The findings of this study provide valuable genome-level information on species evolution and comparative genomics analysis and lay the foundation for further research on quantitative trait loci fine mapping and gene cloning and marker-assisted breeding of important traits in sorghum-sudangrass hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W4310358469,"Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a serious cardiovascular disease that can lead to cardiac arrest if not diagnosed promptly. However, in the actual diagnosis and treatment of ACS, there will be a large number of redundant related features that interfere with the judgment of professionals. Further, existing methods have difficulty identifying high-quality ACS features from these data, and the interpretability work is insufficient. In response to this problem, this paper uses a hybrid feature selection method based on gradient boosting trees and recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) to reduce ACS feature redundancy and uses interpretable feature learning for feature selection to retain the most discriminative features. While reducing the feature set search space, this method can balance model simplicity and learning performance to select the best feature subset. We leverage the interpretability of gradient boosting trees to aid in understanding key features of ACS, linking the eigenvalue meaning of instances to model risk predictions to provide interpretability for the classifier. The data set used in this paper is patient records after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a tertiary hospital in Fujian Province, China from 2016 to 2021. In this paper, we experimentally explored the impact of our method on ACS risk prediction. We extracted 25 key variables from 430 complex ACS medical features, with a feature reduction rate of 94.19%, and identified 5 key ACS factors. Compared with different baseline methods (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron, and 1D Convolutional Networks), the results show that our method achieves the highest Accuracy of 98.8%."
https://openalex.org/W4310089661,"Salt marshes are ecologically and economically important features of coastal environments that are vulnerable to sea level rise, the rate of which has accelerated in recent decades along the southeastern US Atlantic coast. Increased flooding frequency and duration across the marsh platform is predicted to impact vegetation community structure and overall marsh persistence, but the effect of changing inundation patterns on biogeochemical processes in marsh sediments remains largely unexplored. As part of a long-term monitoring effort to assess how marshes are responding to sea level rise in North Inlet estuary (South Carolina, USA), we collected data on porewater nutrient concentrations from a series of permanent monitoring plots across multiple transects spanning the marsh elevation gradient during the growing season from 2009 to 2019. Additionally, we calculated time inundated for each plot using local water level data and high-resolution elevation measurements to assess the change in time flooded at each plot. Our results indicate that both NH4 and PO4 nutrient concentrations have increased in most permanent plots over the 11-year study period and that nutrient concentrations are higher with increasing proximity to the creek. Spatial patterns in nutrient increases through time are coincident with considerable increases in tidal inundation observed over the marsh platform. Across plots located in the low marsh, porewater NH4 and PO4 concentrations have risen at average rates of 8.96 μM/year and 0.86 μM/year, respectively, and have reached rates as high as 27.25 μM/year and 3.13 μM/year. We suggest that increased inundation time due to rising sea level has altered biogeochemical conditions influencing nutrient availability in marsh porewater, resulting in increases that likely have relevance for larger scale nutrient cycles as well as marsh ecosystem stability and function."

Objective This study aimed to establish a survival analysis and identify the risk factors for patients with COVID-19 in an upper middle-income city in Brazil. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 280 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The eCOVID platform provided data to monitor COVID-19 cases and help the communication between professionals. Results Age ≥ 65 years was associated with decreased survival (54.8%), and females had a lower survival rate than males (p = 0.01). Regarding risk factors, urea concentration (p&lt;0.001), hospital length of stay (p = 0.002), oxygen concentration (p = 0.005), and age (p = 0.02) were associated with death. Conclusion Age, hospital length of stay, high blood urea concentration, and low oxygen concentration were associated with death by COVID-19 in the studied population. These findings corroborate with studies conducted in research centers worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W4310136340,"Small Heat shock proteins (sHsps) are a family of molecular chaperones that bind nonnative proteins in an ATP-independent manner. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes 16 different sHsps, among them Hsp17, which is evolutionarily distinct from other sHsps in the nematode. The structure and mechanism of Hsp17 and how these may differ from other sHsps remain unclear. Here, we find that Hsp17 has a distinct expression pattern, structural organization, and chaperone function. Consistent with its presence under nonstress conditions, and in contrast to many other sHsps, we determined that Hsp17 is a mono-disperse, permanently active chaperone in vitro, which interacts with hundreds of different C. elegans proteins under physiological conditions. Additionally, our cryo-EM structure of Hsp17 reveals that in the 24-mer complex, 12 N-terminal regions are involved in its chaperone function. These flexible regions are located on the outside of the spherical oligomer, whereas the other 12 N-terminal regions are engaged in stabilizing interactions in its interior. This allows the same region in Hsp17 to perform different functions depending on the topological context. Taken together, our results reveal structural and functional features that further define the structural basis of permanently active sHsps."
https://openalex.org/W4310149781,"A linking procedure establishes a “bridge” between the scores from different patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments that measure similar constructs. After developing a linking relationship however, it is critical to evaluate whether this relationship can be generalized to different groups. Our study aims to validate a published crosswalk for score conversion between the Brief Symptom Inventory Depression subscale and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression 8a using an independent sample. Data were from a sample of young men who have sex with men (MSM), which differs in terms of participant age, race, and ethnicity from the sample used to develop the existing crosswalk. The validity of the newly derived crosswalk was evaluated in terms of the correlation, mean difference and standard deviation between the observed and the linked scores. The two crosswalks were further compared to evaluate if the difference was within an acceptable range. More than half of the item parameters obtained from the two samples were found to overlap in their confidence intervals. Differences between each pair of scores in the two crosswalks was within three T-score points, well within the range of each crosswalk score’s standard error. This study concludes that an existing crosswalk is replicable on a sample that differs from that used for crosswalk development, but future research should continue to examine the generalizability of the linked parameters and evaluate the reproducibility of this crosswalk to other populations."
https://openalex.org/W4310353083,"The urban-wildland interface is expanding and increasing the risk of human-wildlife conflict. Some wildlife species adapt to or avoid living near people, while others select for anthropogenic resources and are thus more prone to conflict. To promote human-wildlife coexistence, wildlife and land managers need to understand how conflict relates to habitat and resource use in the urban-wildland interface. We investigated black bear (Ursus americanus) habitat use across a gradient of human disturbance in a North American hotspot of human-black bear conflict. We used camera traps to monitor bear activity from July 2018 to July 2019, and compared bear habitat use to environmental and anthropogenic variables and spatiotemporal probabilities of conflict. Bears predominantly used areas of high vegetation productivity and increased their nocturnality near people. Still, bears used more high-conflict areas in summer and autumn, specifically rural lands with ripe crops. Our results suggest that bears are generally modifying their behaviours in the urban-wildland interface through spatial and temporal avoidance of humans, which may facilitate coexistence. However, conflict still occurs, especially in autumn when hyperphagia and peak crop availability attract bears to abundant rural food resources. To improve conflict mitigation practices, we recommend targeting seasonal rural attractants with pre-emptive fruit picking, bear-proof compost containment, and other forms of behavioural deterrence. By combining camera-trap monitoring of a large carnivore along an anthropogenic gradient with conflict mapping, we provide a framework for evidence-based improvements in human-wildlife coexistence."
https://openalex.org/W4310353084,"Behaviour change interventions represent key means for supporting healthy ageing and reducing dementia risk yet brief, scalable behaviour change interventions targeting dementia risk reduction in older adults is currently lacking. Here we describe the aims and design of the three-month Brain Bootcamp initiative that seeks to target multiple dementia risk and protective factors (healthy eating, physical, social and cognitive inactivity), through the use of multiple behaviour change techniques, including goal-setting for behaviour, information about health consequences and physical prompts to change behaviours that reduce dementia risk among older adults. Our secondary aim is to understand participants' views of dementia prevention and explore the acceptability and integration of this campaign into daily life.Brain Bootcamp is a pre-post feasibility trial conducted in Sydney, Australia beginning in January 2021 until late August. Participants aged ≥65 years living independently in the community (n = 252), recruited through social media and flyers, will provide information about their demographics, medical history, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, mental health, physical activity, cognitive activity, and diet to generate a dementia risk profile at baseline and assess change therein at three-month follow-up. During the intervention, participants will receive a resource pack containing their individual risk profile, educational booklet on dementia risk factors and four physical items designed to prompt physical, social and mental activity, and better nutrition. Outcome measures include change in dementia risk scores, dementia awareness and motivation. A qualitative process evaluation will interview a sample of participants on the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention.This will be the first short-term multi-domain intervention targeting dementia risk reduction in older adults. Findings will generate a new evidence base on how to best support efforts targeting lifestyle changes and to identify ways to optimise acceptability and effectiveness towards brain health for older adults.ACTRN 381046 (registered 17/02/2021); Pre-results."
https://openalex.org/W4310353152,"Background The exclusive use of hygienic materials during menstruation (sanitary napkins, locally made napkins, tampons, and menstrual cups) among urban women in India has been increasing over time. However, little is known about the wealth-based disparity in the exclusive use of hygienic materials during menstruation among these women. This study, therefore, measures wealth-based inequality in the exclusive use of hygienic materials during menstruation among urban women in India. Furthermore, the measured inequality is decomposed to unravel its contributing factors. Data and methods Using data from the National Family Health Survey-5 (2019–21), we calculated the Erreygers normalized concentration index (CI) for India and each of its states to measure wealth-based inequality in the exclusive use of hygienic materials during menstruation among women in urban India. Further, we decomposed the Erreygers CI to estimate the relative contribution of covariates to wealth-based inequality in the exclusive use of hygienic materials during menstruation. The analysis included 54,561 urban women aged 15–24 from 28 states and eight union territories of India. Results The Erreygers CI value of 0.302 indicated a pro-rich inequality in the exclusive use of hygienic materials among urban women in India. While all the states and UTs showed pro-rich inequality, the CI varied considerably across the country. Among the bigger states, the inequality was highest in Madhya Pradesh (CI: 0.45), Assam (CI: 0.44), Bihar (CI: 0.41), and West Bengal (CI: 0.37) and the lowest in the south Indian states of Tamil Nadu (CI: 0.10), Andhra Pradesh (CI: 0.15), Telangana (CI: 0.15), and Kerala (CI: 0.20). Erreygers decomposition revealed that wealth-based inequality in women’s education and mass media exposure contributed almost 80% of the wealth-based inequality in the exclusive use of hygienic materials during menstruation among urban women in India. Conclusion Substantial pro-rich inequality in the exclusive use of hygienic materials suggests that the policies and program initiatives should prioritize reaching out to poor women to increase the overall rate of exclusive use of hygienic materials during menstruation in urban India."
https://openalex.org/W4307902255,"The serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) spontaneously undergoes a massive structural change from a metastable and active conformation, with a solvent-accessible reactive center loop (RCL), to a stable, inactive, or latent conformation, with the RCL inserted into the central β-sheet. Physiologically, conversion to the latent state is regulated by the binding of vitronectin, which hinders the latency transition rate approximately twofold. The molecular mechanisms leading to this rate change are unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of vitronectin on the PAI-1 latency transition using all-atom path sampling simulations in explicit solvent. In simulated latency transitions of free PAI-1, the RCL is quite mobile as is the gate, the region that impedes RCL access to the central β-sheet. This mobility allows the formation of a transient salt bridge that facilitates the transition; this finding rationalizes existing mutagenesis results. Vitronectin binding reduces RCL and gate mobility by allosterically rigidifying structural elements over 40 Å away from the binding site, thus blocking transition to the latent conformation. The effects of vitronectin are propagated by a network of dynamically correlated residues including a number of conserved sites that were previously identified as important for PAI-1 stability. Simulations also revealed a transient pocket populated only in the vitronectin-bound state, corresponding to a cryptic drug-binding site identified by crystallography. Overall, these results shed new light on PAI-1 latency transition regulation by vitronectin and illustrate the potential of path sampling simulations for understanding functional protein conformational changes and for facilitating drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W4309938390,"S-acylation is an essential post-translational modification, which is mediated by a family of 23 zDHHC enzymes in humans. Several thousand proteins are modified by S-acylation; however, we lack a detailed understanding of how enzyme-substrate recognition and specificity is achieved. Previous work showed that the ankyrin repeat domain of zDHHC17 (ANK17) recognizes a short linear motif, known as the zDHHC ANK binding motif (zDABM) in substrate protein SNAP25, as a mechanism of substrate recruitment prior to S-acylation. Here, we investigated the S-acylation of the Sprouty and SPRED family of proteins by zDHHC17. Interestingly, although Sprouty-2 (Spry2) contains a zDABM that interacts with ANK17, this mode of binding is dispensable for S-acylation, and indeed removal of the zDABM does not completely ablate binding to zDHHC17. Furthermore, the related SPRED3 protein interacts with and is efficiently S-acylated by zDHHC17, despite lacking a zDABM. We undertook mutational analysis of SPRED3 to better understand the basis of its zDABM-independent interaction with zDHHC17. This analysis found that the cysteine-rich SPR domain of SPRED3, which is the defining feature of all Sprouty and SPRED proteins, interacts with zDHHC17. Surprisingly, the interaction with SPRED3 was independent of ANK17. Our mutational analysis of Spry2 was consistent with the SPR domain of this protein containing a zDHHC17-binding site, and Spry2 also showed detectable binding to a zDHHC17 mutant lacking the ANK domain. Thus, zDHHC17 can recognize its substrates through zDABM-dependent and/or zDABM-independent mechanisms, and some substrates display more than one mode of binding to this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W4310089660,"Background In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Bangladesh, socioeconomic inequalities in access to maternity care remain a substantial public health concern. Due to the paucity of research, we attempted to determine the factors affecting the facility delivery, quantify wealth-related inequality, and identify potential components that could explain the inequality. Methods We used the latest Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS 2017–18) data in this study. We utilized logistic regression to investigate the associated factors of facility delivery. The concentration curves (CC), concentration index (CIX) and decomposition of CIX techniques were used to analyze the inequality in-facility delivery. Results Women living in the urban areas, age at first birth after (18–24 years ≥25 years), being overweight/obese, having secondary and higher-level education of the women and their husband, seeking four or more ANC, coming from more affluent households, and women with high enlightenment were significant determinants of facility delivery. The concentration curve was below the line of equality, and the relative concentration index (CIX) was 0.205 (p &lt;0.001), indicating that women from wealthy groups were disproportionately more prevalent to facility delivery. The decomposition analysis reveals that wealth status of women (57.40%), age at first birth (10.24%), husband’s education (8.96%), husband’s occupation (7.35%), education of women (7.13%), women’s enlightenment (6.15%), residence (8.64%) and ANC visit (6.84%) are the most major contributors to the inequalities in utilizing facility delivery. Conclusion The study demonstrates a clear disparity in the use of facility delivery among Bangladeshi women; hence, immediate action is required to lower the inequalities, with a special emphasis on the contributing factors."
https://openalex.org/W4310089711,"The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL111A gene encodes several homologs of the cellular interleukin 10 (cIL-10). Alternative splicing in the UL111A region produces two relatively well-characterized transcripts designated cmvIL-10 (isoform A) and LAcmvIL-10 (isoform B). The cmvIL-10 protein is the best characterized, both structurally and functionally, and has many immunosuppressive activities similar to cIL-10, while LAcmvIL-10 has more restricted biological activities. Alternative splicing also results in five less studied UL111A transcripts encoding additional proteins homologous to cIL-10 (isoforms C to G). These transcripts were identified during productive HCMV infection of MRC-5 cells with the high passage laboratory adapted AD169 strain, and the structure and properties of the corresponding proteins are largely unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether these protein isoforms are able to bind the cellular IL-10 receptor and induce signalling. In the present study, we investigated the expression spectrum of UL111A transcripts in fully permissive MRC-5 cells and semi permissive U251 cells infected with the low passage HCMV strain TB40E. We identified a new spliced transcript (H) expressed during productive infection. Using computational methods, we carried out molecular modelling studies on the three-dimensional structures of the HCMV IL-10 proteins encoded by the transcripts detected in our work (cmvIL-10 (A), LAcmvIL-10 (B), E, F and H) and on their interaction with the human IL-10 receptor (IL-10R1). The modelling predicts clear differences between the isoform structures. Furthermore, the in silico simulations (molecular dynamics simulation and normal-mode analyses) allowed us to evaluate regions that contain potential receptor binding sites in each isoform. The analyses demonstrate that the complexes between the isoforms and IL-10R1 present different types of molecular interactions and consequently different affinities and stabilities. The knowledge about structure and expression of specific viral IL-10 isoforms has implications for understanding of their properties and role in HCMV immune evasion and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4310149775,"Coaching style is key to athletes' performance and mental well-being. However, few attempts have examined the effects of coaching style on athletes in a Chinese cultural context. Based on previous literature and 23 expert interviews (11 with athletes and 12 with coaches), we rebuilt a 16-items on the Controlling Coach Behaviors Scale. In study 1, 130 provincial team athletes completed a 16-items questionnaire on controlling coach behaviors. The questionnaire items were then screened using exploratory factor analysis and transformed into a formal scale. In study 2, another 560 provincial athletes completed several measures related to coaching style, motivation, subjective vitality, and burnout, and systematic tests were carried out to validate the scale. Study 3 examined the test-retest reliability of the Controlling Coach Behaviors Scale over a 2-week interval. Finally, the present study yielded a nine-item Controlling Coach Behaviors Scale with three dimensions (controlling use of reward, negative conditional regard, and excessive personal control). It suggests that cultural differences played an important role in the communication between athletes and coaches. The new Controlling Coach Behaviors Scale shows good validity and can be used in future research."
https://openalex.org/W4310157248,"Drug efflux is a common resistance mechanism found in bacteria and cancer cells, but studies providing comprehensive functional insights are scarce. In this study, we performed deep mutational scanning (DMS) on the bacterial ABC transporter EfrCD to determine the drug efflux activity profile of more than 1,430 single variants. These systematic measurements revealed that the introduction of negative charges at different locations within the large substrate binding pocket results in strongly increased efflux activity toward positively charged ethidium, whereas additional aromatic residues did not display the same effect. Data analysis in the context of an inward-facing cryogenic electron microscopy structure of EfrCD uncovered a high-affinity binding site, which releases bound drugs through a peristaltic transport mechanism as the transporter transits to its outward-facing conformation. Finally, we identified substitutions resulting in rapid Hoechst influx without affecting the efflux activity for ethidium and daunorubicin. Hence, single mutations can convert EfrCD into a drug-specific ABC importer."
https://openalex.org/W4310352365,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the mental health of international migrants globally. Chile has managed its response to the pandemic in an ongoing context of social unrest and combined regional migratory and humanitarian crisis. The country's population presents a high prevalence of common mental disorders and a high suicide rate, with limited access to mental healthcare. International migrants in Chile represent 8% of the total population, and although a socioeconomically heterogenous group, they face social vulnerability, a range of mental health stressors and additional barriers to access mental healthcare. This study describes the mental health outcomes, stressors, response, and coping strategies perceived by international migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile.A qualitative case study was carried out through individual online interviews to 30 international migrants living in Chile during the pandemic and 10 experts of the social and health care sectors. An inductive content analysis was carried out, a process during which the researchers sought to identify patterns and themes derived from the data. Participants experienced mainly negative mental health outcomes, including anxiety and depression symptomatology. Stressors included the virus itself, work, living and socioeconomic conditions, discrimination, fear for their family and distance caring. Institutional responses to address the mental health of international migrants during the pandemic in Chile were limited and participants relied mainly on individual coping strategies.The pandemic can represent an important opportunity to strengthen mental health systems for the general population as well as for population groups experiencing social vulnerability, if the issues identified and the lessons learned are translated into action at national, regional, and international level. Promoting the mental health of international migrants means recognising migration as a social determinant of mental health and adopting a cross-cultural as well as a Human Rights approach."
https://openalex.org/W4310353044,"In this paper, we propose a partial randomized response technique to collect reliable sensitive data for estimation of population proportion in ranked set sampling (RSS) scheme using auxiliary information. The idea is to increase confidence and (or) co-operation of the respondents by providing them the option of both ‘direct’ and ‘randomized’ response for the inquired sensitive question. This option is quite logical because perception of sensitive (insensitive) inquiry can vary among respondents. The properties of the proposed method are discussed and compared with existing randomized response techniques. Cost analysis is also carried out to prove supremacy of the suggested method. Finally, an application to clinical trial on AIDS is included."
https://openalex.org/W4310353076,"In a financial system, entities (e.g., companies or markets) face systemic risk that could lead to financial instability. To prevent this impact, we require quantitative systemic risk management we can carry out using conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) and a network model. The former measures any targeted entity's tail risk conditional on another entity being financially distressed; the latter represents the financial system through a set of nodes and a set of edges. In this study, we modify CoVaR along with its multivariate extension (MCoVaR) considering the joint conditioning events of multiple entities. We accomplish this by first employing a multivariate Johnson's SU risk model to capture the asymmetry and leptokurticity of the entities' asset returns. We then adopt the Cornish-Fisher expansion to account for the analytic higher-order conditional moments in modifying (M)CoVaR. In addition, we attempt to construct a conditional tail risk network. We identify its edges using a corresponding Delta (M)CoVaR reflecting the systemic risk contribution and further compute the strength and clustering coefficient of its nodes. When applying the financial system to global foreign exchange (forex) markets before and during COVID-19, we revealed that the resulting expanded (M)CoVaR forecast exhibited a better conditional coverage performance than its unexpanded version. Its superior performance appeared to be more evident over the COVID-19 period. Furthermore, our network analysis shows that advanced and emerging forex markets generally play roles as net transmitters and net receivers of systemic risk, respectively. The former (respectively, the latter) also possessed a high tendency to cluster with their neighbors in the network during (respectively, before) COVID-19. Overall, the interconnectedness and clustering tendency of the examined global forex markets substantially increased as the pandemic progressed."
https://openalex.org/W4310353183,"Background Facial injuries affect one-third of severely injured patients. These injuries have devastating long-term negative impacts on quality of life. We aimed to study the epidemiology of facial injuries and factors affecting the mortality of hospitalized facial trauma patients in Al-Ain City, United Arab Emirates. Methodology This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from Al-Ain Hospital Trauma Registry. All patients with facial injury who were hospitalized for more than 24 hours or who died after arrival at the hospital during the period from January 2014 to December 2017 were studied. Two sample data analysis was used to compare patients who died and those who survived. Significant factors were then entered into a backward logistic regression model to define factors affecting mortality. Results 408 patients having a mean age of 31.9 years were studied, 87.3% were males. The main mechanisms of injury were road traffic collisions (52.2%) and fall from height (11.3%). 289 (70.8%) patients had associated injuries which were mainly in the head and chest. The backward logistic regression model showed that the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was the only factor that predicted mortality, p&lt;0.0001 with the best cut-off point of 7.5, having a sensitivity of 0.972 and a specificity of 0.8. The ROC had an area under the curve of 0.924. Conclusion The majority of facial injury patients in our setting are young males who were involved in road traffic collisions or falls from height. The most important factor predicting the mortality of these patients was the low GCS. Those having a GCS of 8 and more had a better chance of survival. This information is very important when counseling patients or their relatives for facial surgery."
https://openalex.org/W4310353194,"Brooding rumination is positively associated with symptoms of both depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, non-clinical cross-cultural research indicates that culture may influence these associations. This study aimed to examine the moderating effect of cultural group (Australian versus Malaysian) on the associations between brooding rumination and symptoms of depression and PTSD. European Australians (n = 109) and Malaysians of varying Asian heritages (n = 144) completed an online questionnaire containing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD checklist for DSM-5 and the Ruminative Response Scale-Short Form. First, Malaysian participants had higher brooding rumination than Australian participants. Second, higher levels of brooding rumination were positively associated with depression and PTSD symptom severity. Third, contrary to our expectations, cultural group did not moderate the relationships between brooding rumination and symptoms of depression and PTSD. If replicable, these results suggest that existing assessment and treatment approaches that target brooding rumination may apply to Malaysian individuals with depression and PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W4310089726,"Migraine is an enormous burden on society, but relevant studies are limited. The population of interest of this study was migraine or probable migraine (PM) in Korea. In this population, we aimed to assess the productivity loss through the level of severity defined by monthly migraine days (MMD) and analgesic frequency and to estimate costs and associated factors of productivity loss. We conducted an online survey of adults with migraine symptoms. We defined migraine and PM using the modified International Classification of Headache Disorders, second edition. Severity level was defined by subgroups of MMD (0-3, 4-14, and ≥15 days) and analgesic frequency (0, 1, 2, 3, and ≥4 per week). Productivity loss was assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire and consisted of absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work productivity loss, and activity impairment. The costs of productivity loss due to absenteeism and presenteeism were calculated in 2020 USD. We used negative binomial regression to identify the factors associated with the costs of productivity loss. We identified 362 respondents with migraine or PM. Mean age was 41.7 years, 75.7% were female (N = 274), and 73.2% (N = 265) were employed. On average, productivity losses due to absenteeism and presenteeism were 8.1% and 39.7%, respectively. As MMD increased, there was a trend toward increased activity impairment, presenteeism, and overall work productivity loss. The mean overall productivity loss cost was USD 44.61 per person per day. Duration of migraine attacks was significantly associated with higher absenteeism costs. The results of this study indicate that the higher the MMD, the greater the productivity loss in patients with migraine or PM in Korea. We also found that patients with low-frequency migraine and PM experienced substantial productivity loss. This study provides comprehensive evidence of the burden of migraine in Korea using a representative sample."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the pregnancy outcomes of immigrant women in Korea. Data for all pregnant women who gave birth between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2016 were obtained using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service Database. Pregnant women were divided into two groups: Korean and immigrant women. The main outcome measures were adverse pregnancy outcomes including gestational diabetes of mellitus, preeclampsia, cesarean section, placental abrnomalities, and postpartum hemorrhage. The odds of gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, cesarean section, placental previa, placental abruptio, and postpartum hemorrhage was compared between the two groups. Among 4,439,778 pregnant women who gave birth during the study period, 168,940 (3.8%) were immigrant women. The odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.28), and cesarean section (adjusted OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.25-1.28)were higher in immigrant women than in Korean women, but the odds of preeclampsia (adjusted OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.81-0.86) and postpartum hemorrhage (adjusted OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.97) was lower in immigrant women than in Korean women. Immigrant women had different pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancy and postpartum management that reflects these characteristics will be necessary for immigrant women."

However, due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, adjustment to an imminent death may be more difficult. This study investigates factors related to pre-loss grief and preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic and their relationship with COVID-19 related fears.Data of 299 participants from a cross-sectional study was used. Participants were included if they were relatives of people with cancer, spoke German and were at least 18 years. Multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to measure the relationship between predictors (dysfunctional coping, emotion-focused coping, problem-focused coping, attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, COVID-19 related fears, prognosis, perceived depth of the relationship, perceived conflict in the relationship, health status) and pre-loss grief, preparedness for caregiving and preparedness for death as the dependent variables.Perceived depth (β = .365, p < .001), COVID-19 related fears (β = .141, p = .002), prognosis for death (β = .241, p < .001), dysfunctional coping strategies (β = .281, p < .001) and emotion-focused coping strategies (β = -.320, p < .001) significantly predicted pre-loss grief. Prognosis for death (β = .347, p < .001), dysfunctional coping strategies (β = -.229, p < .001), emotion-focused coping strategies (β = .242, p < .001), COVID-19 related fears (β = -.112, p = .037) and health status (β = .123, p = .025) significantly predicted preparedness for death. Dysfunctional coping (β = -.147, p = .009), problem-focused coping (β = .162, p = .009), emotion-focused coping (β = .148, p = .017), COVID-19 related fears (β = -.151, p = .006), attachment anxiety (β = -.169, p = .003), perceived conflict in the relationship with the patient with cancer (β = -.164, p = .004), perceived depth in the relationship (β = .116, p = .048) and health status (β = .157, p = .003) significantly predicted preparedness for caregiving.This study shows COVID-19 pandemic impacts on the grieving process of relatives of patients with cancer. Consequently, screening for pre-loss grief, preparedness and their associated factors may help provide early support for relatives of people with cancer at need. However, further research is needed to help understand the stability of pre-loss grief and preparedness."
https://openalex.org/W4310337204,"The multi-subunit Mediator complex plays a critical role in gene expression by bridging enhancer-bound transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II machinery. Although experimental case studies suggest differential roles of Mediator subunits, a comprehensive view of the specific set of genes regulated by individual subunits in a developing tissue is still missing. Here we address this fundamental question by focusing on the Med19 subunit and using the Drosophila wing imaginal disc as a developmental model. By coupling auxin-inducible degradation of endogenous Med19 in vivo with RNA-seq, we got access to the early consequences of Med19 elimination on gene expression. Differential gene expression analysis reveals that Med19 is not globally required for mRNA transcription but specifically regulates positively or negatively less than a quarter of the expressed genes. By crossing our transcriptomic data with those of Drosophila gene expression profile database, we found that Med19-dependent genes are highly enriched with spatially-regulated genes while the expression of most constitutively expressed genes is not affected upon Med19 loss. Whereas globally downregulation does not exceed upregulation, we identified a functional class of genes encoding spatially-regulated transcription factors, and more generally developmental regulators, responding unidirectionally to Med19 loss with an expression collapse. Moreover, we show in vivo that the Notch-responsive wingless and the E(spl)-C genes require Med19 for their expression. Combined with experimental evidences suggesting that Med19 could function as a direct transcriptional effector of Notch signaling, our data support a model in which Med19 plays a critical role in the transcriptional activation of developmental genes in response to cell signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4310337253,"The consequences of water deficit and its interaction with pollination system (deliberate selfing compared with open-pollination) on physiological, agronomic and phytochemical traits are not understood in fennel ( Foeniculum vulgare Mill.). A research was started by creating selfed (S1) and half-sib (HS) families on a fennel germplasm in 2018. Populations were studied in the field, applying a normal and a water deficit condition during two years (2019–2020). Considerable genotypic variation was observed within S1 and HS families for all of the evaluated traits, demonstrating that selection for these traits would be successful. Consequences of water deficit were manifested as declined most of the traits; and significantly increased essential oil content, harvest index, and proline content, in both populations. Mandatory selfing reduced the performance of genotypes for most of the traits confirming the existence of inbreeding depression (ID) with higher values for plant dry weight, seed yield, essential oil content, and number of umbelets per umbel. In S1 population, some of the studied traits had higher heritability estimates under normal condition and some of them showed higher heritability under water deficit. Positive relationship between GCA and STI in OP population indicated that it is possible to identify genotypes having high values of combining ability and drought tolerance. Results of the present study suggest that physiological traits cannot be used as an indicator to distinguish drought-tolerant genotypes in S1 progenies, whereas in OP progenies Chl a , Chl b , TChl, CAR, PRO, and RWC, which had significant correlations with drought tolerance, may be used for this purpose. Based on the results contrasting genotypes were identified, which can be used to develop mapping populations for genome studies of drought tolerance and physiological traits of this species in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W4310352175,"Objective To compare a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatment (Cognitive Processing Therapy; CPT), an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) treatment (Relapse Prevention; RP), and assessment-only (AO) for those meeting diagnostic criteria for both PTSD and AUD. Method Participants with current PTSD/AUD (N = 101; mean age = 42.10; 56% female) were initially randomized to CPT, RP, or AO and assessed post-treatment or 6-weeks post-randomization (AO). AO participants were then re-randomized to CPT or RP. Follow-ups were at immediate post-treatment, 3-, and 12-months. Mixed effects intent-to-treat models compared conditions on changes in PTSD symptom severity, drinking days, and heavy drinking days. Results At post-treatment, participants assigned to CPT showed significantly greater improvement than those in AO on PTSD symptom severity ( b = -9.72, 95% CI [-16.20, -3.23], d = 1.22); the RP and AO groups did not differ significantly on PTSD. Both active treatment conditions significantly decreased heavy drinking days relative to AO (CPT vs. AO: Count Ratio [CR] = 0.51, 95% CI [0.30, 0.88]; RP vs. AO: CR = 0.34, 95% CI [0.19, 0.59]). After re-randomization both treatment conditions showed substantial improvements in PTSD symptoms and drinking between pre-treatment and post-treatment over the 12-month follow-up period, with RP showing an advantage on heavy drinking days. Conclusion Treatments targeting one or the other aspects of the PTSD/AUD comorbidity may have salutary effects on both PTSD and drinking outcomes. These preliminary results suggest that people with this comorbidity may have viable treatment options whether they present for mental health or addiction care.

The vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA) was performed with 5 mm laparoscopic needle holders. A unidirectional barbed suture was used to complete the VUA with two simple continuous suture patterns. The number of stitches placed, the patency of the anastomosis, and the distance between the VUA and the ureters were recorded.Four dogs were entered into each group. The prostatectomy was completed in each dog following the same technique. VUA were completed with nine stitches (range: 8-10 stitches) for the 2D group and ten stitches (range: 9-11 stitches) for the 3D group (p<0.176). All the stitches were placed full thickness. The VUA was patent in each case. The left ureter was 1.05 cm (range: 0.5 to 1.1cm) from the VUA in the 2D group and 1.8 cm (range: 1.3-1.8 cm) for the 3D group (p< 0.025). The right ureter was 1.5 cm (range: 1 to 2 cm) from the VUA in the 2D group and 1.75 cm (range: 1.3-2 cm) for the 3D group (p< 0.55).Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy can be performed with a 2D or a 3D camera in canine cadavers. The 3D camera results in more accurate placement of the sutures since they were placed further away from the left ureter.Radical prostatectomy with laparoscopy should be considered for dogs."

Existing techniques assume relatively simple relationships among points and do not guarantee an optimal match. We introduce an algorithm capable of exactly solving point set matching by modeling the task as hypergraph matching. The algorithm extends the classical branch and bound paradigm to select and aggregate vertices under a proposed decomposition of the multilinear objective function. The methodology is motivated by Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism used frequently in developmental biology and neurobiology. The embryonic C. elegans contains seam cells that can act as fiducial markers allowing the identification of other nuclei during embryo development. The proposed algorithm identifies seam cells more accurately than established point-set matching methods, while providing a framework to approach other similarly complex point set matching tasks."

A total of 48 RFI extreme individuals (High-RFI, n = 24; Low-RFI, n = 24) were selected from a population of 142 heifers for classical plasma metabolite and hormone quantification and plasma metabolomic profiling through untargeted LC-MS. Most efficient heifers (Low-RFI) had greater (P = 0.03) plasma concentrations of IGF-1 and tended to have (P = 0.06) a lower back fat depth compared to least efficient heifers. However, no changes were noted (P ≥ 0.10) for plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, non-esterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate and urea. The plasma metabolomic dataset comprised 3,457 ions with none significantly differing between RFI classes after false discovery rate correction (FDR &gt; 0.10). Among the 101 ions having a raw P &lt; 0.05 for the RFI effect, 13 were putatively annotated by using internal databases and 6 compounds were further confirmed with standards. Metabolic pathway analysis from these 6 confirmed compounds revealed that the branched chain amino acid metabolism was significantly (FDR &lt; 0.05) impacted by the RFI classes. Our results confirmed for the first time in beef heifers previous findings obtained in male beef cattle and pointing to changes in branched-chain amino acids metabolism along with that of body composition as biological mechanisms related to RFI. Further studies are warranted to ascertain whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between these mechanisms and RFI."

However, limited research exist on the quality evaluation of various R. tanguticum locations, which has certain drawbacks. In this study, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to comparative study on the chemical contents of R. tanguticum, to clarify the relationship between the chemical contents and the spatial distribution of R. tanguticum. First of all, the FTIR spectra of 18 batches of R. tanguticum were examined. Following the cluster analysis, the FTIR spectra of various production locations differed. To some extent, establishing the double index analysis sequence of common and variation peaks may differentiate distinct production locations of medicinal materials. The HPLC fingerprint of R. tanguticum was constructed to further explore the link between components and their origin. PCA of common peaks of 18 batches of R. tanguticum indicated that R. tanguticum grown in Gannan and Qinghai had a tendency to separate t[2], however this trend was not noticeable. Then, OPLS-DA model was established, and the key differential components of R. tanguticum produced in Gannan and Qinghai were discovered to be R16, R37, R46, and R47 (Aloe emodin) (VIP ≥ 1 and P < 0.05). At last, Pearson's test was used to examine the relationship between longitude, latitude, altitude, and composition. Longitude was significantly positively correlated with R28 and R30 (P < 0.05), and a very significantly positively correlated with R35, R36, R37, R46, and R47 (P < 0.01). Latitude was significantly negatively correlated with R34, R35, and R40 (P < 0.05), and extremely significantly negatively correlated with R28, R30, R36, R37, R46, and R47 (P < 0.01). Altitude was significantly positive correlation with R36 and R37 (P < 0.01).

Methods A total of 254 cases of hospital-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in a tertiary hospital in Beijing from January 2016 to December 2020 were retrospectively collected. Appropriate influencing factors were selected by referring to relevant articles from the aspects of basic clinical information and contact history before infection, and divided into a training set and a test set. Both the RF and LR models were trained by the training set, and using testing set to compare these two models. Results The prediction accuracy of the LR model was 87.0%, the true positive rate of the LR model was 94.7%; the false negative rate of the LR model was 5.3%; the false positive rate of the LR model was 35%; the true negative rate of the LR model was 65%; the sensitivity of the LR model for the prognosis prediction of hospital-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was 94.7%; and the specificity was 65%. The prediction accuracy of the RF model was 89.6%; the true positive rate of the RF model was 92.1%; the false negative rate of the RF model was 7.9%; the false positive rate of the RF model was 21.4%; the true negative rate of the RF model was 78.6%; the sensitivity of the RF model for the prognosis prediction of hospital-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was 92.1%; and the specificity was 78.6%.

https://openalex.org/W4310353155,"The encapsulation of drugs in micro and nanocarriers has helped to resolve mechanisms of cellular resistance and decrease drug side effects as well. In this study, poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) was used to encapsulate the Euphol active substance-containing latex from Euphorbia tirucalli (E-latex). The nanoparticles (NP) were prepared using the solvent evaporation method and the physical and chemical properties were evaluated using spectrophotometric techniques. FTIR was used to prove the formation of the ester bond between the E-latex and PLGA-NP. The UV-Vis spectroscopic technique was used to show that more than 75% of the latex was encapsulated; the same technique was used to determine the release profile of the compound at different pH values, as well as determining the speed with which the process occurs through kinetic models, and it was observed that the best adjustments occurred for the Korsmeyer-Peppas model and the Higuchi model. The DLS technique was used to determine the diameter of the particles produced as well as their zeta potential (ZP). The sizes of the particles varied from 497 to 764 nm, and it was observed that the increase in E-latex concentration causes a reduction in the diameter of the NP and an increase in the ZP (-1.44 to -22.7 mV), due to more functional groups from latex film being adsorbed to the NPs surfaces. The thermogravimetric experiments exhibit the glass transition temperatures (Tg) that is appropriate for the use of formulated NPs as a stable drug delivery device before use. The in vivo activity of E-NPs (30 and 100 mg/Kg/p.o.) was tested against carrageenan-induced mechanical hypernociception. The data demonstrated a significantly antinociceptive effect for E-NPs, suggesting that E-latex nanoencapsulation preserved its desired properties."
https://openalex.org/W4310353193,"Mutations in ATP13A2 cause Kufor-Rakeb Syndrome (KRS), a juvenile form of Parkinson's Disease (PD). The gene product belongs to a diverse family of ion pumps and mediates polyamine influx from lysosomal lumen. While the biochemical and structural studies highlight its unique mechanics, how PD pathology is linked to ATP13A2 function remains unclear. Here we report that localization of overexpressed TOM20, a mitochondrial outer-membrane protein, is significantly altered upon ATP13A2 expression to partially merge with lysosome. Using Halo-fused version of ATP13A2, ATP13A2 was identified in lysosome and autophagosome. Upon ATP13A2 co-expression, overexpressed TOM20 was found not only in mitochondria but also within ATP13A2-containing autolysosome. This modification of TOM20 localization was inhibited by adding 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) and not accompanied with mitophagy induction. We suggest that ATP13A2 may participate in the control of overexpressed proteins targeted to mitochondrial outer-membrane."
https://openalex.org/W4310354710,"Background Submaximal endurance exercise has been shown to cause elevated gastrointestinal permeability, injury, and inflammation, which may negatively impact athletic performance and recovery. Preclinical and some clinical studies suggest that flavonoids, a class of plant secondary metabolites, may regulate intestinal permeability and reduce chronic low-grade inflammation. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of supplemental flavonoid intake on intestinal health and cycling performance. Materials and methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted with 12 cyclists (8 males and 4 females). Subjects consumed a dairy milk-based, high or low flavonoid (490 or 5 mg) pre-workout beverage daily for 15 days. At the end of each intervention, a submaximal cycling trial (45 min, 70% VO 2 max) was conducted in a controlled laboratory setting (23°C), followed by a 15-minute maximal effort time trial during which total work and distance were determined. Plasma samples were collected pre- and post-exercise (0h, 1h, and 4h post-exercise). The primary outcome was intestinal injury, assessed by within-subject comparison of plasma intestinal fatty acid-binding protein. Prior to study start, this trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03427879). Results A significant time effect was observed for intestinal fatty acid binding protein and circulating cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α). No differences were observed between the low and high flavonoid treatment for intestinal permeability or injury. The flavonoid treatment tended to increase cycling work output (p = 0.051), though no differences were observed for cadence or total distance. Discussion Sub-chronic supplementation with blueberry, cocoa, and green tea in a dairy-based pre-workout beverage did not alleviate exercise-induced intestinal injury during submaximal cycling, as compared to the control beverage (dairy-milk based with low flavonoid content)."

We investigated depressive symptoms as an important modifiable risk factor that may mediate the effects of physical and cognitive decline on disability.We prospectively analyzed data from 223 adults (age 50-85; 117 controls and 106 with type-2 diabetes) over 48 weeks who were participating in a clinical trial ""Memory Advancement by Intranasal Insulin in Type 2 Diabetes."" Data from self-reported disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule) and depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale) were obtained from baseline, week 25, and week 48 visits. Cognition (Mini-mental status examination) and medical comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index) were assessed at baseline. Longitudinal analysis assessed the extent to which change in depressive symptoms predicted worsening disability. Mediation analyses were performed to determine the extent to which depressive symptoms accounted for disability associated with worse cognition, walking speed, and comorbidities.At baseline, depressive symptoms, cognition, and walking speed were within normal limits, but participants had a high 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality. Depressive symptoms were related to disability at baseline (p<0.001), and longitudinally (p<0.001). Cognition, walking speed, and comorbidities were associated with disability at baseline (p-values = 0.027-0.001). Depressive symptoms had a large mediating effect on disability longitudinally: the indirect effect on disability via depression accounts for 51% of the effect of cognition, 34% of the effect of mobility, and 24% of the effect of comorbidities.Depressive symptoms substantially exacerbated the effects of worsening cognition, gait speed, and comorbidities on disability. In our sample, most individuals scored within the ""normal"" range of the Geriatric Depression Scale, suggesting that even subclinical symptoms can lead to disability. Treating subclinical depression, which may be under-recognized in older adults, should be a public health priority to help preserve independence with aging."
https://openalex.org/W4310358391,"Melanoma shows highly aggressive behavior (i.e., local invasion and metastasis). Matrix metalloprotease-3 (MMP-3), a zinc-dependent endopeptidase, degrades several extracellular substrates and contributes to local invasion by creating a microenvironment suitable for tumor development. Here, we report that interleukin-1β (IL-1β) triggers the MMP-3 expression in canine melanoma cells. The activity of MMP-3 in the culture supernatant was increased in IL-1β-treated melanoma cells. IL-1β time- and dose-dependently provoked the mRNA expression of MMP-3. IL-1β induced the migration of melanoma cells; however, this migration was attenuated by UK356618, an MMP-3 inhibitor. When the cells were treated with the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor TPCA-1, the inhibition of MMP-3 expression was observed. In IL-1β-treated cells, the phosphorylation both of p65/RelA and p105 was detected, indicating NF-κB pathway activation. In p65/RelA-depleted melanoma cells, IL-1β-mediated mRNA expression of MMP-3 was inhibited, whereas this reduction was not observed in p105-depleted cells. These findings suggest that MMP-3 expression in melanoma cells is regulated through IL-1β-mediated p65/RelA activation, which is involved in melanoma cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W4310358402,"Medical students are often paired together on clinical teams during their clerkships. While this practice has multiple potential positive effects, evidence suggests that most students feel that their evaluation is impacted by the other student. This perception negatively impacts the learning environment. We set out to determine whether paired students had a measurable effect on each other's clerkship grade during the medicine sub-internship.We examined 186 4th year student-pairs during the required medicine sub-internship at 3 hospital sites of Harvard Medical School from 2013-2017. Chi-square tests were used to determine whether pairing impacted the final clerkship grade. Subsequently we examined whether pairing impacted the sub-internship performance stratified by students' 3rd year core medicine clerkship grade to account for prior performance.We found no significant deviation between the expected and observed distribution of student grades (chi-square 1.9, p = 0.39) among 186 student pairs, suggesting that pairing had no meaningful effect on the sub-internship grade. We also saw no significant effect of pairing when controlling for prior internal medicine clerkship performance (chi-square 10.9, p = 0.53).Despite concerns that students on the same medical team may impact each other's performance evaluation, our exploratory study demonstrated no significant effect of student pairing on grades in a medicine sub-internship. Further study of the complex relationship between students on a medical team are warranted to optimize this common practice and enhance the learning environment."
https://openalex.org/W4310358639,"Two-component systems (TCSs) are widespread regulatory systems in bacteria, which control cellular functions and play an important role in sensing various external stimuli and regulating gene expression in response to environmental changes. Among the nineteen genes for the two-component system found in the whole genome of Pseudomonas stutzeri LH-42, one of the TCS coded by the HK-1 gene, has a structural domain similar to the HAMP domain, which plays an important role in regulating bacterial virulence in other bacteria. In this study, the deletion mutant LH-42△HK-1 was successfully constructed using the lambda Red recombinase system. Compared with the wild-type strain, the mutant strain LH-42△HK-1 showed a significantly slower growth time and a longer stationary phase time. In addition, in the plate bacteriostatic experiment with Escherichia coli DH5α as an indicator strain, the inhibition zone size of the mutant strain showed significantly less than the wild-type strain(P<0.05), indicating that the virulence of the mutant strain was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type strain. Overall, the results indicate that the deletion of the gene HK-1 decreased bacterial virulence in Pseudomonas stutzeri LH-42."
