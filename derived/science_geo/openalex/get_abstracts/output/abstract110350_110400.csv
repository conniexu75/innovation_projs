https://openalex.org/W1488828742,"ErbB3 is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases and is believed to be a receptor for an unknown ligand. We have tested the possibility that heregulin, a growth factor possessing an EGF-like domain, is a ligand for ErbB3. We have found that the iodinated recombinant EGF-like domain of heregulin-beta 1 (125I-rHRG beta 1(177-244) bound specifically to insect cell-expressed bovine ErbB3 with a dissociation constant of 0.85 nM. Moreover, 125I-rHRG beta 1(177-244) bound to NIH3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected with bovine erbB3 with a dissociation constant of 60 pM, but did not bind to parental cells. 125I-rHRG beta 1(177-244) could be chemically cross-linked to a 170-180 kDa protein in erbB3-transfected fibroblasts, and the cross-linked product could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for ErbB3. Finally, rHRG beta 1 stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of both ErbB3 and endogenous p185erbB2/neu in transfectants but not in parental cells. We conclude that ErbB3 is a receptor for HRG and is capable of mediating HRG-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of itself and p185erbB2/neu in cells that express both receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1566261029,"The interaction of prolactin with its receptor in the Nb2 cell line has been shown to induce the phosphorylation of cell-associated proteins and mitogenesis. It has been reported previously that one of these proteins, phosphorylated upon prolactin stimulation, was a tyrosine kinase. We have identified this kinase as JAK2, and demonstrate its association with the prolactin receptor. In addition, we show that the prolactin receptor itself becomes tyrosine phosphorylated upon ligand stimulation in Nb2 cells. These actions are time-dependent and occur rapidly after prolactin stimulation, with first the kinase being activated within 5 min and then the receptor being phosphorylated maximally at 20 min. Moreover, phosphorylation of both JAK2 and the receptor as well as Nb2 cell proliferation are dependent on the concentration of lactogenic hormone, resulting in a bell-shaped response curve similar to that observed in the two site model of hGH action. This indicates that early events in signal transduction as well as later events like mitogenesis and proliferation involve prolactin receptor dimerization. Together these data indicate that the prolactin receptor in Nb2 cells is associated to JAK2 and that upon ligand stimulation, and receptor dimerization, the kinase and the receptor are tyrosine-phosphorylated, which represents the first event in the process of prolactin receptor signal transduction in Nb2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1540646729,"Two types of 12-lipoxygenase that catalyze the transformation of arachidonic acid to 12(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE) have been previously classified into platelet-type and leukocyte-type categories. Here, we document, for the first time, a molecular characterization of both forms within the same species. The amino acid sequence of the murine platelet 12-lipoxygenase deduced from its cDNA is 58% identical to the murine spleen/leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase. Expression constructs carrying the cDNAs for the two 12-lipoxygenase forms were introduced into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The platelet-type enzyme metabolized arachidonic acid exclusively to 12-HPETE, whereas the leukocyte-type enzyme formed both 12-HPETE and 15-hydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoic acid in a ratio of approximately 3:1. Linoleic acid was metabolized to a similar extent by the latter enzyme to 13-hydro(pero)xyoctadecadienoic acid but not by the platelet enzyme. Mutagenesis and deletion of the highly conserved lipoxygenase C-terminal isoleucine (Ile663), a residue believed to be involved in the non-heme iron atom coordination of all lipoxygenases, was performed. Deletion of Ile663 and substitution with most amino acids abolished enzyme activity. Only a valine substitution retained significant activity. These findings would tend to indicate a stringent requirement for the proper spatial alignment and folding of the C-terminal chain back into the core of the enzyme to interact with the iron atom by analogy with the recently determined crystal structure of a soybean lipoxygenase (Boyington, J. C., Gaffney, B. J., and Amzel, L. M. (1993) Science 260, 1482-1486). The platelet-type and leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase genes were cloned from a murine 129 Sv genomic library. Both genes are divided into a similar 14-exon/13-intron format, with the platelet-type gene being approximately twice the size of the leukocyte-type gene (13 versus 7.5 kilobases). A segment of a third gene was also isolated and probably represents a pseudogene derivative of either of these 12-lipoxygenase genes. All three genes were mapped to the central region of mouse chromosome 11 in a region of homology with human chromosome 17. Antibodies prepared against the two forms of 12-lipoxygenase revealed the differential distribution of the two enzymes throughout the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W1500594923,"Dsg1 is a 165-kDa glycoprotein component of suprabasal epidermal desmosomes and the prototype of a subset of the cadherin superfamily of cell-cell adhesion proteins known as desmogleins. The adhesive function of classical cadherins is known to be dependent upon their association with cytoplasmic components called catenins. In the case of desmogleins, a single interaction has been described with a protein called plakoglobin that is found in desmosomal plaques, adherens junctions, and the cytosol. Several proteins with homology to plakoglobin have been described that regulate junction assembly and implement morphoregulatory signals. To address the functional significance of plakoglobin-desmoglein interaction, we have mapped the sequences of Dsg1 that are crucial for this association by using blot overlay techniques. By examining the binding of plakoglobin to a deletion series of the Dsg1 cytoplasmic domain expressed as fusion proteins, we have defined a 19-amino acid sequence that is important for association. This region of Dsg1 sequence shows significant similarity to the catenin-binding domain of classical cadherins, suggesting a common mechanism for the association of plakoglobin with desmosomes and adherens junctions."
https://openalex.org/W1585558137,"The chemokines are a large group of cytokines that are recognized to be important mediators of inflammation. In this study we show that the human mast cell leukemia line HMC-1 is a source of multiple chemokines, including I-309, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta, RANTES, and interleukin-8. I-309 and MCP-1 transcripts are expressed at low levels in unstimulated HMC-1. However, phorbol ester treatment up-regulates these and other chemokine transcript levels and also up-regulates chemokine protein synthesis and secretion. Induction of chemokine transcripts in HMC-1 requires de novo protein synthesis. We compared the effects of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids on the expression of chemokine genes in HMC-1 to their effects in activated T-cells. We find that methyl-prednisolone reduces MCP-1 but not other chemokine transcripts in HMC-1, even though there are distinct and more general effects on chemokine transcripts in activated T-cells. These effects are attributed to inhibition of transcription rather than transcript stability. Our results suggest that human mast cells may be a source of multiple chemokines, that glucocorticoids may inhibit the expression of only a subset of these chemokines, and that mast cells and T-cell chemokine expression may occur via distinct regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2105442098,"The T cell antigen receptor zeta chain and other T cell antigen receptor components are ubiquitinated on receptor occupancy. A systematic mutagenesis of the zeta subunit was undertaken to determine the sites of ubiquitination. Ubiquitination was found to occur in the cytoplasmic domain of zeta with multiple lysines serving as sites for mono- and polyubiquitination. The mutation of all potential sites of ubiquitination did not inhibit receptor tyrosine phosphorylation or the ubiquitination of other T cell antigen receptor subunits. Lysines introduced into nonnative positions in the zeta molecule were also able to serve as sites for ubiquitination. These findings demonstrate that once a T cell antigen receptor is targeted for ubiquitination, there is little specificity with regard to the lysine residues that are modified."
https://openalex.org/W1647141819,"The effect of sense and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) on hepatitis C virus (HCV) gene expression was studied to determine the role of the highly conserved 5'-untranslated region in the life cycle of the virus. It was found that antisense ODNs complementary to nucleotides (nt) 38-65, 134-175, and 312-339 in the 5' noncoding region and 341-377 in the core open reading frame efficiently blocked HCV RNA translation. Overlapping ODNs that differed by only several nucleotides showed substantially different inhibition of HCV RNA translation. Fine sequence specificity testing at nt positions 351-377 revealed that ODNs as small as a 12-mer (nt 351-363) retained a high degree (80%) of inhibitory activity compared to ODNs of longer sequences. These results suggest that there are three highly specific domains in the 5' noncoding region and a sequence immediately downstream of the HCV core initiation codon that may be critical for translation of HCV RNA. This study also provides an experimental approach for the selection of target HCV RNA sequences susceptible to antisense effects, as well as for definition of functional regions of the genome necessary for viral replication."
https://openalex.org/W1572797926,"CAAX farnesyltransferase attaches a farnesyl group to proteins that terminate in the sequence CAAX, where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is typically methionine or serine. A limited number of substrates for the CAAX farnesyltransferase have been identified in cultured cells. These include p21ras proteins and the nuclear lamins A and B. We describe here the use of a CAAX farnesyltransferase inhibitor, together with a hamster cell line that exhibits efficient uptake of [3H]mevalonate, as a means of identifying novel farnesylated proteins. One candidate protein was purified and its attached prenyl group identified as farnesyl. The predicted amino acid sequence of this protein, deduced from a cloned cDNA, terminates with the tetrapeptide Cys-Leu-Ile-Met, which conforms to the consensus sequence for recognition by farnesyltransferase. This farnesylated protein, designated PxF, is localized to the outer surface of peroxisomes as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1603564922,"In this study, we have investigated the subcellular localization of farnesyl-diphosphate synthase (FPP synthase). FPP synthase produces FPP, which is utilized in the synthesis of squalene, cholesterol, farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins, dolichols, coenzyme Q, and the isoprenoid moiety of heme a. This enzyme is found in the 100,000 x g supernatant fraction of cells or tissues and has been considered to be a cytoplasmic protein. In this study, analysis of FPP synthase activity and protein in fractionated rat liver together with immunofluorescent and immunoelectron microscopy studies demonstrated unequivocally that FPP synthase is largely localized in peroxisomes. These data, in combination with the previous observation that mevalonate kinase is predominantly localized in peroxisomes, suggest that peroxisomes are the major site of synthesis of FPP from mevalonate. We also demonstrate that in liver tissue obtained from patients with peroxisomal deficiency diseases (Zellweger syndrome and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy), the activities of five enzymes involved in isoprenoid synthesis, namely mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, mevalonate-diphosphate decarboxylase, isopentenyl-diphosphate isomerase, and FPP synthase, are significantly reduced, consistent with a peroxisomal localization of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1579422048,"Several genes homologous to the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) of Escherichia coli have been cloned and characterized from the Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. Sequence analysis reveals four large open reading frames, designated mcpA, mcpB, tlpA, and tlpB, each encoding a predicted 72-kDa protein. These proteins exhibit strong homology to chemoreceptors from several organisms, although similarity is limited to the C-terminal domain. These transducer genes were mapped to a chromosomal position of 279 degrees, which is distant from previously identified fla, mot, or che loci. Each gene was inactivated by insertion of a nonpolar chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cassette in the N-terminal region. In vivo methylation of the bacterial strain deficient in mcpA revealed the loss of several methylated bands in the range of the MCP previously designated as H1, and greatly reduced methylation of the MCP designated as H2. Furthermore, this bacterial strain exhibited a chemotaxis deficiency toward glucose and alpha-methyl-glucoside. Inactivation of mcpB caused a reduction in methylation of the MCP designated as H3, while chemotaxis toward asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, and histidine was significantly impaired in this strain. Despite strong homology, inactivation of tlpA and tlpB did not result in an observed deficiency in chemotaxis. Most unusually, these mutant strains exhibited a striking tendency to adhere together and resisted disaggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1542963228,"To determine the specific role of each follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) oligosaccharide, we mutated Asn to Gln at each glycosylation site (alpha Gln52, alpha Gln78, alpha Gln52-78, beta Gln7, beta Gln24, and beta Gln7-24) to selectively inhibit oligosaccharide attachment. For wild-type and mutant FSH, we determined the binding affinity to homogenized rat Sertoli cells and the signal-transducing activity in cultured rat granulosa cells. The binding affinity of FSH lacking any one of the oligosaccharides was increased over wild-type FSH, while the signal-transducing activity of FSH lacking the oligosaccharide at alpha Asn52 (alpha Gln52 FSH) was markedly reduced, and that of FSH lacking either beta oligosaccharide (beta Gln7 and beta Gln24 FSH) was slightly reduced. At each FSH beta glycosylation site, we made a second amino acid substitution to inhibit glycosylation (beta Tyr9 and beta Tyr26) and an amino acid substitution that preserved glycosylation (beta Ser9 and beta Ser26). The amino acid sequence of the second beta subunit glycosylation site was important for signal transduction, regardless of the presence or absence of the oligosaccharide. Thus, while each FSH oligosaccharide has a similar impact on binding affinity, the alpha 52 oligosaccharide has a disproportionate role in signal transduction, and the amino acid sequence at beta Asn24 functions in both binding and signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1556931988,"In T lymphocytes activated via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), the SH2- and SH3-containing adapter molecule Grb2 forms a complex with the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange protein Sos and tyrosine phospho-proteins. The interaction of Sos with Grb2 is mediated via the Grb2 SH3 domains. In this study, it is shown that a 75-kDa protein is also complexed with the Grb2 SH3 domains in T cells, but not in Rat-1 fibroblasts. The identity of the p75 protein is not known, but immunoblot analysis with phosphotyrosine antibodies indicated that it is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in TCR-activated T cells. This characteristic clearly distinguishes p75 from Sos since Sos is not a phosphotyrosine protein. In vitro binding studies indicated that the p75 phosphotyrosine protein binds to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of intact Grb2, but not to a Grb2 fusion protein mutated in its SH3 domains. p75 can also bind to the single COOH-terminal Grb2 SH3 domain, whereas Sos has an in vitro binding preference for the NH2-terminal Grb2 SH3 domain. Collectively, these data indicate that in T cells, two proteins can complex with the Grb2 SH3 domains: Sos and a p75 molecule that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in TCR-activated cells. The significance of p75 association with Grb2 is not clear, but by analogy with Sos, p75 is a potential candidate for a Grb2 effector protein. Data are presented showing that the interaction of the Grb2 SH2 domains with tyrosine phosphoproteins may be regulated by conformational restraints imposed by different molecules complexing with the Grb2 SH3 domains. It is thus possible to speculate that the interaction of either p75 or Sos with the Grb2 SH3 domain may influence the interaction of the Grb2 SH2 domain with tyrosine phosphoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2118198704,"The role of eucaryotic protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) in the folding and reoxidation of proteins in vitro was investigated using an antibody Fab fragment as a model substrate, since PDI is known to participate in the disulfide bond formation of immunoglobulins in vivo. PDI has no effect on the folding of the Fab fragment with intact disulfide bonds, suggesting that, at least in this system, PDI is not able to influence the folding process in a chaperone-like manner. Instead, the role of PDI is limited to disulfide bond formation as demonstrated for the folding of the denatured and reduced Fab fragment. Here, PDI influences the yield of reactivation enormously with a maximum effect at about stoichiometric amounts of PDI and Fab. Furthermore, PDI changes the redox dependence of the reaction. In the presence of PDI, formation of the correct disulfide bonds is possible at higher oxidizing conditions compared to the spontaneous reaction. The requirements both for stoichiometric amounts of PDI and for the presence of PDI during the first seconds of refolding suggest that there is a kinetic competition between rapid structure formation of the antibody domains and interaction of PDI with cysteine residues in the folding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1534226618,"A reconstituted proteoliposomal system was obtained with Ca-ATPase purified from human erythrocyte membrane (plasma membrane, PM ATPase), and liposomes prepared by reverse-phase evaporation. The reconstituted PM ATPase behaved as an electrogenic Ca2+/H+ exchanger and, under optimal conditions, utilization of 1 mol of ATP was accompanied by uptake of one Ca2+ by the vesicles, and ejection of one H+ from the lumen of the vesicles. Ca2+ uptake was greatly (5-fold) stimulated by the addition of calmodulin, and by collapsing the H+ gradient with the ionophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. In the presence of calmodulin and p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, the reconstituted system sustained transport rates of 1.00 +/- 0.12 mumol of Ca2+/mg of protein min-1 (30 degrees C), reaching asymptotic levels of 8.05 +/- 0.41 mumol of Ca2+/mg of protein (i.e. 20 mM lumenal Ca2+). The corresponding net charge transfer produced a maximal electrical gradient of 40.5 +/- 1.8 mV at steady state. Demonstration of the electrogenic behavior of the PM ATPase, obtained for the first time with these experiments, was critically dependent on the detergent used in the reconstitution procedure. The lumenal pH rise had a much greater rate-limiting effect on the pump, than the electrical potential developed by the pump."
https://openalex.org/W1510534561,"Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) is a regulatory protein for Rab proteins that controls not only the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of Rab proteins but also their translocation between the cytosol and cell membranes. Recently, rab GDI cDNAs have been isolated from human, bovine, rat, and Drosophila, and these Rab GDI proteins indicated an important role in the regulation of intracellular vesicle traffic. In this study, we have isolated two different rab GDI cDNAs, designated rat rab GDI alpha and beta, from a rat brain cDNA library using bovine rab GDI cDNA as a probe. Rat rab GDI alpha and beta show 99 and 86% amino acid identity with bovine rab GDI, respectively, indicating that rat rab GDI alpha is a rat counterpart of bovine rab GDI. Both rat Rab GDI alpha and beta proteins expressed in Escherichia coli showed a similar degree of activity of regulating the GDP/GTP exchange reaction to that of bovine Rab GDI using Rab3A and Rab11 as substrates. Northern blot analysis revealed that rab GDI alpha mRNA was expressed abundantly in brain but much less in other tissues, whereas rat rab GDI beta mRNA was ubiquitously expressed. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that astrocytes expressed rat rab GDI beta gene but not rat rab GDI alpha gene. These results indicate that Rab GDI alpha is involved in sorting of highly specialized vesicles in brain such as neurosecretory vesicles, whereas Rab GDI beta plays a general role in vesicular trafficking in diverse types of cells."
https://openalex.org/W1502339211,"The beta A4-amyloid protein precursor (APP) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is the source of the characteristic beta A4-amyloid deposits found in Alzheimer brains. It is expressed in several isoforms generated by alternative splicing of exons 7, 8, and 15, of which the leukocyte-derived APP mRNAs lacking exon 15 are significantly expressed in non-neuronal tissues, but not in neurons. The recent finding of APP-like proteins prompted us to analyze alternative splicing of the nearest relative of APP, the amyloid protein precursor homologue (APPH) or amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2). We were able to show that there are two alternatively spliced inserts, i.e. the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain and a 12-amino-acid-encoding region on the NH2-terminal side of the transmembrane domain, which is part of the region of highest divergence between APP and APLP2/APPH. Analysis of the tissue-specific differential expression of the resulting four APLP2/APPH mRNA isoforms revealed that isoforms lacking the latter, non-homologous insert are highly expressed in non-neuronal tissues, but only weakly in neurons. While this resembles the tissue-specific alternative splicing of exon 15 of APP, expression of the Kunitz protease inhibitor-encoding exon of APLP2/APPH is abundant in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues and thus differs from APP. Because of the similar regulation of alternative splicing of exon 15 of APP and the described APLP2/APPH insert, and because of structural similarities of the sequences and the predicted secondary structures, a functional homology of alternatively spliced isoforms of APP and APLP2/APPH is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1599420609,"Several different models have been proposed for the transmembrane structure of receptors for the neurotransmitter L-glutamate. In this study, the sites of N-linked oligosaccharides on GluR6, a member of the kainate class of ionotropic glutamate receptors, were examined. Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to alter the consensus sequence at three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation in the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule. The presence of a carbohydrate substitution was monitored by shifts in the relative molecular weight of the mutant receptors on immunoblots. Molecular weight shifts were observed for the mutants N515Q and N720Q and for two companion mutants, T517A and T722A, which also eliminate the consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation. No shift in molecular weight was observed in the the mutant N574Q. These results indicate that asparagines 515 and 720 are glycosylated and thus are likely located extracellularly. In immunocytochemical analyses of GluR6 expressed in baculovirus-infected cells, permeabilization with detergents was required for immunostaining with a carboxyl-terminal antibody, indicating that the carboxyl terminus is located intracellularly. Electrophysiological recordings of the mutant receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney cells demonstrated that the amplitudes of the kainate-activated currents mediated by the N574Q, N720Q, and the T722A mutants were not significantly different from currents mediated by wild type GluR6 receptors, while the currents mediated by the N515Q and T517A mutants were significantly depressed. Based on these findings, we propose a model for the transmembrane topology of GluR6."
https://openalex.org/W1512088791,"The gene products of tap1 and tap2 encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II region belong to the ATP binding cassette superfamily of transporters. They are thought to form a heterodimer for the delivery of peptides into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum; peptides are required for correct assembly and presentation of the MHC class I molecule peptide complex at the cell surface. To elucidate the ATP binding properties of these proteins in vitro, we expressed the hydrophilic C-terminal part of human transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP1) (nucleotide binding domain (NBD)-TAP1, amino acids 452-748) and TAP2 (NBD-TAP2, amino acids 399-686) fused to a His6 tag in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins accumulated exclusively in inclusion bodies and were solubilized under denaturing conditions. After purification by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, we were able to refold the domains for functional studies. NBD-TAP1 bound to C-8-ATP-agarose and was specifically eluted with ATP or EDTA. Photoaffinity labeling of NBD-TAP1 with the ATP analogues 8-azido-[gamma-32P]ATP and 3'-O-[(4-azido-3,5-[125I]diiodo-2-hydroxybenzoyl)-beta-alanyl]-ATP was specific. The addition of 50 microM ATP inhibited photoaffinity labeling by 8-azido-ATP down to 8% of controls. Efficiency of inhibition decreased as follows: ATP > GTP > ADP > CTP > AMP. Photolabeling of NBD-TAP2 was not observed. ATP hydrolysis by NBD-TAP1 was not detected. Until now strong but only indirect data of the TAP function existed. The described experiments demonstrate ATP binding to an isolated domain of the antigenic peptide transporter, TAP, and therefore support the theory of ATP-dependent peptide translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1546821979,"Using a polymerase chain reaction based strategy, we identified a novel transmembrane tyrosine kinase in CD34+ human bone marrow cells and a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, Hep3B. This protein, hepatoma transmembrane kinase or Htk, shares amino acid similarity with the EPH subfamily of tyrosine kinases. The HTK gene is located on human chromosome 7. The predicted 987-amino acid sequence of Htk includes a transmembrane region and signal sequence. In the predicted extracellular domain, a cysteine-rich region and tandem fibronectin type III repeats are present while a single uninterrupted catalytic domain is present in the intracellular domain. These features are consistent with other members of the Eph subfamily. Antibodies raised against Htk extracellular domain immunoprecipitated a 120-kDa protein from either in vitro translated HTK or Hep3B cells which localized primarily to the Hep3B membrane subcellular fraction. Purified in vitro translated Htk was enzymatically active and autophosphorylated on tyrosine in kinase assays. Furthermore, antibodies against Htk ECD were agonistic, inducing Htk tyrosine phosphorylation in transfected NIH3T3 cells. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a single HTK transcript abundantly present in placenta and in a range of primary tissues and malignant cell lines. HTK appears to be expressed in fetal but not adult brain and in primitive and myeloid but not lymphoid hematopoietic cells. The novel transmembrane protein, Htk, may function as a receptor with an expression pattern suggesting a role in events mediating differentiation and development."
https://openalex.org/W1628302795,"We previously determined that a region between positions -228 and -189 upstream from the human gamma-globin genes can form an intramolecular triplex (H-DNA) in supercoiled plasmids. To identify proteins that might interact with this DNA structure, we performed expression cloning using an adult bone marrow cDNA library and the single-stranded region of the H-DNA structure as a probe. We cloned molecules very similar to two previously identified cDNAs, dbpA and dbpB. The dbpB-like protein (called BP-8 in this study) interacts specifically (KD approximately 4 nM) with two homopyrimidine in the single-stranded gamma-228 to -189 probe, but binds to double-stranded DNA containing the same sequence with 100-fold less affinity. We have also shown that supercoiled plasmids containing the gamma-228 to -189 region contain a high affinity binding site for BP-8 that is stabilized by factors that stabilize H-DNA; two HPFH point mutations (-202 C-->G or C-->T) that destabilize the secondary DNA structure abolish the high affinity binding site. Collectively, these data show that dbpB/BP-8 binds specifically to homopyrimidine half-sites in single-stranded DNA, and that it also binds to H-DNA structures that contain homopyrimidine tracts in the single-stranded and triple-stranded regions."
https://openalex.org/W1479953545,"As previously reported, guanine nucleotide regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in the Dictyostelium mutant synag 7 can be restored in vitro by addition of a high-speed supernatant prepared from wild-type cells (Theibert, A., and Devreotes, P. N. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15121-15125). We have designated this activity CRAC, for cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase. Trypsinization of partially purified material demonstrated that this activity contains a protein. We report here a 50,000-fold purification of this protein using Q and S Sepharose fast flow and P11 cellulose chromatography, followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation and separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purification of wild-type and mutant supernatants in parallel allowed identification of an 88-kDa protein required for reconstituting activity. A polyclonal antibody was raised against this protein; it stains a band in unfractionated wild-type, but not mutant, supernatants. Immunoblots of fractions from each purification step show that activity and the immunostaining band cochromatograph. We have determined a short N-terminal sequence of the 88-kDa CRAC polypeptide, which matches a portion of the deduced N terminus of a gene, dagA, isolated from a mutant similar to synag 7. Expression of the dagA cDNA in synag 7 cells restores both the 88 kDa band and CRAC activity."
https://openalex.org/W2128982794,"An unusual feature of valine catabolism is a reaction in which an intermediate of its catabolic pathway, (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA, is hydrolyzed to give the free acid and CoA-SH. The enzyme responsible for this reaction, 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.4), was purified 7200-fold from rat liver in this study. The purified enzyme consists of a single polypeptide with an M(r) of 36,000 in the native and denatured forms. The hydrolase is highly specific for (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA (Km, 6 and 25 microM, respectively) with optimal activity around pH 8. The turnover rate of the enzyme for (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA is 270 s-1, which is high relative to other enzymes of the valine pathway. Likewise, activity of the enzyme expressed on a wet weight basis is also very high in the major tissues of the rat. These findings suggest that rapid destruction of (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA produced during valine catabolism is physiologically important. We propose that the need for a mechanism to protect cells against the toxic effects of methacrylyl-CoA, which is maintained in equilibrium with (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA by crotonase, explains why valine catabolism involves this enzyme and why its tissue activity is so high."
https://openalex.org/W1514790341,"Enzymes and factors, required for in vitro transcription of templates regulated by vaccinia virus intermediate stage promoters, are present in HeLa cells infected with vaccinia virus in the presence of an inhibitor of DNA replication. Previous studies indicated that in vitro transcription could be reconstituted by adding a partially purified transcription factor to the viral RNA polymerase and capping enzyme. By using an independent purification procedure, we isolated two vaccinia virus intermediate were necessary for transcription of several different intermediate stage promoter templates but not for early or late stage promoter templates. VITF-1 was purified to homogeneity, and the sequences of two tryptic peptides were mapped to the fourth open reading frame within the HindIII E fragment (E4L) of the vaccinia virus genome, which had previously been shown to encode an RNA polymerase subunit of 30 kDa (RPO30) with homology to eukaryotic transcription elongation factor SII. Co-chromatography of VITF-1 with the E4L-derived protein was demonstrated using specific antiserum. In addition, transcriptionally active recombinant VITF-1 was made by expressing the E4L open reading frame in Escherichia coli. Thus, E4L encodes a multifunctional protein, serving as a RNA polymerase subunit and a stage-specific transcription factor. The stepwise binding of capping enzyme, VITF-1, and VITF-2 to a DNA/viral RNA polymerase complex was demonstrated."

PCC 6803, in which the photosystem II (PS II) genes psbB and/or psbC (coding for CP47 and CP43, respectively) were inactivated together with the psaAB operon (coding for the photosystem I (PS I) core complex) and the apcE gene (coding for the phycobilisome anchor protein). Lack of the CP43 protein led to a significant decrease of the D1, D2, and CP47 proteins and a decrease in the 77 K fluorescence emission peak at 685 nm. In the absence of the CP47 protein, no PS II reaction center assembly was detected and the 77 K fluorescence emission peak at 695 nm was lost. The psbB-/psbC-/PS I-less/apcE- mutant had no assembly of the D1, D2, CP47, and CP43 proteins, had lost the 77 K fluorescence emission peaks at 685 and 695 nm, but retained about 15% of the chlorophyll present in the PS I-less/apcE- background strain. A broad 77 K fluorescence emission band with a maximum at 678 nm was displayed in the PS II-less, PS I-less mutant upon excitation of the remaining chlorophyll. A 678 nm shoulder was observed in the 77 K fluorescence emission spectrum of thylakoids from the psbB-/PS I-less/apcE- mutant, which still contains CP43 but no PS II reaction center. This shoulder was absent in thylakoids from the psbC-/PS I-less/apcE- mutant, which contain some PS II reaction center complexes. These results are consistent with the chlorophyll associated with the 678 nm emission to serve as peripheral antenna to PS II. The fluorescence emission characteristics of this chlorophyll are different from those of an accessory chlorophyll-binding protein expressed under iron-stress conditions in cyanobacteria. The chlorophyll remaining in the absence of PS II and PS I is indicative of a new chlorophyll-binding protein in cyanobacterial thylakoids."
https://openalex.org/W1564348675,"An evolutionarily nonconserved region of approximately 250 amino acids can be deleted from the amino-terminal part of the beta subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase without effect on the enzyme's basic function. The non-essential segment is located between two highly conserved motifs and is flanked by sequences participating in the rifampicin-binding site. The results define the second non-essential domain in the beta subunit, in addition to the more distal dispensable segment identified previously. The Alc protein of bacteriophage T4 participates in the host transcription shutoff after infection by causing premature termination of transcription on E. coli DNA. Point mutations which prevent Alc action in vivo change amino acids in the non-essential NH2-terminal domain of the beta subunit. These point mutations as well as deletions which remove the non-essential region also prevent Alc action. Thus, in the RNA polymerase molecule, the proximal non-essential domain of beta may function as an acceptor of Alc or other regulatory factors."
https://openalex.org/W1579341542,"Ligand-induced structural alterations of retinoid X receptor (RXR) appear to facilitate receptor homodimerization, to enhance DNA binding of RXR homodimeric complexes, and to dictate the transcriptional activation properties of RXR complexes bound to response elements located in the promoter region of 9-cis-retinoic acid responsive genes. The technique of limited proteolysis was used to address 9-cis-retinoic acid-induced RXR conformational change and to identify receptor region(s) which undergo structural alteration upon ligand binding. Proteolytic digestion of 9-cis-retinoic acid-liganded, but not unliganded, RXR gave rise to a fragment of 31 kilodaltons (PF31), which contained a large portion of the RXR ligand binding domain. The potency with which 9-cis-retinoic acid induced formation of PF31 was nearly identical to that with which the ligand enhanced DNA binding of a RXR homodimeric complex to a response element composed of the directly repeated hexanucleotide, PuGGTCA, separated by 1 base pair. The amino-terminal limit of PF31 mapped to Ser229 of mouse RXR alpha, which lies roughly in the middle of the spacer region separating the DNA and ligand binding domains of the receptor. These results suggest that a fairly large region of the receptor protein undergoes a structural alteration upon ligand binding which may directly alter the multiple functions of the RXR ligand binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W67602620,"The insulin and insulin-like growth factor I receptors (IR and IGF-IR, respectively) are heterotetrameric tyrosine kinases consisting of two extracellular ligand-binding alpha subunits and two transmembrane catalytic beta subunits. A number of lines of evidence have suggested that the IR and IGF-IR differ with respect to their ability to elicit mitogenic versus metabolic events upon activation by cognate ligands. To ascertain the contribution of the poorly conserved carboxyl-terminal domains to the differential functioning of the IR and IGF-IR, we have constructed receptor chimeras in which the carboxyl-terminal domain of one receptor was fused to the remainder of the heterologous receptor. The responses of a number of parameters after ligand stimulation were examined in stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells expressing the chimeric receptors or the analogous wild-type receptor sequence. Replacement of the IR carboxyl terminus with that of the IGF-IR severely affected insulin-stimulated responses, whereas substitution of the carboxyl terminus of the IGF-IR with that of the IR had a minimal effect. These data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal domains of the IR and IGF-IR are not interchangeable and that the mitogenic activity of the IR can be influenced by sequences present in the carboxyl-terminal domain. The analogous functions of the IGF-IR, on the other hand, do not appear to be greatly affected by the presence of the IR carboxyl-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W1517578896,"Near-ultraviolet resonance Raman spectra of chloroperoxidase derivatives and high valent intermediates show frequencies that can be systematically assigned. In accord with previous observations of low v4 frequencies for the ferric enzyme, and quite low v4 frequencies for the ferrous enzyme, low v4 frequencies are observed for ferryl compound II and several ferric derivatives. Resonance Raman spectra of chloroperoxidase compound I feature upshifted v2, v11, and v37 frequencies and other characteristics that argue for a 2A1u in preference to a 2A2u ground state for the porphyrin phi-cation radical. A moderately intense anomalously polarized band is observed at a frequency typical for octaethylporphyrin phi-cation radicals, which have been previously assigned as the 2A1u radical type. Similar resonance Raman spectral attributes are observed for horseradish peroxidase compound I, supporting a 2A1u symmetry state assignment for this species also. A 2A1u symmetry state assignment for chloroperoxidase and horseradish peroxidase compounds I is consistent with the beta-pyrrole substituent pattern of the protoporphyrin hemes found in these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W49995498,"Previous studies have demonstrated that a 3.0-kilobase, rat whey acidic protein (WAP) transgene containing 949 base pairs (bp) 5'- and 70 bp 3'-flanking DNA is expressed specifically in the mammary gland of transgenic mice in a copy number-dependent, position-independent manner (1). In order to localize the critical regulatory elements important for tissue-specific, high level WAP gene expression, DNase I hypersensitivity mapping studies of WAP transgenes were performed in nuclei isolated from mammary gland and liver. Two regions of DNase I hypersensitivity located at approximately -150 and -800 by from the site of transcription initiation, respectively, were detected only in nuclei isolated from the lactating mammary gland. Within the distal hypersensitive region several binding sites for members of the CTF/NFI family of transcription factors were identified using in vitro DNase I and dimethyl sulfate interference footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Genomic footprinting established that such protein-DNA interactions occur preferentially in the lactating mammary gland. The analysis of several 5' deletion constructs identified the region between -853 and -729 bp as essential for WAP transgene expression. These results suggest that the distal DNase I hypersensitive region contains binding sites for CTF/NFI and plays a critical role in the regulation of WAP gene expression in transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2146801486,"In trimethylamine dehydrogenase, the enzyme-bound FMN is covalently linked to Cys-30 by a 6-S-cysteinyl FMN bond. The role played by this bond in catalysis has been investigated using a recombinant wild-type trimethylamine dehydrogenase and a Cys-30 to Ala-30 mutant, both expressed from a cloned gene (tmd) in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. The recombinant wild-type and C30A enzymes were found to be quantitatively associated with the 4Fe-4S center and ADP which are both present in the enzyme isolated from bacterium W3A1. In contrast to the enzyme isolated from bacterium W3A1, however, both recombinant proteins contained less than stoichiometric amounts of flavin and were refractory to reconstitution by FMN. The FMN in the recombinant wild-type enzyme was shown to be covalently linked to the protein, and the enzyme possessed catalytic properties similar to its counterpart isolated from bacterium W3A1. It is envisaged that flavinylation proceeds via a nucleophilic attack by the thiolate of Cys-30 at C-6 of the isoalloxazine ring of enzyme-bound FMN. The C30A mutant was found to bind FMN noncovalently and to also catalyze the demethylation of trimethylamine. The major effect of removing the 6-S-cysteinyl FMN bond is to raise the apparent Km for trimethylamine by 2 orders of magnitude and to diminish the apparent kcat for the reaction by only a factor of 2. Therefore, the 6-S-cysteinyl FMN bond is not essential for catalysis, but it is required for efficient functioning of the enzyme at micromolar concentrations of substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1482134855,"We have studied the relationship between folding and secretion competence of hsp150-beta lactamase fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. hsp150 is a secretory protein of yeast, and beta-lactamase was chosen, since its folding can be monitored by assaying its enzymatic activity. The hsp150 pre-pro-protein consists of a signal peptide, subunit I, a repetitive region, and a unique C terminus. Fusion of beta-lactamase to the C terminus of hsp150 produced Cla-bla protein, which was secretion-competent but inactive. The Pst-bla protein, where beta-lactamase was fused to subunit I, was also inactive and mostly secreted, but part of it remained in the pre-Golgi compartment. When beta-lactamase was fused to the C-terminus of the repetitive region, the fusion protein (Kpn-bla) was translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum, acquired disulfide bonds, and adopted an enzymatically active conformation. Kpn-bla was secreted to the medium without decrease of specific activity or retention in the cell. Folding of Kpn-bla to an active and transport-competent form required co-translational disulfide formation, since treatment of cells with dithiothreitol resulted in endoplasmic reticulum-retained inactive Kpn-bla. When dithiothreitol was removed, Kpn-bla resumed transport competence but remained inactive. Reduction of prefolded Kpn-bla did not inhibit enzymatic activity or transport. The repetitive hsp150 carrier may have use in heterologous protein production by conferring secretion competence to foreign proteins in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W26535959,"The type I interferons (IFNs) are a family of multifunctional cytokines which includes the 15 IFN alpha subtypes and IFN beta. These IFNs compete for binding to cell surface receptors. However, murine cells transfected with a cDNA for a human IFN alpha receptor (IFNAR) developed an antiviral response only to human IFN alpha B, but not to human IFN alpha 2 nor -beta(1). In this study we show, using a panel of CHO-human chromosome 21 hybrid cell lines which all express IFNAR, that only those containing the region 21q22.2 to 21q22.3 transduce signals for IFN responses. Two such hybrid cell lines responded to IFNs alpha 2, -alpha B and -beta by induction of 2‘-5‘ oligoadenylate synthetase and resistance to viral infection. Other hybrid cell lines, that lacked the region 21q22.2-3, failed to transduce signals as above; even though they expressed IFNAR and bound human IFN alpha 2, -alpha B, and -beta. These data demonstrate that a gene(s) located in the region 21q22.2-3 encodes a factor(s) which is necessary for signaling but does not influence ligand binding. This factor is not the cofactor required for IFN gamma signaling which is located in the region 21p to 21q22.1(2)."
https://openalex.org/W64666574,"Mitogenic stimulation of connective tissue cells by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has two unusual properties; entry into S-phase is delayed compared with that induced by other mitogens, and the dose response is biphasic, with low concentrations stimulating and high concentrations inhibiting or having no effect. A hypothesis that provides an explanation for both of these properties is that TGF-beta stimulates proliferation indirectly by inducing synthesis of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain, which in turn stimulates proliferation via autocrine activation of the PDGF receptor alpha-subunit (PDGFR alpha). High concentrations of TGF-beta reduce PDGFR alpha expression and break the autocrine loop. We tested this hypothesis by determining whether TGF-beta and interleukin-1 alpha can induce DNA synthesis in connective tissue (3T3) cells derived from the Patch mouse line in which the PDGFR alpha gene is deleted. We found that these cells do respond mitogenically to TGF-beta and interleukin-1 alpha, indicating that PDGF A-chain induction is not the sole mechanism of mitogenic stimulation. Reestablishing PDGFR alpha expression via transfection with a human PDGFR alpha construct enhanced the response to TGF-beta. Neutralizing anti-PDGF antiserum reduced TGF-beta stimulation of PDGFR alpha-expressing 3T3 cells by about 35%. We conclude that induction of PDGF A-chain/PDGFR alpha autocrine stimulation does contribute to the ability of TGF-beta to stimulate connective tissue cells, but that there is, in addition, a PDGF-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1512178996,"A mouse testis cDNA expression library was screened using a monoclonal antibody (1C9) that recognized an abundant testis-specific 101-kDa endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein. The screening resulted in the isolation of a 2.3-kilobase cDNA clone (A2/6). The sequence encoded 611 amino acids with a calculated mass of 69,454 Da, that was 60% similar to mouse calnexin. A high affinity calcium binding domain, present in both calnexin and calreticulin, and one transmembrane domain similar to that of calnexin were found in the A2/6 protein domain. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from seven different tissues showed hybridization only to testis RNA. Southern blot analysis indicated that A2/6 was a single copy gene. The calculated molecular mass for A2/6 was unexpectedly lower than the 101-kDa protein recognized by 1C9 on Western blot analysis of total testis protein. However, Escherichia coli and in vitro translation products of A2/6 cDNA yielded a similar 100-kDa protein. Finally, using the recombinant protein, calcium binding activity was detected by a 45Ca2+ overlay assay. These results suggest that spermatogenic cell endoplasmic reticulum has a unique calcium binding protein, calnexin-t, which appears to be a calnexin variant."
https://openalex.org/W1894223222,"Abstract IA-1 is a novel cDNA originally isolated from a human insulinoma subtraction library (ISL-153). It encodes a protein containing both a zinc finger DNA-binding domain and a putative prohormone domain. IA-1 transcripts have been found thus far only in tumors of neuroendocrine origin. Clinical studies have shown that IA-1 is a sensitive marker for neuroendocrine differentiation of human lung tumors. In this study, we cloned and sequenced the entire IA-1 gene and its 5'-upstream region from a human liver genomic library. In situ hybridization localized the IA-1 gene to the short arm of human chromosome 20. Sequence analysis and restriction enzyme mapping showed that the IA-1 gene is uninterrupted and appears to be intronless. Evidence that IA-1 is an intronless gene that can translate into protein was obtained from in vitro translation studies that showed that both IA-1 cDNA and IA-1 genomic DNA yielded identical protein products of approximately 61,000 daltons. Examination of the 5'-upstream region (2090 base pairs) revealed several tissue-specific regulatory elements, including glucokinase upstream promoter elements and a Pit-1 factor binding site. The presence of several different upstream regulatory elements may account for IA-1 gene expression in different neuroendocrine tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1483670107,"The cAMP response unit of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) gene promoter consists of two independently weak components; the typical cAMP response element and a region of the promoter that contains three binding sites for CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins. Previous work from our laboratory indicated that all three binding sites were required for the full response to cAMP. However, in the present study, we demonstrate that the activity of this latter component cannot be mimicked by multiple copies of other well characterized CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein binding sites. Re-examination of the premoter region containing the three C/EBP binding sites revealed the presence of an additional cis-element, which is required to mediate the activation by cAMP. This DNA sequence binds a protein in HepG2 nuclear extracts that is distinct from CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein and cAMP response element-binding protein, and evidence is presented which suggests that its identity is activator protein-1. Thus, the robust response of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene promoter to cAMP in liver requires the involvement of three different transcription factors. Utilization of multiple transcription factors to mediate the activation by cAMP likely allows for a tissue-specific response to this signal, a mechanism whereby to fine-tune the extent of the response, and a mechanism whereby to integrate signals from separate signaling pathways into a coordinated response."
https://openalex.org/W1595040373,"Macrophage capping protein (MCP) is a unique member of the gelsolin-villin family of calcium-activated barbed end capping proteins which in micromolar Ca2+ also binds actin monomers and nucleates actin assembly. Unlike gelsolin, MCP cannot sever actin filaments, and its Ca(2+)-dependent interaction with actin is completely reversible. The Ca2+ binding properties of MCP and its Ca(2+)-dependent functions were studied quantitatively. MCP undergoes a Ca(2+)-induced conformational change as evidenced by different chymotryptic digest patterns in 0.2 mM CaCl2 compared with 2 mM EGTA. MCP has a single low affinity Ca2+ binding site (KD = 37 microM). Binding of MCP to actin monomers requires a similar Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]0.5 = 62 microM) suggesting that MCP.Ca2+ complex formation promotes monomer binding. In contrast, filament capping by MCP requires 1/60th of the Ca2+ concentration required for monomer binding, half-maximal capping occurring at 1 microM Ca2+. The marked difference in the Ca2+ sensitivity of these two functions indicate that MCP's primary actin regulatory role in the macrophage is likely to be capping of the barbed ends of actin filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1604206379,"Activin A stimulated DNA synthesis and transient c-fos expression in quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. The activin A-induced DNA synthesis was dose-dependent with a half-maximal effect obtained at 0.3 nM. The maximal response obtained at 10 nM was comparable with that induced by 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor. Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts expressed abundant high affinity binding sites for 125I-labeled activin A with a Kd value of 0.63 nM and the number of binding sites at 24,000/cell. Northern blot analysis revealed that Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts express a high level of type II activin receptor mRNA. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of mitogenic action of activin A, we examined the effect of activin A on mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Unexpectedly, however, activin A did not induce kinase activation under conditions in which basic fibroblast growth factor and endothelin-1 at similar or even less potent mitogenic concentrations did. Furthermore, activin A did not induce phosphorylation of the Erk2 species of mitogen-activated protein kinase. These observations strongly suggest that the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase is not a necessary step for activin A-induced DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W159484846,"We have hypothesized that type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) may exacerbate accumulation of extracellular matrix in atheroma by inhibiting local generation of plasmin and intramural proteolysis. Thus, suppression of PAI-1 expression would decrease atherogenesis. To inhibit expression of PAI-1 in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial and aortic smooth muscle cells, a 20-base antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide targeting specific sequences in the 3'-untranslated region of the PAI-1 gene was used. Studies with 32P-labeled oligomers verified stability in media. Secretion of PAI-1 protein assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay declined specifically and dose-dependently in cells exposed to the antisense oligonucleotide treated under basal conditions and after stimulation of PAI-1 expression with transforming growth factor beta (0.5 ng/ml for endothelial cell, 5 ng/ml for smooth muscle cell). Inhibition of expression was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled PAI-1 and was paralleled by decreased steady-state levels of PAI-1 mRNA (Northern blots). Decreased PAI-1 synthesis was accompanied by augmentation of cell-associated plasmin activity. Thus, the antisense oligonucleotide down-regulated PAI-1 elaboration, an approach that may be useful in limiting obstructive vascular lesions."
https://openalex.org/W112086784,"High density lipoprotein-associated cholesteryl esters (HDL CE) are taken up by many cells without parallel uptake of HDL apoproteins, a pathway we have termed selective uptake. The first step in this pathway, the reversible incorporation of HDL CE into the plasma membrane, is the subject of the present study. To examine the role of membrane proteins, the rate of HDL CE incorporation into isolated rat liver plasma membrane was compared with the rate of incorporation into synthetic membranes devoid of protein. Both membrane systems exhibited saturable uptake of CE, and at rates that were similar (t1/2 approximately 2 h, measured with 50 micrograms of HDL protein). Addition of unlabeled HDL to chase CE tracer from the biological and synthetic membranes revealed two kinetically distinct CE pools (t1/2 approximately 0.5 h and t1/2 approximately 30 h). Both biological and synthetic membranes accepted similar amounts of CE into both pools, with a maximum incorporation of 2-4 mol % relative to membrane phospholipids. CE transfer between HDL and membranes was kinetically second-order, in contrast to the first-order transfer of unesterified cholesterol. There was no evidence for direct participation of any apolipoprotein in CE uptake; CE in HDL or in protein-free microemulsions of similar particle size transferred to membranes at similar rates. To examine the possibility that CE transfer requires transient fusion of the HDL amphipathic coat with the membrane outer leaflet, radiolabeled cardiolipin was incorporated into either HDL particles or into synthetic membranes as an amphipathic coat marker that does not diffuse through the aqueous phase; transfer between HDL and membranes was not observed. Thus, CE are transferred between HDL and cell membranes in a collision-mediated process that does not involve amphipathic coat fusion and is not dependent on either membrane protein or apolipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1503380933,"Abstract Platelet activation and aggregation by fibrillar collagens are based on substrate primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure. Although several peptides incorporating sequences from the triple-helical domains of types I and III collagen inhibit collagen-mediated platelet aggregation, none independently promote platelet activation and aggregation. It is believed that the absence of these platelet activities is due to the lack of proper substrate tertiary and quaternary structures. We have utilized a synthetic, triple-helical mini-collagen that incorporates a known cell adhesion site (alpha 1(IV)1263-1277) to better understand the relationship between substrate primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure and platelet activation and aggregation. The promotion of platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation was compared for this triple-helical polypeptide (THP), fibrillar and type IV collagens, and a single-stranded peptide (SSP) incorporating the alpha 1(IV)1263-1277 sequence. Glass-coated fibrillar and type IV collagens and the THP supported platelet adhesion at substrate concentrations of 0.33 nM, 0.20 nM, and 0.89 microM, respectively. When platelets were stirred with 10 micrograms/ml of fibrillar (0.33 nM) and type IV (0.20 nM) collagen, SSP (2.1 microM), and THP (0.89 microM), only the fibrillar collagen caused 3H-labeled arachidonic acid release, elevation of cytosolic calcium, irreversible aggregation, and secretion of granule contents. The THP (0.45-1.8 microM) effectively inhibited fibrillar collagen-mediated platelet aggregation, while the SSP did not. At a substrate concentration of 40 micrograms/ml, the THP (3.6 microM) was as effective as fibrillar collagen (1.3 nM) at inducing 3H-labeled oleic acid-labeled platelet activation and microaggregate formation, while the SSP and type IV collagen were relatively ineffective. Rotary shadowing images indicated that aggregates of the THP could form distinct quaternary structures, while the type IV collagen used here could not. These results are the first demonstrations of a synthetic peptide promoting platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation and suggest that the combination of THP primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structural features are required for platelet aggregation."

Here, we report the crystal structure of the sequence isomer having Pro and Leu at residues 22 and 25 (the PL form). This elimination of the sequence heterogeneity resulted in a simpler structure which permits a more accurate modeling of protein disorder. In the observed disorder, the PL form structure and the mixed form structure have significant differences: 1) the disorder caused by the sequence heterogeneity (Pro2/Ser22, Leu/Ile25, Tyr29) is absent in the PL form; 2) Phe13 and Glu23 disordered in the mixed form have only one conformation in the PL form; and 3) Asn12 has multiple conformations in the PL form. During the study of disorder in the PL form structure, we found that conformational correlation can be inferred from a structure determined with Bragg's reflections by introducing fundamental stereochemical information, van der Waals contact (Gursky, O., Badger, J., Li, Y., and Caspar, D. L. D. (1992) Biophys. J. 63, 1210-1220), although an x-ray structure is an image averaged over a large number of copies and the period of data collection and does not carry direct evidence about correlations. The correlations among Thr2,Arg10, and Ile34 present the clearest example. The dimension of this correlation is comparable with the short-range (4-8 A) correlations in the atomic displacements concluded from the x-ray diffuse scattering experiments (Caspar, D. L.

https://openalex.org/W1571576335,"Here we report the identification of a new mutation in the alpha-chain of the insulin receptor, changing Trp412 into Ser using DNA from consanguineous parents who gave birth to a child with leprechaunism. The mutant receptor was expressed stably in CHO and transiently in COS-1 cells. It was found that the Ser412 mutant is not cleaved into alpha- and beta-subunits and remains as a 210-kDa proreceptor at an intracellular site. This property of the mutant receptor is in line with the observed decreased insulin binding to the parental fibroblasts. Cross-linking experiments show that the Ser412 proreceptor is able to bind insulin with an affinity comparable to that of the wild-type alpha-chain. Despite its capacity to bind insulin, the mutant receptor is not autophosphorylated. We postulate that the patient was homozygous for the Trp412–>Ser mutation and that the mutation was responsible for the leprechaun phenotype. This is the first description of a transport-defective receptor with the mutation outside the tetrabasic processing site and a functional insulin binding domain. The ability of the Ser412 mutant to bind insulin in cross-linking experiments suggests that the impaired transport of the proreceptor to the cell surface is the primary cause for the binding defect to intact cells."

ChPTP lambda has transcripts of about 5.6 kilobases and is abundant in spleen, intestine, and fibroblasts transformed by oncogenic ras or erbA/B. It has five alternative splicing products varying near their amino termini, and the largest one contains 1237 amino acids. The extracellular domain of ChPTP lambda has several features including a Ser/Thr/Pro-rich region, one fibronectin type III module, and spectrin-like repeats (the first case that spectrin-like repeats were found in the non-cytoplasmic compartment). These repeats were also found in other phosphatases, including CD45 and yeast acid phosphatases PHO5 and PHO3. Antibodies to ChPTP lambda recognized several protein species whose M(r) range from 170,000 to 210,000. ChPTP lambda exhibited phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatase activity. Since CD45 also has these features in the extracellular domain and the two protein-tyrosine phosphatases share 70% similarity in the intracellular domains, we propose that ChPTP lambda and CD45 belong to the same gene family."

Electron microscopic analysis of the reaction products showed displacement of one strand of the linear duplex DNA by the circular ssDNA molecule. In addition, the protein contained 5' to 3' exonuclease activity on ssDNA and dsDNA (with a 50-fold preference on the single-stranded substrate) as well as on single-stranded RNA. Furthermore, p140 was capable of renaturing complementary ssDNA as shown by S1 nuclease assays. p140 behaved like a monomer in solution under reaction conditions. Direct comparison of the biochemical properties, sequence analysis, and cross-reactivity to a monoclonal antibody suggests that p140 is probably identical with ExoII, purified from S. pombe meiotic cells as a ssDNA exonuclease (Szankasi, P., and Smith, G. R. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 6769-6773). Given the diverse activities of p140, the protein might be involved in DNA and/or RNA metabolism in vivo."

The accompanying report (Kaslin, E., and Heyer, W.-D. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 0000-0000) described the purification and characterization of p140exo2, likely to be the S. pombe homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strand exchange protein p175SEP1. Here, we report the purification of p190/210 from S. pombe cells and its identification as fatty acid synthase (FAS). S. pombe FAS (p190/210) binds to single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, leading to condensation of DNA into large aggregates. In addition, it is capable of renaturing complementary single-stranded DNA. Besides stimulating the strand exchange activity of p140exo2, FAS (p190/210) itself exhibits strand exchange activity provided the double-stranded substrate has single-stranded tails. We propose a probable mechanism for the action of FAS (p190/210) during DNA strand exchange in vitro. Since FAS (p190/210) is highly unlikely to have a role in homologous recombination in vivo, we discuss the implications of our data on the interpretation of other homologous pairing and strand exchange proteins purified from eukaryotes using this or similar assays."
https://openalex.org/W1553932831,"We have identified a motility factor in conditioned medium of human fibroblasts that stimulates the migration of HepG2 cells in the Boyden chamber assay. This factor, termed epitaxin, was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, and a series of reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Under a nonreducing condition, purified epitaxin migrated as a 36-kDa band, and the biological activity was recovered from the area in the gel coinciding with this band. Purified epitaxin stimulates the motility of HepG2 cells in the concentrations above 1 ng/ml with half-maximal activity at 4.2 ng/ml, and its mode of action is mainly chemotactic. Epitaxin slightly stimulates DNA synthesis of HepG2 cells, while scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor which also stimulates the motility of HepG2 cells showed a growth-inhibitory effect. Epitaxin increases the motility of a wide variety of epithelially derived tumor cell lines, but none of the tested fibroblast lines responded to epitaxin. These results define epitaxin as a novel fibroblast-derived factor that affects the migration, and possibly the invasion, of epithelially derived tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1551805229,"The main redox component of the O2- generating oxidase complex in neutrophils is believed to be a b-type cytochrome, named cytochrome b558. In the course of purification of cytochrome b558 from rabbit peritoneal neutrophils, another hemoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa, referred to as p-30, was isolated. Although the spectrum of p-30 was virtually identical to that of cytochrome b558, its redox potential, Em,7 = -4 +/- 10 mV, was much less negative than that of cytochrome b558 (-270 +/- 5 mV). The alkaline pyridine hemochrome from purified p-30 was typical of a b-type cytochrome. The 20 N-terminal amino acid residues and some tryptic peptides isolated from p-30 did not show any significant sequence homology to the human phagocyte cytochrome b558 or to mitochondrial and microsomal cytochromes, except for the N-terminal region which displayed some homology to that of rat liver P-450. After subcellular fractionation, p-30 was found to be located in the plasma membrane and the granule fractions, similarly to cytochrome b558. Upon neutrophil activation, part of p-30 was transferred from granules to the plasma membrane."

Antisense oligonucleotide was found to reduce (at 2 microM) or completely block (at 15 microM) the stimulation by insulin of DNA synthesis, measured as thymidine incorporation. The residual DNA synthesis seen in the absence of insulin stimulation was also inhibited by the Raf-1 kinase antisense oligonucleotide."
