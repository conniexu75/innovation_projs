https://openalex.org/W2091234451,"Based on sequence homology to the human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (OATP2; SLC21A6), we cloned a new member of the SLC21A superfamily of solute carriers, termed OATP8 (SLC21A8). The protein of 702 amino acids showed an amino acid identity of 80% with human OATP2. Based on Northern blotting, the expression of OATP8 was restricted to human liver. Cosmid clones containing the genes encoding human OATP1 (SLC21A3), OATP2 (SLC21A6), and OATP8 (SLC21A8) served to establish their genomic organization. All three genes contained 14 exons with 13 identical splice sites when transferred to the amino acid sequence. An antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus localized OATP8 to the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes and the recombinant glycoprotein, expressed in MDCKII cells, to the lateral membrane. Transport properties of OATP8 were studied in stably transfected MDCKII and HEK293 cells. Organic anions transported by human OATP8 included sulfobromophthalein, with aKm of 3.3 μm, and 17β-glucuronosyl estradiol, with a Km of 5.4 μm. Several bile salts were not substrates. Thus, human OATP8 is a new uptake transporter in the basolateral hepatocyte membrane with an overlapping but distinct substrate specificity as compared with OATP2, which is localized to the same membrane domain.

Their substrates comprise a broad range of different structures ranging from inorganic compounds to organic cations and anions as well as amino acids and small peptides. Within this superfamily, the uptake transporters for organic anions are classified into the organic anion/prostaglandin transporter family SLC21A (Human Gene Nomenclature Committee Data Base). Best characterized within this gene family are the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) (1Meier P.J. Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B.

These substances were also identified as substrates or competitive inhibitors of the recently cloned second member of the human OATPs, OATP2 (SLC21A6) (5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the fact that both proteins share only 44% amino acid identity, they have a similar substrate specificity and a similar predicted topology (5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, they differ with respect to their tissue-specific expression. Human OATP1 was cloned from liver but exhibits the highest expression in brain (2Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J.

In contrast, human OATP2 shows a high expression only in liver as tested by Northern blotting (3Abe T. Kakyo M. Tokui T. Nakagomi R. Nishio T. Nakai D. Nomura H. Unno M. Suzuki M. Naitoh T.

Recently, the sequences of three additional members of the human OATP family designatedOATP-B (SLC21A9), OATP-D (SLC21A11), and OATP-E (SLC21A12) were reported (see Table I for accession numbers). The amino acid sequences of these three transporters are quite distinct from human OATP1 and OATP2. Until now, the transporters OATP-B, -D, and -E were not further characterized.Table INomenclature and amino acid sequence identities of human OATP8 with related human transporters of the OATP (SLC21A) familyIdentities are given in relation to human OATP8 (black box). Analysis was performed using the tree alignment from the Heidelberg Unix Sequence Analysis Resource program package (16Senger M. Glatting K.H. Ritter O. Suhai S. Comput. Methods Programs Biomed. 1995; 46: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Gaps in the consecutive numbering of the gene symbols have been reserved for yet unknown human orthologs of rat OATPs. The SLC21A gene nomenclature is based on the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee Data Base. Open table in a new tab So far, little is known about the genomic organization of the human OATP family members. The human OATP1 gene has been localized to chromosome 12p12 (13Kullak-Ublick G.A. Beuers U. Meier P.J. Domdey H. Paumgartner G. J. Hepatol. 1996; 25: 985-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and its promoter region as well as its regulatory properties have been studied (14Kullak-Ublick G.A. Beuers U. Fahney C. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Paumgartner G. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this study (14Kullak-Ublick G.A. Beuers U. Fahney C. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Paumgartner G. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the length of the first exon and the first exon/intron splice site were determined, but the complete genomic organization of the OATP1 gene has not been reported. Moreover, no information is currently available on the genomic organization and the chromosomal localization of the other human OATP family members.Therefore, we screened a genomic data base using the humanOATP2 cDNA to identify a cosmid clone containing the genomic sequence of this transporter. We identified one cosmid clone containing cDNA sequences that were highly homologous to but distinct from OATP2 cDNA sequences. By combining these genomic DNA sequences, we identified a new OATP cDNA, which was termed OATP8 (SLC21A8). Based on this partial cDNA sequence, we cloned the full-length cDNA and analyzed the genomic organization of this transporter in comparison with the genomic organization of human OATP1 and human OATP2. Northern blot analysis revealed a liver-specific expression similar to that of OATP2. An OATP8-specific antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus served to detect the protein in the basolateral hepatocyte membrane of human liver. The recombinant protein was localized to the lateral membrane of stably transfected MDCKII cells. In addition to these MDCKII cells, stably transfected HEK293 cells served to determine transport characteristics of this new transporter OATP8.DISCUSSIONWe have cloned and characterized a new member of the human OATP family belonging to the solute carrier superfamily. The newly identified transporter is the eighth member of the SLC21A family, and the gene symbol accordingly is SLC21A8. By following the numbering of the gene nomenclature, the translation product of this new gene was termed OATP8. All known OATPs within the SLC family exhibit common features. They all are glycosylated and have a similar secondary structure with 12 predicted transmembrane helices (1Meier P.J. Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the OATP family, OATP8 shows the highest degree of identity, both on nucleotide and amino acid level, to human OATP2 (4Hsiang B. Zhu Y. Wang Z. Wu Y. Sasseville V. Yang W.-P. Kirchgessner T.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22395-22401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), whereas other OATPs are expressed in a variety of tissues as shown for human OATP1 with its expression in brain, kidney, liver, and testis (2Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1274-1282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).The genomic organization of human OATP1 (SLC21A3), OATP2 (SLC21A6), and OATP8 is very similar. All three genes contain 14 exons with an average exon size of about 150 bp. All 13 introns share identical phases with a high proportion of class 1 phases, where the codon is interrupted between the first and the second nucleotide (Fig. 1). The genomic organization of human OATP2 (SLC21A6) and OATP8 (SLC21A8) is closely related with 13 exons identical in length. The genomic organization of OATP8 compared with OATP1 revealed 9 exons identical in length. Fig. 1demonstrates that the 5 exons differing in length exhibit gaps in the amino acid alignment leading to the different number of base pairs. OATP1 has been mapped to chromosome 12p12 (13Kullak-Ublick G.A. Beuers U. Meier P.J. Domdey H. Paumgartner G. J. Hepatol. 1996; 25: 985-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and for OATP8 the genomic clone allows for localization to chromosome 12p12–31.7 to 12p12–37.2. Thus, human OATP1 (SLC21A3), OATP2 (SLC21A6), and OATP8 (SLC21A8) differ with respect to their amino acid composition, but their genomic organization indicates that they are closely related and possibly originate from a gene amplification.The cellular localization of OATP8 was examined by the antibody SKT directed against the carboxyl terminus of the protein (Fig. 1). This antibody did not cross-react with human OATP2 (Fig. 5). The OATP8 glycoprotein was detected in the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes (Fig. 3), which is the same membrane domain to which human OATP2 has been localized (5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this is the same localization as demonstrated for human OATP1 (1Meier P.J. Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and for several rat OATP family members (25Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Stieger B. Hochli M.

Hepatology. 1994; 20: 411-416PubMed Google Scholar) except for rat OATP1, which is apically localized in kidney (28Bergwerk A.J. Shi X. Ford A.C. Kanai N. Jacquemin E. Burk R.D. Bai S. Novikoff P.M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Schuster V.L. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G231-G238PubMed Google Scholar) and brain (29Angeletti R.H. Novikoff P.M. Juvvadi S.R. Fritschy J.M. Meier P.J. Wolkoff A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Interestingly, OATP8 was not detected in bile ductular cells (Fig. 3, H and I). These cells also lack expression of human OATP2 (5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To investigate the transport properties of the recombinant glycoprotein, we used transfected MDCKII and HEK293 cells overexpressing human OATP8. In polarized MDCKII cells transfected with OATP8 cDNA, the cellular localization was restricted to the lateral membrane, whereas in the nonpolarized HEK293 cells the recombinant protein was localized to the whole plasma membrane (Fig.4). Using the HEK293 cells stably expressing the recombinant protein, several typical organic anions including BSP, E217βG, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were transported by OATP8 (Table IIand Fig. 6). The apparent Km values for BSP and E217βG were 3.3 and 5.4 μm, respectively. These Km values were in the same range as the ones for transport by recombinant rat Oatp1 (25Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Stieger B. Hochli M. Landmann L. Tynes R. Meier P.J. Hagenbuch B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1037-G1042PubMed Google Scholar). The Kmvalue for E217βG was comparable with the one determined with human OATP2 (5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major difference between the hepatic basolateral uptake transporters OATP2 and OATP8 concerns their ability to transport certain bile salts. In contrast to human OATP2, which transports cholyl taurine and whose 17β-glucuronosyl estradiol transport was inhibited by cholate (5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), OATP8 did neither transport cholyl taurine nor cholate nor cholyl glycine. Both transporters thus have overlapping substrate specificities as well as clear differences that require further detailed characterization. An additional marked difference between OATP2 and OATP8 became apparent in the deglycosylation experiments indicating that OATP8 in human liver is much more glycosylated than OATP2 (Fig. 5). Deglycosylation yields a similar molecular mass for both proteins that corresponds to the mass predicted on the basis of the number of amino acids. It will be of interest to examine in more detail a role of the different oligosaccharide moieties of OATP8 and OATP2 in human hepatocytes.In summary, human OATP8 represents the third member of the human OATP family of transporters that was cloned, localized, and functionally examined. OATP8 is the second uptake transporter, in addition to OATP2 (3Abe T. Kakyo M. Tokui T. Nakagomi R. Nishio T. Nakai D. Nomura H. Unno M. Suzuki M. Naitoh T. Matsuno S. Yawo H. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is predominantly, if not exclusively, expressed in human liver and mediates the sodium-independent, high affinity uptake of important physiological amphiphilic organic anions into hepatocytes. It will be of interest to identify additional mutually exclusive endogenous substrates for human OATP2 and OATP8, in addition to cholate and cholyl taurine. The gene superfamily of solute carriers (SLC)1 comprises a growing family of different types of transporters. Their substrates comprise a broad range of different structures ranging from inorganic compounds to organic cations and anions as well as amino acids and small peptides.

Recently, the sequences of three additional members of the human OATP family designatedOATP-B (SLC21A9), OATP-D (SLC21A11), and OATP-E (SLC21A12) were reported (see Table I for accession numbers). The amino acid sequences of these three transporters are quite distinct from human OATP1 and OATP2. Until now, the transporters OATP-B, -D, and -E were not further characterized. Identities are given in relation to human OATP8 (black box). Analysis was performed using the tree alignment from the Heidelberg Unix Sequence Analysis Resource program package (16Senger M. Glatting K.H. Ritter O. Suhai S. Comput. Methods Programs Biomed. 1995; 46: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Gaps in the consecutive numbering of the gene symbols have been reserved for yet unknown human orthologs of rat OATPs. The SLC21A gene nomenclature is based on the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee Data Base. So far, little is known about the genomic organization of the human OATP family members. The human OATP1 gene has been localized to chromosome 12p12 (13Kullak-Ublick G.A. Beuers U. Meier P.J. Domdey H. Paumgartner G. J. Hepatol. 1996; 25: 985-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and its promoter region as well as its regulatory properties have been studied (14Kullak-Ublick G.A. Beuers U. Fahney C. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Paumgartner G. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this study (14Kullak-Ublick G.A. Beuers U. Fahney C. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Paumgartner G. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the length of the first exon and the first exon/intron splice site were determined, but the complete genomic organization of the OATP1 gene has not been reported. Moreover, no information is currently available on the genomic organization and the chromosomal localization of the other human OATP family members. Therefore, we screened a genomic data base using the humanOATP2 cDNA to identify a cosmid clone containing the genomic sequence of this transporter. We identified one cosmid clone containing cDNA sequences that were highly homologous to but distinct from OATP2 cDNA sequences. By combining these genomic DNA sequences, we identified a new OATP cDNA, which was termed OATP8 (SLC21A8). Based on this partial cDNA sequence, we cloned the full-length cDNA and analyzed the genomic organization of this transporter in comparison with the genomic organization of human OATP1 and human OATP2. Northern blot analysis revealed a liver-specific expression similar to that of OATP2. An OATP8-specific antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus served to detect the protein in the basolateral hepatocyte membrane of human liver. The recombinant protein was localized to the lateral membrane of stably transfected MDCKII cells. In addition to these MDCKII cells, stably transfected HEK293 cells served to determine transport characteristics of this new transporter OATP8. DISCUSSIONWe have cloned and characterized a new member of the human OATP family belonging to the solute carrier superfamily. The newly identified transporter is the eighth member of the SLC21A family, and the gene symbol accordingly is SLC21A8. By following the numbering of the gene nomenclature, the translation product of this new gene was termed OATP8. All known OATPs within the SLC family exhibit common features. They all are glycosylated and have a similar secondary structure with 12 predicted transmembrane helices (1Meier P.J. Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the OATP family, OATP8 shows the highest degree of identity, both on nucleotide and amino acid level, to human OATP2 (4Hsiang B. Zhu Y. Wang Z. Wu Y. Sasseville V. Yang W.-P. Kirchgessner T.G.

Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1274-1282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).The genomic organization of human OATP1 (SLC21A3), OATP2 (SLC21A6), and OATP8 is very similar. All three genes contain 14 exons with an average exon size of about 150 bp. All 13 introns share identical phases with a high proportion of class 1 phases, where the codon is interrupted between the first and the second nucleotide (Fig. 1). The genomic organization of human OATP2 (SLC21A6) and OATP8 (SLC21A8) is closely related with 13 exons identical in length. The genomic organization of OATP8 compared with OATP1 revealed 9 exons identical in length. Fig. 1demonstrates that the 5 exons differing in length exhibit gaps in the amino acid alignment leading to the different number of base pairs. OATP1 has been mapped to chromosome 12p12 (13Kullak-Ublick G.A. Beuers U. Meier P.J. Domdey H. Paumgartner G. J. Hepatol. 1996; 25: 985-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and for OATP8 the genomic clone allows for localization to chromosome 12p12–31.7 to 12p12–37.2. Thus, human OATP1 (SLC21A3), OATP2 (SLC21A6), and OATP8 (SLC21A8) differ with respect to their amino acid composition, but their genomic organization indicates that they are closely related and possibly originate from a gene amplification.The cellular localization of OATP8 was examined by the antibody SKT directed against the carboxyl terminus of the protein (Fig. 1). This antibody did not cross-react with human OATP2 (Fig. 5). The OATP8 glycoprotein was detected in the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes (Fig. 3), which is the same membrane domain to which human OATP2 has been localized (5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this is the same localization as demonstrated for human OATP1 (1Meier P.J. Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and for several rat OATP family members (25Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Stieger B. Hochli M.

Wolkoff A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Interestingly, OATP8 was not detected in bile ductular cells (Fig. 3, H and I). These cells also lack expression of human OATP2 (5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To investigate the transport properties of the recombinant glycoprotein, we used transfected MDCKII and HEK293 cells overexpressing human OATP8. In polarized MDCKII cells transfected with OATP8 cDNA, the cellular localization was restricted to the lateral membrane, whereas in the nonpolarized HEK293 cells the recombinant protein was localized to the whole plasma membrane (Fig.4). Using the HEK293 cells stably expressing the recombinant protein, several typical organic anions including BSP, E217βG, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were transported by OATP8 (Table IIand Fig. 6). The apparent Km values for BSP and E217βG were 3.3 and 5.4 μm, respectively. These Km values were in the same range as the ones for transport by recombinant rat Oatp1 (25Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Stieger B. Hochli M. Landmann L. Tynes R. Meier P.J. Hagenbuch B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1037-G1042PubMed Google Scholar). The Kmvalue for E217βG was comparable with the one determined with human OATP2 (5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major difference between the hepatic basolateral uptake transporters OATP2 and OATP8 concerns their ability to transport certain bile salts. In contrast to human OATP2, which transports cholyl taurine and whose 17β-glucuronosyl estradiol transport was inhibited by cholate (5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), OATP8 did neither transport cholyl taurine nor cholate nor cholyl glycine. Both transporters thus have overlapping substrate specificities as well as clear differences that require further detailed characterization. An additional marked difference between OATP2 and OATP8 became apparent in the deglycosylation experiments indicating that OATP8 in human liver is much more glycosylated than OATP2 (Fig. 5). Deglycosylation yields a similar molecular mass for both proteins that corresponds to the mass predicted on the basis of the number of amino acids. It will be of interest to examine in more detail a role of the different oligosaccharide moieties of OATP8 and OATP2 in human hepatocytes.In summary, human OATP8 represents the third member of the human OATP family of transporters that was cloned, localized, and functionally examined. OATP8 is the second uptake transporter, in addition to OATP2 (3Abe T. Kakyo M. Tokui T. Nakagomi R. Nishio T. Nakai D. Nomura H. Unno M. Suzuki M. Naitoh T. Matsuno S. Yawo H. J. Biol.

By subtracting the mRNAs expressed by the mouse epidermus-derived DC line XS52 with the mRNAs expressed by the J774 macrophage line, we identified five novel genes that were expressed selectively by this DC line. One of these genes encoded a type II membrane-integrated polypeptide of 244 amino acids containing a putative carbohydrate recognition domain motif at the COOH-terminal end. This molecule, termed “dectin-1,” was expressed abundantly at both mRNA and protein levels by the XS52 DC line, but not by non-DC lines (including the J774 macrophage line). Dectin-1 mRNA was detected predominantly in spleen and thymus (by Northern blotting) and in skin-resident DC, i.e. Langerhans cells (by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). Affinity-purified antibody against dectin-1 identified a 43-kDa glycoprotein in membrane fractions isolated from the XS52 DC line and from the dectin-1 cDNA-transfected COS-1 cells. His-tagged recombinant proteins containing the extracellular domains of dectin-1 showed marked and specific binding to the surface of T cells and promoted their proliferation in the presence of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody at suboptimal concentrations. These in vitro results suggest that dectin-1 on DC may bind to as yet undefined ligand(s) on T cells, thereby delivering T cell co-stimulatory signals. Not only do these results document the efficacy of subtractive cDNA cloning for the identification of unique genes expressed by DC, they also provide a framework for studying the physiological function of dectin-1.

Blood. 1997; 90: 3245-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DC are characterized morphologically by the extension of long, lamellar dendrites. Upon activation with proinflammatory stimuli, DC acquire surface expression of relatively large amounts of major histocompatibility complex class I and class II molecules as well as co-stimulatory molecules (e.g. CD40, CD80, and CD86) and adhesion molecules (e.g. CD11a, CD11c, CD54, CD58, and CD102) (1.Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12348) Google Scholar, 6.Hart D.N.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3245-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These surface molecules allow DC to establish intimate, antigen-specific interaction with T cells. DC are also capable of incorporating exogenous antigens efficiently by phagocytosis, endocytosis, and pinocytosis (7.Lanzavecchia A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and surface expression of IgG and IgE receptors and carbohydrate receptors appears to contribute to this function (8.Fanger N.A.

Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This mobility is mediated in part by the expression of homing receptors (e.g.CD44, CD62P ligand, and cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen) and chemokine receptors (e.g. CXC chemokine receptor-1, -2, and -3 and CC chemokine receptor-1 through -7) (6.Hart D.N.J.

Finally, DC elaborate a wide variety of cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-α) and chemokines (IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α and -1γ, DC-chemokine-1, and thymus-expressed chemokine) (17.Caux C.

The ultimate goal in our laboratories has been to understand the biology of DC at a molecular level. As an initial step, we established a stable, long term DC line from the epidermis of newborn BALB/c mice. This DC line, termed “XS52,” retains important features of resident DC in the epidermis of skin (i.e. Langerhans cells), including their surface phenotype, antigen-presenting capacity, and cytokine and cytokine receptor profiles (19.Mohamadzadeh M.

Taking the advantage of having relatively large numbers of a pure DC population (with cell doubling time of 18–24 h), we chose to employ the subtractive cloning strategy for the identification of genes that are expressed preferentially by a DC line. Here we report the results of this molecular approach, focusing on the characterization of one of the novel genes identified by the subtraction. Female BALB/c mice (6–10 weeks old) and New Zealand White rabbits (4–20 weeks old) were housed in the pathogen-free facility of the Animal Resource Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. All of the experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health. XS52 cells are a long term DC line established from the epidermis of BALB/c mice (22.Xu S. Ariizumi K. Caceres-Dittmar G. Edelbaum D. Hashimoto K. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2697-2705PubMed Google Scholar). This line was maintained and expanded in complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with mouse recombinant granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (1 ng/ml) and NS47 fibroblast culture supernatant (10% v/v) as a source of CSF-1 (22.Xu S.

The J774 cells are a long term macrophage line established from BALB/c mice; this line was purchased from the American Tissue Type Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in complete RPMI 1640 in the absence of added growth factors. We also used the Pam 212 keratinocyte line (32.Yuspa S.H. Hawley-Nelson P. Koehler B. Stanley J.R. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 4694-4703PubMed Google Scholar), NS fibroblast lines (22.Xu S. Ariizumi K.

Epidermal cells were isolated from abdominal skin of BALB/c mice using two sequential trypsin treatments and then enriched for Langerhans cells by centrifugation over Histopaque (1.083; Sigma) as before (30.Ariizumi K. Kitajima T. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2137-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36.Matsue H. Edelbaum D. Hartmann A.C. Morita A. Bergstresser P.R. Yagita H. Okumura K. Takashima A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5287-5298PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, the epidermal cells harvested from the medium/Histopaque interface (interface epidermal cells) were depleted of Langerhans cells by anti-Ia mAb plus complement treatment as before (30.Ariizumi K. Kitajima T. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2137-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Splenic DC were isolated as described previously (36.Matsue H. Edelbaum D. Hartmann A.C. Morita A. Bergstresser P.R. Yagita H. Okumura K. Takashima A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5287-5298PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, spleen cell suspensions were prepared by mechanical dissociation, followed by collagenase treatment (1% collagenase, 1 h, 37 °C). After lysis of erythrocytes, splenic cells were subjected to gradient centrifugation with Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); cells collected from the interface between 1.035 and 1.075 g/ml Percoll were then incubated on tissue culture plates. After a 90-min incubation, nonadherent cells were removed by extensive pipetting, and the adherent cells were cultured overnight. Cells released during the second culture period were harvested and used as splenic DC preparations. A subtractive cDNA library was constructed using the methods reported by Rubenstein et al. (37.Rubenstein J.L.R. Brice A.E. Ciaranello R.D. Denney D. Porteus M.M.H. Usdin T.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4833-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNAs isolated from the XS52 DC line were reverse-transcribed into cDNAs, ligated unidirectionally to the λ ZapII phages (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and then converted into a single-stranded phagemid library in which cDNAs were synthesized as an antisense strand (pBluescript II SK(−), Strategene). This cDNA library (1.2 μg) was hybridized with 50 μg of biotinylated poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the J774 macrophage line. Unhybridized cDNAs were purified by the streptavidin-phenol extraction method and converted into a double-stranded form byTaq DNA polymerase. Subsequently, the resulting “DC-specific” cDNA library was screened sequentially by differential colony hybridization, slot-blotting, and Northern blotting. In colony hybridization, colonies were transferred onto nylon membranes and hybridized differentially with total cDNA probes prepared from XS52 DC-derived poly(A)+ RNAs and from J774 macrophage-derived poly(A)+ RNAs. In slot blotting, the cDNA inserts were polymerase chain reaction-amplified, slot-blotted onto nylon membranes, and hybridized with total cDNA probes from XS52 DC and from J774 macrophages. In both screening steps, we isolated only those clones that were hybridized strongly with XS52 DC-derived total cDNA probes but not detectable with the J774 macrophage-derived cDNA probes. Northern blotting was performed as described previously (38.Ariizumi K. Meng Y. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6031-6039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA inserts were excised by enzymatic digestion and32P-labeled. Total RNAs (10 μg/lane) isolated from XS52 DC or J774 macrophages by using RNA-STAT60 (Tel-TestB; Friendswood, TX) were size-fractionated on a vertical agarose gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized with the above 32P-labeled probes. Once again, we selected those cDNA clones that showed strong hybridization only with the XS52 DC-derived probes. Finally, 50 cDNA clones selected by Northern blotting were sequenced and subjected to homology search using the GenBankTM and EMBL data bases. Total RNAs were isolated from several different lines or from different mouse organs. In some experiments, XS52 DC and J774 macrophages were cultured for 48 h in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml of either GM-CSF or CSF-1 before RNA isolation. Northern blotting was carried out as described above using32P-labeled dectin-1 cDNA probe (clone 1C11-5) or the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control probe (38.Ariizumi K. Meng Y. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6031-6039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was carried out as described previously (30.Ariizumi K. Kitajima T. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2137-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38.Ariizumi K. Meng Y. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6031-6039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA isolated from the interface epidermal cells was reverse-transcribed into cDNA and then PCR-amplified with the following primer sets: 5′-AGGCCCTATGAAGAACTACAGACA-3′ (nt 1384–1407) and 5′-TGGCCAGGACAGCATAAGGAA-3′ (nt 1830–1811) for dectin-1; 5′-TACAGGCTCCGAGATGAACAACAA-3′ (nt 450–473) and 5′-TGGGGAAGGCATTAGAAACAGTC-3′ (nt 899–921) for IL-1β, or 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCAA-3′ (nt 25–45) and 5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′ (nt 541–564) for β-actin. The PCR products were separated on agarose gel, transferred onto a membrane, and hybridized with 32P-labeled dectin-1, IL-1β, or β-actin cDNA probe. His-dectin-1 fusion protein consisting of, from the N terminus, hexahistidine and the extracellular domain of dectin-1 was produced in Escherichia coli as follows. The DNA fragment encoding an extracellular domain (aa 73–244) of dectin-1 was PCR-amplified, and BamHI andSmaI sites were then attached to the resulting DNA fragment at the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively. Using BamHI andSmaI sites, the fragment was ligated to immediately downstream of the hexahistidine sequence in pQE-30 vector (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). This recombinant vector was introduced into E. coli; His-dectin-1 protein was extracted from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-treated E. coli in 8 m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) buffer and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). Approximately 5–8 mg of proteins were recovered from 1.5 liters of E. coli culture by elution at pH 5.9 and 4.9. After extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), relatively small fractions (4–20%) of the His-dectin-1 proteins were recovered in a soluble form, and this fraction was used in the functional studies (see below). As a control protein with a His tag, His-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) was produced in E. coli transformed with the commercially available His-DHFR plasmid pQE-16 (Qiagen) and purified as described above. COS-1 cells were transfected using FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with pSecTag vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) that contained the DNA insert encoding, from the N terminus, the Igκ leader sequence, hexahistidine sequence, TEV site, and extracellular domain (aa 73–244) of dectin-1. Culture supernatants collected at 48–60 h after transfection were purified using the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. A synthetic 21-aa peptide containing a cysteine residue at the N terminus of the 20-aa sequence GRNPEEKDNFLSRNKENHKP corresponding to aa 75–94 of dectin-1 was used to immunize rabbits. After three rounds of standard immunization, serum was collected and subjected to affinity purification of peptide-specific Ab using the same 21-mer peptide. Briefly, high pressure liquid chromatography-purified peptide was conjugated to the thiol coupling gel in buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). Following washing and equilibration with a 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 40 ml of serum was applied to the peptide antigen-conjugated thiol coupling gel, and peptide-specific antibodies were then eluted, after extensive washing with the phosphate buffer, with 100 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). After neutralization, the fractions showing significantA 280 values were dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). XS52 DC were homogenized in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) with 5–10 strokes with a 27-gauge needle on a 1-ml syringe and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g, and the resulting supernatants (“crude lysates”) were fractionated into cytosolic and membrane fractions by centrifugation for 40 min at 100,000 × g. In some experiments, whole cell extracts were prepared from several different cell lines in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,000 × g. The full-length cDNA for dectin-1 was excised from clone 1C11-5 by digestion with EcoRI and XbaI restriction enzymes and inserted into a mammalian expression vector pZeoSV2(+) (Invitrogen). COS-1 cells were transfected with the resulting vector or an empty vector alone using FuGene 6, and membrane fractions were prepared at 72 h after transfection. These samples were separated by 10–20% or 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and then blotted with 0.72 μg/ml of affinity-purified rabbit anti-dectin-1 or control rabbit IgG. After extensive wash, the membrane was blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and then developed with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Different cell lines were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then incubated with 1 μg/ml of anti-dectin-1 or control rabbit IgG, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Splenic DC preparations were subjected to double staining with anti-dectin-1 followed by phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated secondary Ab and with FITC-conjugated anti-Ia or anti-CD11c mAb (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). These samples were analyzed by FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) as before (22.Xu S. Ariizumi K. Caceres-Dittmar G. Edelbaum D. Hashimoto K. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2697-2705PubMed Google Scholar). Binding properties of His-dectin-1 were examined in binding buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution containing 1.3 mm CaCl2, 3% fetal calf serum, and 10 mm HEPES) by using four different protocols. First, soluble fractions of bacterially produced His-dectin-1 proteins were labeled with biotin (Pierce) and tested for the binding to selected cell lines (2 × 106cells/ml). Following a 30-min incubation on ice with 5 μg/ml of biotinylated His-dectin-1, the cells were washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated streptavidin at 1:100 dilution (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Samples were then analyzed by FACScan. In some experiments, the activated D10 T cells were cultured for 16 h in the presence of 4 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) before analyses, or they were incubated with 0.25% trypsin in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C. For the N-glycosidase treatment, the cells were first fixed with 0.4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 3 h at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and then incubated with 600 milliunits/ml neuraminidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by the second 16-h incubation at room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were washed with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and treated with 10 units/ml N-glycosidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the same buffer for 16 h at 37 °C. To determine the extent of deglycosylation achieved by the above treatment with tunicamycin or N-glycosidase, the same T cell samples were tested for their ability to bind biotinylated phytohemagglutinin and biotinylated wheat germ agglutinin (both purchased from Sigma). Second, soluble fractions of bacterially produced His-dectin-1 proteins (3 μg in 100 μl of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) were labeled with 100 μCi of 125I (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in the presence of an IODO-BEAD (Pierce). After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the removal of the bead and the addition of 100 μl of 3% bovine serum albumin. The125I-labeled His-dectin-1 (0.7 μg/ml, specific activity: 5 × 106 cpm/μg) was then incubated with the activated D10 T cells (1 × 107 cells/ml). After a 90-min incubation on ice, the cell suspensions were overlaid on the top of 700 μl of 100% fetal calf serum and centrifuged at 600 ×g for 1 min to remove the unbound probes. The cellular pellets were washed three more times in PBS and then counted for radioactivities. To test the specificity, the incubation was carried out in the presence of “cold” His-dectin-1 (76 μg/ml) or anti-dectin-1 (50 μg/ml); His-DHFR or control IgG at the same concentrations were added to serve as controls. Third, His-dectin-1 proteins produced by COS-1 cells were biotinylated, incubated at 5 μg/ml with the activated D10 T cells (2 × 106 cells/ml), and then analyzed by FACScan as described above. To test the specificity, nonlabeled, bacterially produced His-dectin-1 or His-DHFR (160 μg/ml) was added to the incubation. Finally, 125I-labeled, bacterially produced His-dectin-1 proteins were incubated for 120 min on ice with agarose beads that were conjugated with mannose, fucose, lactose, GluNAc, or GalNAc (all purchased from Sigma). Specific binding was then examined by counting the radioactivities that were eluted by the addition of the corresponding carbohydrates. ELISA plates were coated with graded concentrations of anti-CD3ε mAb (Pharmingen) together with bacterially produced His-dectin-1 (10 μg/ml). In some experiments, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates coated with anti-CD3 mAb (0.3 μg/ml) and His-dectin-1 (10 μg/ml) were preincubated with graded concentrations of anti-dectin-1 or control IgG. Splenic T cells purified from normal BALB/c mice were cultured in these wells (105 cells/well) for 4 days, pulsed with [3H]thymidine for 16 h, and then harvested as before (22.Xu S. Ariizumi K.

Serine 15 phosphorylation of p53 leads to a stabilization of p53 by reducing its interaction with murine double minute 2, a negative regulatory partner. Recently, p53 was reported to be activated and phosphorylated at serine 15 following UV radiation. However, the signaling pathway that mediates UV-induced phosphorylation is less well characterized. Here, we provide evidence that UVB-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 is mediated directly by ERKs and p38 kinase. We find that in a mouse JB6 epidermal cell line, ERKs and p38 kinase form a complex with p53 following UVB radiation. Inhibition of ERKs or p38 kinase activity by the use of a dominant negative mutant of ERK2 or p38 kinase or their respective specific inhibitor, PD98059 or SB202190, results in abrogation of UVB-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15. Strikingly, incubation of UVB-activated ERKs or p38 kinase immunoprecipitated complex with exogenous p53 shows serine 15 phosphorylation of both exogenous and co-precipitated endogenous p53 protein. Additionally, active recombinant ERK1/2 and p38 kinase but not JNKs are also able to phosphorylate p53 at serine 15 <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with PD98059 or SB202190 blocks p53-dependent transcription activity but increases the level of p53 co-precipitated murine double minute. These results strongly suggest that both ERKs and p38 kinase have a direct role in UVB-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 <i>in vivo</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2012457700,"The activity of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is regulated by its subcellular localization, phosphorylation and through its interaction with different proteins. The association of eNOS with caveolin-1 (Cav) is believed to maintain eNOS in an inactive state; however, increased association of eNOS to heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) is observed following activation. In this study, we investigate the relationship between caveolin and hsp90 as opposing regulatory proteins on eNOS function. Immunoprecipitation of Cav-1 from bovine lung microvascular endothelial cells shows that eNOS and hsp90 are present in the Cav-1 complex. eNOS and hsp90 from the lysate also interact with exogenous glutathione S-transferase-linked caveolin-1 (GST-Cav), and the addition of calcium-activated calmodulin (CaM) to the GST-Cav complex partially inhibited the association of eNOS and hsp90. Purified eNOS associates with GST-Cav specifically through the caveolin-scaffolding domain (residues 82–101); however, the addition of CaM slightly, but nonstatistically, reduces eNOS binding to GST-Cav. When hsp90 is present in the binding reaction, the addition of increasing concentrations of CaM significantly displaces eNOS and hsp90 from GST-Cav. eNOS enzymatic activity is also less sensitive to inhibition by the caveolin scaffolding peptide (residues 82–101) when eNOS is prebound to hsp90. Collectively, our results show that the actions of CaM on eNOS dissociation from caveolin are facilitated in the presence of hsp90.

Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The first two proteins inhibit NOS activity, whereas the latter two are stimulatory. In the case of caveolins, in vitro data support the concept that when eNOS is localized in the caveolae, it has the capacity to interact with caveolin. This interaction may tonically down-regulate NO production and is most likely associated with inactivation of the enzyme at rest. According to this model, agonists that promote an elevation of intracellular calcium can promote the dissociation of caveolin from eNOS via a proposed exclusive binding of either caveolin or calmodulin to eNOS, thus removing the negative regulation (10.Michel J.B.

However, it is not clear if the time course of dissociation of caveolin from eNOS is consistent with eNOS activation and NO release and whether this occurs in a calcium/CaM-dependent manner with all forms of stimulation leading to NO production (12.Kuchan M.J. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C628-C636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Rizzo V. McIntosh D.P. Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol.

Recently, we have shown that agonists that promote NO release through distinct signaling mechanisms (histamine, estradiol, vascular endothelial growth factor, and fluid shear stress) stimulate the recruitment of hsp90 to eNOS in a time frame consistent with activation of eNOS and NO production (9.Garcia-Cardena G.

Moreover, the ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin, which specifically binds in the unique ATP binding pocket of hsp90, inhibits agonist-stimulated NO production from cultured endothelial cells and endothelium-dependent relaxations of isolated blood vessels (15.Shah V. Wiest R. Garcia-Cardena G. Cadelina G. Groszmann R.J. Sessa W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G463-G468PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these results are consistent with the idea that hsp90 directly or indirectly modulates eNOS. This concept of hsp90 facilitating NOS activation has been extended to another NOS isoform, neuronal NOS. Neuronal NOS also interacts with hsp90 in cell lysates, and geldanamycin blocks ionomycin-stimulated NO release from cells stably expressing neuronal NOS (16.Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R.

The relationship between caveolin and hsp90 as opposing regulatory proteins that control the production of NO has not been explored. Therefore, the purposes of this study are to 1) examine the interactions of eNOS with caveolin-1 and hsp90 in cells and in vitro; 2) determine the role of hsp90 in the calmodulin-induced dissociation of eNOS from caveolin; and 3) explore the interaction of these regulatory proteins on eNOS function. Bovine lung microvascular endothelial cells (BLMVEC) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine as described previously (17.Garcia-Cardena G.

Purified hsp90 from bovine brain was obtained from Stressgen, and purified calmodulin was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Recombinant bovine eNOS was purified fromEscherichia coli as described previously (19.Martasek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). eNOS stock solutions (1 mg/ml) for all of the studies were in a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 200 mmNaCl, 0.5 mml-arginine, and 40 μm BH4. eNOS and caveolin-1 were immunoprecipitated from cultured BLMVEC as described previously (7.Garcia-Cardena G.

Immunocomplexes were isolated, electrophoresed, and either Western blotted or exposed to autoradiography in the case of [35S]methionine-labeled BLMVEC (20.Liu J. Garcia-Cardena G. Sessa W.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12333-12340Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Western blots were sequentially probed with anti-caveolin-1 monoclonal Ab (Transduction Laboratories), with anti-eNOS monoclonal Ab (9D10; Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories), and with anti-hsp90 monoclonal Ab (SPA 830; Stressgen). The caveolin fusion protein expression was performed as described previously (21.Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A.

The interaction of GST-caveolin fusion protein with eNOS and hsp90 from BLMVEC cells lysates was performed as follows. Cells were lysed in a modified RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin) for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were Dounce-homogenized (20 strokes) and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. Lysates (500 μg of proteins) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with beads containing ∼100 pmol of either GST alone or GST-Cav (∼20 μl of packed volume) in a total volume of 400 μl. After binding, the beads were washed (three times) with wash buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA. In some experiments, the immobilized proteins were washed with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 125 mm NaCl containing 1 mm CaCl2. The beads were then resuspended in the same buffer, and CaM (0.1 and 1 μm) was then added for 1 h at 4 °C. In vitro interactions of GST-Cav with purified or recombinant proteins (hsp90, eNOS, or CaM) were performed for 2 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, in 20% glycerol). After binding, the beads were extensively washed (five times) with a high salt wash buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Beads were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Interacting proteins were identified by colloidal brilliant blue (Sigma) staining of the gels or by Western blotting with anti-eNOS monoclonal, anti-hsp90 monoclonal Ab or anti-calmodulin monoclonal Ab (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The binding of eNOS, hsp90, and calmodulin to ADP-Sepharose beads was performed in the above binding buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Following incubation, the beads were washed three times, and elution from the beads was done by boiling (10 min) in SDS-sample buffer, electrophoresis, and Western blotting (see above). The conversion of3H-l-arginine to 3H-labeledl-citrulline was used to determine NOS activity (22.Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To examine the effects of either caveolin peptides or hsp90 on NOS activity, Me2SO vehicle, Cav peptide (residues 82–101; 10 μm), or hsp90 (1 μg) was preincubated with recombinant eNOS (0.5 μg) in a 100-μl reaction for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by the addition of l-arginine and NOS co-factors for 10 min at 37 °C. The coat protein for caveolae, caveolin-1 (6.Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A.

Therefore, we investigated if these three proteins could exist in a heterocomplex in quiescent endothelial cells. Immunoprecipitation of eNOS from [35S]methionine-labeled BLMVEC lysates revealed the presence of four major proteins in the eNOS immunocomplex: p200, p90, p60, and p20 (Fig.1 A). A 90-kDa and a 20-kDa protein were previously identified as hsp90 (9.Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C.

The intensity of the radioactivity incorporated into the eNOS-associated proteins (p90, p60, and p20) compared with35S-labeled eNOS suggests that only a fraction of hsp90 or caveolin-1 interacts with eNOS in resting endothelial cells under these conditions. Based upon the radioactivity incorporated and taking into account that the number of labeled methionines and the turnover of labeled proteins may vary, the associated proteins are binding substoichiometrically. The substoichiometric interaction of caveolin-1 and hsp90 with eNOS is not surprising, since only a fraction of the total eNOS pool is enriched in caveolae in most endothelial cells (10–30%) (7.Garcia-Cardena G.

Res. 1999; 85: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and the bulk of hsp90 is associated with cytoskeleton or in the cytosol (27.Czar M.J. Welsh M.J. Pratt W.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 322-330PubMed Google Scholar). We interpret the interaction of eNOS with its associated regulatory proteins more akin to signaling complexes where the binding is rarely stoichiometric and transient. Immunoprecipitation of caveolin-1 from BLMVEC lysates resulted in the recovery of both eNOS and hsp90 (detected by Western blotting), supporting the idea that these proteins could exist as a heterotrimeric complex in vivo (Fig. 1 B). Next, we tested if eNOS and hsp90 could be isolated from BLMVEC lysates using glutathioneS-transferase-linked caveolin-1 (GST-Cav) as a tool to isolate the complex. As seen in Fig. 1 C, eNOS and hsp90 co-associate with GST-Cav but not with GST alone. To examine if CaM, an important allosteric activator of eNOS, could influence the interaction of eNOS/hsp90 with GST-Cav, exogenous CaM was added to the GST-Cav complex. The addition of calcium-activated CaM (0.1 and 1 μm) to the GST-Cav complex partially inhibited the association of eNOS and hsp90 to the complex. These results suggest that in endothelial cells, eNOS and, interestingly, hsp90 are capable of associating with caveolin-1, thus implying that the three proteins are in a complex in resting endothelial cells and that exogenous CaM can disrupt the binding of eNOS and hsp90 to caveolin. Next, we examined if we could reconstitute the heterotrimeric complex in vitro using purified proteins. As reported previously, the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (amino acids 82–101) is responsible for the interaction of caveolin with multiple proteins such as Ha-RAS, c-Src, and eNOS (28.Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Incubation of peptides derived from the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (Cav-(82–101)) completely prevented the association of eNOS with GST-Cav (Fig.2 A). However, Cav-X (10.Michel J.B. Feron O. Sase K. Prabhakar P. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25907-25912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) did not affect the binding of eNOS to GST-Cav, showing the specificity of the in vitro interactions between the two proteins. Fig.2 B shows that purified eNOS and hsp90 do not interact with GST alone and that hsp90 does not interact with GST-Cav. However, in the presence of eNOS, hsp90 is detected in the complex with GST-Cav. This shows that the interaction of hsp90 with the caveolin-1 is through its association with eNOS, not via direct binding to caveolin, as described previously (29.Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The association of eNOS with caveolin-1 in endothelial cells is thought to be disassembled following activation of eNOS by calcium-dependent stimuli that promote CaM binding to eNOS (11.Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The binding of CaM to eNOS is believed to disrupt the binding of caveolin-1 to the enzyme, thereby providing a mutually exclusive interaction with either an activator (CaM) or inhibitor (caveolin-1) of eNOS. This has been described using cell lysates for the co-precipitation of eNOS and caveolin-1 followed by the addition of purified CaM back to the immunocomplexed proteins or by the usage of the scaffolding domain peptide as a caveolin surrogate that prevents eNOS binding to CaM-Sepharose (11.Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 30.Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Clearly, the scaffolding domain peptide is an inhibitor of eNOS activity that appears to act competitively with respect to CaM in NOS activity assays (10.Michel J.B. Feron O. Sase K. Prabhakar P. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25907-25912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 31.Ghosh S. Gachhui R. Crooks C. Wu C. Lisanti M.P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22267-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the exclusivity of caveolin-1 versus calmodulin binding to eNOS as a regulatory mechanism has not been directly examined with caveolin-1 protein. Therefore, we co-incubated eNOS and/or hsp90 with GST alone or GST-Cav in the presence of CaM (1 μm in 1 mm calcium) and analyzed the complex by Coomassie staining or Western blotting. As seen in Fig.3 A, eNOS or hsp90 does not bind to GST alone. Approximately 10% of the input eNOS (lane 6) bound specifically to GST-Cav (lane 2). The addition of CaM does not prevent eNOS binding to GST-Cav (lane 3). Co-incubation of eNOS with hsp90 results in recovery of the complex with GST-Cav, with approximately 10% of both eNOS and hsp90 input bound (comparelanes 4 and 6). Incubation of the eNOS·hsp90·GST-Cav complex with CaM results in less eNOS and hsp90 bound (lane 5). Next we performed similar experiments using semiquantitative Western blotting to analyze proteins bound to GST-Cav. As mentioned above, eNOS interacts with GST-Cav, but not GST. In presence of concentrations of CaM up to 1 μm, CaM slightly, but nonstatistically, reduces eNOS binding to GST-Cav (lanes 2–5 in Fig. 3 B; quantified in Fig. 3 C). When hsp90 is present in the binding reaction, the amount of eNOS bound to GST-Cav does not change (comparelane 2 with lane 6); however, the addition of increasing concentrations of CaM significantly displaces eNOS from GST-Cav (lanes 7–9). Similarly, hsp90 is also markedly displaced from the caveolin complex in response to CaM addition, reinforcing the fact that hsp90 directly binds to eNOS and eNOS acts as a molecular bridge for the hsp90 association with caveolin-1 (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that the conformational changes in eNOS following the addition of CaM are not sufficient to disrupt its physical association with caveolin-1 and that the presence of hsp90 facilitates the actions of CaM in displacing eNOS from caveolin-1. The latter conditions may more accurately reflect the calcium-CaM-induced displacement of eNOS observed in endothelial cell lysates (see Fig. 1 C) (11.Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Since eNOS bound to caveolin-1 is believed to be in an inactive state, we monitored the reconstitution of an active eNOS complex by affinity purification of the complex using ADP-Sepharose chromatography. eNOS reversibly binds to this resin via its NADPH binding site. Purified eNOS (0.5 μg or 9.2 nm) in the absence of CaM binds to ADP-Sepharose resin (Fig. 4,lane 1), whereas hsp90 (1 μg or 27.7 nm) and CaM (1 μm) do not directly bind to the resin (lane 6). However, in presence of eNOS, hsp90 is bound to the resin via its interaction with eNOS (lane 2). Interestingly, the addition of CaM (0.01–1 μm) favors the binding of eNOS to the resin, suggesting that CaM increases the affinity of eNOS for ADP-Sepharose through increased affinity for NADPH. Enhanced binding of eNOS allows for increased recovery of hsp90 and CaM bound in the complex. These data indicate that CaM activation of eNOS and/or hsp90 increases the amount of each component in the complex. To examine the interrelationship between hsp90 and caveolin as regulators of eNOS function, we measured NOS activity in vitro. In the presence of fixed levels of CaM (0.1 μm), the caveolin scaffolding domain peptide, Cav-(82–101) (10 μm), inhibits (Fig.5 A) and hsp90 increases NOS activity. Preincubation of eNOS with hsp90 reduces the inhibitory effects of Cav-(82–101). To examine this more thoroughly, we titrated increasing concentrations of the Cav-(82–101) on eNOS activity in the absence or in the presence of hsp90 preincubated with eNOS. As seen in Fig. 5 B, Cav-(82–101) dose-dependently inhibits NOS activity with an approximate EC50 of 2.5 μm (Fig. 5 B). However, in the presence of hsp90, an EC50 of 6 μm is observed, showing that the inhibitory properties of caveolin-1 are reduced when eNOS is bound to hsp90. Collectively, these data suggest that hsp90 influences the inhibitory actions of caveolin-1 on eNOS. In support of this idea are data demonstrating that 1) hsp90, eNOS, and caveolin-1 can exist as a heterotrimeric complex in endothelial cells; 2) The complex can be reassembled using lysates or purified components, with eNOS being the bridge between hsp90 and caveolin; 3) CaM weakly displaces eNOS from GST-Cav, whereas if hsp90 is included in the reaction mix, CaM exerts a stronger effect on displacing eNOS from caveolin; and finally 4) hsp90 more efficiently binds to eNOS in a CaM-dependent manner and reduces the inhibitory actions of the caveolin-1 scaffolding peptide on eNOS activity. In a cellular context, the presence of hsp90 and caveolin-1 associated to eNOS under basal conditions may modulate low level activation of eNOS and basal release of nitric oxide. Upon an increase in cytoplasmic calcium, calcium-activated CaM may aid in the further recruitment of hsp90 to the complex and facilitate the release of the caveolin inhibitory clamp. This effect was previously thought to be dependent only on CaM, whereas we suggest that hsp90, and perhaps other regulatory signals (32.Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar), will serve as active participants in the release of eNOS from caveolin-1. The presence of a calmodulin binding site on hsp90 suggests that the interaction between eNOS and the chaperone protein can be regulated by the common binding partner, CaM (33.Minami Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9604-9610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Nishida E. Koyasu S. Sakai H. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16033-16036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as evidenced by CaM facilitating the effects of hsp90 on the eNOS dissociation from GST-Cav (Fig. 3) and CaM-dependent association of hsp90 and eNOS with CaM in a complex bound to ADP-Sepharose (Fig. 4). The dissociation of eNOS from caveolin in response to calcium-dependent agonists has been documented; however, our results now indicate that hsp90 plays a role in this effect. Elucidating the cellular mechanisms of eNOS interacting with CaM and hsp90 as positive modulators of eNOS activation and understanding how this regulates the caveolin-1/eNOS interaction will increase our knowledge of how endothelial cells produce NO."

Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent evidence suggests a critical role for chemokines in a variety of pathophysiological processes (e.g. infectious and autoimmune diseases, allergic responses, modulation of angiogenesis, chronic and acute inflammation, tumor growth, and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells). Chemokines are a superfamily of small (8–16 kDa) proteins sharing 20–70% homology in amino acid sequences. According to the relative position of their cysteine residues, chemokines can be subdivided into four families, including CXC (α-chemokine), CC (β-chemokine), C (γ-chemokine), and CX3C (δ-chemokine). A new nomenclature has recently been proposed for the chemokine ligands, which we will use in this paper (1.Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar).The CXC chemokines, with the first two cysteines separated by one amino acid residue, are subdivided into two subclasses, based upon the presence or absence of the amino acid motif ELR (glutamic acid-leucine-arginine) at the N terminus. Most ELR chemokines, including CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL1/Groα, CXCL5/ENA-78, CXCL7/NAP-2, and CXCL6/GCP-2, are strong neutrophil chemoattractants. However, non-ELR chemokines, exemplified by CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL9/MIG, CXCL11/I-TAC, CXCL12/SDF-1, and CXCL13/BLC, recruit predominantly lymphocytes (2.Moser B. Sci. Prog. 1998; 81: 299-313PubMed Google Scholar). The second family, the CC chemokines, attract predominantly monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and T-cells but not neutrophils. Typical CC chemokines include CCL5/RANTES, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/MIP-1β, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL11/eotaxin, CCL21/6ckine, CCL20/MIP3α, and CCL19/MIP3β. The C and CX3C families are comprised of one member each, XCL1/lymphotactin and CX3CL1/fractalkine (neurotactin), respectively. XCL1 is a potent chemoattractant for T and natural killer cells (3.Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Bazan J.F. Moore K.W., J. Schall T.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 1535-1540Google Scholar). CX3CL1 is the only membrane-bound chemokine and attracts monocytes and T lymphocytes but not neutrophils (5.Bazan F.J. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar).Within an organism, cells are exposed to a complex pattern of chemokine signals that must be integrated such that cells arrive at their designated destination in the target tissue or lymphoid organ. These signals are mediated by the interactions of chemokines with seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)1 located on the cell surface. Chemokine receptors transduce their signals through heterotrimeric Gαι proteins, which are sensitive to pertussis toxin (6.Zaballos A. Gutierrez J. Varona R. Ardavin C. Marquez G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5671-5675PubMed Google Scholar). Based on their ligand specificity, chemokine receptors can be divided into several families. Thus far, five CXC receptors (CXCR1 through CXCR5) (7.Legler D. Loetschert M. Roos R. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and nine CC receptors (CCR1 through CCR9) have been identified (6.Zaballos A. Gutierrez J. Varona R. Ardavin C. Marquez G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5671-5675PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the receptors for XCL1 (8.Yoshida T. Imai T. Kakizaki M. Nishimura M. Takagi S. Yoshie O. J. Biol.

Additionally, a number of orphan GPCRs (STRL33, CKRX/HCR, GPR15, and GPR2) have been identified whose sequences cluster with other defined chemokine receptors, but as yet no ligand has been identified for these receptors (10.Liao F.

Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel CC chemokine, which we have designated CCL28, according to the recently proposed nomenclature for chemokine ligands (1.Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). CCL28 shares most homology with another recently described chemokine (CTACK/CCL27) whose receptor has been identified as the previously orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR2 (11.Marchese A. Docherty J. Nguyen T. Heiber M. Cheng R. Heng H. Tsui L. Shi X. George S. O'Dowd B. Genomics. 1994; 23: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which has now been renamed CCR10 (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that CCL28 also binds CCR10, making it the second ligand of this new chemokine receptor. Their expression pattern suggests that this ligand/receptor pair may be particularly important in the homeostasis or inflammatory responses of the gastrointestinal system.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we present a new CC chemokine, CCL28, which is the second chemokine ligand that binds to the previously known orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR2, now renamed CCR10 (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The availability of large data bases of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) has made possible the rapid identification of new members of chemokines based on sequence and structural homologies. We identified a full-length cDNA encoding human CCL28 using a human chemokine consensus sequence. CCL28 has a number of interesting features. Both human and mouse CCL28 have 6 cysteines, which represent 2 extra cysteines in addition to the 4 conserved common cysteines, one of them between the second and the third cysteines, and another after the fourth cysteine. Several chemokines have been identified that contain two additional cysteines in various positions. CCL23/MPIF-1, CCL6/C10, and CCL9/MIP-1γ have one additional conserved cysteine located between the usual Cys-2 and Cys-3 positions and a second additional conserved cysteine positioned after Cys-4 (1.Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). CCL1/I-309 and its mouse homologue TCA-3 have a similar pattern of additional cysteines, which by CLUSTAL W alignment correlate to the 2 additional cysteines present in mouse and human CCL28 (data not shown). CCL21/6Ckine is another chemokine with 6 cysteines, with the two additional ones located after the 4 consensus chemokine cysteines in the long α-helix tail C terminus (18.Hedrick J.A. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1589-1593PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the 2 additional cysteines form a disulfide bond as has been proposed for CCL15/HCC-2 (19.Pardigol A. Forssmann U. Zucht H.D. Loetscher P. Schulz-Knappe P. Baggiolini M. Forssmann W.G. Magert H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6308-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Another characteristic of mouse and human CCL28 is its long C-terminal tail. It is known that both CC and CXC chemokines possess a C-terminal helix (20.St. Charles R. Walz D.A. Edwards B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Clore G. Bax A. Driscoll P.C. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8172-8174Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The additional disulfide might join the C terminus to the core of the protein, and therefore may restrict its mobility. Disruption or truncation of the C-α helix eliminates the biological activity of these molecules (4.Hedrick J.A. Saylor V. Figueroa D. Mizoue L. Xu Y. Menon S. Abrams J. Handel T. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1535-1540Google Scholar, 22.Zhang Y.J. Rutledge B.J. Rollins B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15918-15924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).One interesting feature of human and mouse CCL28 is their high RNA expression in normal colon, and in tissues derived from mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease or human ulcerative colitis, as well as in mouse gut associated lymphoid tissue. Human CCL28 RNA was highly expressed by an epithelioid tumor cell line, HCT 116, derived from colon carcinoma, as well as by colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines, DLD-1 (data not shown). These data, along with immunohistochemical staining, suggest that CCL28 is produced by epithelial cells. Thus, it is possible that this chemokine plays a homeostatic role in immunological surveillance in the gut. CCL28 RNA was also present in normal human lung, monkey lung, and in several asthmatic lung tissues (data not shown), suggesting that CCL28 is a homeostatic chemokine but may also participate in inflammatory responses associated to the mucosal immune system (23.Brandtzaeg P. Farstad I.N. Haraldesen G. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 267-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Mouse CCL28 was also detected up-regulated in tissues from the IL-10−/− mouse, suggesting that IL-10 down-regulates the expression of this chemokine.One of the most important aspects of finding a new chemokine is that it may represent the ligand for a previously known orphan G-protein-coupled receptor. To this end, we tested CCL28 against a panel of known orphan receptor transfectants. Although it failed to flux any of the known chemokine receptor transfectants, we detected a significant Ca2+ flux in transfectants of the previously known orphan receptor, GPR2. We have recently observed that GPR2 is the receptor for the skin-associated chemokine CCL27/CTACK (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), which is also the chemokine that shares the highest homology with CCL28 (Fig.1 B). GPR2 has several structural features that strongly suggest that it is a chemokine receptor, including the presence of a DRY box motif (which is present in most of the other chemokine receptors) as well as strong homology to CXCR3 and other chemokine receptors (Fig. 3 B). Accordingly, this receptor has been renamed CCR10 (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We also identified mouse CCR10 (Fig.3 A). Both human and mouse CCR10 transfectants fluxed Ca2+ in response to CCL28. Furthermore, CCL28 desensitized the CCL27 responses, indicating that these chemokines share the CCR10 receptor. Interestingly, the expression of CCL27/CTACK is strongly associated with the skin, whereas the expression of CCR10 is more widespread. This led us to speculate that there are other ligands for this receptor (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In particular, CCR10 is strongly expressed in the gut where CCL28 is also expressed (Figs. 5 and 6). CCL28 as well as CCR10 expression is already strong in normal gut samples, suggesting that this ligand/receptor pair plays a homeostatic role in the gut. We have made similar observations in the skin (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, because both of these anatomical sites are also continuously exposed to antigens, it is possible that the expression observed may represent an inflammatory background rather than homeostatic expression. It is known that freshly isolated colon epithelial cells spontaneously secrete CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL1/Groα, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/MIP-1β, and CCL5/Rantes (24.Yang S.K. Eckmann L. Panja A. Kagnoff M.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1214-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), which are generally considered inflammatory rather than homeostatic chemokines. We found that CCL28 is expressed by normal and pathological colon, and the protein was detected by immunostaining in epithelial cells from colon or small intestine. It is possible that certain T-cell populations enriched in the gut, like αEβ7-positive cells present in lamina propia and/or intraepithelial T-cells or γδ intraepithelial T-cells (25.Lefrancois L. Fuller B. Huleatt J.W. Olson S. Puddington L. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1997; 18: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), may be attracted by CCL28. Future experiments will investigate these possibilities.Typically, CC chemokines mapping outside the CC chemokine cluster act on lymphocytes (1.Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar), and CCL28 appears to be no exception, because we observed responses to CCL28 by both CD4 and CD8 T-cells. CCR10 is expressed in some T-cells as well as in some B-cell lines but not in normal B-cells. The latter observation suggests that normal B-cells may respond to CCL28 under certain circumstances but not in the resting state. It is necessary to perform further studies to characterize the subpopulations of T-cells that express CCR10 and respond to CCL28. Furthermore, it is possible that CCR10 is regulated by the activation state of the T-cells (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Future studies will attempt to clarify the target populations of this novel chemokine.In summary, we present here a new chemokine ligand/receptor pair, which is potentially involved in both homeostatic and inflammatory responses in the skin and gut. Chemokines and their receptors play a pivotal role in lymphocyte trafficking, recruiting, and recirculation (1.Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent evidence suggests a critical role for chemokines in a variety of pathophysiological processes (e.g. infectious and autoimmune diseases, allergic responses, modulation of angiogenesis, chronic and acute inflammation, tumor growth, and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells). Chemokines are a superfamily of small (8–16 kDa) proteins sharing 20–70% homology in amino acid sequences. According to the relative position of their cysteine residues, chemokines can be subdivided into four families, including CXC (α-chemokine), CC (β-chemokine), C (γ-chemokine), and CX3C (δ-chemokine). A new nomenclature has recently been proposed for the chemokine ligands, which we will use in this paper (1.Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). The CXC chemokines, with the first two cysteines separated by one amino acid residue, are subdivided into two subclasses, based upon the presence or absence of the amino acid motif ELR (glutamic acid-leucine-arginine) at the N terminus. Most ELR chemokines, including CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL1/Groα, CXCL5/ENA-78, CXCL7/NAP-2, and CXCL6/GCP-2, are strong neutrophil chemoattractants. However, non-ELR chemokines, exemplified by CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL9/MIG, CXCL11/I-TAC, CXCL12/SDF-1, and CXCL13/BLC, recruit predominantly lymphocytes (2.Moser B. Sci. Prog. 1998; 81: 299-313PubMed Google Scholar). The second family, the CC chemokines, attract predominantly monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and T-cells but not neutrophils. Typical CC chemokines include CCL5/RANTES, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/MIP-1β, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL11/eotaxin, CCL21/6ckine, CCL20/MIP3α, and CCL19/MIP3β. The C and CX3C families are comprised of one member each, XCL1/lymphotactin and CX3CL1/fractalkine (neurotactin), respectively. XCL1 is a potent chemoattractant for T and natural killer cells (3.Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Bazan J.F. Moore K.W., J. Schall T.

Additionally, a number of orphan GPCRs (STRL33, CKRX/HCR, GPR15, and GPR2) have been identified whose sequences cluster with other defined chemokine receptors, but as yet no ligand has been identified for these receptors (10.Liao F.

Tsui L. Shi X. George S. O'Dowd B. Genomics. 1994; 23: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has been searching for novel chemokines and their receptors to understand more about their participation in homeostatic and pathological processes. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel CC chemokine, which we have designated CCL28, according to the recently proposed nomenclature for chemokine ligands (1.Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). CCL28 shares most homology with another recently described chemokine (CTACK/CCL27) whose receptor has been identified as the previously orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR2 (11.Marchese A. Docherty J. Nguyen T. Heiber M. Cheng R. Heng H. Tsui L. Shi X. George S. O'Dowd B. Genomics. 1994; 23: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which has now been renamed CCR10 (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that CCL28 also binds CCR10, making it the second ligand of this new chemokine receptor. Their expression pattern suggests that this ligand/receptor pair may be particularly important in the homeostasis or inflammatory responses of the gastrointestinal system. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we present a new CC chemokine, CCL28, which is the second chemokine ligand that binds to the previously known orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR2, now renamed CCR10 (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The availability of large data bases of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) has made possible the rapid identification of new members of chemokines based on sequence and structural homologies. We identified a full-length cDNA encoding human CCL28 using a human chemokine consensus sequence. CCL28 has a number of interesting features. Both human and mouse CCL28 have 6 cysteines, which represent 2 extra cysteines in addition to the 4 conserved common cysteines, one of them between the second and the third cysteines, and another after the fourth cysteine. Several chemokines have been identified that contain two additional cysteines in various positions. CCL23/MPIF-1, CCL6/C10, and CCL9/MIP-1γ have one additional conserved cysteine located between the usual Cys-2 and Cys-3 positions and a second additional conserved cysteine positioned after Cys-4 (1.Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). CCL1/I-309 and its mouse homologue TCA-3 have a similar pattern of additional cysteines, which by CLUSTAL W alignment correlate to the 2 additional cysteines present in mouse and human CCL28 (data not shown). CCL21/6Ckine is another chemokine with 6 cysteines, with the two additional ones located after the 4 consensus chemokine cysteines in the long α-helix tail C terminus (18.Hedrick J.A. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1589-1593PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the 2 additional cysteines form a disulfide bond as has been proposed for CCL15/HCC-2 (19.Pardigol A. Forssmann U. Zucht H.D. Loetscher P. Schulz-Knappe P. Baggiolini M. Forssmann W.G. Magert H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6308-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Another characteristic of mouse and human CCL28 is its long C-terminal tail. It is known that both CC and CXC chemokines possess a C-terminal helix (20.St. Charles R. Walz D.A. Edwards B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Clore G. Bax A. Driscoll P.C. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8172-8174Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The additional disulfide might join the C terminus to the core of the protein, and therefore may restrict its mobility. Disruption or truncation of the C-α helix eliminates the biological activity of these molecules (4.Hedrick J.A. Saylor V. Figueroa D. Mizoue L. Xu Y. Menon S. Abrams J. Handel T. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1535-1540Google Scholar, 22.Zhang Y.J. Rutledge B.J. Rollins B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15918-15924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).One interesting feature of human and mouse CCL28 is their high RNA expression in normal colon, and in tissues derived from mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease or human ulcerative colitis, as well as in mouse gut associated lymphoid tissue. Human CCL28 RNA was highly expressed by an epithelioid tumor cell line, HCT 116, derived from colon carcinoma, as well as by colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines, DLD-1 (data not shown). These data, along with immunohistochemical staining, suggest that CCL28 is produced by epithelial cells. Thus, it is possible that this chemokine plays a homeostatic role in immunological surveillance in the gut. CCL28 RNA was also present in normal human lung, monkey lung, and in several asthmatic lung tissues (data not shown), suggesting that CCL28 is a homeostatic chemokine but may also participate in inflammatory responses associated to the mucosal immune system (23.Brandtzaeg P. Farstad I.N. Haraldesen G. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 267-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Mouse CCL28 was also detected up-regulated in tissues from the IL-10−/− mouse, suggesting that IL-10 down-regulates the expression of this chemokine.One of the most important aspects of finding a new chemokine is that it may represent the ligand for a previously known orphan G-protein-coupled receptor. To this end, we tested CCL28 against a panel of known orphan receptor transfectants. Although it failed to flux any of the known chemokine receptor transfectants, we detected a significant Ca2+ flux in transfectants of the previously known orphan receptor, GPR2. We have recently observed that GPR2 is the receptor for the skin-associated chemokine CCL27/CTACK (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), which is also the chemokine that shares the highest homology with CCL28 (Fig.1 B). GPR2 has several structural features that strongly suggest that it is a chemokine receptor, including the presence of a DRY box motif (which is present in most of the other chemokine receptors) as well as strong homology to CXCR3 and other chemokine receptors (Fig. 3 B). Accordingly, this receptor has been renamed CCR10 (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We also identified mouse CCR10 (Fig.3 A). Both human and mouse CCR10 transfectants fluxed Ca2+ in response to CCL28. Furthermore, CCL28 desensitized the CCL27 responses, indicating that these chemokines share the CCR10 receptor. Interestingly, the expression of CCL27/CTACK is strongly associated with the skin, whereas the expression of CCR10 is more widespread. This led us to speculate that there are other ligands for this receptor (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In particular, CCR10 is strongly expressed in the gut where CCL28 is also expressed (Figs. 5 and 6). CCL28 as well as CCR10 expression is already strong in normal gut samples, suggesting that this ligand/receptor pair plays a homeostatic role in the gut. We have made similar observations in the skin (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, because both of these anatomical sites are also continuously exposed to antigens, it is possible that the expression observed may represent an inflammatory background rather than homeostatic expression. It is known that freshly isolated colon epithelial cells spontaneously secrete CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL1/Groα, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/MIP-1β, and CCL5/Rantes (24.Yang S.K. Eckmann L. Panja A. Kagnoff M.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1214-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), which are generally considered inflammatory rather than homeostatic chemokines. We found that CCL28 is expressed by normal and pathological colon, and the protein was detected by immunostaining in epithelial cells from colon or small intestine. It is possible that certain T-cell populations enriched in the gut, like αEβ7-positive cells present in lamina propia and/or intraepithelial T-cells or γδ intraepithelial T-cells (25.Lefrancois L. Fuller B. Huleatt J.W. Olson S. Puddington L. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1997; 18: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), may be attracted by CCL28. Future experiments will investigate these possibilities.Typically, CC chemokines mapping outside the CC chemokine cluster act on lymphocytes (1.Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar), and CCL28 appears to be no exception, because we observed responses to CCL28 by both CD4 and CD8 T-cells. CCR10 is expressed in some T-cells as well as in some B-cell lines but not in normal B-cells. The latter observation suggests that normal B-cells may respond to CCL28 under certain circumstances but not in the resting state. It is necessary to perform further studies to characterize the subpopulations of T-cells that express CCR10 and respond to CCL28. Furthermore, it is possible that CCR10 is regulated by the activation state of the T-cells (12.Homey B. Wang W. Soto H. Buchanan M. Wiesenborn A. Catron D. Müller A. McClanahan T. Dieu-Nosjean M. Orozco R. Ruzicka T. Lehmann P. Oldham E. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Future studies will attempt to clarify the target populations of this novel chemokine.In summary, we present here a new chemokine ligand/receptor pair, which is potentially involved in both homeostatic and inflammatory responses in the skin and gut.

There is a great deal of information available about the first steps in the homing cascade, but molecular understanding of lymphocyte transmigration through the intercellular junctions of high endothelial venules is lacking. In analyzing expressed sequence tags from a cDNA library prepared from human tonsillar high endothelial cells, we have identified a cDNA encoding a novel member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein, which we have termed VE-JAM (“vascular endothelial junction-associated molecule”), contains two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a relatively short cytoplasmic tail. VE-JAM is prominently expressed on high endothelial venules but is also present on the endothelia of other vessels. Strikingly, it is highly localized to the intercellular boundaries of high endothelial cells. VE-JAM is most homologous to a recently identified molecule known as Junctional Adhesion Molecule, which is concentrated at the intercellular boundaries of both epithelial and endothelial cells. Because the Junctional Adhesion Molecule has been strongly implicated in the processes of neutrophil and monocyte transendothelial migration, an analogous function of VE-JAM during lymphocyte homing is plausible.

Although all vascular endothelial cells perform certain functions in common, there is a remarkable diversity of specialized functions that depend on the class of the blood vessel and the requirements of the underlying tissue. In many instances, our understanding of these diverse functions is at the phenomenological level without detailed molecular explanations. One specialized microvasculature that has received a lot of attention are the postcapillary high endothelial venules (HEV)1 of secondary lymphoid organs (reviewed in Ref. 2.Girard J.-P. Springer T.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 449-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). These vessels, which are lined by morphologically distinctive high endothelial cells (HEC), serve as the portal of entry of blood-borne lymphocytes into secondary lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes and tonsils, allowing lymphocytes of appropriate specificity to respond to sequestered and processed antigens within the organ. The highly selective recruitment process, termed “lymphocyte homing” involves a cascade of steps: rolling of the lymphocyte along the HEV, arrest and flattening on the endothelium, and finally transmigration across the endothelium (reviewed in Refs. 3.Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholarand 4.Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Science. 1996; 272: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). There has been a great deal of progress in our molecular understanding of the first two steps in the homing cascade,i.e. in the identification of primary and secondary adhesion molecules and the elucidation of signaling mechanisms involved in integrin activation (reviewed in Ref. 5.Rosen S.D.

We have taken a gene profile approach by constructing a cDNA library from primary human tonsillar HEC and performing EST sequencing. Several of the sequences that we identified corresponded to a novel member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). The encoded protein, which is termed VE-JAM, is prominently expressed on HEC of tonsils but is also present on the endothelium of other vessels. It is most closely related to another member of the IgSF, i.e.JAM, which has been implicated in the recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils across endothelium (10.Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S.

HEC were isolated from surgical specimens of tonsils, and the cDNA library (in pcDNA1.1) was prepared as described previously (15.Bistrup A. Bhakta S. Lee J.K. Belov Y.C. Gunn M.D. Zuo F.-R. Huang C.-C. Kannagi R. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In parallel, an aliquot of the same HEC cDNA was employed to generate a PCR select library (16.Chen Z. Zeng H. Gorczynski R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The HEC cDNA was cut into fragments that averaged 400 bp by digestion with RsaI. Subtraction was performed with cDNA fragments (also RsaI-digested) obtained from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and peripheral blood lymphocytes. The subtracted cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into pCR-II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to generate the cDNA library. A total of 1049 inserts were sequenced. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) (107 cells) were isolated as published previously (17.Sassetti C. Tangemann K. Singer M.S. Kershaw D.B. Rosen S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Frozen purified HEC (106 cells) were solubilized in RNAzolB (Teltest Inc., Friendswood, TX). Total RNA was isolated as per the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was prepared from 2 μg of RNA primed with random hexamers using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). A 539-bp VE-JAM cDNA fragment was amplified from HEC cDNA using primers: 5′-CCTCTTCTGCTCTGAGTGGAACT and 3′-TTGAGTTTTATAATAGTTTAATAACTTGTG, and the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase primers amplified the appropriate 289-bp fragment from both HEC and PBL (18.Sassetti C. Van Zante M. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9001-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A pool selection technique (15.Bistrup A. Bhakta S. Lee J.K. Belov Y.C. Gunn M.D. Zuo F.-R. Huang C.-C. Kannagi R. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) was employed. Previously mentioned primers were designed to amplify 539 bp of the insert of EST clone 1293, which contains sequence toward the 3′-end of the VE-JAM cDNA (Fig. 1). To favor the identification of a full-length clone, the individual pools were tested in a PCR reaction using a 5′-primer matching the vector and a 3′-primer matching VE-JAM. Southern blotting was performed on the PCR reactions to identify the pools with the longest inserts. The isolated clone was sequenced in both directions. The probe consisted of the entire insert of EST clone 1293 (Fig. 1). The probe was labeled with [32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Strip-EZ DNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Multiple tissue and immune system tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) containing human poly(A)+ mRNA were hybridized at 60 °C overnight after prehybidization for 2 h in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH). The blots were then washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature before autoradiography. These blots were then stripped and rehybridized with a β-actin probe that was supplied with the blots. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown to 80% confluency in 100-cm2 flasks and transfected with the empty vector or the VE-JAM plasmid (8 μg/flask) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested with 4 mm EDTA in PBS without calcium or magnesium and washed once in 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and 5 × 105 cells/well were placed in a 96-well plate. Cells were incubated with the appropriate antibody for 30 min on ice and washed three times with cold PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) for 30 min on ice and washing, flow cytometry was performed. Peripheral blood was obtained by venipuncture and stained as above. Leukocyte populations were identified by their forward and side scatter characteristics. Platelets were identified with an antibody to αIIbβ3 (Plt-1, Immunotech, Westbrooke, ME). Staining was analyzed using CellQuest (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). A cDNA for the extracellular domain of VE-JAM (1–717 bp of the coding region) was inserted into Ig-pEFBos vector, which encodes the Fc region of human IgG1 (18.Sassetti C. Van Zante M. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9001-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid containing the VE-JAM/Ig chimera was transfected into COS cells using serum-free media. After 5 days, the medium was collected. 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (Bio-Rad), was added to the supernatant, which was agitated overnight at 4 °C with protein A beads (Repligen, Needham, MA). The following day, the beads were poured into a column equilibrated in PBS. The protein was eluted with 100 mm triethylamine (pH 11.0) into a tube containing 1/10 the final volume of 3 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. The eluate was concentrated with a Centricon30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and equilibrated with PBS. A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was prepared by inserting a cDNA of the extracellular domain of VE-JAM (1–717 bp) into a modified PEAK 10 vector (Edge Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD), which encodes a portion of GST (bases 258–917) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (18.Sassetti C. Van Zante M. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9001-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The VE-JAM·GST fusion protein was produced in PEAKRapid cells (Edge Biosystems) as recommended by the manufacturer. The fusion protein in the conditioned medium was purified with glutathione-agarose (Sigma) by overnight incubation at 4 °C. The beads were placed into a column, washed with PBS, and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0 (Sigma), in PBS. The eluate was concentrated with a Centricon30 (Amicon) and equilibrated with PBS. Polyclonal antibodies were produced by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) where 800 μg of VE-JAM/GST fusion protein was used to immunize two rabbits. Antibody titer was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using VE-JAM·Ig fusion protein as the antigen (19.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Antibodies were affinity purified by chromatography on a column of VE-JAM·Ig fusion protein coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Sigma) according to standard procedures (19.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Anti-VE-JAM antibody was biotinylated using EZ-link-Sulfo Link (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of purified VE-JAM/GST fusion protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% gel electroblotted onto Problott (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The appropriate band, identified by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, United Kingdom), was excised and subjected to Edman degradation analysis. Human tonsil, foreskin, lung, placenta, and heart samples were obtained from surgical or autopsy specimens at the University of California, San Francisco. Rat heart was isolated from a Harlan Sprague-Dawley female by standard procedures. Tissues were frozen in OCT embedding medium (Miles Inc, Elkhart, IN). Frozen sections were cut (10 μm) and fixed in 1:1 methanol:acetone for 5 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in 100% methanol for 20 min. Sections were blocked with PBS containing 5% normal goat serum (or 0.2% bovine serum albumin for placenta and rat heart only). Rabbit polyclonal VE-JAM and anti-CD31 (monoclonal antibody 2148, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), rabbit polyclonal von Willebrand factor (DAKO, Denmark), and MECA-79 were used at 0.3, 1, and 1 μg/ml, respectively. After staining for 1 h at room temperature, sections were washed two times in PBS. For immunofluorescence, bound antibodies were detected with Cy 3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or Cy 2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) (Jackson Immunoresearch, Westgrove, PA). For immunocytochemistry, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA) was added to detect bound rabbit antibodies. This was followed by addition of ELITE ABC (Vector) mixture, using Nova Red (Vector) as the substrate. Normal rabbit IgG (Caltag, Burlingame, CA) or mouse IgG1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used as control. Tonsillar stroma was prepared as described by Baekkevold et al. (7.Baekkevold E.S. Jahnsen F.L. Johansen F.E. Bakke O. Gaudernack G. Brandtzaeg P. Haraldsen G. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 327-336PubMed Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, surgical specimens were stored for less than 4 h in sterile saline at 4 °C. Disinfection was achieved with Cliniscrub solution (Clinipad Corp., Rocky Hill, CT) diluted 1/50 in PBS. Tonsils were finely chopped with a razor blade, and the resulting mince was depleted of lymphocytes by washing with PBS using a Falcon 70-μm cell strainer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The remaining tissue was digested for 15 min at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (Fischer, Pittsburgh, PA) containing 1 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mg/ml dispase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.04 mg/ml DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After free lymphocytes were removed by washing over a cell strainer, the residual stromal components were digested for an additional 60 min at 37 °C with fresh enzyme solution. The digested stroma was washed once with RPMI 1640 and plated onto Vitrogen (Celtrix Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) coated glass slides. Nonadherent cells were washed away after 90 min, and adherent cells were cultured in EBM-MV medium (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD). A frozen human tonsil obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network, Western Division (Case Western University, Cleveland, OH) was homogenized in 25 ml of PBS plus 2% Triton X-100 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 5 mm EDTA plus 1X Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysates were spun at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and frozen in 1-ml aliquots. 1 μg of VE-JAM antibody was added to 1 ml of tonsillar lysate and rocked overnight at 4 °C. 10 μl of protein A beads were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein A beads (Repligen) were then spun down and washed five times with PBS. The beads were boiled in 20 μl of 6× SDS loading buffer and run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred to a Pro-Blott membrane and probed with 1 μg/ml biotinylated anti-VE-JAM in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Caltag) for 1/2 h with detection of specific bands by the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To identify genes that are selectively expressed in HEC, we prepared a PCR select library (16.Chen Z. Zeng H. Gorczynski R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) from HEC cDNA, which was subtracted with HUVEC and PBL cDNAs. This approach utilizes relatively small cDNA fragments (400–600 bp) that are generated with the RsaI restriction enzyme. We subjected the library to an EST analysis. A full description of this library and our analysis of ESTs will be the subject of a future communication. Of the novel cDNAs present within the library, one appeared five times as partial sequences. A full-length clone was obtained from an unsubtracted HEC cDNA expression library (15.Bistrup A. Bhakta S. Lee J.K. Belov Y.C. Gunn M.D. Zuo F.-R. Huang C.-C. Kannagi R. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) using a pool selection technique in conjunction with PCR (15.Bistrup A. Bhakta S. Lee J.K. Belov Y.C. Gunn M.D. Zuo F.-R. Huang C.-C. Kannagi R. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA (Fig. 1) contains a single open reading frame, which is predicted to encode a protein of 298 amino acids followed by a 3′-untranslated region of 72 bp and a poly(A) tail. The start codon satisfies the criteria for a strong context for translation initiation (20.Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). A cleavable signal peptide of 28 amino acids was predicted using SignalP (21.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar), which was verified by amino-terminal sequencing of a GST fusion protein expressed in PEAKRapid cells. Overall the cDNA is predicted to encode a type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular portion of 237 amino acids, a transmembrane domain of 23 amino acids, and a cytoplasmic tail of 38 amino acids (GenBankTM accession number AF255910). The protein is hereafter referred to as VE-JAM based on the characterization provided below. The extracellular region of VE-JAM is comprised of two IgSF domains, a membrane distal V-set domain, and a membrane proximal C2-type domain. It resembles an extensive list of cell surface antigens with two tandem IgSF domains (see “Discussion” below). A subset of these molecules (i.e. ChT1, HCAR, and A33 antigen) contains two additional, similarly spaced cysteines in their C2 type domains, in addition to the conserved pair of cysteines that is characteristic of most IgSF domains (22.Heath J.K. White S.J. Johnstone C.N. Catimel B. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Tu G.F. Ji H. Whitehead R.H. Groenen L.C. Scott A.M. Ritter G. Cohen L. Welt S. Old L.J. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23.Katevuo K. Imhof B.A. Boyd R. Chidgey A. Bean A. Dunon D. Gobel T.W. Vainio O. J.

VE-JAM exhibits these extra cysteines with the identical spacing found in these other proteins (Fig.2). Using the human sequence VE-JAM cDNA sequence as a probe, we identified a homologous mouse sequence in the NCBI dbEST data base. When the clone containing the EST was retrieved and fully sequenced, we obtained a full-length cDNA (GenBankTM mEST AI154320) (Fig. 1). The sequence predicts a protein of 298 amino acids, which is 80% identical to human VE-JAM and exhibits the same general features; therefore, this protein is very likely to be the murine ortholog of VE-JAM (GenBankTM accession number AF25911). Sequence comparisons with the GenBankTM NR data base revealed that VE-JAM is most homologous to JAM (Fig. 2), a recently identified protein that is localized to intercellular boundaries of epithelial and endothelial cells and that is strongly implicated in transendothelial migration of myeloid cells (10.Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J.

Immunol. 1999; 36: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Homology between VE-JAM and JAM is seen throughout the predicted proteins with an overall identity of 34%. Two stretches of 9 and 11 amino acids in the second IgSF domains are identical. In addition, the potential glycosylation sites in the second IgSF domain of VE-JAM are conserved in mouse and human JAM. However, the extra pair of cysteines is not present in either mouse or human JAM (Fig. 2 B). The next most homologous protein to VE-JAM is A33 antigen, which exhibits 22% identity in amino acid sequence, including conservation of the extra cysteine pair (22.Heath J.K. White S.J. Johnstone C.N. Catimel B. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Tu G.F. Ji H. Whitehead R.H. Groenen L.C. Scott A.M. Ritter G. Cohen L. Welt S. Old L.J. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A Northern analysis on a multitissue blot (human) was carried out with a 509-bp probe corresponding to the 3′-end of the VE-JAM cDNA (Fig.3 A). Three major species of ≈1.2, 1.4, and 4.4 kilobases were detected in several tissues, the smallest of which is consistent with the minimum expected message size. Variable expression in different tissues was observed with highest expression in the heart followed by the placenta and lymph node. Because cDNAs corresponding to VE-JAM were initially detected in a library derived from HEC mRNA, we wished to confirm the presence of transcripts in HEC. As shown in Fig. 3 B, VE-JAM-specific primers amplified a band in a PCR reaction using cDNA made from an independent preparation of HEC. There was no specific band when reverse transcriptase was not included in the preparation of template, proving that RNA, and not genomic DNA, was responsible for the amplification. There was no detectable signal from PBL cDNA. To study VE-JAM at the protein level, we prepared a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the ectodomain of the protein. A GST fusion protein containing the entire extracellular domain of the human VE-JAM was expressed in mammalian cells, purified on a glutathione-agarose column, and used to immunize rabbits. Specific antibodies were affinity purified on a column of an immunoglobulin chimera of VE-JAM, which contained the extracellular domain of VE-JAM fused to the Fc portion of IgG1. The purified antibodies stained CHO cells that were transfected with the VE-JAM cDNA but not the parental cells (Fig.4 A). Normal IgG was negative on both populations of cells. CHO cells transfected with a cDNA encoding human JAM were not stained by the VE-JAM antibody, establishing that the antibody was not cross-reactive to the related protein (data not shown). To visualize the protein encoded by the VE-JAM cDNA, we carried out a Western blot analysis on VE-JAM-transfected CHO cells. A single band of ≈40 K d was detected in lysates of transfected cells but not in the parental cells (Fig. 4 B). Normal rabbit IgG did not react with any bands. The same molecular weight was observed when VE-JAM was labeled at the cell surface by surface biotinylation (not shown). The unmodified mature protein is predicted to have a molecular mass of 33 kDa. The extra mass is likely attributable to glycosylation at the potential sites forN-linked modifications. To determine the cellular expression pattern of VE-JAM, we carried out immunocytochemistry on cryostat sections of several human tissues with the polyclonal VE-JAM antibody. Staining of human tonsil sections demonstrated the VE-JAM was strongly expressed in HEV (Fig.5, A and B), consistent with the occurrence of ESTs in the HEC cDNA library and the reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments. Specificity was established by demonstrating that all reactivity was blocked when the antibody was mixed with purified VE-JAM·IgG (not shown). In human and rat heart, staining with the VE-JAM antibody was observed on the endothelium of endocardium, arteries, venules, and capillaries (Fig. 5, Cand D). Co-staining for PECAM-1 or von Willebrand factor, widely used markers for vascular endothelium (reviewed in Refs. 25.Wagner D.D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar and26.Newman P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), verified that VE-JAM was present on the endothelial lining of endocardium and the vessels (not shown). A survey of other human tissues (lung, placenta, and foreskin) established staining on the endothelia of both large and small vessels. Interestingly, VE-JAM was not detected in oral epithelium, epidermis of skin, respiratory epithelium of bronchus (not shown), or in mesothelium of the pericardium (Fig. 5 C). This result is in contrast to the expression pattern of JAM, which is broadly distributed on both simple and stratified epithelia, as well as vascular endothelium (10.Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J.

Immunol. 1998; 35: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Additionally in flow cytometry experiments, VE-JAM was not detected on the surface of platelets or leukocytes isolated from blood (TableI). This latter finding was consistent with the failure to detect VE-JAM mRNA in RNA of PBL (Fig.3 A) and the absence of staining in T- and B-cell zones of tonsils (Fig. 5, A and B).Table IStaining of whole blood with antibodies to VE-JAMBlood cellVE-JAMNormal IgGGranulocytes15.210.3Monocytes4.03.3Platelets22.010.2Lymphocytes2.22.1A sample of blood was stained with VE-JAM antibody or normal rabbit IgG and analyzed by flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values for the mean fluorescent intensity are indicated.

https://openalex.org/W2136184845,"Proteins of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp) family connect signaling pathways to the actin polymerization-driven cell motility. The ubiquitous homolog of WASp, N-WASp, is a multidomain protein that interacts with the Arp2/3 complex and G-actin via its C-terminal WA domain to stimulate actin polymerization. The activity of N-WASp is enhanced by the binding of effectors like Cdc42-guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, or the Shigella IcsA protein. Here we show that the SH3-SH2-SH3 adaptor Grb2 is another activator of N-WASp that stimulates actin polymerization by increasing the amount of N-WASp·Arp2/3 complex. The concentration dependence of N-WASp activity, sedimentation velocity and cross-linking experiments together suggest that N-WASp is subject to self-association, and Grb2 enhances N-WASp activity by binding preferentially to its active monomeric form. Use of peptide inhibitors, mutated Grb2, and isolated SH3 domains demonstrate that the effect of Grb2 is mediated by the interaction of its C-terminal SH3 domain with the proline-rich region of N-WASp. Cdc42 and Grb2 bind simultaneously to N-WASp and enhance actin polymerization synergistically. Grb2 shortens the delay preceding the onset of Escherichia coli (IcsA) actin-based reconstituted movement. These results suggest that Grb2 may activate Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization downstream from the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway.

Recent works have shown that the Arp2/3 complex, which contains 7 polypeptides including the actin-related proteins Arp2 and Arp3, is the universal downstream cytoskeletal target of a variety of signaling cascades (see Refs. 1.Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar and 2.Carlier M.-F. Ducruix A. Pantaloni D. Chem.

The Arp2/3 complex stimulates the formation of new actin filaments that actively grow from their barbed ends at specified locations beneath the plasma membrane. Barbed end growth develops the protrusive force responsible for lamellipodia extension and ruffling. The recent reconstitution of actin-based motility from pure proteins (3.Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that in addition to the site-directed nucleating activity of activated Arp2/3, the maintenance of a highly dynamic steady state of actin assembly in the medium by actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin and capping proteins was crucial in eliciting actin-based movement. The actin nucleating activity of Arp2/3 is revealed upon interaction with proteins of the WASp1/Scar family (4–9, see Ref. 10.Bi E. Zigmond S.H. Curr.

These multidomain proteins are thought to connect the signaling pathways to Arp2/3 and actin and are involved in the formation of filopodia (11.Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T.

The PH/WH1 domain contains binding sites for WASp-interacting protein (18.Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The WA domain of all members of the WASp family is responsible for the stimulation of actin nucleation by Arp2/3 complex and does so by interacting both with Arp2/3 complex via the A region and with G-actin via the WH2 region (4.Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 26.Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The interaction with G-actin via the WH2 region confers a profilin-like function to the WA domain, shuttling actin subunits to the growing barbed ends (9.Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In addition, the WASp and N-WASp members of the WASp/Scar family contain a CRIB domain that binds Cdc42 in the GTP-bound form (27.Aspenström P. Lindberg U. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 70-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 28.Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. Mccormick F. Francke U. Abo A.

The isolated full-length N-WASp molecule activates Arp2/3 to a lesser extent than the WA domain; however, upon binding Cdc42 or PIP2, N-WASp activates Arp2/3 in an enhanced fashion (6.Rohatgi R.L. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar), leading to a dramatic enhancement of actin polymerization in vitro. This result suggested that the WA domain may be buried in the N-WASp protein due to some internal interaction, and N-WASp would switch to an active state, in which the WA domain is exposed, upon binding Cdc42 or PIP2. Very recent NMR studies (31.Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Mananb N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the so-called “cofilin-homology region“ in the WA domain of WASp interacts with the CRIB domain, in an autoinhibited complex. Activation of N-WASp/Arp2/3 by the Shigella flexneri bacterial pathogen has also been described (9.Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). S. flexneri undergoes actin-based propulsion in host cells and is one of the best tools for a molecular approach of actin-based motility. Initiation of actin assembly at the surface of Shigella is mediated by a single protein, IcsA (32.Bernardini M.L. Mounier J. d'Hauteville H. Coquis-Rondon M. Sansonetti P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3867-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), that harnesses N-WASp (33.Suzuki T. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2767-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). IcsA mimics Cdc42 in inducing a structural change in N-WASp, exposing WA and stimulating Arp2/3-induced actin assembly and bacterial motility (9.Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The structural basis for activation of N-WASp by IcsA is not yet known. The above results suggest that the function of WASp proteins in a physiological context is to link Cdc42 activation to de novoactin assembly. However, the activation of N-WASp may be driven by other ligands binding to the proline-rich region of N-WASp via SH3 domains, such as the adaptors Grb2 and Nck (22.Banin S. Truong O. Katz D.R.

Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar for a recent review), including proteins involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, Grb2 could act not only as an adaptor but also as an effector of actin-dependent processes in response to signaling. Microinjection of anti-Grb2 antibodies abolishes actin-based membrane ruffling in response to EGF (44.Matuoka K. Shibasaki F. Shibata M. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3464-3473Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), binding of Grb2 to dynamin (45.Wang Z. Moran M.F.

The role of these interactions in the regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization has not been clearly established; however, addition of Grb2 to cell lysates increases the amount of N-WASp that coimmunoprecipitates with the activated EGF receptor (23.She H.-Y. Rockow S. Tang J. Nishimura R. Skolnik E.Y. Chen M. Margolis B. Li W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1709-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here we use in vitro actin polymerization assays with pure Arp2/3 and N-WASp and motility assays ofShigella in a medium reconstituted from pure proteins (3.Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) to show that Grb2 directly activates N-WASp and mediates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin nucleation. Actin was purified from rabbit muscle and was isolated as monomeric CaATP-G-actin by gel filtration in G buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl−, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.01% NaN3) and pyrenyl-labeled as described (48.Pantaloni D.

Polymerization of actin was monitored by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin. The assays were carried out at 20 °C in a Spex fluorolog2 or a Safas flx spectrofluorimeter. Samples (80 μl) contained typically 2.5 μm MgATP-G-actin (10% pyrenyl-labeled), 10–20 nm Arp2/3 complex, and N-WASp, Grb2, and other reagents as indicated in F buffer (G buffer supplemented with 0.1 m KCl and 1 mm MgCl2). The maximum slope of the polymerization curves was taken as a measure of the activation of Arp2/3 complex. N-WASp (W) was assumed to bind Arp2/3 (Y) and Grb2 (X) and to associate into a dimer W2with an equilibrium dissociation constant K D. The different equilibria to be considered (Fig. 6) were described by the following Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6.

The total concentration of W was the sum of the concentrations of all the W containing species. It was considered that [X]total = [X], i.e.Grb2 is in large excess over all complexes of N-WASp and Arp2/3. The value of Y was adjusted by iteration until the total concentration of Y was exactly equal to the concentration of Arp2/3 in the experiment. The value of [WY] + [WXY], which is the concentration of activated N-WASp-Arp2/3 complex, carrying or not Grb2, was taken as representing the activity measured in the polymerization assays.Figure 2Structure-function relationship of N-WASp and effect of Grb2. a, N-WASp concentration dependence of the stimulation of actin polymerization. MgATP-G-actin (2.5 μm) was polymerized in the presence of 9 nmArp2/3 complex and N-WASp at the indicated concentrations, in the absence (closed circles) or in the presence (open circles) of 1 μm Grb2. The maximum rate of polymerization is plotted versus the concentration of N-WASp. Thin lines are theoretical curves obtained assuming that N-WASp is in a reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium (K = 90 nm); Arp2/3 binds equally well monomeric and dimeric N-WASp, but only the monomeric species is active in stimulating polymerization and binds Grb2 preferentially.Inset, percent activation by Grb2 at different concentrations of N-WASp (the line is the theoretical curve). b, evidence for N-WASp self-association by covalent cross-linking.

Microbiol. 1995; 18: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), was tested by examining the motile behavior of bacteria in the motility medium reconstituted from pure proteins (3.Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Bacteria (6×109 bacteria/ml) were precoated with N-WASp by preincubation in X buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm sucrose) containing 0.2 μm N-WASp and Grb2 as indicated, at 20 °C for 10 min. Bacteria were then sedimented at 13,000 × g for 4 min, resuspended in the original volume of X buffer, and diluted 30-fold in the motility medium. The motility medium consisted of 8 μm F-actin, 5 μm actin depolymerizing factor, 50 nm Capping protein, 2.5 μmprofilin, and 0.1 μm Arp2/3 complex and was supplemented or not with Grb2 at the same concentration as in the preincubation step. Motility was observed in phase contrast optical microscopy as described (3.Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The time course of generation of actin tails and establishment of the steady rate of propulsion was monitored for each sample, and the average rates were measured over at least 10 bacteria. N-WASp was equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated at 1 μm with 5 mm EDC and 5 mm NHS for 45 min at 0 °C. Samples were immediately denatured and submitted to SDS-PAGE (9% acrylamide), electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose, and Western blotted using a polyclonal anti-N-WASp at a 1:500 dilution (9.Egile C.

The binding of Cdc42-GTPγS or of the Shigella protein IcsA to N-WASp leads to the activation of actin polymerization by Arp2/3. The molecular mechanism by which activated Arp2/3 complex induces the seemingly autocatalytic polymerization of actin is not fully understood. The current interpretation of the activation of Arp2/3 by N-WASp is that when N-WASp binds effectors like Cdc42 or IcsA, the C-terminal WA domain of N-WASp is exposed and is able to interact with Arp2/3 and G-actin to stimulate actin filament nucleation and barbed end growth (6.Rohatgi R.L. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 9.Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The pyrene fluorescence assay for actin polymerization provides a rapid, accurate, and quantitative test of the function of putative effectors leading to the structural change and activation of N-WASp (or of antagonists of this reaction). The effect of Grb2, an SH3-SH2-SH3 multidomain adaptor, on the function of N-WASp was addressed. Grb2 stimulated actin polymerization in the presence of Arp2/3 complex and N-WASp (Fig.1 a). The effect of Grb2 was maximum at a concentration of 1 μm, and half-effect was observed at 0.1–0.2 μm (data not shown). Under conditions of maximum activation, in the presence of 1 μmGrb2, the N-WASp concentration dependence of the rate of actin polymerization was consistent with the binding of Grb2·N-WASp complex to Arp2/3 with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 5 nm(Fig. 1 b). In the absence of Grb2, however, the activity measurements did not reflect normal saturation of Arp2/3 by N-WASp. First, the half-maximum was obtained at a concentration of N-WASp representing 25% of the Arp2/3 concentration. Second, activation of polymerization first increased with N-WASp and then decreased at high concentration (Fig. 2 a). Third, the percent activation provided by Grb2 increased with the concentration of N-WASp (Fig. 2 a, inset). The decrease in activation of polymerization upon increasing N-WASp was observed in a range of N-WASp concentration (0.1–0.8 μm) in which no appreciable sequestration of G-actin by WA can occur. The two opposite effects of N-WASp therefore suggest that N-WASp exists in two states that can interact with Arp2/3. At low concentration (10−9–10−8m), N-WASp binds Arp2/3 in a complex that stimulates polymerization, whereas at high concentration (10−7-10−6m) it also binds Arp2/3, but in a state that does not stimulate polymerization. The stronger stimulating effect of Grb2 at high N-WASp concentration suggests that Grb2 shifts N-WASp to its active state. To get more insight into the possible association state of N-WASp and its control by Grb2, sedimentation velocity and cross-linking experiments were carried out. At 4 μmN-WASp had a sedimentation coefficients 20,w of 5.45 S. This value is much higher than the one expected (3.98 S) for a monomeric 56-kDa globular protein and is suggestive of a dimeric structure of N-WASp. Cross-linking of N-WASp by EDC/NHS showed evidence for a triplet of covalently cross-linked polypeptides migrating with apparent molecular masses of 150–190 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 b), supporting the view that N-WASp is in a self-association equilibrium. The different cross-linked species may correspond to different locations of the cross-links in the amino acid sequence. The amount of cross-linked polypeptides decreased in the presence of Grb2, suggesting that Grb2 stabilizes the monomeric form of N-WASp. No covalently cross-linked Grb2-N-WASp polypeptide was detected. As will be discussed under “Discussion,” the polymerization data shown in Fig. 2 aare satisfactorily modeled (continuous line through the data points) assuming that N-WASp undergoes self-association upon increasing concentration and that the monomeric form activates actin polymerization and is favored by Grb2 binding. The above results suggest that one or both of the two SH3 domains of Grb2 activate N-WASp by binding to the proline-rich region of the protein. This possibility was tested using mutated forms of Grb2 and specific targets of the SH3 domains as follows (Fig.3). First, the activating effect of Grb2 wild type (curve f in Fig. 3 A) was totally inhibited by 2.5 μm of the Sos-derived peptide dimer VPPPVPPRRR-Aha-K-Aha-RRRPPVPPPV (curve h in Fig. 3 A), which binds both SH3 domains (Fig. 3 B) and blocks the Ras signaling pathway (52.Cussac D. Vidal M. Leprince C. Liu W.Q. Cornille F. Tiraboschi G. Roques B.P. Garbay C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The pYpYN phosphorylated tripeptide, which mimics the targets of the SH2 domain of Grb2, caused a weak inhibition in the absence as well as in the presence of Grb2. However, activation of N-WASp by Grb2 in itself was not affected by pYpYN tripeptide (compare curves j and k). In conclusion, the SH2 domain of Grb2 is not responsible for the activation of N-WASp, and binding of the SH2 domain of Grb2 to a phosphotyrosine peptide does not affect the affinity of its SH3 domains for proline-rich targets, in agreement with Cussacet al. (55.Cussac D. Frech M. Chardin P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4011-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The G203R point mutation in the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 is located at the interface of the two SH3 domains (Fig. 3 B). It has been shown to impair sex myoblast migration (56.Clark S.G.

https://openalex.org/W2033852349,"Thrombin activates protease-activated receptors (PARs) by specific cleavage of their amino-terminal exodomains to unmask a tethered ligand that binds intramolecularly to the body of the receptor to effect transmembrane signaling. Peptides that mimic such ligands are valuable as agonists for probing PAR function, but the tethered ligand peptide for PAR4, GYPGKF, lacks potency and is of limited utility. In a structure-activity analysis of PAR4 peptides, AYPGKF was ∼10-fold more potent than GYPGKF and, unlike GYPGKF, elicited PAR4-mediated responses comparable in magnitude to those elicited by thrombin. AYPGKF was relatively specific for PAR4 in part due to the tyrosine at position 2; substitution of phenylalanine orp-fluorophenylalanine at this position produced peptides that activated both PAR1 and PAR4. Because human platelets express both PAR1 and PAR4, it might be desirable to inhibit both receptors. Identifying a single agonist for both receptors raises the possibility that a single antagonist for both receptors might be developed. The AYPGKF peptide is a useful new tool for probing PAR4 function. For example, AYPGKF activated and desensitized PAR4 in platelets and, like thrombin, triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis but not inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in PAR4-expressing cells. The latter shows that, unlike PAR1, PAR4 couples to Gq and not Gi.

This serves to unmask a new amino terminus beginning with the sequence SFLLRN, which serves as a tethered peptide agonist, binding intramolecularly to the body of the receptor to effect transmembrane signaling. PARs are thus in essence peptide receptors that carry their own ligands, which remain silent until unmasked by site-specific receptor cleavage.

Human PAR4 is activated when thrombin cleaves its amino-terminal exodomain at the Arg-47/Gly-48 peptide bond to unmask the tethered ligand GYPGQV (4.Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D.

The synthetic peptide GYPGQV does function as an agonist for PAR4, but a concentration of 200–500 μm is required for activity. This lack of potency severely limits the utility of this peptide for probing PAR4 function in culture systems and virtually precludes its use in vivo. Structure-function relationships for the PAR4 tethered ligand have not been explored. We here report such a study. In addition to identifying requirements for agonist activity and specificity, this study provides a new PAR4 specific agonist peptide, AYPGKF. This peptide was shown to be useful for probing PAR4 signaling in culture systems and in platelets. All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma. myo-[3H]Inositol and [3H]adenine were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fura-2/AM was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Bordetella pertussis toxin islet-activating protein was obtained from List Biologicals (Campbell, CA). α-Thrombin was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The thromboxane receptor agonist, U46619, was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Corp. (San Diego, CA). Peptides were synthesized at University of California San Francisco as carboxyl-terminal amides, purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and characterized by mass spectroscopy. Peptide solutions were made fresh from powder for most experiments. Stable cell lines based on KOLFs, a cell line derived from lung fibroblasts from PAR1 knockout mice (8.Connolly A.J. Ishihara H.

KOLF clones resistant to hygromycin were screened for receptor expression by cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the FLAG epitope using M1 monoclonal antibody (10.Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KOLF lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum and 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Analogous Rat 1 cell lines were derived by transfecting the same expression vectors and a neomycin resistance vector and then screening G418-resistant clones for M1 antibody binding (10.Ishii K.

COS7 cells were transiently transfected for 5 h with 2 μg/ml DNA (human PAR1 or PAR4 cDNA in pBJ1) using LipofectAMINE and Opti-MEM media (Life Technologies, Inc.) per the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum overnight. The cultures were then split into 24-well plates for phosphoinositide hydrolysis assays. All cell culture was at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells cultured in 24-well plates were labeled overnight withmyo-[3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, and penicillin/streptomycin. Following labeling, the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of pertussis toxin (0.1 -100 ng/ml) for 5 h at 37 °C. Agonists were then added together with 20 mm LiCl in serum-free media and incubated at 37 °C for 20–120 min. Cells were extracted, and total [3H]inositol phosphates were quantitated as described (11.Hung D.T. Vu T.-K.H. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium mobilization was measured fluorometrically using fura-2 as described previously (12.Ishihara H.

Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 24-well plates and labeled with [3H]adenine (2 μCi/ml) over night at 37 °C in 1 ml of HEPES-buffered serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were treated in the presence or absence of pertussis toxin (0.1–100 ng/ml) for 5 h at 37 °C and then incubated with forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of α-thrombin (30 nm) or agonist peptides. Cells were then extracted, and [3H]cAMP and total [3H]adenine nucleotides were assayed as described previously (14.Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet-rich plasma and washed human or mouse platelets were prepared, and platelet ATP secretion and aggregation in response to various agonists was measured by standard lumiaggregometry (Chrono-log Corp.) as described previously (7.Kahn M.L.

Blood. 1998; 91: 4152-4157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To define the structure-function requirements for PAR4-activating peptides, we tested a series of hexapeptides based on the sequence GYPGKF. GYPGKF represents the first six amino acids of the new amino terminus unmasked when thrombin cleaves mouse PAR4 and was chosen as the starting sequence because it was more potent than the cognate human sequence GYPGQV on both the mouse and human receptors.

Agonist-triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis was used as an end point. Untransfected KOLFs showed no responses to thrombin or to the peptides tested (Refs. 8.Connolly A.J. Ishihara H. Kahn M.L.

We first compared the native PAR4 and PAR1 peptides GYPGKF and SFLLRN. GYPGKF elicited only 55% of the maximal response triggered by thrombin in PAR4-expressing cells, even when added at 500 μm. By contrast, in PAR1-expressing cells, the maximal responses to SFLLRN and thrombin were of similar magnitude. Both peptides were specific for their respective receptors in this cell system (TableI).Table ISynthetic peptides screened for PAR1 and PAR4 receptor activationPosition of altered amino acidSynthetic peptide aCha, cyclohexylalanine; F, parafluoro-phenylalanine; homoR, homoarginine; Orn, ornithine; Mpr, mercaptoproprionic acid.

Important results were confirmed using Rat1 cell lines expressing human PAR4 or PAR1 (see text). We next performed an alanine scan and a series of other substitutions designed to identify sites important for activity and specificity at PAR4 versus PAR1. Surprisingly, alanine or serine substitution at position one of GYPGKF yielded a gain of function for PAR4 activation (Table I). Threonine substitution caused a loss of function. These data suggest that small aliphatic side chains are preferred at position 1. Substitution of a mercaptoproprionic acid for serine in SFLLRN nearly abolished agonist activity for PAR1 (15.Coughlin, S. R., and Scarborough, R. M. (1995) U. S. Patent 5,759,994Google Scholar, 16.Seiler S.M. Peluso M. Michel I.M. Goldenberg H. Fenton J.n. Riexinger D. Natarajan S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cognate substitution of mercaptoproprionic acid for glycine in GYPGKF also resulted in loss of agonist function. Mercaptoproprionic acid-YPGKF and SYPGKF differ at only two positions. The mercaptoproprionic acid-peptide lacks an amino-terminal protonated amino group and has a sulfur atom at the position corresponding to oxygen in the serine side in SYPGKF. The amino-terminal protonated amino group of SFLLRN is critical for agonist function at PAR1; thus, it is likely that the protonated amino group in GYPGKF is critical for agonist activity at PAR4. This is consistent with the notion that the proteolytic switch in PARs involves both removal of sequence amino to the cleavage site and creation of a new protonated amino group that functions in the context of the tethered ligand (17.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Hung D.T. Rose J. Vu T.K. Wheaton V.I. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13146-13149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Coller B.S. Ward P.

A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In contrast to the gain of function seen with alanine substitution at position 1, substitution of alanine for the tyrosine at position 2 in GYPGKF resulted in a loss of agonist activity (not shown). Thus, as in the PAR1 agonist SFLLRN (17.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Hung D.T. Rose J. Vu T.K. Wheaton V.I. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13146-13149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Vassallo Jr., R.R. Kieber-Emmons T. Cichowski K. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6081-6085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the aromatic side chain at position 2 is critical for activity. Interestingly, substitution of phenylalanine or para-fluorophenylalanine for tyrosine did not decrease agonist activity for PAR4 but did cause a remarkable gain of function for PAR1 (Table I). This result suggests that the presence of a tyrosine at position two is an important determinant of the activity of GYPGKF and of its specificity for PAR4 over PAR1. More importantly, this result shows that is it possible to develop agonists and, by extension, perhaps antagonists, that act on both PAR1 and PAR4. Substitution of alanine for proline at position three or for glycine at position four in GYPGKF resulted in substantial loss of agonist function for PAR4 (Table I). This loss of function was also noted in the context of the SYPGKF better-than-native peptide. Proline and glycine are often found in β-turns; thus, proline 3 and glycine 4 may be important for a conformation necessary for agonist function. Substitution of leucine, cyclohexylalanine, or isoleucine for glycine at position 4 all caused gain of function for PAR1, consistent with published results (17.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W.

Klimas C. Matsueda G.R. Bernatowicz M.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 190-197PubMed Google Scholar), but also caused loss of function at PAR4. Substitutions at positions 5 and 6 that might be expected to yield gain of function at PAR1 failed to do so (Table I). Conversely, the better-than-native PAR1 agonists S(F)(Cha)(Cha)RK and S(F)(Cha)(Cha)(homoR)K (where Cha indicates cyclohexylalanine) had no activity at PAR4 (Table I). The results in Table I were confirmed in two ways. First, all of the phosphoinositide hydrolysis studies were verified at a semiquantitative level using peptide-triggered increases in cytoplasmic calcium, measured fluorometrically, as an end point (see below). Second, important experiments were replicated using Rat 1 cell lines stably transfected with hPAR1 or hPAR4. These studies yielded results very similar to those obtained with the KOLF-based cell lines shown in TableI. AYPGKF was again shown to be a more potent agonist than GYPGKF. In PAR4-expressing Rat 1 cells, the maximum response to thrombin (30 nm) was an ∼18-fold increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis (mean of triplicate determinations; standard deviations were ∼5% of means). Untransfected cells showed no significant response. Responses to 30, 100, and 500 μm AYPGKF were 72, 101, and 116% of the maximal thrombin response to thrombin, respectively. The corresponding responses to GYPGKF were 4, 30, and 92%, respectively. The relative specificity of AYPGKF for PAR4 and SFLLRN for PAR1 was also confirmed. In Rat 1 cells expressing PAR1 or PAR4, the maximum response to thrombin (30 nm) was an 11- or 19-fold increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis, respectively, and untransfected cells showed no significant response. In cells expressing PAR1 or PAR4, the response to 500 μm SFLLRN was 130 or 3% of the maximal response to thrombin, respectively. The cognate responses to 500 μm AYPGKF were 4 or 97% of the maximal response to thrombin, respectively. Thus, even at 500 μm, SFLLRN and AYPGKF were relatively specific for their respective receptors. By contrast, the peptides GFPGKF and G(F)PGKF, which demonstrated an ability to activate both PAR1- and PAR4-expressing KOLFs, showed similar activity in the Rat1 system. The response to 500 μm GFPGKF in Rat1 cells expressing PAR1 or PAR4 was 72 or 81% of the maximal thrombin response, respectively. The cognate responses to G(F)PGKF were 131 or 76%, respectively. The structure-activity scan in Table I yielded two peptides, SYPGKF and AYPGKF, that were more potent than the native GYPGKF sequence at stimulating PAR4-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Because cells were exposed to agonist for 60 min in the phosphoinositide hydrolysis assay, it was possible that increased activity of a given peptide might be due to better stability in cell culture. To test this possibility and to further probe the specificity of these peptides, we examined their ability to trigger immediate increases in cytoplasmic calcium in KOLF-PAR4 and KOLF-PAR1 cell lines (Fig.1). AYPGKF and SYPGKF triggered increases in cytoplasmic calcium concentration in KOLF-PAR4; over several experiments, the peak calcium response elicited by AYPGKF was similar to that elicited by thrombin in these cells. AYPGKF and SYPGKF triggered little response in KOLF-PAR1. Conversely, SFLLRN induced calcium mobilization in KOLF-PAR1 but not in KOLF-PAR4 cells. We next compared the relative potencies of AYPGKF, SYPGKF, and GYPGKF in the phosphoinositide hydrolysis and cytoplasmic calcium assays (Fig.2 and data not shown) in KOLF-PAR4 cells. GYPGKF appeared to be a partial agonist for PAR4-triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis; even at 500 μm, GYPGKF elicited only approximately 50% of the maximal response to thrombin (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, both AYPGKF and SYPGKF were full agonists for PAR4 activation and showed EC50 values of 20 and 50 μm, respectively, in this assay. Similarly, AYPGKF stimulated calcium mobilization in KOLF-PAR4 cells with an EC50 of approximately 25 μm (Fig.2 B), whereas more than 200 μm GYPGKF was required to elicit similar responses in this assay (data not shown). Thus in assays in which cellular effects are measured over either seconds or hours, AYPGKF was substantially more potent than GYPGKF. These data militate against peptide stability as being responsible for the greater activity of AYPGKF and instead suggest that AYPGKF is intrinsically more active than GYPGKF at PAR4.Figure 2Phosphoinositide hydrolysis and intracellular calcium mobilization in response to PAR4 activation. A,KOLF-PAR4 cells were treated with either α-thrombin (30 nm) (filled square) or the indicated concentrations of GYPGKF (open squares), AYPGKF (open triangles), or SYPGKF (open circles) in the presence of LiCl (20 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Total [3H]inositol phosphates were collected and quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values from untreated cells (ranging from 500 to 1200 cpm in different experiments) were subtracted as background. Data are the means ± S.E.;n = 3. Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. B, KOLF-PAR4 cells were loaded with fura-2/AM and assayed for intracellular calcium mobilization in response to increased concentrations of AYPGKF. Concentrations were (bottom curve to top curve) 1, 5, 10, 100, and 500 μm. Data are representative of two similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) AYPGKF appeared to be potentially useful as a probe of PAR4 function. To further assess specificity, we examined the ability of this peptide to activate calcium mobilization in Xenopus oocytes (1.Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

AYPGKF (500 μm) elicited ∼10-fold increases in 45Ca release from hPAR4-expressing oocytes, but only ∼1.5-fold increases in hPAR1 expressing oocytes and no responses in oocytes expressing hPAR2 or hPAR23 (data not shown). Oocytes expressing hPAR1, hPAR2, and hPAR3 did respond robustly to SFLLRN, SLIGRL, and thrombin, respectively. Thus, even in our most sensitive assay system, AYPGKF was relatively specific for PAR4 versus the other known PARs. PAR1 has been shown to couple to G proteins of the Gi, Gq, and G12/13 subfamilies (14.Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol.

We first determined whether PAR4 might exhibit a different coupling pattern by measuring phosphoinositide hydrolysis and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in the presence or absence of pertussis toxin and then compared signaling in response to thrombin versus AYPGKF to determine whether such agonists recapitulated the signaling pattern elicited by thrombin. Thrombin or SFLLRN inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner in PAR1-KOLF cells (Fig. 3 and data not shown), consistent with the known coupling of PAR1 to Gi(14.Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to thrombin or SFLLRN was slightly inhibited by pertussis toxin in KOLF-PAR1 cells and was more substantially inhibited by pertussis toxin in COS7 cells transiently transfected with PAR1 (Fig. 4and data not shown). This is consistent with a Gi-mediated contribution to phospholipase C activation (26.Blank J.L. Shaw K. Ross A.H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25184-25191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, neither thrombin, GYPGKF, nor AYPGKF inhibited adenylyl cyclase in PAR4-expressing KOLFs or COS7 cells (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Moreover, PAR4-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was pertussis toxin-insensitive. Under the conditions used in these experiments, treatment with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylates all detectable pertussis substrate in cell membranes as assayed by subsequent ADP-ribosylation of membrane preparations in vitro using activated pertussis toxin and 32P-NAD (11.Hung D.T. Vu T.-K.H. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus these data suggest that, unlike PAR1, PAR4 does not couple to Gi. Moreover, the observation that the responses to thrombin and the various agonist peptides were concordant, at least in terms of which G proteins were activated, suggests that these peptides are useful probes of PAR4 signaling in mammalian cells. The observation that the response of PAR4-expressing cells to GYPGKF, even at 500 μm, was less than 60% of the maximum response to thrombin again emphasizes the utility of better than native PAR4 agonists.Figure 4Phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to α-thrombin or agonist peptides in the presence of increasing concentrations of pertussis toxin.KOLF-PAR4 or KOLF-PAR1 or transfected COS7 cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of pertussis toxin for 5 h at 37 °C and then either left untreated (triangles), treated with α-thrombin (30 nm) (circles), or treated with the receptor agonist peptides (squares): GYPGKF (500 μm) for PAR4-expressing cells or SFLLRN (100 μm) for PAR1-expressing cells. Agonist treatment was for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of LiCl (20 mm). Total [3H]inositol phosphates released (mean ± S.E.;n = 3) were quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments for each cell type.

In platelet-rich plasma, AYPGKF caused platelet shape change at 20 μm (Fig. 5, top left; shape change is indicated by the dip in the solid aggregation curve). At 100 μm and above, AYPGKF reliably stimulated platelet ATP secretion and aggregation (Fig. 5). By comparison, under the conditions used in these experiments, GYPGKF elicited only shape change even at 500 μm. The PAR1 agonist SFLLRN was considerably more potent than AYPGKF; the threshold for SFLLRN for shape change and secretion was ∼4 μm,and substantial responses occurred at 20 μm. However, maximum responses to AYPGKF were at least as great at those to SFLLRN (Fig. 5). AYPGKF also elicited robust increases in platelet cytoplasmic calcium concentration (Fig. 6). Responses to AYPGKF were not inhibited by preincubating platelets with the PAR1 antagonist BMS200261 (100 μm) (27.Bernatowicz M.S. Klimas C.E. Hartl K.S. Peluso M. Allegretto N.J. Seiler S.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 4879-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); by contrast, SFLLRN responses were blocked by this reagent (data not shown). Thus, platelet responses to AYPGKF are not attributable to agonist activity at PAR1. These results are consistent with expression of both PAR1 and PAR4 on human platelets (4.Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W.

Washed human platelets were loaded with fura-2/AM, and agonist-triggered increases in cytosolic calcium were measured fluorometrically. Platelets were either left untreated prior to measurements (gray bars) or were pretreated with the PAR1-antagonist peptide BMS200261 (100 μm) for 5 min and AYPGKF (500 μm) for 30 min at room temperature (white bars). These platelets were then stimulated with a saturating concentration of agonist as indicated: α-thrombin (30 nm), SFLLRN (100 μm), AYPGKF (500 μm), or U46619 (10 μm). Data shown are means ± S.E. (n = 2). This experiment was replicated twice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Desensitization with PAR-specific agonist peptides has been useful for probing the role of specific receptors in differentiated cells, and AYPGKF indeed proved useful in this regard. Increases in cytoplasmic calcium were measured fluorometrically as an index of PAR signaling. In platelets in which PAR1 was blocked by the antagonist BMS200261 (27.Bernatowicz M.S. Klimas C.E. Hartl K.S. Peluso M. Allegretto N.J. Seiler S.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 4879-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), pretreatment with AYPGKF caused platelets to become refractory to both AYPGKF and to thrombin (Fig. 6). Only limited heterologous desensitization to the thromboxane receptor agonist U46619 was noted. These results indicate that AYPGKF effectively desensitized PAR4-mediated signaling in human platelets. Moreover, they confirm and extend previous studies that suggest PAR1 and PAR4 account for most if not all thrombin signaling in human platelets (7.Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Genetically manipulated mice are increasingly utilized to identify the molecules and mechanisms that regulate platelet function. In our hands, thrombin is the most effective agonist for activation of mouse platelets, with ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and U46619 being considerably less potent. However, because thrombin clots fibrinogen, thrombin cannot be used to study platelet function in platelet-rich plasma; washed platelets must be used, and preparation of washed platelets entails substantial additional ex vivomanipulation. In the human system, the PAR1 agonist SFLLRN has proven useful as a strong agonist that can activate platelets in platelet-rich plasma. However, mouse platelets utilize PAR3 and PAR4 for thrombin signaling—PAR1 does not contribute. No peptide agonist capable of activating mouse PAR3 has been described, and recent evidence suggests that mPAR3 functions as a cofactor for thrombin cleavage of PAR4 rather than as a bona fide receptor (28.Nakanishi-Matsui M. Zheng Y.-W. Sulciner D. Weiss E.J. Ludeman M.J. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). AYPGKF proved to be a potent activator of mouse platelets in platelet-rich plasma, unlike the wild-type GYPGKF peptide (Fig. 7). AYPGKF will therefore be useful for exploring platelet function in genetically manipulated mice. Indeed, AYPGKF caused shape change but not secretion or aggregation in platelets from Gαq-deficient mice (data not shown), suggesting that PAR4 mediates shape change through a G protein other than Gq, probably G12/13 (29.Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In summary, this exploration of structure-activity relationships for PAR4 tethered ligand peptides has provided useful structure-function lessons, a new PAR4 agonist, and new information regarding PAR4 coupling to G proteins. Several structure-function lessons were learned. First, the amino-terminal protonated amino group of the PAR4 tethered ligand appears to be important for agonist activity at PAR4. This is consistent with the notion that the proteolytic switch that activates the tethered ligand involves not only removal of sequence amino to the scissile bond between Arg-47 and Gly-48 but also generation of a new protonated amino group at the nitrogen that was part of that peptide bond. This is analogous to previous findings with PAR1 (17.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Hung D.T. Rose J. Vu T.K. Wheaton V.I. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13146-13149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Coller B.S. Ward P. Ceruso M. Scudder L.E. Springer K. Kutok J. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11713-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and, not surprisingly, suggests that the proteolytic switch in PARs utilizes a common mechanism (19.Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Second, the basis for agonist specificity for PAR4 versus PAR1 was in part attributable to the tyrosine at position 2 in GYPGKF and AYPGKF. Several peptides in which this tyrosine was substituted by phenylalanine or p-fluorophenylalanine were capable of acting at both PAR1 and PAR4. Because human platelets express both PAR1 and PAR4, it might be desirable to block activation of both receptors to prevent or treat thrombosis. The observation that it is possible to generate an agonist capable of activating both receptors raises the possibility that it might also be possible to generate an antagonist capable of blocking both receptors. These studies also generated a new PAR4 agonist, AYPGKF, which was used to provide new information about PAR4 signaling and function in platelets and other cells. AYPGKF, unlike GYPGKF or GYPGQV (peptides based on native tethered ligand sequence), was a full agonist for PAR4 and ∼10-fold more potent than the native agonist GYPGKF. AYPGKF was also relatively specific for PAR4 versus the other known PARs. The increased potency of AYPGKF made it a useful tool for investigating PAR4 signaling in various settings. In the course of characterizing thrombin and peptide signaling in PAR-transfected cells, we noted that whereas PAR1 coupled to Gq and Gi, PAR4 coupled to Gq but not Gi. Elevated cAMP levels inhibit platelet activation; hence, the ability of PAR1 to activate Gi and inhibit adenylyl cyclase (in addition to activating Gq) may contribute to its effectiveness in activating human platelets (14.Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Brass L.F. Molino M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Conversely, the lack of ability to activate Gi of PAR4 may be a factor in its apparent lesser role in thrombin-triggered platelet activation (7.Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). AYPGKF also proved useful for directly probing PAR4 function in platelets (Figs. 5 and 6). When combined with PAR1 inhibition, desensitization of PAR4 signaling by prolonged incubation with AYPGKF effectively blocked platelet activation by thrombin. This observation supports the model that PAR1 and PAR4 together account for most if not all platelet activation by thrombin (7.Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). One specialized use of AYPGKF will be probing mouse platelet function, as it elicits robust platelet activation in platelet-rich plasma. Reliable activators of mouse platelets are needed given the increasing use of genetically modified mice to investigate platelet function (4.Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D. Moff S.

Collectively, these results further our understanding of platelet activation and thrombin signaling and provide a valuable new tool for future studies. We expect that the availability of the AYPGKF peptide will promote study of PAR4 function, much as the availability of SFLLRN promoted study of PAR1."

The most frequently studied form of NFκB consists of two proteins, p50 (NFκB1) and p65 (RelA). In unstimulated cells, this heterodimer is retained in the cytoplasm by an inhibitory protein known as the inhibitor of κB (IκB). In response to most stimuli that activate NFκB, IκB becomes phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteosome (7.Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Jung S. Avraham A.

The transcriptional activity of NFκB is also controlled by phosphorylation of dimer subunits. For example, both p50 and p65 are phosphorylated in cells, and phosphorylation of p65 has been shown to positively regulate its transcriptional activity (9.Li C.C. Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. J.

The activities of IKKα and IKKβ are controlled by the related kinases NFκB-interacting kinase (NIK) and the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinases 1–3 (MEKK1–3) (30.Malinin N.L.

Other kinases that control IKK activity may yet be identified. Recent studies have shown that two upstream regulators of NIK are the transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 and Cot/Tpl2, whereas MEKK1 has been shown to be regulated by the viral protein Tax (37.Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

The relative importance of each of these pathways to the regulation of IKK activity in response to different stimuli remains unclear. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β (IL1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), as well as bacterial endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), signal to the IKK complex through the activation of specific receptors on the plasma membrane. In the case of IL1β, its receptor (IL1βRI) signals to an associated complex consisting of the IL1β-accessory protein, MyD88, and two related interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase proteins (41.Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The activated receptor complex signals to the IKK complex through a scaffolding protein called TRAF6 (43.Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V.

LPS induces signaling following binding to a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-linked, membrane-associated protein called CD14. Recently, a member of the toll family of receptors known as toll receptor 4 was identified as a receptor for LPS (45.Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6421) Google Scholar). Another toll family member, toll receptor 2, has also been identified as possible LPS receptor (46.Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). These receptors have significant homology to the IL1βRI and in fact require many of the known IL1βRI-associated molecules for efficient signaling (47.O'Connell M.A. Bennett B.L. Mercurio F.

Once activated, macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1β, TNFα, and IL6. The signaling pathways required for these events are not well defined but are known to result in the activation of three different MAPK cascades as well as an increase in NFκB activity (51.Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also clear that activation of NFκB is necessary for transcription of the genes encoding these cytokines (48.Swantek J.L. Christerson L. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11667-11671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the Rho family small G proteins Rac1, Cdc42hrs, and RhoA are capable of activating NFκB in various cell types (52.Sulciner D. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J.

These observations indicate that Rho family small G proteins are involved in regulating NFκB activation following cytokine stimulation. All small G proteins mediate signaling through the activation of specific effector proteins. Both Rac1 and Cdc42hs share a number of common effectors, including the p21-activated kinases (PAKs) (56.Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To date four PAKs have been cloned, and in the case of PAKs 1–3, binding of GTP-liganded Rac or Cdc42hs promotes their activation by relieving an autoinhibitory constraint (56.Lim L. Manser E.

Once activated, a number of cellular phenotypes have been attributed to PAK activity, including activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), JNK, and p38 MAPK cascades (PAKs 1–4), regulation of cytoskeletal organization (PAKs 1, 2, and 4), and regulation of apoptosis (PAK2) (56.Lim L.

In this study we show that PAK1 mediates NFκB activation by Ras, Raf-1, and Rac1 and that expression of an active form of PAK1 is capable of stimulating NFκB activity on its own. In addition, we show that active PAK1 stimulates the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NFκB in the apparent absence of IKKα or IKKβ activation. We also demonstrate that in mouse macrophages, PAK1 activity is stimulated by LPS and is required for efficient NFκB activation and TNFα transcription. These results identify PAK1 as an important regulator of NFκB in both fibroblasts and macrophages.

Mouse anti-Myc and mouse anti-HA antibodies were from the Cell Culture Center and the Berkeley Antibody Company, respectively. Rabbit anti-NIK (H-248), rabbit anti-IKKα (M-280), rabbit anti-IKKβ (H-470), rabbit anti-p65 (H-286) and rabbit anti-PAK1 (N-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Escherichia colilipopolysaccharide from strain 0127:B8 was obtained from Difco. GST-IκB-(1–54) was expressed in logarithmically growing BL21DE3E. coli by the addition of 400 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. GST fusion proteins were purified essentially as described (59.Lee L.F. Li G. Templeton D.J. Ting J.P.-Y. J. Biol.

Hexa-histidine-tagged IKKα and IKKβ were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified first by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography and then by MonoQ (anion exchange) fast protein liquid chromatography. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. HEK 293 cells (293 cells) and REF52 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1%l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Prior to transfection, the cells were placed in fresh growth medium. Both cell lines were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (63.Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P.S. Lewis R. Ahn J. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Twenty hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with DMEM plus 0.5% calf serum (NIH 3T3 cells) or DMEM without serum (293 cells). The cells were then allowed to incubate for another 24 h. RAW 264.7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (endotoxin-free), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine. These cells were transfected using the Profection DEAE-dextran transfection system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) or diluent for 6 h and then harvested. Transfected cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped into luciferase lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 70 mmK2HPO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were rapidly mixed for 10 s, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and either assayed immediately or flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Firefly luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using a Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) and a Turner luminometer. For promoter activation assays in NIH3T3 cells, transfection efficiency was monitored by assaying for β-galactosidase activity derived from a cotransfected, constitutively active β-galactosidase expression plasmid. β-Galactosidase activity was determined essentially as described (65.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In RAW 264.7 cells, transfection efficiency was determined by measuring the activity of expressed Renilla firefly luciferase derived from the transfection of pRL-TK (Promega). Renilla luciferase assays were performed at the same time as the firefly luciferase assays using a Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) and the Turner luminometer. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were performed as described previously (51.Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assay the activity of transfected IKKα or IKKβ, 293 cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed with Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 80 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation, and supernatants were removed, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Equal amounts of epitope-tagged IKK proteins were used for immunoprecipitation based on prior immunoblotting. IKKs were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with antibodies directed against the appropriate epitope tags and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each immunoprecipitate was washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and was divided in two parts. One-half was tested for immunoprecipitated IKKα or IKKβ protein by immunoblotting. The other half was assayed for kinase activity toward GST-IκB-(1–54). Kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, 3 μm GST-IκB-(1–54), and 4500 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer and were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Phosphate incorporated into GST-IκB-(1–54) was measured by excising the Coomassie Blue-stained bands and counting by liquid scintillation. For assaying endogenous PAK1 activity in RAW 264.7 cells, the cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for increasing amounts of time, washed once with cold PBS, and lysed in Triton lysis buffer. PAK1 was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of cell lysate/sample by incubating with 1 μg of rabbit anti-PAKα antibody (N20) and protein A-Sepharose for at least 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating platform. The immunoprecipitates were then pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mNaCl and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2. The immunoprecipitate was assayed for kinase activity using myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate. MBP kinase assays were carried out essentially as described (59.Lee L.F. Li G. Templeton D.J. Ting J.P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28253-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). After the kinase reaction the pellet containing the immunoprecipitated PAK1 was solubilized with Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoprecipitated PAK1 was detected by Western blotting using the rabbit anti-PAK1 antibody (N-20). REF52 cells were plated on glass coverslips in 10% fetal bovine serum and injected with expression vectors for p65 and Myc-epitope-tagged versions of either V12Rac1, PAK1 165, or wt NIK. All expression vectors were injected into the nucleus at 0.25 mg/ml using an Eppendorf 5171 microinjector mounted on a Zeiss Axiophot S135 inverted microscope. Either 4 or 16 h after injection the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at 37 °C and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Expressed p65 RelA was detected with rabbit anti-p65 diluted to 2 μg/ml in PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). Myc-tagged proteins were detected with mouse anti-Myc diluted to 0.4 μg/ml in PBST. Fixed cells were incubated with these antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h followed by three 5-min washes with PBST. The cells were then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson Labs) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse for 1 h at 37 °C followed by three 5-min washes with PBST and once with distilled water. Epiflouresence was detected with a Zeiss Axiovert S135 microscope fitted with a Photometrics cooled CCD camera. Ras, Raf-1, and Rac1 have all been shown to stimulate NFκB activity (53.Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 66.Norris J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the case of Ras and Raf-1, this activation may to be critical to their ability to promote cell growth. On the other hand, NFκB activation by Rho family small G proteins has been suggested to be important for the response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Because PAK1 is a Rac and Cdc42hs effector that is involved in the Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1, we tested whether PAK1 activity is required for activation of NFκB by these molecules. Thus, NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with an NFκB-luciferase reporter plasmid, active forms of Ras (V12H-Ras), Raf-1 (Raf BXB), or Rac1 (V12Rac1), and either a control vector or dominant negative (dn) PAK1. This dominant negative form of PAK1 consists of the catalytic domain of PAK1 (amino acids 232–544) containing a point mutation that renders it inactive (K298A). Because it lacks the N-terminal regulatory domain, it cannot bind to Rac1 or Cdc42hs. As shown in Fig. 1 A, expression of active Ras, Raf-1, or Rac1 stimulated NFκB activity in these cells. In the case of Ras, NFκB activation was only partially blocked by dominant negative PAK1. Because Ras activates NFκB through multiple signaling pathways, this likely indicates that only one of these pathways relies on PAK1 (66.Norris J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13841-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). On the other hand, dominant negative PAK1 was more effective at blocking NFκB activation by active Rac1 and completely blocked activation by active Raf-1. This suggests that PAK1 plays a more important role in NFκB activation stimulated by Raf-1 and Rac1. For all three proteins, dominant negative PAK1 blocked NFκB activation slightly less well than dominant negative NIK, and coexpression of dominant negative NIK and dominant negative PAK1 did not result in a greater degree of inhibition of NFκB activation (data not shown). Because NIK phosphorylates and activates the IκB kinases IKKα and IKKβ, this suggests that NFκB activation by Ras, Raf-1, or Rac1 ultimately depends on the phosphorylation of IκB. To test if PAK1 functions downstream of proteins known to mediate NFκB activation by cytokines, dominant negative PAK1 was coexpressed with increasing amounts of the adaptor proteins TRAF2 and TRAF6. TRAFs link cytokine receptor activation to the IκB kinase activation cascade, and overexpression of wild type TRAF proteins stimulates NFκB activity (43.Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 44.Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayashi N. Tojo T. Suzuki K. Aizawa S. Watanabe T. Mosialos G. Kieff E.

https://openalex.org/W2151769410,"L-type Ca2+ channels are unusual in displaying two opposing forms of autoregulatory feedback, Ca2+-dependent inactivation and facilitation. Previous studies suggest that both involve direct interactions between calmodulin (CaM) and a consensus CaM-binding sequence (IQ motif) in the C terminus of the channel's α1C subunit. Here we report the functional effects of an extensive series of modifications of the IQ motif aimed at dissecting the structural determinants of the different forms of modulation. Although the combined substitution by alanine at five key positions (Ile1624, Gln1625, Phe1628, Arg1629, and Lys1630) abolished all Ca2+ dependence, corresponding single alanine replacements behaved similarly to the wild-type channel (77wt) in four of five cases. The mutant I1624A stood out in displaying little or no Ca2+-dependent inactivation, but clear Ca2+- and frequency-dependent facilitation. An even more pronounced tilt in favor of facilitation was seen with the double mutant I1624A/Q1625A: overt facilitation was observed even during a single depolarizing pulse, as confirmed by two-pulse experiments. Replacement of Ile1624 by 13 other amino acids produced graded and distinct patterns of change in the two forms of modulation. The extent of Ca2+-dependent facilitation was monotonically correlated with the affinity of CaM for the mutant IQ motif, determined in peptide binding experiments in vitro. Ca2+-dependent inactivation also depended on strong CaM binding to the IQ motif, but showed an additional requirement for a bulky, hydrophobic side chain at position 1624. Abolition of Ca2+-dependent modulation by IQ motif modifications mimicked and occluded the effects of overexpressing a dominant-negative CaM mutant. L-type Ca2+ channels are unusual in displaying two opposing forms of autoregulatory feedback, Ca2+-dependent inactivation and facilitation. Previous studies suggest that both involve direct interactions between calmodulin (CaM) and a consensus CaM-binding sequence (IQ motif) in the C terminus of the channel's α1C subunit. Here we report the functional effects of an extensive series of modifications of the IQ motif aimed at dissecting the structural determinants of the different forms of modulation. Although the combined substitution by alanine at five key positions (Ile1624, Gln1625, Phe1628, Arg1629, and Lys1630) abolished all Ca2+ dependence, corresponding single alanine replacements behaved similarly to the wild-type channel (77wt) in four of five cases. The mutant I1624A stood out in displaying little or no Ca2+-dependent inactivation, but clear Ca2+- and frequency-dependent facilitation. An even more pronounced tilt in favor of facilitation was seen with the double mutant I1624A/Q1625A: overt facilitation was observed even during a single depolarizing pulse, as confirmed by two-pulse experiments. Replacement of Ile1624 by 13 other amino acids produced graded and distinct patterns of change in the two forms of modulation. The extent of Ca2+-dependent facilitation was monotonically correlated with the affinity of CaM for the mutant IQ motif, determined in peptide binding experiments in vitro. Ca2+-dependent inactivation also depended on strong CaM binding to the IQ motif, but showed an additional requirement for a bulky, hydrophobic side chain at position 1624. Abolition of Ca2+-dependent modulation by IQ motif modifications mimicked and occluded the effects of overexpressing a dominant-negative CaM mutant. calmodulin base pair 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid Na4 salt 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl N-hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid As part of its ubiquitous role in controlling Ca2+-dependent cellular processes, calmodulin (CaM)1 is an important regulator of many types of ion channels, both voltage- and ligand-gated (1.Saimi Y.

Prominent among these are L-type Ca2+ channels, which open in response to membrane depolarization and activate contractions of heart cells, trigger hormone secretion from endocrine cells, and control gene transcription in neurons. It is generally agreed that the passage of Ca2+ ions through L-type channels exerts profound feedback effects on the subsequent opening and closing of their pore-forming α1C subunit (6.McDonald T.F.

Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Both inhibitory and facilitatory forms of autoregulation have been described, and both appear to involve CaM. The inhibitory form, Ca2+-dependent inactivation, has long been recognized to promote the shutting off of channel conductance during a maintained depolarization (8.Brehm P. Eckert R.

Hypotheses about the involvement of CaM in Ca2+-dependent inactivation have ranged widely, the earliest considering direct phosphorylation of the channel by CaM kinase II or its dephosphorylation by the CaM-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (10.Chad J.E.

The enhancing form of autoregulation, Ca2+-dependent facilitation, is seen most prominently in L-type channels when basal Ca2+ is elevated (14.Marban E. Tsien R.W. J. Physiol.

Recent experiments have implicated direct binding of CaM to L-type channels as a key step in both types of autoregulation. As first shown by Zühlke and Reuter (24.Zühlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), partial deletion of a consensus CaM-binding IQ motif in the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of α1C eliminated Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Ca2+-dependent binding of CaM to peptides containing the IQ motif (25.Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H.

Overexpression of CaM mutants with defective Ca2+-binding sites exerts a dominant-negative effect on both Ca2+-dependent inactivation (25.Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 26.Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Yue D.T.

Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Mutations in the IQ motif that eliminate the CaM binding also prevent both forms of modulation (25.Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Although all of these observations support the involvement of Ca2+-dependent CaM binding to the L-type channel in both inactivation and facilitation, they raise the question of how both forms of autoregulation might arise from a single Ca2+ sensor (25.Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). This complexity exceeds that found in any other CaM-regulated ion channel so far. As a first step toward understanding the dual action of CaM, we have examined the contributions of individual amino acids of the IQ motif to Ca2+-sensitive inactivation and facilitation of L-type channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. A comprehensive series of alanine substitutions were carried out at five positions (Ile1624, Gln1625, Phe1628, Arg1629, and Lys1630), followed up by systematic replacement of the critical residue Ile1624 by 13 other amino acids. Analysis of the electrophysiological properties of the various mutant channels supported the following general conclusions. First, Ca2+-dependent inactivation and facilitation coexist as distinct processes, separable by different kinetics of onset and decay and emphasized to differing extents by various voltage protocols. Second, when both Ca2+-dependent gating mechanisms are operative, Ca2+-dependent inactivation can mask an underlying facilitation (here we use “inactivation” or “facilitation” to refer to underlying mechanisms rather than the net behavior that results from these processes working in opposition). Third, although both processes require CaM binding to the IQ motif, inactivation and facilitation depend on significantly different structural determinants within this motif. The L-type Ca2+ channel α1C,77 subunit, which we call 77wt, was originally cloned from human fibroblasts (28.Soldatov N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4628-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and subsequently assembled in an expression-competent vector to form the 77wt-containing plasmid pHLCC77 (29.Soldatov N.M. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10540-10543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This cDNA construct was the basis for the creation of all mutant Ca2+ channels described in this paper. As template for site-directed mutagenesis, we used the plasmid p77NB (24.Zühlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which contains anNsiI-BamHI fragment from pHLCC77 that encodes the entire C-terminal end of 77wt. We used different polymerase chain reaction strategies for introducing single or multiple amino acid mutations into the IQ motif of 77wt (see Fig. 1 A). The mutant channels 77IQ/2A and 77FRK/3A were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene GmbH, Zürich, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 220-bp BglII fragment containing the mutations was then transferred into p77NB before subcloning aVan91I-BamHI fragment harboring the mutatedBglII segment into full-length pHLCC77. The 77IQFRK/5A mutant was constructed by triple-fragment ligation of a 400-bpVan91I-RsaI fragment from 77IQ and a 1850-bpRsaI-BamHI fragment from 77FRK/3A into pHLCC77. The construction of 77I/A, 77I/E, and 77I/V has already been described (25.Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The introduction of additional amino acid substitutions at Ile1624 generally followed the same procedure. To replace Ile1624 by Met, Ser, Arg, Phe, Leu, Cys, and Trp, an antisense oligonucleotide was synthesized that contained the degenerate codon WKS (W is A, T; K is G, T; S is G, C) in place of the wild-type ATC codon. In addition, an adjacent silent mutation (TTC to TTT) disrupted an EcoNI restriction site, which was used to screen for mutations. With this mutant oligonucleotide, we performed the polymerase chain reaction and used the amplified mutant 400-bp Van91I-RsaI fragment for triple-fragment ligation as described above, although with a wild-type RsaI-BamHI fragment instead of a 77FRK fragment. The remaining amino acid replacements at position 1624 (Ile to Gly, Ile to Thr, and Ile to Tyr) as well as the construction of 77IQ/CA were performed accordingly using individual non-degenerate oligonucleotides. Finally, the alanine substitutions at Phe1628, Arg1629, and Lys1630 were introduced by a similar strategy. The amplified 615-bpRsaI-AatII fragment containing the individual mutations was used together with a wild-typeVan91I-RsaI fragment for triple-fragment ligations directly into pHLCC77. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire amplified restriction fragment in the final cDNA construct. The synthesis of oligonucleotides and the cDNA sequencing were performed by a commercial laboratory (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Bioconcept, Allschwil, Switzerland), MBI Fermentas (Mächler AG, Basel, Switzerland), and Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Rotkreuz, Switzerland). DNA isolation and purification systems were from Promega (Catalys AG, Wallisellen, Switzerland) and QIAGEN (Basel). Mutant and wild-type Ca2+ channel cDNAs were linearized with BamHI prior to in vitro RNA transcription with an Ambion T7 mMessage mMachine kit (AMS Biotechnology, Lugano, Switzerland). The auxiliary Ca2+channel subunits β1 (30.Ruth P. Röhrkasten A. Biel M. Bosse E. Regulla S. Meyer H.E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Science. 1989; 245: 1115-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and α2δ (31.Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) as well as the calmodulin mutant CaM(3−) (4.Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) were transcribed using 25 units of SP6 RNA polymerase (Stratagene GmbH) with the T7 mMessage mMachine kit after appropriate linearization of the template cDNAs. For microinjection into Xenopus oocytes, cRNAs encoding wild-type or mutant Ca2+ channel α1C subunits and auxiliary channel subunits were mixed at equimolar concentrations and diluted with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Injection pipettes were pulled with a DMZ Universal Puller (Zeitz Instruments GmbH, Augsburg, Germany) and had tip openings of 20–25 μm. Using a Nanoject Microinjector (Drummond Scientific Co., Bromall, PA), we routinely injected 23 nl of cRNA mixture (0.05–0.33 pmol/μl) into freshly isolated and defolliculated Xenopus oocytes (32.Sigel E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 386: 73-90Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Optimal Ca2+ channel expression depended on the total amount of injected cRNA and was obtained 4–7 days after injection. For the coexpression of Ca2+ channels with CaM(3−) it was necessary to inject large amounts of CaM(3−) cRNA (up to 200 fmol) at least 3 days prior to Ca2+ channel cRNA injections to obtain a strong time- and dose-dependent dominant-negative effect by CaM(3−) on L-type Ca2+ currents (I Ca). Microinjected Xenopus oocytes were kept at 17–19 °C in a sterile Barth's medium containing 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH) and supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Three to seven days after injection of Ca2+ channels, oocytes were used to analyze electrophysiological properties of the expressed Ca2+channels with a standard two-electrode voltage clamp configuration using an oocyte clamp OC-725C amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) connected through a CED 1401 A/D interface (CED, Cambridge, United Kingdom) to a personal computer. Before recording whole cellI Ba or I Ca, oocytes were injected with 23–46 nl of 100 mm BAPTA solution (pH 7.4) to minimize contaminating Ca2+-activated Cl−currents. The injection of higher amounts of BAPTA resulted in a decrease in I Ca and in a reduction of Ca2+-dependent inactivation. 2R. D. Zühlke, unpublished observations. The tip diameter of the BAPTA injection pipettes was only 10–15 μm to minimize leakage after injections. During I Barecordings, oocytes were constantly superfused with a solution containing 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 50 mmNaOH, 1 mm KOH, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid). To evoke I Ca, the bath solution was switched to a solution containing Ca(NO3)2 instead of Ba(OH)2. In general, I Ba and I Ca were obtained in the same oocyte, and oocytes initially expressingI Ba < 500 nA were not used. Current recordings have been acquired and, where possible, analyzed with CED Patch and Voltage Clamp software. Ionic currents were filtered at 0.5 kHz and sampled at 2 kHz. Additional analysis of current properties as well as statistical analysis of current parameters were done using MS Excel 97 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and GraphPAD Prism 3.0 (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego CA). All values are given as means ± S.E. In some cases, error bars were smaller than graphical symbols and thus not visible (e.g. Fig.3 A). In general, statistical comparisons between mean values of parameters were done by paired Student's t test. Where appropriate, unpaired t tests or analysis of variance has been used. Purified CaM (Calbiochem) was labeled with dansyl chloride (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as recommended in the manufacturer's protocol. Emission fluorescence spectra of dansyl-CaM alone and after titration of peptides were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer LS 50 B luminescence spectrometer. Wild-type and mutant peptides were synthesized at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Center at Stanford University (Stanford, CA) and were resuspended in water. All experiments were performed with 33 nm dansyl-CaM in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 1 μm free Ca2+ (buffered with HEDTA) to which concentrated solutions of peptide were added. The excitation wavelength was 340 nm, and both the excitation and emission band passes were set at 15 nm. The fraction of bound dansyl-CaM was calculated from the fractional increase in fluorescence intensity at 480 nm using the relationship f b = (I m − I f)/(I b− I f), where I m is the measured fluorescence, I f is the fluorescence when no peptide is added, and I b is the fluorescence when all dansyl-CaM is bound. K d values were determined using the Hill equation f b = 1/(1 + 10(log kd− X ) k), where X is the peptide concentration in moles/liter andk is the Hill coefficient. Our previous analysis (25.Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) was based on mutations at a single position, isoleucine 1624, the first of 12 residues in a consensus IQ motif in the C-terminal tail of the α1C subunit (residues 1624–1635) (Fig. 1 A). Those experiments led to the conclusion that both Ca2+-dependent inactivation and facilitation depend upon CaM binding to the IQ motif. We have tested this idea further with an extensive series of mutations and detailed kinetic analysis. Previous work has shown that Ca2+-dependent inactivation can be eliminated by deletion of the first eight amino acids of the IQ motif, but not the last four residues (24.Zühlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, we focused our attention on the first five conserved positions in the consensus IQ motif (Fig.1 A, underlined boldface letters). Currents carried by Ba2+ and Ca2+ ions were recorded in the same oocytes to assess the effects of Ca2+ entry on the decline of current during a standard depolarizing pulse to +20 mV. Fig. 1 B compares the Ca2+ dependence of current decay in a series of alanine mutations with that found in 77wt channels. Ca2+-dependent inactivation was prominent with the 77wt channel and with the mutants 77Q/A, 77F/A, 77R/A, and 77K/A. On the other hand, the Ca2+ dependence of decay was barely detectable with 77FRK/3A and completely absent with 77I/A, 77IQ/2A, and 77IQFRK/5A. The widely ranging Ca2+dependence was the most striking feature of this series of mutants, although variations in the rate of Ba2+ current decay were also discernible and deserve further study in their own right. The examples displayed in Fig. 1 B were representative of pooled data from many oocytes, shown in Fig. 1 C. To assess the effect of Ca2+-dependent inactivation in a more quantitative fashion, we measured residual Ca2+ and Ba2+ currents at 100 ms, expressed them as a fraction of peak I Ca (r 100Ca) andI Ba (r 100Ba), and calculated the ratio as the Ca2+-dependent fraction, f 100 = (r 100Ba/r 100Ca) − 1. A particularly interesting result was obtained with the 77IQ/2A mutant. In this case, I Ca declined considerably more slowly than I Ba, a reversal of the usual difference in decay. In this respect, the 77IQ/2A construct was unique among the mutations tested. Two possibilities for the interpretation of the Ca2+ sensitivity of 77IQ/2A may be considered. The mutation alters the expression of Ca2+ sensitivity, to retard inactivation rather than to accelerate it, or the mutation changes the balance between two distinct processes, inactivation (which decreases current in a Ca2+-dependent way) and facilitation (which increases current in a Ca2+-dependent way). To decide between these possibilities, one may consider the results of multiple-pulse experiments. If only inactivation operates, be it slow or fast, currents evoked by a train of closely spaced pulses must become progressively smaller than the current evoked following a long quiescence. If, on the other hand, inactivation were counteracted by a genuine facilitatory process (strong enough to counteract inactivation), currents during repeated depolarizing pulses could gradually increase. Accordingly, the various alanine replacement mutants were tested with a pulse train protocol (40 identical pulses from −90 to +20 mV for 50 ms, applied at 0.5 and 3.3 Hz). As plotted in Fig.2 A, the peak inward currents during successive depolarizations were normalized to currents evoked during the first depolarization so that facilitation would appear as an increase above unity. With Ba2+ as charge carrier, no facilitation was observed in any of the channel constructs. Likewise, with Ca2+ as charge carrier, facilitation could not be detected for either 77wt or 77IQFRK/5A. In contrast, the mutant channel 77IQ/2A displayed a very prominent facilitation ofI Ca such that currents grew pulse by pulse until they reached an amplitude at the end of the train nearly twice as large as after a long rest. This facilitation was seen only at 3.3 Hz, not at 0.5 Hz. A much smaller degree of facilitation was evident with 77FRK/3A, once again only at the higher pulse frequency, not at the lower one. Fig. 2 B summarizes pooled data from experiments with pulse trains for the same series of alanine substitutions shown in Fig. 1. 77IQ/2A stands out as the construct with the greatest degree of facilitation, followed by 77I/A and then 77FRK/3A. Focusing mainly on 77IQ/2A, a working hypothesis is that the slower decay ofI Ca relative to I Ba (Fig.1 B) arises from the same underlying facilitatory mechanism as expressed in experiments with pulse trains (Fig. 2 A). In agreement with this hypothesis, a smaller but significant retardation of I Ca inactivation relative toI Ba was also found for 77I/A, which also exhibits marked facilitation (25.Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The next question was whether facilitation is specific to particular variants of 77wt or whether it is a widespread property of L-type channels, but is masked to varying degrees by inactivation. To try to dissect the contributions of facilitation and inactivation, we used a conventional two-pulse protocol. Systematic variations in the interval between the two identical depolarizing pulses were carried out to emphasize possible differences in the rate of relaxation of inactivation and facilitation (Fig.3 A). Effects specifically dependent on Ca2+ entry were highlighted by comparison of the size of I Ca relative toI Ba at each recovery interval. The simplest result was obtained with the construct 77IQFRK/5A. The time courses of fractional recovery of I Ca andI Ba were virtually identical at all interpulse intervals, consistent with the exposure of an inactivation process that was independent of Ca2+ entry. In contrast, in the strongly facilitating mutant 77IQ/2A, fractional recovery ofI Ca proceeded with a strikingly biphasic time course, rising to a peak of 1.4 at an interval of 0.1 s before returning much more slowly back toward 1. The increase above unity is yet another expression of the facilitation process; here, the added kinetic information is that facilitation is much slower to subside than inactivation. In the case of 77FRK/3A, there is only a small overshoot above 1.0 and a much faster decay (Fig. 3 A), whereas mutant 77I/A showed facilitation and decay rates between those of 77IQ/2A and 77FRK/3A (data not shown). Evidently, the extent of facilitation and the kinetics of its decay are both affected by the various alanine replacements. The observations with mutant channels provide a useful perspective for interpreting the results with the wild-type channel itself. Fractional recovery of 77wt currents never exceeded unity with either Ca2+ or Ba2+ as charge carrier. At interval times shorter than ∼0.05 s, the fractional recovery ofI Ca fell short of that ofI Ba, as expected for Ca2+-dependent inactivation. However, recovery of I Ca clearly exceeded that ofI Ba at times longer than ∼0.05 s. The difference was sustained over the 0.5-s interval examined in these experiments, although by definition, it must have decayed to zero at even longer intervals that allowed restoration of the resting state. For 77wt, the maximal difference in fractional recovery ofI Ca versus I Bawas >0.2 (Fig. 3 B), typical of the single alanine mutants listed in Fig. 1 A. These differences are expressions of an underlying facilitatory process present in almost all alanine constructs, 77IQFRK/5A being the notable exception. Although the facilitation is not generally overt, it was readily uncovered by examination of differences in fractional recovery. Could the differential effects of recovery from inactivation betweenI Ca and I Ba in 77wt simply be explained by differences in the abilities of the two divalent ions to screen surface charges (33.Frankenhaeuser B. Hodgkin A.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1957; 137: 218-244Crossref Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 34.Hille B. Woodhull A.M. Shapiro B.I. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1975; 270: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar)? This is unlikely because with conventional two-pulse protocols (prepulse durations of 2 s), the isochronic inactivation curve of I Ba was shifted to more positive potentials than that of I Ca, with half-maximal inactivation voltages for I Baand I Ca of −6.1 and −15.2 mV, respectively (24.Zühlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The difference in midpoint voltages of inactivation was opposite to what would be required to explain the faster recovery ofI Ca relative to I Ba. The preceding survey of the effects of alanine replacement at several positions along the IQ motif pointed to Ile1624, the first position of the IQ motif, as the most important residue among those studied. Relative to other individual alanine replacements, I1624A had a particularly strong effect on Ca2+-dependent inactivation (Fig.1 C) and, probably not coincidentally, revealed the greatest amount of facilitation with pulse"

Here we report the purification of these additional components of the apoB mRNA editing enzyme-complex from rat liver and the cDNA cloning of the novel APOBEC-1-stimulating protein (ASP). Two proteins copurified into the final active fraction and were characterized by peptide sequencing and mass spectrometry: KSRP, a 75-kDa protein originally described as a splicing regulating factor, and ASP, a hitherto unknown 65-kDa protein. Separation of these two proteins resulted in a reduction of APOBEC-1-stimulating activity. ASP represents a novel type of RNA-binding protein and contains three single-stranded RNA-binding domains in the amino-terminal half and a putative double-stranded RNA-binding domain at the carboxyl terminus. Purified recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ASP, but not recombinant GST-KSRP, stimulated recombinant GST-APOBEC-1 to edit apoB RNA in vitro. These data demonstrate that ASP is the second essential component of the apoB mRNA editing enzyme-complex. In rat liver, ASP is apparently associated with KSRP, which may confer stability to the editing enzyme-complex with its substrate apoB RNA serving as an additional auxiliary component.

In humans and many other mammalian species, the apoB mRNA is extensively edited in the small intestine, but remains unedited in the liver (3.Greeve J. Altkemper I. Dieterich J.-D. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1367-1384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, the liver secretes apoB-100 containing very low density lipoproteins, which, in the blood, are metabolized into the highly atherogenic low density lipoproteins (LDLs)1 (4.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar). In contrast, the small intestine synthesizes apoB-48 containing chylomicrons that are rapidly metabolized and do not serve as precursors for LDL formation (5.Kane J.P. Annu. Rev.

Some animals such as horses, dogs, rats, and mice do edit the apoB mRNA also in the liver and consequently have very low plasma LDL levels (3.Greeve J. Altkemper I. Dieterich J.-D. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1367-1384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, editing of the apoB mRNA is a decisive genetic regulation for the formation of atherogenic lipoproteins.ApoB mRNA editing is an intranuclear event that occurs post-transcriptionally coincident with splicing and polyadenylation (7.Lau P.P.

An 11-nucleotide “mooring” motif downstream of the editing site from nucleotides 6671 to 6681 is absolutely required for the editing reaction (13.Shah R.R. Knott T.J. Legros J.E. Navaratnam N.

Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of APOBEC-1 reconstitutes apoB mRNA editing in rabbit liver and results in drastic reduction of elevated LDL levels in LDL receptor-deficient Watanabe-heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, thus demonstrating the physiological power of apoB mRNA editing (20.Greeve J.

Besides this transcriptional regulation, the other components of the apoB mRNA editing enzyme-complex most probably have a pivotal role in the control of mRNA editing.Various approaches have been undertaken to further characterize these additional components. The purification of the apoB mRNA editing holoenzyme proved to be very difficult due to its delicate structure and low abundance (8.Greeve J. Navaratnam N. Scott J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3569-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10.Garcia Z.C. Poksay K.S. Boström K. Johnson D.F. Balestra M.E. Shechter I. Innerarity T.L. Arterioscler.

The APOBEC-1-stimulating factors are present in many tissues and organs that either lack APOBEC-1 or apoB (16.Yamanaka S. Poksay K.S. Balestra M.E. Zheng G.Q. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol.

This suggested that these factors may have other functions in addition to their role in apoB mRNA editing. Two proteins with molecular masses of 60 and 43 kDa were found, using UV cross-linking, to specifically bind to apoB RNA in rat enterocyte extracts (29.Navaratnam N. Shah R. Patel D. Fay V. Scott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In rat hepatoma extracts, a 66- and a 44-kDa protein cross-linked specifically to apoB RNA and cofractionated with high molecular mass editosomes in sedimentation and native gel shift analyses (30.Harris S.G. Sabio I. Mayer E. Steinberg M.F. Backus J.W. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7382-7392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins were later partially purified using APOBEC-1 affinity chromatography and had APOBEC-1-stimulating activity (31.Yang Y. Yang Y. Kovalsky K. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27700-27706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies identified a 240-kDa protein that appeared to confer APOBEC-1-stimulating activity (32.Schocks D. Kuo S.-R. Steinburg M.F. Bolognino M. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mehta et al.(33.Mehta A. Banerjee S. Driscoll D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28294-28299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported in 1996 the partial purification of a 65-kDa protein from baboon kidney using APOBEC-1 affinity chromatography. In 1998, Mehta and Driscoll (34.Mehta A. Driscoll D.M Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4426-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) purified this 65-kDa protein from baboon kidney to homogeneity using apoB RNA affinity chromatography and demonstrated that this protein strongly stimulated APOBEC-1 to edit apoB RNAin vitro. Another APOBEC-1-interacting protein, designated ABBP-1 (APOBEC-1-bindingprotein 1), was identified by two-hybrid selection in yeast (35.Lau P.P. Zhu H.-J. Nakamuta M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1452-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). ABBP-1 is a splice variant of human hnRNP A/B protein that can also bind apoB RNA, but its importance for apoB mRNA editing remains to be conclusively confirmed (35.Lau P.P. Zhu H.-J. Nakamuta M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1452-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We also performed two-hybrid selection with APOBEC-1 as a bait and isolated hnRNP C1 protein as an APOBEC-1-binding protein (36.Greeve J. Lellek H. Rautenberg P. Greten H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, hnRNP C1 is a very potent inhibitor of APOBEC-1-mediated mRNA editing rather than an APOBEC-1-stimulating protein (36.Greeve J. Lellek H. Rautenberg P. Greten H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).In this investigation, we purified the APOBEC-1-stimulating proteins from rat liver nuclei to homogeneity using ssDNA affinity chromatography and identified two proteins with molecular masses of 75 and 65 kDa that could not be further separated without reducing the activity. The 75-kDa protein was identified as the mRNA-binding protein KSRP (K homology-type splicingregulatory protein), recently described as a splicing regulating protein (37.Min H. Turck C.W. Nikolic J.M. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). KSRP alone does not stimulate APOBEC-1. The 65-kDa protein, a hitherto unknown protein, was cloned and designated APOBEC-1-stimulating protein (ASP). ASP has three RNA-binding domains with homologies to poly(A)-binding proteins. Recombinant ASP complements recombinant APOBEC-1 to edit apoB RNAin vitro. Therefore, APOBEC-1 and ASP represent the minimal requirements for apoB mRNA editing in vitro.DISCUSSIONEditing of the apoB mRNA is mediated by APOBEC-1 in conjunction with other proteins that are absolutely required for editing, but so far have not been conclusively characterized. In this study, we purified the APOBEC-1-stimulating factors from rat liver to homogeneity and identified two proteins with molecular masses of 75 and 65 kDa that could not be separated without reducing activity. Peptide sequencing identified the prominent 75-kDa protein as KSRP, an RNA-binding protein with four K homology RNA-binding domains that was originally described as a constituent of a protein complex assembled on an intronic splicing enhancer element of c-src in the brain (37.Min H. Turck C.W. Nikolic J.M. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Native purified KSRP alone, however, did not confer APOBEC-1-stimulating activity. The 65-kDa protein is a hitherto unknown protein and was therefore designated APOBEC-1-stimulating protein. The full-length cDNA of ASP was isolated by polymerase chain reaction using information obtained from EST data base searching with ASP peptide sequences. Recombinant ASP stimulated recombinant APOBEC-1 to edit apoB RNA in vitro. Therefore, we conclude that ASP is the second essential component of the apoB mRNA-editing enzyme beside the catalytic subunit APOBEC-1 for editing activity in vitro. In rat liver, ASP is apparently associated with the RNA-binding protein KSRP, which binds to apoB RNA and may confer further stability to the editing enzyme complex with its substrate apoB RNA.In rat liver nuclear extracts, the APOBEC-1-stimulating proteins are present in excess over APOBEC-1 and can be separated from the apoB mRNA editing holoenzyme by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Purification of ASP on ssDNA-cellulose was made possible by the observation that the editing-stimulating activity bound to this matrix after digestion with micrococcal nuclease. The 0.3 m NaCl elution fraction from this column exhibited strong APOBEC-1-stimulating activity and contained only three major proteins. The APOBEC-1-stimulating activity eluted from gel filtration columns in a high molecular mass range. Only two proteins, KSRP and ASP, were detected in these fractions, and the more abundant KSRP cross-linked much more strongly to apoB RNA than did ASP. Gel filtration in 0.5m NaCl separated these two proteins and resulted in a reduction of editing activity that shifted into a lower molecular mass range. Concomitantly, cross-linking of KSRP to apoB RNA was reduced after gel filtration in 0.5 m NaCl. This indicated binding of KSRP and ASP to apoB RNA in a cooperative fashion and a cooperative effect of both proteins on the stimulation of APOBEC-1. Furthermore, coexpression of APOBEC-1 and KSRP in yeast did not stimulate apoB mRNA editing. 2R. Kirsten, S. Welker, and J. Greeve, unpublished data. Native KSRP alone that had been separated from the 65-kDa protein did not complement APOBEC-1 to edit apoB RNA. The first hint that the 65-kDa protein might be the APOBEC-1-stimulating protein came from UV cross-linking experiments with 32P-labeled apoB RNA in the presence of unlabeled β-actin RNA. UV cross-linking to the 65-kDa protein was not competed even by a 100-fold excess of β-actin RNA. In contrast, UV cross-linking to KSRP was strongly decreased in the presence of a 100-fold excess of β-actin RNA. Residual APOBEC-1-stimulating activity in fractions 27–29 obtained by gel filtration in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl further indicated that the 65-kDa protein is the APOBEC-1-stimulating factor.Peptide sequences of the 65-kDa protein did not match any known protein. We cloned the cDNA of this protein from both human liver and human small intestine. According to its function, we designated this protein APOBEC-1-stimulating protein. The liver-derived cDNA contained an in-frame insertion of 24 nucleotides that most probably results from alternate splicing. Otherwise, the cDNA sequence of ASP was identical in the liver and intestine and confirmed the sequences of the ESTs we had analyzed. The expression of ASP in the kidney that does not express apoB or APOBEC-1 suggests a more general role of ASP in mRNA processing and possibly editing and argues against a restricted function of ASP only in apoB mRNA editing. In 1998, a 65-kDa protein that induced APOBEC-1 to edit apoB RNA in vitro was purified from baboon kidney by apoB RNA affinity purification (34.Mehta A. Driscoll D.M Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4426-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ASP may be similar or even identical to this protein, although this remains to be proven.ASP contains three RBDs in the amino-terminal half that are not identical. The observed homology of these RBDs to poly(A)-binding proteins is remarkable (47.Burd C.G. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 48.Belostotsky D.A. Meagher R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cell. 1999; 98: 835-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Not only is the human intestinal apoB mRNA edited from C to U at nucleotide 6666, but approximately half of the transcripts are also cleaved and polyadenylated prematurely immediately downstream of C6666 (2.Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Pease R.J. Edwards Y.H. Knott T.J. Scott J. Cell. 1987; 50: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has long been assumed that apoB mRNA editing activates cryptic polyadenylation signals (2.Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Pease R.J. Edwards Y.H. Knott T.J. Scott J. Cell. 1987; 50: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The homology of ASP to poly(A)-binding proteins could indicate a physical link of apoB mRNA editing with 3′-end formation. Several recent observations have led to the assumption that transcription, capping, splicing, and polyadenylation as well as RNA export may be coupled processes with intimate interrelations (52.Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 53.Bently D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 54.Barabino S.M.L. Keller W. Cell. 1999; 99: 9-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). APOBEC-1-mediated mRNA editing could well be another polishing within this “RNA factory” (54.Barabino S.M.L. Keller W. Cell. 1999; 99: 9-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Most poly(A)-binding proteins, however, are localized in the cytoplasm and regulate mRNA stability and translation (55.Craig A.W. Haghighat A., Yu, A.T. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1998; 392: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 56.Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 57.Otero L.J. Ashe M.P. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3153-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The nuclear localized poly(A)-binding protein II involved in 3′-end formation of mRNA differs from these proteins and ASP (58.Wahle E. Cell. 1991; 66: 759-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 59.Nemeth A. Krause S. Blank D. Jenny A. Jeno P. Lustig A. Wahle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The copurification of KSRP and ASP suggests that ASP might be associated with KSRP in vivo, although this remains to be firmly established. KSRP has been described in a high molecular mass complex together with hnRNPs F and H and is thought to regulate the alternate splicing of c-src in the brain (37.Min H. Turck C.W. Nikolic J.M. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 45.Chou M.-Y. Rooke N. Turck C.W. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The four K homology RNA-binding domains confer the high affinity RNA binding of KSRP. The strong cross-linking of KSRP to apoB RNA demands more detailed studies of the topology and sequence specificity of this binding. According to the data presented, it is reasonable to assume that KSRP is another auxiliary protein for APOBEC-1, but not an essential component for editing in vitro.Another remarkable feature of ASP appears to be the putative double-stranded RBD in the carboxyl-terminal half. The existence of both RBD and double-stranded RBD is not common for RNA-binding proteins. Native ASP did not bind very strongly to apoB RNA. This was apparently not dependent on the apoB RNA used in these assays since an apoB RNA of 430 nucleotides did not cross-link better than an apoB RNA of 55 nucleotides. The weak cross-linking of ASP may be explained by the presence of KSRP in our fractions. Two recent studies re-examined the secondary RNA structure requirements for efficient editing at C6666 (60.Richardson N. Navaratnam N. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31707-31717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 61.Hersberger M. Patarroyo-White S. Arnold K.S. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34590-34597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both studies concluded that C6666 is located at a junction between a double-stranded and a single-stranded RNA region. This junction was localized either at the loop of a hairpin (60.Richardson N. Navaratnam N. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31707-31717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or at the beginning of a double-stranded stem formed by the mooring sequence (nucleotides 6671–6681) and a 3′-efficiency element (nucleotides 6718–6746) (61.Hersberger M. Patarroyo-White S. Arnold K.S. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34590-34597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A protein that specifically recognizes this junction between a double-stranded and a single-stranded region would fit these models. A/I editing, the second well described mode for editing of nuclear encoded transcripts besides the C/U editing mediated by APOBEC-1, specifically occurs in double-stranded RNA (62.Higuchi M.

The responsible ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting onRNA) contain three double-stranded RNA-binding R motifs (64.Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11457-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 65.O'Connell M.A. Krause S. Higuchi M. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Jenny A. Keller W. Mol. Cell.

An evolutionary link between cytidine deaminases and ADARs is suggested by sequence homologies in the deaminase domain of these enzymes found even in bacteria, yeast, and Caenorhabditis elegans (67.Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, it is very attractive to speculate that ASP may provide the recognition motif for double-stranded RNA in APOBEC-1-mediated C/U editing.In summary, we have purified ASP, a novel APOBEC-1-stimulating protein, from rat liver and have cloned its cDNA. APOBEC-1 plus ASP represent the minimal apoB mRNA editing enzyme in vitro. In rat liver, ASP appears to be associated with the mRNA-binding protein KSRP. The cloning of ASP leads to many new questions regarding apoB mRNA editing, some of which (such as the precise interaction of ASP with APOBEC-1, KSRP, and apoB RNA) will be the focus of our next investigations. Editing of the mRNA of apoB at nucleotide 6666 from C to U creates a premature stop translation codon that leads to the synthesis of the carboxyl-terminal truncated apoB-48 (1.Chen S.-H. Habib G. Yang C.Y. Gu Z.W. Lee B.R. Weng S.A. Silbermann S.R. Cai S.J. Deslypere J.P. Rosseneu M. Gotto A.M. Li W.H. Chan L.

Cell. 1987; 50: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). In humans and many other mammalian species, the apoB mRNA is extensively edited in the small intestine, but remains unedited in the liver (3.Greeve J. Altkemper I. Dieterich J.-D. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1367-1384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, the liver secretes apoB-100 containing very low density lipoproteins, which, in the blood, are metabolized into the highly atherogenic low density lipoproteins (LDLs)1 (4.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar). In contrast, the small intestine synthesizes apoB-48 containing chylomicrons that are rapidly metabolized and do not serve as precursors for LDL formation (5.Kane J.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1983; 45: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 6.Innerarity T.L. Boren J. Yamanaka S. Olofson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2353-2356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Some animals such as horses, dogs, rats, and mice do edit the apoB mRNA also in the liver and consequently have very low plasma LDL levels (3.Greeve J. Altkemper I. Dieterich J.-D. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1367-1384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, editing of the apoB mRNA is a decisive genetic regulation for the formation of atherogenic lipoproteins. ApoB mRNA editing is an intranuclear event that occurs post-transcriptionally coincident with splicing and polyadenylation (7.Lau P.P. Xiong W. Zhu H.-J. Chen S.-H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20550-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Editing of apoB mRNA is mediated by a multicomponent enzyme complex termed the apoB mRNA editing enzyme (8.Greeve J.

In vivo, free, inactive V1 and Vo sectors exist in dynamic equilibrium with fully assembled, active V1 Vo complexes, and this equilibrium can be perturbed by changes in carbon source. Free V1 complexes were isolated from the cytosol of wild-type yeast cells and mutant strains lacking Vo subunit c (Vma3p) or V1 subunit H (Vma13p).

These V1 complexes hydrolyzed CaATP but not MgATP, and CaATP hydrolysis rapidly decelerated with time.

V-ATPases maintain organelle acidification and affect cytosolic pH and ion balance, and their activity has been linked to a diverse array of cellular processes ranging from zymogen activation to protein sorting to viral membrane fusion events (1.Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 2.Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). V-ATPases are comprised of two structural domains, the V1domain, which consists of a complex of peripheral subunits containing the nucleotide-binding sites attached to the cytoplasmic face of membrane, and the Vo domain, which is comprised of several integral membrane and tightly associated peripheral proteins that contain the proton pore (1.Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 2.Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The yeast V-ATPase has at least eight V1 subunits (designated A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H) and five Vo subunits (designated a, c, c′, c“, and d) (1.Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical approaches have converged to show that all of the subunits are required for function of V1Vo complexes (3.Kane P.M. J. Bioenerg.

Other eukaryotic V-ATPases have very similar subunit compositions. Functional interdependence of V1 and Vo has been clearly established. Only fully assembled V1Vo complexes can couple ATP hydrolysis to H+ translocation, and in vitro experiments indicate that upon V1 dissociation, the Vodomain does not conduct protons and the V1 domain does not perform MgATP hydrolysis (5.Moriyama Y.

Nevertheless, many different cells have been shown to contain free V1 and free Vosectors in addition to fully assembled V1Vocomplexes (9.Myers M. Forgac M. J. Cell.

Independent experiments in yeast and Manduca sexta have indicated that the disassembled V1 and Vo sectors exist in a dynamic equilibrium with fully assembled complexes and that this equilibrium can be shifted in response to changes in extracellular conditions (10.Sumner J.-P.

Starvation appears to stimulate disassembly of V1 from Vo, but this disassembly is fully reversible upon refeeding (13.Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Graf R. Harvey W., R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol.

This reversible association between V1 and Vo is believed to regulate V-ATPase function in vivo: disassembly of V-ATPase complexes may conserve ATP when energy reserves are low and reassembly of the enzyme may provide the renewed proton pumping capacity necessary to prevent cytosolic acidification when active metabolism resumes (16.Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Wieczorek H. Gruber G. Harvey W.R. Huss M. Merzendorfer H. Zeiske W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A constitutively active free V1 in the cytosol could quickly become lethal to the cell by hydrolyzing cytosolic reserves of ATP. Graf et al. (14.Graf R. Harvey W., R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20908-20913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have isolated cytosolic V1complexes from M. sexta and shown that these complexes exhibit Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis at nonphysiological Ca2+ concentrations but hydrolyze MgATP only in the presence of methanol. The properties of V1complexes have also been examined by reconstitution of expressed subunits and biochemically isolated subcomplexes of the bovine clathrin-coated vesicle ATPase (18.Xie X-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9859-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Peng S-B. Stone D.K. Xie X-S. J. Biol.

These studies have also revealed a shift from Mg2+-dependent to Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity in V1 complexes detached from the membrane subunits and have suggested that CaATPase activity is a partial reaction characteristic of dissociated V1 sectors that is functionally related to the MgATPase activity of the fully assembled proton pump (18.Xie X-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9859-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to gain more insight into the cellular mechanisms of V1-ATPase silencing, we have purified and characterized native yeast cytosolic V1 complexes. Cytosolic V1 were isolated from wild-type cells and from twovma mutant strains. We found that V1 subunit C was not present in any of the isolated complexes. All of the isolated V1 complexes hydrolyzed ATP in the presence Ca2+, but only V1 complexes lacking subunit H had MgATPase activity. The current study also indicates that product inhibition of ATPase activity may occur in cytosolic V1complexes but cannot fully account for the inactivation of these complexes. In addition, structural changes within the V1complex itself, such as lost of an activator subunit (C subunit) and presence of at least one inhibitory subunit (H subunit) may be critical for silencing the MgATPase activity in vivo. Zymolyase 100T was purchased from ICN. Concanamycin A was obtained from Wako Biochemicals. Prestained molecular mass markers (high range) were obtained from Life Technologies. ATP bioluminescence assay kit HS II and anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The wild-type yeast strain used in these experiments was SF838-1D (MATα ade6 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 pep4-3 gal2(22.Stevens T.H. Rothman J.H. Payne G.S. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar)). The vma3Δ strain was congenic with the wild-type strain except for the vma3Δ::URA3mutation (23.Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A congenic vma13Δ strain was constructed by excising a BamHI-SacII fragment containing thevma13Δ::LEU2 allele from the deletion plasmid described below, and integrating into the VMA13locus by a one-step gene disruption (24.Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). Replacement of the wild-type allele by the deletion allele was confirmed by PCR of chromosomal DNA prepared from yeast cells. VMA13 in pRS315 was a gift from R. Hirata. VMA13 was tagged with the Myc epitope immediately following the methionine start codon by employing PCR and subcloning techniques. Two separate PCR reactions were performed usingVMA13 as a template. Reaction A utilized primer 1: 5′-AGAAATAAGCTTTGTTCCATTGTTCCTGAAATCGC, and primer 2: 5′-GACGAAGGAATTTGAAAGAG, this reaction generated a 564-base product that encompassed 546 5′-untranslated region bases and 18 5′ bases of the Myc epitope including the HindIII site that is found within the Myc sequence. Reaction B utilized primer 3: 5′-CAAAGCTTATTTCTGAAAGACTTGGGAGCACGAAGATATT and primer 4: 5′-GATCACGCATAACC generating a 1912-base product which contained 27 bases of the Myc epitope including the HindIII site, 1433 bases of VMA13 open reading frame, and 452 bases of 3′-untranslated region. PCR products were ligated into pCR2.1TM (Invitrogen). Orientation of products was determined based on restriction digests. Reaction A was subcloned into pRS316 using BamHI and HindIII sites, Reaction B product was subcloned into the newly constructed pRS316 vector containing the Reaction A product using KpnI andHindIII sites. Sequencing confirmed the presence of the Myc epitope within wild-type VMA13. N-Myc VMA13 is able to complement the growth phenotypes of a vma13Δstrain, and vacuolar vesicles isolated from this strain possess 80% wild type ATPase activity. 2K. L. Keenan and P. M. Kane, manuscript in preparation. VMA13 was cloned into the yeast shuttle vector pRS316 at theBamHI and NotI sites. A deletion plasmid was constructed by replacing the 1084-base pair BglII fragment within the ORF of VMA13 with a 2.2-kilobase Leu2 fragment. Cells were grown overnight to mid-log phase (3A 600/ml) in YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) medium adjusted to pH 5. 6000A 600 units of cells (approximately 6 × 1010 cells) were harvested by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 300 ml of 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, containing 10 mmdithiothreitol. Cells were rocked for 5 min at 30 °C, pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 2200 × g, and the pellet resuspended in 300 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.2m sorbitol, 2% glucose. Cells were converted to spheroplasts by adding 1500 units of zymolase 100T to the suspension and gently shaking at 30 °C for 20 min. Spheroplasts were washed twice with 300 ml of YEPD medium containing 1.2 m sorbitol. In certain experiments, spheroplasts were briefly deprived of glucose by incubating 5 min at 30 °C in 200 ml of YEP (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) plus 1.2 m sorbitol. Otherwise, incubation was performed in 200 ml of YEPD plus 1.2 m sorbitol. Finally, spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation and lysed on ice in 15 ml of buffer A (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mmNaCl, 30 mm KCl, 0.3 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) in a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenate was centrifuged at 275,000 × g for 1.25 h in a Ti-75 rotor and the supernatant (15–20 mg of protein/ml) precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate. Precipitation was performed by dropwise addition of a cold saturated solution of ammonium sulfate, pH 7, in three steps of 0–20, 20–35, and 35–50% (v/v) with 15 min incubation between additions and constant stirring on ice. After the final addition, the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and the protein pelleted at 9,000 ×g for 11 min. The precipitated protein was resuspended in buffer A and desalted on a Centricon Plus-20 filter (100,000 dalton cutoff; Amicon), then filtered and applied to a Mono-Q2 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in buffer A containing 9.6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer and the bound protein eluted with three sequential linear gradients: 5 ml of 0–30% buffer B (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.2 m KCl, 0.3 mmEDTA, 9.6 mm β-mercaptoethanol) followed by a 20-ml isocratic flow of 70% buffer A, 30% buffer B, 6 ml of 30–40% buffer B followed by a 20-ml isocratic flow in 60% buffer A, 40% buffer B, and 5 ml of 40–100% buffer B followed by a 5-ml isocratic flow in 100% buffer B. 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were analyzed for the presence of V1 subunits by Western blotting, and fractions containing V1 subunits were immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions with monoclonal antibodies 8B1 or 13D11 (against the 69- and 60-kDa V1 subunits, respectively) to identify those containing V1 complexes (11.Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing V1 complexes (fractions 43–54) eluted at 40% buffer B (0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m KCl) and were pooled and concentrated on a Centricon Plus-20 filter (100,000 dalton cut-off). Pooled Q-2 fractions were applied to a Bio-Rad Sec 400 gel filtration column equilibrated with 30% buffer A, 70% buffer B. Purified V1 complexes (0.05–0.5 mg) were collected in a single fraction. Chromatography was performed on a Bio-Rad BioLogic system. Hydrolysis of ATP quantitated colorimetrically as the phosphate released based on the Taussky and Schorr method (25.Taussky H.H. Schorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction was started by addition of 1.5–15 μg of purified V1 to 500 μl of ATPase assay medium (0.05 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 4 mm ATP or GTP and 1.6 mm CaCl2 or MgCl2). The final metal-nucleotide complex concentration in the medium was calculated for each condition by the Bound and Determined computer program (26.Brooks S.P.J. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Incubations were performed at 37 °C for the indicated times (0.5–30 min). Reactions were stopped by addition of an equal volume of 10% (w/v) SDS. Phosphate released was determined by measuring the absorbance at 700 nm immediately after addition of 0.5 ml of Taussky and Schorr reagent (10% FeSO4, 1.2 n sulfuric acid, 1.2% ammonium molybdate). A blank containing only assay medium was measured for each reaction. A standard calibration curve for Pi was used to calculate the micromoles of Pi formed. Data were analyzed using the Sigma Plot curve-fitting application program. The amount of ATP and ADP bound to the purified V1preparation was determined as follows. V1 (20–60 μg) was precipitated by addition of perchloric acid to a final concentration of 0.44 m, and after 15 min on ice, the mixture was neutralized by addition of equal volume of ice-cold fresh 0.8m potassium bicarbonate, then incubated for an additional 20 min on ice. Soluble nucleotides were recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation. ATP and ADP concentrations were measured using the luciferin-luciferase assay in an Autolunat LB953 luminometer. ADP was converted to ATP by addition of 8.3 mmphosphoenolpyruvate and 48 μg of pyruvate kinase in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, and 20 mm KCl. Protein concentrations were determined by Lowry assay (27.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.J. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to better understand how cytosolic V1 sectors are inactivated and possibly to gain insights into how V1dissociation is triggered, we isolated and characterized cytosolic V1 sectors from yeast. Cytosolic V1 complexes from wild-type yeast cells and vma3Δ mutant cells, treated both with and without a brief glucose deprivation, were purified by a variation of the methods reported by Graf et al. (14.Graf R. Harvey W., R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20908-20913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, the population of V1 complexes in the cytosol was increased by depriving the cells of glucose for 5 min. This treatment has been shown to trigger dissociation of approximately 75% of assembled V1Vo complexes (13.Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and provided an alternative source of V1. vma3Δ mutants do not form stable Vo sectors, but assemble stable V1 complexes constitutively present in the cytosol (11.Doherty R.D.

The purification procedure consisted of four fractionation steps and yielded ∼0.05–0.1 and ∼0.4–0.5 mg of V1 from 2 liters of log-phase culture of wild-type and vma3Δ cells, respectively. Glucose deprivation improved the yield of V1sectors from wild-type cells, but did not significantly affect the yield of V1 sectors from the vma3Δ cells. Briefly, the purification consisted of isolation of a soluble fraction by high speed centrifugation, followed by protein precipitation with 50% ammonium sulfate and two sequential chromatographic columns: ion exchange on a Mono-Q column and gel filtration on a Biosilect Sec-400 column. Fig. 1 A shows the protein elution profile from the ion exchange column, and Fig.1 B is a Western blot analysis of the elution pattern of A, B, and C V1 subunits. The C subunit failed to bind to the column even at the lowest salt concentration and fractionated away from the rest of the cytosolic V1 subunits. Because the A and B subunits were detected throughout the gradient, we assessed whether they were assembled with other subunits by nondenaturing immunoprecipitation of selected pooled fractions (not shown). Assembled V1 complexes were present only in fractions eluted with 0.2m salts (0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m KCl); A and B subunits that eluted elsewhere from the column were either partially or fully dissociated from the remaining V1subunits. The assembled V1 complexes eluted from the Mono-Q column (Fig. 1 B, fractions 43–54) were concentrated and subjected to gel filtration chromatography. The elution profile for the gel filtration column is shown in Fig. 1 C. The V1 complexes eluted in a single peak (Fig. 1 D) with an estimated molecular mass of 445 kDa. Purified V1 complexes from wild-type and vma3Δcells, either with or without glucose deprivation, showed a similar subunit composition. The presence of the 27-kDa E subunit in the V1 complexes was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig.1 D). Silver staining of the peak eluted from gel filtration column (Fig. 2) showed additional bands of 32, 16, and 14 kDa that correspond in molecular mass to the previously identified D, G, and F subunits, respectively (4.Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the V1 complexes obtained from both strains contained the A, B, D, E, F, and G V1 subunits (Figs. 1 D and 2). Both the E and G subunit had a somewhat smeared appearance in the V1 preparations. In addition to the previously characterized V1 subunits, bands of approximately 25 and 80 kDa and several high molecular mass bands were consistently present in the fractions containing the V1complexes. We have not yet determined whether these proteins are associated with cytosolic V1 complexes. We were particularly interested in determining whether the H subunit, encoded by the VMA13 gene in yeast (29.Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was associated with the cytosolic V1 complexes. This protein has a molecular mass of 54 kDa and is often masked by the 60-kDa subunit, so theVMA13 gene was tagged with a Myc epitope to allow it to be clearly identified. The tagged protein was expressed in avma13Δ yeast strain and shown to fully complement the growth defects of the strain. Co-purification of subunit H with cytosolic V1 complexes was confirmed using anti-Myc antibodies against V1 complexes purified fromvma13Δ cells expressing the Myc-tagged VMA13gene (Fig. 3). Therefore, the cytosolic V1 sectors appear to contain all the previously characterized V1 subunits except subunit C. The isolated V1 domain of the M. sexta V-ATPase is not active as a MgATPase except in the presence of organic solvents (14.Graf R. Harvey W., R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20908-20913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similarly, the isolated yeast V1 complexes did not hydrolyze ATP if the divalent cation supplied was Mg2+. In an attempt to activate the yeast V1 ATPase activity, the purified V1 was treated with 25% methanol, 30 mm octylglucoside, 5–50 mm sodium sulfite, 0.5%N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide, and 5–10 mm dithiothreitol, treatments which had effectively activated the MgATPase activity of the ManducaV1 (14.Graf R.

None of these treatments elicited any MgATPase activity in the yeast V1 complexes. Cytosolic V1 complexes from both wild-type andvma3Δ cells did hydrolyze ATP in a Ca2+-dependent manner at nonphysiological (mm) Ca2+ concentrations, however. CaATPase activity has been described in purified V1 complexes fromM. sexta (14.Graf R. Harvey W., R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol.

The enzymatic properties of complexes purified from glucose-deprived wild-type cells or vma3Δ cells with or without glucose deprivation were very similar. Because vma3Δ cells provided a more abundant source of cytosolic V1 than wild-type cells, the kinetic analysis described below was performed on cytosolic V1complexes isolated from vma3Δ mutant cells. CaATP hydrolysis was first examined as a function of the time at a constant CaATP concentration (1.4 mm). When the incubation time was varied from 0.5 to 20 min, the plot of micromole of Pi formed versus time had a hyperbolic shape showing a rapid initial rate that decayed until there was little further ATP hydrolysis after 3 min (Fig.4 A). The initial activity, detected at 1 min, was 1.7 μmol of Pi/min/mg. At a lower CaATP concentration (0.3 mm), it took longer for the activity to decay, but the activity was gone by 20 min. An apparentK m of 0.183 mm for CaATP, which is similar to the K m of yeast V1Vo (0.210 mm; Ref. 34.Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was estimated from 1-min reactions performed at a larger range of concentrations. Based on this information, 1.4 mm CaATP should nearly saturate the enzyme, and the loss of activity over time seen in Fig. 4 A cannot be attributed to substrate depletion. The substrate specificity of the yeast V1 complexes was examined. Ca2+-dependent hydrolysis of GTP was observed (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, CaGTP hydrolysis was linear for at least 20 min under conditions where ATP hydrolysis had ceased after 3 min. The V1 complexes exhibited a specific activity for GTP hydrolysis of 0.47 μmol/min/mg of protein. Once again the hydrolysis was Ca2+-dependent; Mg2+ did not support any GTPase activity in the cytosolic V1 complexes. Loss of activity over time could be an indication of product inhibition of the ATPase activity. Product inhibition has been studied in considerable detail in F1-ATPases, and appears to be specific to ADP in many cases (35.Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36.Hyndman D.J. Milgrom Y.M. Bramhall E.A. Cross R.L. J. Biol.

Thus, although GTP is a substrate for F1, GDP is much less efficient in product inhibition (36.Hyndman D.J. Milgrom Y.M. Bramhall E.A. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28871-28877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further explore the possibility that the ATPase activity of the cytosolic V1 complexes was inhibited by ADP, V1 complexes were preincubated in the presence of CaADP before measurement of the CaATPase activity. Isolated V1 complexes were preincubated with 1.1 mmCaADP for 1 min, then the V1-CaADP mixture was diluted 30-fold into assay medium and the CaATPase activity measured in the presence of 1.4 mm CaATP (Fig. 4 A). The CaATPase activity of the V1 complexes was not fully inhibited by CaADP preincubation. The initial ATPase activity was 51% that in the absence of ADP, and a decay in ATPase activi"
https://openalex.org/W2083683366,"Membrane transporters of the adenine nucleotide binding cassette (ABC) superfamily utilize two either identical or homologous nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Although the hydrolysis of ATP by these domains is believed to drive transport of solute, it is unknown why two rather than a single NBD is required. In the well studied P-glycoprotein multidrug transporter, the two appear to be functionally equivalent, and a strongly supported model proposes that ATP hydrolysis occurs alternately at each NBD (Senior, A. E., al-Shawi, M. K., and Urbatsch, I. L. (1995) FEBS Lett 377, 285–289). To assess how applicable this model may be to other ABC transporters, we have examined adenine nucleotide interactions with the multidrug resistance protein, MRP1, a member of a different ABC family that transports conjugated organic anions and in which sequences of the two NBDs are much less similar than in P-glycoprotein. Photoaffinity labeling experiments with 8-azido-ATP, which strongly supports transport revealed ATP binding exclusively at NBD1 and ADP trapping predominantly at NBD2. Despite this apparent asymmetry in the two domains, they are entirely interdependent as substitution of key lysine residues in the Walker A motif of either impaired both ATP binding and ADP trapping. Furthermore, the interaction of ADP at NBD2 appears to allosterically enhance the binding of ATP at NBD1. Glutathione, which supports drug transport by the protein, does not enhance ATP binding but stimulates the trapping of ADP. Thus MRP1 may employ a more complex mechanism of coupling ATP utilization to the export of agents from cells than P-glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2056088021,"Using an expression cloning strategy, the cDNA encoding the human HNK-1 sulfotransferase (HNK-1ST) has been cloned. During this cloning we found that HNK-1ST and other Golgi-associated sulfotransferases cloned before share homologous sequences including the RDP motif (Ong, E., Yeh, J.-C., Ding, Y., Hindsgaul, O., and Fukuda, M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 223, 5190–5195). Using this conserved sequence in HNK-1ST as a probe, we identified two expressed sequence tags in EST data base which have 31.6 and 30.7% identity with HNK-1ST at the amino acid levels. Expression of these two full-length cDNAs failed to form HNK-1 glycan nor to add sulfate to CD34 or NCAM. Surprisingly, proteins expressed by these cDNAs transferred sulfate to the C-4 position ofN-acetylgalactosamine in chondroitin and desulfated dermatan sulfate, thus we named these two enzymes, chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase 1 and -2 (C4ST-1 and C4ST-2). Both C4ST-1 and C4ST-2, however, did not form 4,6-di-O-sulfatedN-acetylgalactosamine when chondroitin sulfate C was used as an acceptor. Moreover, analysis of 35S-labeled dermatan sulfate formed by C4ST-1 indicate that sulfation preferentially took place in GlcA→GalNAc unit than in IdoA→GalNAc unit, suggesting that 4-O-sulfation at N-acetylgalactosamine may precede epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid during dermatan sulfate biosynthesis. Northern analysis demonstrated that the transcript for C4ST-1 is predominantly expressed in peripheral leukocytes and hematopoietic tissues while theC4ST-2 transcript is more widely expressed in various tissues. These results indicate C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 play complementary roles in chondroitin and dermatan sulfate synthesis in different tissues.

Using monoclonal antibodies or isolated carbohydrates, various laboratories reported that HNK-1 glycan is involved in cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions (12.Keihauer G. Faissner A.

In one study, a non-sulfated form of HNK-1 precursor glycan did not facilitate neurite outgrowth as opposed to a functional, intact HNK-1 glycan (13.Mohan P.S. Chou D.K. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 2024-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results, combined together, suggest that HNK-1 glycan plays critical roles in development, in particular during neural cell development.The HNK-1 carbohydrate is synthesized by the addition of a sulfate to β1,3-glucuronylated N-acetyllactosamine, GlcAβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc→R (4.Jungalwala F.B.

Subsequently, it was revealed that this sequence motif is a part of the binding site for 3′-phosphate group of the donor substrate, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) (16.Kakuta Y.

Most recent studies showed that the arginine residue (Arg) in the RDP motif is involved in hydrogen bonding to 3′-phosphate group while aspartic acid (Asp) and proline (Pro) residues participate in the core structure of the 3′-phosphate-binding site by residing in a tight turn of the polypeptides (17.Kakuta Y.

In addition, the amino acid sequences responsible for binding to 5′-phosphosulfate are conserved among different sulfotransferases (17.Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem.

In fact, we and others cloned the cDNA encoding L-selectin ligand sulfotransferases that add a sulfate to the 6-position of N-acetylglucosamine, which is eventually converted to 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X, NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4[sulfo→6(Fucα1→3)GlcNAc]β1→6R (19.Uchimura K.

The expression of full-length cDNAs unexpectedly revealed that these cDNAs encode novel chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferases, adding a sulfate to 4-position of N-acetylgalactosamine residues in chondroitin and desulfated dermatan sulfate. Moreover, we found that these two chondroitin 4-sulfotransferases exhibit diverse tissue distribution, indicating that these two enzymes play complementary roles in different tissues.DISCUSSIONThe present study describes the isolation of novel cDNAs encoding chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase by searching the EST data bases for cDNAs homologous to the human HNK-1ST (14.Ong E. Yeh J.-C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). HNK-1ST adds a sulfate to the 3-position of glucuronic acid, which in turn is attached to the 3-position of galactose inN-acetyllactosamine. C4ST, on the other hand, adds a sulfate to the 4-position of N-acetylgalactosamine, which is in turn attached to the 4-position of glucuronic acid. These results are striking since these two acceptors are rather dissimilar. The β-glucuronyl residue in HNK-1 glycan is at the nonreducing terminal. In contrast, C4ST apparently acts on an already elongated chondroitin chain since no preferential addition to shorter acceptors has been noticed when the products were analyzed by gel filtration (data not shown, see also Ref. 26.Yamauchi S.

The hydroxyl groups in both C-3 of glucuronic acid and C-4 of N-acetylgalactosamine are projected above their respective pyranose rings in their normal conformations (37.Homans S.W. Fukuda M. Hindsgaul O. Molecular Glycobiology. Oxford Unversity Press, Oxford1994: 230-257Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the active sites of both HNK-1ST and C4ST may approach the acceptor from above the plane of GlcAβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→R (for HNK-1ST) and GlcAβ1→3GalNAcβ1→4GlcAβ1→R (for C4ST).It is noteworthy that C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 share only 41.8% identity at the amino acid levels, but share a common catalytic property. C4ST-1 and C4ST-2, however, are much more homologous to each other in the vicinity of 5′-phosphosulfate and 3′-phosphate binding sites (Fig. 3). Moreover, C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 apparently share common structural domains toward the carboxyl-terminal regions (A and B in Fig. 3). These regions do not share homology with other sulfotransferases (34.Kakuta Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and further studies are necessary to determine their roles.Fig. 9 illustrates the phylogenetic relationship of cloned Golgi-associated sulfotransferases that add a sulfate on carbohydrate acceptors. The results clearly indicate thatC4ST-1, C4ST-2, and HNK-1ST form a gene family distinct from the rest of the sulfotransferase gene families. The members within the same gene family depicted in Fig. 9 catalyze identical or similar reactions, except for one case. LSST, I-GlcNAc6ST, GlcNAc6ST, C6ST, and KSST form a gene family whose acceptor specificities are not clearly related to each other. The cDNAs (GlcNAc6ST, LSST, andI-GlcNAc6ST) encoding a sulfotransferase that adds a sulfate to the 6-position of N-acetylglucosamine at the nonreducing terminal were identified in EST data base for their homology toC6ST or KSST (19.Uchimura K.

In contrast, C6ST and KSST add a sulfate on the 6-position ofN-acetylgalactosamine or galactose on already elongated substrates (22.Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T.

These results, combined together with the results obtained in the present study, indicate that it is possible to identify cDNAs encoding enzymes that utilize very different acceptors from those utilized by a protein whose cDNA was used as a probe. Further studies will be significant to determine the three-dimensional structures of these sulfotransferases bound to acceptors in order to test if these enzymes approach their acceptors from above the plane of the acceptors.The present study demonstrated that both C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 act much more efficiently on non-sulfated chondroitin or desulfated dermatan sulfate than chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate C, or dermatan sulfate (Fig. 4). No disulfated disaccharide was released after chondroitinase ABC digestion of reaction products derived from chondroitin sulfate C (Fig. 5). These results indicate that C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 add sulfate only on unsulfatedN-acetylgalactosamines.The present study also demonstrated that C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 add a sulfate to the 4-position of N-acetylgalactosamine residues in dermatan sulfate, which had been chemically desulfated (Figs. 4 and6). The detailed analysis of dermatan sulfated by C4ST-1 revealed the following points. Even though glucuronic acid residues are minor components in the dermatan sulfate, at least one-fourth of the total radioactivity was detected in ΔDi-4S when released by chondroitinase AC I digestion. In this case, ΔDi-4S was released only when 4-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine are positioned between two glucuronic acids. This finding suggests that C4ST-1 acts onN-acetylgalactosamine residues next to glucuronic acid. If C4ST-1 transfers a sulfate to N-acetylgalactosamine linked to iduronic acid as efficiently as to N-acetylgalactosamine linked to glucuronic acid, more 35S-labeled oligosaccharides would be released by chondroitinase B digestion than by chondroitinase AC I digestion. However, ΔDi-4S was hardly released after chondroitinase B digestion (Fig. 6). These results, combined together, indicate that the GlcA→GalNAc unit is a much better acceptor for C4ST-1 (and most likely for C4ST-2 as well) than the IdoA→GalNAc unit.The results obtained in the present study are similar to those obtained on C4ST purified from a rat chondrosarcoma cell line (26.Yamauchi S. Hirahara Y. Usui H. Takeda Y. Hoshino M. Fukuta M. Kimura J.H. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2456-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the C4ST in that study added a sulfate more on desulfated dermatan sulfate (porcine skin) and the products were highly susceptible to chondroitinase AC II, which cleaves only a GlcA→GalNAc unit flanked by GlcA→GalNAc (39.Hiyama K. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1824-1828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy is probably due to the difference in the source of dermatan sulfate and that the dermatan sulfate from pig skin probably contains more glucuronic acid residues which are clustered than the dermatan sulfate from porcine intestinal mucosa used in the present study.The detailed biosynthetic steps of dermatan sulfate are currently unknown. Malström (40.Malmström A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 161-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that epimerization from glucuronic acid to iduronic acid takes place in unsulfated chondroitin. However, the conversion to iduronic acid in that report was only 15%, which is much lower than the actual iduronic acid content in nature (41.Malmström A. Fransson L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 18: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, this epimerization is reversible for unsulfated forms, but IdoA→GalNAc(4S) is not converted to GlcA→GalNAc(4S). On the other hand, Silbert et al. (42.Silbert J.E. Palmer M.E. Humphries D.E. Silbert C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13397-13400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that lower sulfation leads to lower epimerization, suggesting that sulfation at the 4-position ofN-acetylgalactosamine precedes epimerization. If C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 involve mainly in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate, the expression of C4ST-1 or C4ST-2 should result in higher expression of dermatan sulfate containing large amounts of IdoA→GalNAc(4S). However, if the same enzyme contributes to form both chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, several factors may determine the destination of these synthesized molecules to chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate. When an epimerase is expressed, it converts a glucuronic acid to an iduronic acid, and this reaction is accelerated by the sulfation of N-acetylgalactosamine introduced by C4ST. In contrast, in the absence of an epimerase, no dermatan sulfate is formed. Thus, the presence of an epimerase should be a main regulator, but another possibility needs to be considered. The results of in vitro enzyme assay showed that the sulfotransferase activity of C4ST to chondroitin and dermatan reciprocally changes depending upon the concentration of protamine chloride in the reaction mixture (Ref. 26.Yamauchi S. Hirahara Y. Usui H. Takeda Y. Hoshino M. Fukuta M. Kimura J.H. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2456-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and the present study). The concentration of protamine chloride also affects the activity of chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase including its substrate specificity (43.Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the environmental factors affecting the activity of C4ST might contribute to the regulation of the chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate biosynthesis. It is also possible that another sulfotransferase preferentially acting on IdoA→GalNAc is involved in dermatan sulfate biosynthesis. Further studies will be significant to clarify these points.While we were preparing this manuscript, the mouse counterpart of C4ST-1 was reported (44.Yamauchi S. Mita S. Matsubara T. Fukuta M. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8975-8981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The human and mouse C4ST-1 have 96.0% identity at the amino acid levels. The expression profile of the mouse C4ST is slightly different from that of human C4ST-1 in that it is mainly expressed in the brain and kidney. The mouse C4ST-1, however, apparently exhibits almost the same substrate specificity as the human C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 (44.Yamauchi S. Mita S. Matsubara T. Fukuta M. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8975-8981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).The transcripts of human C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 are differentially expressed in various tissues. The C4ST-1transcript is predominantly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes and hematopoietic tissues such as, bone marrow and spleen, while theC4ST-2 transcript is more widely expressed, including in the pituitary gland, adrenal gland, spinal cord, small intestine, spleen, and lung (Fig. 7 and 8). These results indicate that C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 may play complementary roles in different tissues.Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans have been found in the brain and have been shown to play roles in neural cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth (45.Ruoslahti E.

Chondroitin sulfate is also present in blood cells and has been shown to be involved in interaction with CD44 (50.Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K.

C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 cloned in the present study will be powerful tools to determine the roles of chondroitin sulfate in these various biological systems. Sulfate groups in carbohydrates play important roles in conferring highly specific functions on glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans (1.Hooper L.V. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2.Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A.

Cell. 1999; 99: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Expression of certain sulfated carbohydrates is spatially and temporally controlled, thereby providing developmental regulation of those functions displayed by such sulfation. One of these sulfated glycans is the HNK-1 glycan (4.Jungalwala F.B. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5.Schachner M. Martini R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 183-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The functional significance of HNK-1 glycan was first recognized as an antigen involved in peripheral demyelinative neuropathy. The structural analysis of glycolipids reactive with the autoantibodies led to the discovery that the HNK-1 epitope is sulfo→3GlcAβ11→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ→R (6.Chou D.K. Ilyas A.A. Evans J.E. Costello C.

Subsequently, HNK-1 glycan has been found in a number of neural cell adhesion molecules, including NCAM, myelin-associated glycoprotein, L1, contactin, and Po (5.Schachner M. Martini R.

Using monoclonal antibodies or isolated carbohydrates, various laboratories reported that HNK-1 glycan is involved in cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions (12.Keihauer G. Faissner A. Schachner M. Nature. 1985; 316: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 13.Mohan P.S. Chou D.K. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 2024-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In one study, a non-sulfated form of HNK-1 precursor glycan did not facilitate neurite outgrowth as opposed to a functional, intact HNK-1 glycan (13.Mohan P.S. Chou D.K. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 2024-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results, combined together, suggest that HNK-1 glycan plays critical roles in development, in particular during neural cell development. The HNK-1 carbohydrate is synthesized by the addition of a sulfate to β1,3-glucuronylated N-acetyllactosamine, GlcAβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc→R (4.Jungalwala F.B. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others cloned the cDNA encoding HNK-1 sulfotransferase using an expression cloning strategy (14.Ong E. Yeh J.-C.

During this cloning, we discovered that the newly cloned HNK-1 sulfotransferase and other Golgi-associated sulfotransferases cloned before share a common sequence motif, which includes ZZRDPXXXZ, where X and Z denote any amino acid and hydrophobic amino acids, respectively (14.Ong E. Yeh J.-C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was revealed that this sequence motif is a part of the binding site for 3′-phosphate group of the donor substrate, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) (16.Kakuta Y.

A mutation made at SFRE significantly reduced estrogen-dependent transcription from the lactoferrin ERE in human endometrial cells. In this study, we demonstrated that ERRα1 binds both SFRE and ERE elements and constitutively transactivates the lactoferrin gene promoter. In DNase I footprinting protection analysis, both SFRE and ERE regions were protected by glutathioneS-transferase-ERRα1 fusion protein. The receptor formed two protein-DNA complexes with either SFRE or ERE in electrophoresis mobility shift assay. Homodimerization of ERRα1 was confirmed with the mammalian two-hybrid system. ERRα1 activates reporter constructs containing various types of estrogen response elements in endometrial and non-endometrial cells in transient transfection experiments. Overexpressing the coactivator, SRC1a or GRIP1, further enhances ERRα1-induced transcriptional activity. We demonstrated that the AF2 domain of ERRα1 is essential for the transactivation function and that deletion or mutation at this region abrogates the activation capability. Protein-protein interaction between the SRC1a and ERRα1 C terminus was confirmed with a GST glutathione S-transferase “pull-down” assay. When comparing ERRα1 and the estrogen receptor α (ERα) in many of the experiments, we found that ERα can also bind SFRE of the lactoferrin gene and transactivate the promoter activity in a ligand-dependent manner. The present study demonstrated that ERRα1 binds similar DNA elements as ERα and confers its transactivation function constitutively. Therefore, ERRα1 may actively modulate the estrogen response of lactoferrin gene as well as other estrogen-responsive genes.

Lactoferrin: Interaction and Biological Functions. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 3-23Crossref Google Scholar and references therein). It has been demonstrated that the protein is involved in killing bacteria, modulating the immune system and suppressing tumor growth. Presently, it is unclear how lactoferrin exerts its multiple functions. Two facts about lactoferrin make it a primary candidate in the first line of defense; it is expressed in wet surface mucosa, and it is a major protein in the secondary granule of the polymorphic neutrophils. In addition, high levels of lactoferrin in the colostrum and milk suggest a nutritional value for the infant (4.Brock J.H. Arch. Dis. Child. 1980; 55: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Lactoferrin may also be involved in normal reproduction function, and its expression in the endometrium and uterus is under the influence of estrogen and epidermal growth factor (5.Teng C.T. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 31: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Together, the expression and regulation of lactoferrin in various tissues and under a wide variety of physiological conditions imply that the protein is needed for protection and nutrition. We have extensively studied lactoferrin expression under the influence of estrogen in the reproductive tract (5.Teng C.T. Cell Biochem.

To understand the molecular mechanisms that are involved in estrogen regulation of the lactoferrin gene in the uterus, we have isolated and characterized a compounded estrogen response element (ERE)1 of the lactoferrin gene promoter from both human and mouse (7.Teng C.T.

Estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) play an important role in the differentiation and development of various organs and in the maintenance of proper cellular function in a wide variety of tissues (13.Couse J.F.

The structure of the receptors in this family is organized into several domains, including the N-terminal region that contains the activation function 1 (AF1) followed by DNA binding domain and C-terminal ligand binding domain (17.Ham J.

The ligand-bound receptor recruits coactivators to its AF2 domain and exerts transcriptional activation function, whereas the unliganded receptor associates with corepressors and represses transcriptional activity. In addition to the NR whose ligand has been identified, ligands for the majority of NR family members are yet to be defined. These NR members are grouped as the “orphans” (for review, see Refs. 15.Laudet V. Adelmant G. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 124-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and 29.Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The estrogen receptor-related receptors 1 and 2 (ERRα, NR3B1; and ERRβ, NR3B2 (Ref. 30.Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature CommitteeCell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar)) were the earlier orphan receptors identified by screening the cDNA library with radiolabeled DNA binding domain of the ERα (31.Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 311: 91-94Crossref Scopus (695) Google Scholar). For the past few years, our laboratory has isolated an isoform of ERRα (ERRα1) from human endometrial carcinoma RL95–2 cells based on its ability to bind lactoferrin SFRE (12.Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5795-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). There are two potential initiation sites for ERRα1 that could generate polypeptides of 506 and 422 amino acids (32.Shi H.P. Shigeta H. Yang N.Y. Fu K.S. O'Brian G.O. Teng C.T. Genomics. 1997; 44: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The first methionine (Met) of the long form is present in the first exon, whereas the first Met of the short form resides in the second exon of the ERRα gene (32.Shi H.P. Shigeta H. Yang N.Y. Fu K.S. O'Brian G.O. Teng C.T. Genomics. 1997; 44: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Indeed, the nuclear protein of human endometrium RL95–2 cells shows two proteins at 42- and 57-kDa range that reacted to the antibody generated against the GST-ERRα1 fusion protein in Western analysis (12.Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5795-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The short form of ERRα1 is identical to the original ERRα from the third Met to the end of the protein (31.Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 311: 91-94Crossref Scopus (695) Google Scholar), whereas the major difference between ERRα and the long form of ERRα1 lies in the N-terminal region. However, there are minor discrepancies between the ERRα and ERRα1 at the C-terminal region. The region in question arose from a frameshift of the original ERRα. The sequence of ERRα1 at this region is identical between human and mouse, and the peptide antibody derived from this region detected the same protein as the GST-ERRα1 antibody (33.Shigeta H. Zuo W. Yang N. DiAugustine R. Teng C.T. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 19: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, we concluded that the sequence of ERRα1 was correct, and the short form of ERRα1 clone was used for functional study. Recently, a third estrogen receptor-related receptor (ERR3) was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening using the glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) as bait (34.Hong H. Yang L. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain region of ERRs and ERs is highly conserved; however, the other parts of the protein share very little homology (31.Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 311: 91-94Crossref Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 34.Hong H. Yang L. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). ERRα1 is expressed in the mesodermal tissues and nervous system early in mouse embryonic life (35.Bonnelye E. Vanacker J.M. Spruyt N. Alric S. Fournier B. Desbiens S. Laudet V. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and plays a role in bone morphogenesis (36.Bonnelye E. Vanacker J.M. Dittmar T. Begue A. Desbiens X. Denhardt D.T. Aubin J.E. Laudet V. Fournier B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and lipid metabolism (37.Vega R.B. Kelly D.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is expressed selectively in various adult tissues and in a species-specific pattern of expression (31.Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 311: 91-94Crossref Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 32.Shi H.P. Shigeta H. Yang N.Y. Fu K.S. O'Brian G.O. Teng C.T.

Recently, a diverse class of genes that possesses ERRα1 binding element was identified. These genes were modulated by the receptor either positively or negatively (12.Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5795-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 37.Vega R.B. Kelly D.P. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5695-5700PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the pivotal roles of ERRα1 in a variety of pathways during differentiation, development, and homeostasis. ERRα1 was isolated based on its ability to bind a SFRE in the human lactoferrin gene (11.Yang N.Y. Teng C.T. Endocr. J. 1994; 2: 241-248Google Scholar, 12.Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5795-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). More extensive studies on the binding requirement of ERRα1 showed that its binding is in fact permissive and can bind a wide variety of natural and synthetic estrogen response elements (38.Sladek R. Bader J.A. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F. Eisenbraun T.L. Wiley S.T. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol.

Ligands for the ERR receptors are not clearly identified; however, the pesticides (46.Yang C. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4519-4524PubMed Google Scholar) and serum components have been suggested as the potential ligands for ERRα1 (44.Vanacker J.M. Bonnelye E. Chopin-Delannoy S. Delmarre C. Cavailles V. Laudet V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 764-773PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to the ligand-dependent receptors, ERRα1 was shown as a potent transactivator when its C-terminal region was fused to the progesterone receptor DNA binding domain and tested with a progesterone receptor response element driven reporter in mammalian cells (47.Lydon J.P. Power R.F. Conneely O.M. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 273-283PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of transcription by ERRα and ERRβ was due to the binding of coactivators to the receptors in a ligand-independent manner (48.Xie W. Hong H. Yang N.N. Lin R.J. Simon C.M. Stallcup M.R. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These findings make ERRα1 a significant modulator in many signaling pathways that require the same coactivator and similar DNA response elements. In this report, we extended our previous study and further examined the functional role of ERRα1 on regulation of the human lactoferrin promoter activity in the endometrial cells. Here we showed homodimer binding of ERRα1 to both ERE and SFRE of the lactoferrin gene. Furthermore, ERRα1 interacts with coactivator SRC1a in a ligand-independent manner, and the conserved AF2 of the ERRα1 is essential for the constitutive transactivation function. Human endometrial carcinoma cell line HEC-1B (ATCC no. HTB-113) and CV1 (ATCC no. CCL-70) were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Tissue culture components were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Estradiol-17β (E2) was purchased from Sigma. [35S]Methionine and and S-linkage glutathione-Sepharose beads were acquired from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [14C]chloramphenicol from NEN Life Science Products. The wild type and mutant human lactoferrin hLF-414CAT plasmids have been described previously (11.Yang N.Y. Teng C.T. Endocr. J. 1994; 2: 241-248Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the various types of ERE were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. and linked to CAT promoter reporter plasmids. The 3xERE-Luc construct was a gift from D. McDonnell (Duke University, Durham, NC). The fragment of ERRα1 plasmids used in the study was generated either by restriction enzyme digestion or PCR of the full-length short form of ERRα1 and subsequent subcloning into appropriate vectors. The first methionine in the short form ERRα1 was designated as 1 and the last amino acid glutamine as 422 (12.Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1997; 44: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mutations made in the C-terminal region of ERRα1 were carried out by Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids were purified either by CsCl centrifugation or column chromatography (QIAfilter Maxi column, Qiagen, Santa Cruz, CA). Sequence of all the plasmids were verified by automatic sequencing. Reporter plasmid 5x(Gal4)-CAT was obtained fromCLONTECH. Expression plasmids pSG5-ERα (9.Liu Y.H. Teng C.T. Mol.

Stallcup (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA), and pcDNA3-CBP-Flag2x (50.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K.

Plasmids Gal4-ERRα1 and VP16-ERRα1 were constructed by PCR using the ERRα1 cDNA (12.Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5795-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) as a template. PCR products were subsequently cloned into Gal4-DB and VP16 vectors (CLONTECH). HEC-1B and CV1 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Inc) under 5% CO2. Prior to transfection, cells were split into six-well plates and cultured in phenol red-free Eagle's minimum essential medium with 10% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped FBS (DCCS-FBS) for 24 h. To examine the effect of serum on ERRα1 activity, cells were cultured in DCCS-FBS for 3 weeks prior to transfection experiments. Transient transfections were performed with Cellphect transfection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Effectene Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were transfected with 6.0 μg (Cellphect transfection) or 1.0 μg (Effectene Reagent) of total DNA consisting of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or luciferase (Luc) reporter construct, the expression plasmids, the internal control (pCH110, β-galactosidase) and the salmon sperm DNA or empty vectors made up the final DNA concentration. Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were washed and 10−7m E2 or vehicle was added. The cells were cultured for an additional 24 h in a serum-free condition before preparation of cell extracts. CAT enzyme and the β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (12.Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5795-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The CAT activities were normalized against β-galactosidase activities. All experiments were repeated at least three times with duplicate samples in each experiment, and data are presented as mean ± S.D. DNase I protection of the human lactoferrin 5′-flanking sequence with GST-ERRα1 (12.Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C. J. Biol.

Parker, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom) was performed according to the standard method of Ausubel et al. (51.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

DNA fragment from −441 to −308 of the human lactoferrin gene (7.Teng C.T. Liu Y.H. Yang N.Y. Walmer D. Panella T. Mol.

Teng C.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 355-364PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C. J. Biol.

Teng C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5795-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) were used to supershift the DNA-bound GST-ERRα1 and GST-ERα. GST pull-down experiments with GST-ERRα1 fusion protein and SRC1a protein were performed as described (52.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1997: 16.7.1-16.7.6Google Scholar). GST and GST fusion proteins were prepared fromEscherichia coli BL21 cells after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of an overnight culture. The bacteria were disrupted by sonication, and the fusion protein was isolated with 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (52.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1997: 16.7.1-16.7.6Google Scholar). The in vitro translated SRC1a was labeled with [35S]methionine by a TNT wheat germ extract-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Binding of the35S-labeled SRC1a to the full-length protein and fragments of GST-ERRα1 fusion protein was examined in SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Various Gal4-ERRα1 mutant constructs (1.0 μg) were transfected into HEC-1B cells. The cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection. Ten μg of protein from each cell lysates were loaded and separated on the NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel with MOPS running buffer (Novex, San Diego, CA). The SeeBlue pre-stained standard (Novex) was used as molecular weight marker. After electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized with anti-Gal4 binding domain (1–147) rabbit polyclonal IgG (0.2 μg/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ERRα1 enhanced ERα-mediated transactivation of the human lactoferrin gene promoter (12.Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5795-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To examine whether ERRα1 by itself also activates the human lactoferrin gene promoter, we transfected the ERRα1 expression vectors together with the wild type (wt) and mutant (m1, m6, m1/m6) hLF-414CAT reporter plasmids that contain the previously characterized SFRE and ERE into human endometrial carcinoma, HEC-1B, cells. The sequence of wild type and mutant SFRE and ERE in the reporter plasmids is shown in Fig. 1 A. Overexpressing ERRα1 in HEC-1B cells strongly stimulated both wt and mutant (m1 and m6) reporter activities (Fig. 1 B) in an estrogen-independent manner (compare solid andopen bars). It was surprising that mutations made at either SFRE (m1) or ERE (m6) only slightly reduced the transactivation capability to ERRα1 in the cells. The basal activity of the m6 plasmids was 6-fold higher than the wt (compareopen bars of wt and m6 in Fig. 1 B) and overexpressing ERRα1 enhanced the m6 reporter activity 4-fold; therefore, the overall transactivation activity of ERRα1 was slightly reduced. These results demonstrated that the ERE or SFRE mutation reduced ERRα1's functional activity to the same degree (Fig.1 C), suggesting that ERRα1 can stimulate promoter through SFRE and ERE. To eradicate the ERRα1 activity, both ERE and SFRE had to be mutated (m1/m6). These points are better illustrated in the form of -fold of stimulation (Fig. 1 C). ERRα1 clearly showed E2-independent transactivation function with either SFRE or ERE. As control, we transfected ERα into the cells and obtained a strong stimulation of the wt reporter activity in the presence of E2. We found that mutation at SFRE (m1) significantly reduced ERα activity, whereas mutation at ERE did not abolish ERα function and significant level of E2-dependent transactivation activity was retained if SFRE was left intact (m6). To completely abrogate ERα's transactivating ability, both SFRE and ERE had to be destroyed (m1/m6). These results were in agreement with our previous findings (12.Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5795-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). There was no ERα in the HEC-1B cells (53.Hopfer H. Rinehart Jr., C.A. Kaufman D.G. Vollmer G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and apparently the endogenous level of ERRα1 was not high enough to activat"

The extracellular portion of the receptor includes eight C-type carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), of which one, CRD-4, shows detectable binding to monosaccharide ligands. We have determined the crystal structure of CRD-4. Although the basic C-type lectin fold is preserved, a loop extends away from the core of the domain to form a domain-swapped dimer in the crystal. Of the two Ca2+ sites, only the principal site known to mediate carbohydrate binding in other C-type lectins is occupied. This site is altered in a way that makes sugar binding impossible in the mode observed in other C-type lectins. The structure is likely to represent an endosomal form of the domain formed when Ca2+ is lost from the auxiliary calcium site. The structure suggests a mechanism for endosomal ligand release in which the auxiliary calcium site serves as a pH sensor. Acid pH-induced removal of this Ca2+ results in conformational rearrangements of the receptor, rendering it unable to bind carbohydrate ligands.

Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar,2.Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The receptor is well suited to this scavenging function, since it has an extracellular region containing multiple domains that allow recognition of a diverse range of glycoconjugate ligands. The ability of the receptor to mediate both endocytosis and phagocytosis also means that it can facilitate clearance of both particulate and soluble ligands. Once internalized, ligands are released from the receptor following endosomal or phagosomal acidification, and the receptor recycles to the cell surface. The role of the mannose receptor in the innate immune response is well documented, with several clinically important pathogens includingMycobacterium tuberculosis and Pneumocystis carinii subject to opsonin-independent phagocytosis by the receptor. More recent studies indicate that the receptor may play a central role in coordinating the innate and adaptive immune responses by enhancing uptake and processing of soluble glycoconjugates released from pathogens for presentation to T cells by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (1.Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 2.Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol.

Levels of endogenous proteins bearing high mannose oligosaccharides such as lysosomal enzymes and tissue plasminogen activator are also regulated by the mannose receptor. These proteins are released from tissues into the blood in response to pathological events. The receptor also plays an important role in removing pituitary hormones such as lutropin and thyrotropin from the circulation after they have acted on their target cells (3.Fiete D. Baenziger J.U.

An N-terminal cysteine-rich domain mediates recognition of sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine, which is the terminal sugar of the unusual oligosaccharides present on pituitary hormones (6.Fiete D.J.

The cysteine-rich domain is followed by a fibronectin type II repeat, the function of which is unclear. The remaining extracellular portion of the receptor consists of eight tandemly repeated C-type (Ca2+-dependent) carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs).1Several of the eight C-type CRDs, but not the cysteine-rich domain or the fibronectin type II repeat, are involved in Ca2+-dependent recognition of mannose, fucose, or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues on the surface of pathogens or at the termini of oligosaccharides of endogenous glycoproteins (7.Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mannose receptor is the prototype of a family of receptors sharing the same overall domain organization, although it is the only one known to bind carbohydrate ligands (9.Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 5-8Crossref Google Scholar). Of the eight C-type CRDs, CRDs 4–8 are required for binding and endocytosis of mannose/GlcNAc/fucose-terminated ligands, but only CRD-4 has demonstrable sugar binding activity in isolation. The requirement of multiple CRDs for high affinity ligand binding and endocytosis probably reflects the requirement for multivalent binding, which is a common feature of C-type and other lectins (10.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). CRD-4 forms part of a protease-resistant ligand binding core with CRD-5 and is central to sugar recognition by the receptor. Studies combining ligand binding assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and NMR have given a detailed picture of how CRD-4 binds to sugar and Ca2+ (11.Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Mullin N.P. Hitchen P.G. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5668-5681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13.Hitchen P.G. Mullin N.P. Taylor M.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). CRD-4 of the mannose receptor has specificity for mannose, GlcNAc, and fucose like the C-type CRDs of rat serum and liver mannose-binding proteins (MBPs), which have been well characterized by crystallography, NMR, and mutagenesis (10.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Mannose receptor CRD-4 binds to two Ca2+ as do MBPs. Some aspects of the mode of binding of sugar and Ca2+ by CRD-4 are similar to those of the MBP CRDs, but others are different (12.Mullin N.P. Hitchen P.G. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5668-5681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), indicating that mannose binding by the mannose receptor probably evolved separately from mannose binding by other C-type lectins. Understanding the molecular basis of cell surface ligand recognition and endosomal release by the mannose receptor requires information about how individual domains interact with sugars as well as the structural arrangement of the multiple domains. As CRD-4 is the central ligand binding domain of the receptor, detailed analysis of this domain represents a first step toward understanding the receptor as a whole. This paper describes structural analysis of CRD-4 of the mannose receptor by crystallography. The structure obtained appears to represent a non-sugar binding form of the domain that reveals a possible mechanism for release of sugar ligands from the receptor in the acid environment of the endosome. The structure also suggests ways in which multiple CRDs in the whole receptor might interact with each other. CRD-4 of the human mannose receptor was produced in Escherichia coli as described previously, except that DNA coding for CRD-4 in theOmpA expression vector was modified to remove the portion specifying 12 amino acids at the N-terminal end of the domain (11.Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These residues form part of the linker region between CRD-4 and CRD-3. The recombinant protein contains residues 626–769 of the mature mannose receptor (5.Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the sequence Gly-Ile fused to its N terminus and an extra Asp at the C terminus. The protein was purified by affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose followed by reverse-phase HPLC as described previously (11.Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lyophilized CRD-4 was dissolved in water to a concentration of approximately 40 mg/ml and neutralized with 100 mm NaOH to give a final pH of 8.0. The protein was diluted to a concentration of 12 mg/ml protein, and CaCl2was added to a final concentration of 3–5 mm. Crystals were grown at 21 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 8–13% polyethylene glycol 10,000 (Aldrich), 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mmCaCl2 (solution A). For the native crystal used in data collection, solution A also contained 45 mmMgCl2, although Mg2+ is not required for crystal growth. Clusters or single thin plates (typical size 0.25 × 0.10 × 0.02 mm3) appeared within a week. The crystals belong to space group C2 and contain two molecules per asymmetric unit, corresponding to a solvent content of 40%. For data collection, crystals were transferred to 20 μl of solution A for 20 min, then transferred to 20 μl of solution A containing 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol for another 5 min and flash-cooled to 100 K in a nitrogen gas stream. The crystal used for the methyl 3-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-α-d-mannopyranoside (Manα(1,3)Man) disaccharide sugar soak was grown from a protein stock that also contained 100 mm α-O-methyl mannoside (Sigma). This stock was used in an attempt to improve crystal quality, but the presence of the sugar proved to not affect crystal growth. The crystal was transferred to 20 μl of solution A containing 200 mm Manα(1,3)Man (V-Labs, Inc.) for 40–60 min before transferring the crystals to 20 μl of the cryoprotectant solution, which also contained 200 mm Manα(1,3)Man. It is likely that any monosaccharide present in the original crystal was removed by the soaking procedure. Diffraction data from native and Manα(1,3)Man-soaked crystals were measured to maximum Bragg spacings of 2.3 Å on a MAR Image plate detector at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beam line 9–1. Intensities were integrated, scaled, and merged with DENZO and SCALEPACK (14.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) using the native CRD-4 data. Several different search models were tried, and a composite search model constructed by superimposing the CRDs from three C-type CRDs (residues 1 to 122 of human E-selectin (16.Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K.

Nielsen B.B. Rasmussen H. Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. Larsen I.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1tn3)) gave the clearest results. Ca2+ and water molecules were removed from the search model, but all side chains and the refined individual atomic temperature factors were retained. Two strong peaks (6.1 and 5.7 S.D. over the mean (ς)) were found in a cross-rotation function that was calculated using reflections between 12 and 3.0 Å (next highest peak 4.2ς). The highest 15 rotation solutions were used for a translation search, and after rigid-body refinement, the best solution, corresponding to the highest rotation and translation function solutions, gave an R-value of 51.6% and a correlation coefficient of 35.6% (copy A). Another round of translation search was done while fixing the first molecule, using the next 14 sets of rotation angles found in the cross-rotation procedure. The highest correlation coefficient and lowest R-value corresponded to the second highest peak of the rotation function (copy B). After rigid-body refinement of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, theR-value was 48.2%, and the correlation coefficient was 46.9%. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by a 2-fold rotation axis almost parallel to the b axis, explaining why a self-rotation function did not show a 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry axis. Subsequent phase improvement was done using DM (19.Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Electron density maps were calculated using data to 2.6Å after solvent flattening or solvent flipping and with or without 2-fold averaging. 10% of the data were omitted for cross-validation (20.Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar) in DM and, later, in refinement. An initial model was constructed using the molecular graphics program O (21.Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13016) Google Scholar). At this stage some amino acid residues at the N and C termini of the protein and in loop regions could not be interpreted, but most of the structure comprising the core of the protein could be determined clearly from the map. The model was subjected to simulated annealing and iterative cycles of positional and temperature factor refinement followed by manual fitting and rebuilding. All refinement procedures employed the maximum likelihood amplitude target in CNS (22.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16991) Google Scholar). An overall anisotropic temperature factor and a bulk solvent correction were applied throughout. Strict non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were applied in the first 10 rounds, and some connections in loop regions could be placed unambiguously. Subsequently, tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints (force constant, 300 kcal mol−1) were applied to allow regions of significant difference to be refined properly. Extending the resolution to 2.3 Å made the identification of most amino acids possible. Three Ca2+ ions were identified, one in each protomer and one shared between copy A and copy B. Water molecules were assigned to peaks in F o − F c electron density maps at a contour greater than 3ς that were within hydrogen bonding distance from a potential partner. At this stage the first and last residues of a large loop region (residues 701–707 and 729–734) could not be placed in the maps. Attempts to build the missing regions in a manner that would connect the remainder of the molecule to produce a compact, monomeric CRD like those CRDs used in the molecular replacement calculations gave models with prohibited backbone torsion angles for those loop residues. The 2F o − F c andF o − F c maps made from this model and also a simulated annealing omit map showed that instead of bending and turning back to form a monomeric CRD molecule, the chain in this region extends out to a symmetry-related molecule. This feature was present in both regions in copy B and one region (residues 729–734) in the other copy A (see Fig. 1). Therefore, a model of mannose receptor CRD-4 was built that consisted of two symmetry-related molecules that make a dimer by domain swapping (23.Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) residues 702–734. Refinement of this model containing alanine residues where side chains could not be assigned from the map in the two ambiguous regions immediately dropped the R- and R-free values by 1%, and significant positive electron density could be assigned for the side chains in the loops (Fig. 1). Independent refinement of the model against the Manα(1,3)Man soak data starting with a model lacking these regions also showed the domain-swapped structure. The good geometry in the dimeric model for these loop regions is further evidence of its existence in the crystal structure. Refinement was stopped when no further improvement toR-free was made. For the CRD-4 crystal that was soaked in Manα(1,3)Man, no sugar could be detected in the electron density maps. Refinement statistics are given in TableII. The current CRD-4 native model contains residues 628–702 and 707–763 of copy A, residues 626–768 (residue 768 in the final model was assigned as Ala, because no side chain could be identified in the electron density maps) and the Ile preceding the first residue for copy B, 3 Ca2+ and, 145 water molecules. The Manα(1,3)Man-soaked CRD-4 model contains residues 628–636, 639–702, and 707–762 for copy A, residues 626–767 and the N-terminal Ile for copy B, 3 Ca2+, and 115 water molecules.Table IIRefinement statistics for mannose receptor CRD-4Data setNativeManα(1,3)ManResolution range (Å)40–2.340–2.3R cryst aRcryst andR free = ∑∥F o‖ − ‖F c∥/∑‖F o‖, where ‖F o‖ = observed structure factor amplitude, and ‖F c‖ = calculated structure factor amplitude for the working and test sets, respectively.21.621.2R free aRcryst andR free = ∑∥F o‖ − ‖F c∥/∑‖F o‖, where ‖F o‖ = observed structure factor amplitude, and ‖F c‖ = calculated structure factor amplitude for the working and test sets, respectively.27.826.2r.m.s.d. from ideality Bonds (Å)0.0060.006 Angles (°)1.381.39Average B-factor (Å2) (copy A/copy B) Main chain30.2/23.837.7/34.6 Side chain30.3/24.438.0/35.4 Water molecules30.940.1a Rcryst andR free = ∑∥F o‖ − ‖F c∥/∑‖F o‖, where ‖F o‖ = observed structure factor amplitude, and ‖F c‖ = calculated structure factor amplitude for the working and test sets, respectively. Open table in a new tab Equilibrium sedimentation measurements were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using an An60Ti rotor at 20,000 and 22,000 rpm and 20 °C. Equilibrium distributions from three different loading concentrations and the two different rotor speeds were analyzed simultaneously using the Nonlin curve fit program supplied with the instrument. The structure of mannose receptor CRD-4 was determined by molecular replacement using a search model composed of three superimposed C-type CRDs (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table III). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two molecules, which provides two independent views of the domain. In an attempt to obtain a ligand complex, diffraction data were also measured from a crystal soaked in a synthetic mother liquor containing 200 mm Manα(1,3)Man. Independent refinement of a model against these data revealed no electron density for the sugar, and the structure obtained is identical to the model refined against data from the native crystal to within the experimental error. Copy A is modeled between residues 628 and 763, except for residues 703–706, whereas copy B is well defined with no chain breaks between residues 626 and 768. Although CRD-4 binds to two Ca2+ in solution, only the principal site is occupied in both copies. One other Ca2+ is present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, but it shares ligands between copy A and copy B and is likely an adventitious site resulting from crystal packing.Table IIIComparison of CRD-4 with other C-type lectinsMBP-A (1RTM)E-selectin (1ESL)Tetranectin (1HTN)CD-94 (1B6E)Lithostathine (1LIT)LY-49 (1QO3)TC-14 (1BYF)SP-D (1B08)IX/X-BP (1IXX)r.m.s.d.

The overall structure of CRD-4 (Fig.2 A) is similar to other C-type CRDs (Table III), containing two α helices and two small antiparallel β sheets. It is useful to compare CRD-4 to the only other known mannose binding C-type lectin structure, MBP (Fig. 2 B). The core region of the CRD-4 domain, consisting of β strands 1–5 and the two α helices, superimposes on the equivalent residues of the rat MBP-A CRD with an r.m.s.d. of 1.5 Å. The principal difference resides in the position of helix α2, which is the most variable element of secondary structure among the known C-type lectin-like folds. In CRD-4, the helix is pushed outward relative to MBP and is reminiscent of the position of this helix in E-selectin (16.Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The variability of this region in the known C-type CRD structures may account for the fact that the clearest molecular replacement results were obtained using composite search models in which several different CRDs were superimposed. At the base of the molecule, β strands from the N and C termini pair to form the lower sheet and are similar to those in MBP. An additional antiparallel strand, β0, precedes β1; this strand is somewhat irregular and makes only a few hydrogen bonds with β1. The small sheet is stabilized by a disulfide bond formed between a cysteine in the loop preceding β0 and a cysteine in β1. This disulfide-stabilized, three-stranded antiparallel sheet has been observed in several other C-type lectin-like domains, including lithostathine (17.Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.-P.

Nature. 1999; 402: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition to the known structures, CRD-2, -3, -6, and -8 of the mannose receptor as well as other C-type lectins such as the rat hepatic lectin (RHL) contain this pair of cysteines, suggesting that these domains will have a similar structure in this region. In CD94 (26.Boyington J.C. Riaz A.N. Patamawenu A. Coligan J.E. Brooks A.G. Sun P.D. Immunity. 1999; 10: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and Ly49a (27.Tormo J. Natarajan K. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), this region participates in homodimer interfaces in which β0 from two molecules pair in a parallel orientation. It is possible that such a structure forms between some pairs of CRDs in the full mannose receptor. Unlike the core of the domain, the “upper” portion of the polypeptide chain, which contains irregular loop regions, differs strikingly from that of MBP. The extended series of loops that follows β2, residues 701–734, extends away from the core of the domain (Fig.2 A), in contrast to MBPs, in which the equivalent region forms the upper part of the compact domain (Fig. 2 B). In MBPs, this region is stabilized by two Ca2+ ions. The Ca2+ site 1 of MBPs, which is also found in tetranectin, is composed exclusively of residues from this region and is designated as the auxiliary Ca2+ site (12.Mullin N.P. Hitchen P.G. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5668-5681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Ca2+ site 2 of MBPs, which is conserved among all C-type lectin-like domains with sugar binding activity and participates in direct interactions with bound sugar ligands, is formed in part by residues from extended loops as well as residues from β4. This site is referred to as the principal site. Although CRD-4 binds to two Ca2+ in solution (11.Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only the principal Ca2+ is observed in the CRD-4 structure described here. The implications of this observation will be discussed below. Superposition of the core of the domain from the two copies of CRD-4 in the asymmetric unit of the crystal reveals a significantly different disposition of the extended loop with respect to the core of the protein (Fig. 3). The difference can be described as a rotation of the loop by 43° with respect to the core. This observation suggests that the loop is flexibly disposed with respect to the core of the domain. The general shape and disposition of this region is similar to that of the coagulation factor IX/X-binding protein (IX/X-BP) (Fig. 3). Extensive interactions occur between the extended loops formed by residues 701–734 of two CRD-4 molecules related by a crystallographic 2-fold rotational symmetry axis (Fig. 4, A and B). Most strikingly, the most distal portion of the loop (residues 708 to 728) forms the upper portion of the Ca2+- and sugar-binding site of the partner molecule. This domain swapping (23.Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) produces a dimer in which each end, comprised of residues 625–700 and 735–768 from one polypeptide chain and residues 708–728 from a crystal symmetry-related molecule, has the compact fold typical of C-type CRDs (except IX/X-BP) (Fig. 4 C). This “hybrid molecule” will be referred to as CRD4 monomer-like (CRD4-M). Comparison of CRD4-M with MB"

Exposure of both cell lines to 43 °C for 1 h initiated apoptosis. Apoptosis peaked at 3–6 h after heat exposure in the HL-60 cells. Whereas HL-60AR cells were partially protected against HT-induced apoptosis at these early time points, maximal levels of apoptosis were detected later, i.e. 12–18 h after heat exposure. This differential induction of apoptosis was directly correlated to the induction of the antiapoptotic HSP27 and HSP70. In particular, in the HL-60 cells HSP27 was significantly induced at 12–18 h after exposure to 43 °C when apoptosis dropped. In contrast, coinciding with the late onset of apoptosis in HL-60AR cells at that time HL-60AR cells lacked a similar HSP response. In line with the higher antioxidant capacity HL-60AR cells accumulated reactive oxygen species to a lesser degree than HL-60 cells after heat treatment. Protection from HT-induced apoptosis as well as diminished heat-induced HSP27 expression was also observed after cotreatment of HL-60 cells with 43 °C and catalase but not with superoxide dismutase. These data emphasize the pivotal role of reactive oxygen species for HT induced pro- and antiapoptotic pathways.

In contrast, coinciding with the late onset of apoptosis in HL-60AR cells at that time HL-60AR cells lacked a similar HSP response. In line with the higher antioxidant capacity HL-60AR cells accumulated reactive oxygen species to a lesser degree than HL-60 cells after heat treatment. Protection from HT-induced apoptosis as well as diminished heat-induced HSP27 expression was also observed after cotreatment of HL-60 cells with 43 °C and catalase but not with superoxide dismutase. These data emphasize the pivotal role of reactive oxygen species for HT induced pro- and antiapoptotic pathways. hyperthermia heat shock protein reactive oxygen species catalase superoxide dismutase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin Hyperthermia (HT)1 has a potential as an antineoplastic treatment modality when combined with radiation or chemotherapy (1.Robins H.I. Cohen J.D. Neville A.J. Gautherie M. Clinical Thermology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992Google Scholar). Thus, the biological effects of elevated temperatures have been studied extensively. Cell death is apparent after application of a critical temperature load (2.Gorman A.M. Heavey B. Creagh E. Cotter T.G. Samali A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3.Katschinski D. Robins H.I. Schad M. Frede S. Fandrey J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3404-3410PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we and others were able to demonstrate that HT-induced cell death can at least partly be attributed to the induction of apoptosis (2.Gorman A.M. Heavey B. Creagh E. Cotter T.G. Samali A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3.Katschinski D. Robins H.I. Schad M. Frede S. Fandrey J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3404-3410PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Takasu T. Lyons J.C. Park H.J. Song C.W. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2504-2508PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this effect, exposure of malignant cells to elevated temperatures also elicits a well regulated cellular defense including the production of HSPs (5.Li G.C. Werb Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 6.Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). In particular, induction of HSP27 and HSP70 has been shown to exert the protective role of HSP by inhibition of apoptosis (7.Jaattela M. Wissing D. Bauer P.A. Li G.C.

Several studies indicate the involvement of heat-mediated oxidative stress in HT-induced cytotoxicity. After exposure to heat-increased levels of superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide as well as increased lipid peroxidation products have been found in various cell lines and in tumor tissue (12.Yoshikawa T. Kokura S. Tainaka K. Itani K. Oyamada H. Kaneko T. Naito Y. Kondo M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2326-2329PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestl R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3239-3244PubMed Google Scholar). The origin of the ROS, however, remains to be determined. Noteworthy, ROS are also known to induce HSPs that are critical for cellular thermoresistance and the development of thermotolerance (2.Gorman A.M. Heavey B. Creagh E. Cotter T.G. Samali A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17.Schoeniger L.O. Andreoni K.A. Ott G.R. Risby T.H. Bulkley G.B. Udelsman R. Burdick J.F. Buchman T.G.

Thus, heat-induced oxidative stress seems to play a pivotal role, i.e. the induction of apoptotic cell death and induction of antiapoptotic HSPs. Via manipulation of the activity of antioxidant enzymes one should be enabled to determine the importance of ROS for heat-mediated apoptosis and the induction of cellular defense. SOD, CAT, and glutathione peroxidase are the main cellular ROS degrading enzyme systems. SOD converts the superoxide radical (O⨪2) into hydrogen peroxide, which is metabolized by CAT and glutathione peroxidase. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the antioxidative capacity is affecting HT-mediated apoptosis and HSP production. To this end we investigated HT-induced apoptosis in the parental leukemia cell line HL-60 as well as in HL-60AR cells that are characterized by elevated endogenous CAT activity (19.Bhalla K. Hindenburg A. Taub R.N. Grant S. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3657-3662PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Lenehan P.F. Gutierrez P.L. Wagner J.L. Milak N. Fisher G.R. Ross D.D. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1995; 35: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the modulation of HT-induced apoptosis and HSP induction by exogenous treatment with CAT or SOD. The mouse anti-Bcl-2, mouse anti-Bcl-XS/L, and rabbit anti-Bax antibodies as well as the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA) and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The mouse monoclonal anti-HSP27 and anti-HSP70 antibodies were purchased from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada). CAT, SOD, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The human leukemia cell lines HL-60 and HL-60AR were a kind gift from Dr. K. Bhalla (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). Endogenous CAT enzyme activity in HL-60 and HL-60AR cells was determined to be 53.3 ± 17.8 and 176.3 ± 55.8 μmol min−1 mg protein−1.The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified 5% CO2 in air atmosphere at 37 °C. For heat exposure cells were seeded in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks, allowed to grow for 24 h, and then exposed to 43 °C for 1 h. After heat treatment, cells were returned to 37 °C. Cell viability was determined using the trypan blue exclusion test. Before each experiment cells were determined to have a viability of >90%. Time zero was considered the point at which the cells were removed from the water bath after heat treatment. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Data shown in the graphs for various parameters represent the means ± S.D., and data sets were compared using the Student's ttest. The 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks were placed into plastic freezer bags and filled with 5% CO2/air before sealing. The flasks were placed into a gently shaking water bath maintained at 43 °C ± 0.1 °C for 1 h. The medium in the flasks equilibrated to the water bath temperature in about 5 min. The temperature in the water bath was controlled using a thermistor temperature probe, which was regularly calibrated to a tenth degree in the range of 20–50 °C. After the heat treatment the flasks were removed from the freezer bags and returned to the 37 °C incubator. Extent of DNA fragmentation was determined by a modified method described in Ref. 21.Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6683) Google Scholar. At different time points after heat exposure cells were collected and resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton-X). After incubation for 20 min at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and subsequently the fragmented DNA was recovered from the supernatant. The pellets were sonicated for 15 s in 100 μl of lysis buffer. The amount of DNA in both fractions was determined by a fluorometric method using 10 μg/ml DAPI as described in Ref. 22.Brunk C.F. Jones K.C. James T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar. The fluorescence intensity was measured using 360-nm excitation wavelength and 460-nm emission wavelength (CytoFluorTM 2350 Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). The percentage of DNA fragmentation was defined as the ratio of the amount of fragmented DNA to the total amount of DNA. Cells were exposed to 43 °C for 1 h. At frequent intervals thereafter, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysate (30 μg of protein/sample) was incubated with 12 μm of the fluorogenic peptide substrate DEVD-AMC in a 96-well microtiter plate at room temperature. The cleavage of DEVD-AMC was monitored by AMC liberation in a fluoroscan plate reader (CytoFluorTM 2350, Millipore) using 360-nm excitation and 460-nm emission wavelength. Fluorescence was measured every 60 s during a 60-min period, and fluorescence units were converted to pmol amounts of AMC using a standard curve generated with free AMC (Sigma). Control experiments confirmed that the release of substrate was linear with DEVD-AMC and protein concentration. Addition of the competitive inhibitor DEVD-CHO (50 nm) to the samples blocked DEVD-AMC cleavage. At various time points after heat treatment, cells were treated with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by fixation onto glass slides with 70% ethanol. After rehydration glass slides were stained with Hoechst dye (1.5 μg/ml) for 5 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted in 2.5% Dabco (1,4-diazabicylo[2.2.2]octane). Nuclei were visualized using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Apoptotic nuclei were expressed as a percentage of total nuclei. Cells were spun down, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, 120 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and stored at −80 °C. Protein (50 μg) was run on a polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry electroblotting (Bio-Rad); membranes were stained with Ponceau S to verify equal protein loading per lane. After overnight blocking (5% nonfat milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline), blots were probed for 1 h with antibodies against Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-X, HSP27, HSP70, or actin (diluted 1:200, 1:200, 1:200, 1:1000, 1: 1000, and 1:1000, respectively) and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (dilution: 1:2000) and the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The production of intracellular ROS was estimated fluorometrically using the oxidation sensitive fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF; Sigma). Before heat exposure, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 5 μm DCF for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently cells were washed and resuspended in DCF free RPMI 1640. Cells were then exposed to 37 or 43 °C for 1 h. At frequent time intervals thereafter, samples were analyzed using a CytoFluorTM 2350, Millipore fluorometer. Fluorescence of DCF was detected at an excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively. Total RNA was isolated according to the method described in Ref. 23.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar. 15 μg of total RNA were subjected to electrophoresis in denaturing 1% agarose gels containing 0.7 mol/liter formaldehyde. RNA was transferred onto nylon membranes (Nytran Plus, Schleicher & Schüll) with a vacuum blotting apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were cross-linked with UV light dried at 80 °C for 2 h and prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in 45% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml sonicated denatured salmon testis DNA. Hybridizations were performed in fresh solution supplemented with the radioactive probe (0.5 to 2 × 106 cpm/ml) for 2 days at 42 °C. Hybridization probes were polymerase chain reaction generated fragments. Polymerase chain reaction fragments were [α-32P]dCTP-labeled with a commercially available kit (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). After hybridization, the filters were washed twice for 15 min in 2× SSC/0.1%SDS at 50 °C and then twice in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Filters were sealed in plastic bags and analyzed by exposure to imaging plates for a Bio Imaging Analyzer (BAS 1000; Fuji, Düsseldorf, Germany). Exposure of HL-60 to 43 °C for 1 h resulted in significant apoptotic cell death as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation, caspase 3 activation, and quantitation of apoptotic nuclei after Hoechst staining (Fig. 1). To test for the involvement of ROS in HT-induced apoptosis, HL-60 cells were incubated with CAT (500 units/ml) or SOD (50 units/ml) during heat exposure. As shown in Fig. 2 treatment of HL-60 cells with heat in the presence of CAT but not SOD partially protected from HT-induced apoptosis 3 h after heat exposure. Moreover, modulation of apoptosis by antioxidant enzymes was demonstrated by heat exposure of the parental HL-60 cells and the HL-60AR cells, for which an increased endogenous CAT enzyme activity has been described (also see “Materials and Methods”). In the HL-60 cells, apoptosis peaked at 3–6 h and disappeared by 18–24 h after treatment, whereas HL-60AR cells showed a late onset of apoptosis. Peak apoptosis was not observed until 12–18 h after exposure to 43 °C for 1 h (Fig. 1).Figure 2Modulation of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis and caspase 3 activity by ROS scavengers. HL-60 cells were exposed to 43 °C for 1 h in the presence of CAT (500 units/ml) or SOD (50 units/ml). After heat treatment, cells were washed and resuspended in fresh medium in the absence of ROS modulating molecules. 3 h later cells were stained with the DNA-specific fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 and assayed for the extent of apoptosis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Determination of intracellular ROS in HL-60 and HL-60AR cells after exposure to 43 °C for 1 h confirmed the accumulation of ROS in response to heat as described earlier by others (Ref. 14.Flanagan S.W. Moseley P.L. Buettner G.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 285-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar and Fig. 3). However, hyperthermia induced a significantly higher accumulation of ROS in HL-60 cells compared with HL-60AR cells. This is in line with the higher antioxidative capacity of the HL-60AR cells via their increased endogenous CAT enzyme activity (20.Lenehan P.F. Gutierrez P.L. Wagner J.L. Milak N. Fisher G.R. Ross D.D. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1995; 35: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Members of the Bcl-2 protein family play an important role for pro- but also antiapoptotic pathways. Interestingly, basal Bcl-2 protein expression was significantly higher in the HL-60AR cells than in the parental HL-60 cells. In contrast, basal expression of Bcl-XL and Bax was not altered in the HL-60AR cells. Treatment of HL-60 and HL-60AR cells with 43 °C did not affect the protein levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL as well as the proapoptotic Bax at any time (Fig.4 A). In contrast, exposure of both cell lines to 43 °C induced HSP27 and HSP70 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4), but the response markedly differed between HL-60 and HL-60AR cells. Following exposure to 43 °C for 1 h HSP70 mRNA levels in HL-60 cells peaked at 3 h after treatment (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, in HL-60AR cells the induction of HSP70 mRNA was delayed for 3 h and reached its maximum 6 h after treatment. Similar results were obtained for HSP27. HL-60 cells presented with detectable basal HSP27 mRNA and protein levels and a rapid induction after exposure to heat. Both the induction of HSP27 and HSP70 in the HL-60 cells coincided with the drop of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis. In contrast, in the HL-60AR cells faint basal HSP27 mRNA and protein levels were only moderately induced after exposure to heat. To further determine the effects of the cellular redox status on HSP27 expression, HL-60 cells were treated with CAT or SOD in addition to HT. As demonstrated in Fig.5, heat-induced HSP27 induction was diminished by co-treatment of HL-60 cells with heat and CAT but not with SOD.Figure 5Modulation of heat-induced HSP27 and HSP 70 expression by antioxidant enzymes. HL-60 cells were exposed to 43 °C in the absence or presence of CAT (500–1500 units/ml) or SOD (50–150 units/ml) for 1 h. After heat treatment, cells were washed and resuspended in fresh medium in the absence of ROS modulating molecules. 6 h later cellular protein was extracted and analyzed for HSP27 and HSP70 expression. For comparison, extracts from HL-60AR cells 6 h after exposure to 43 °C were loaded into thesecond lane from the left. Equal protein loading per lane was checked by probing for β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the present study we found that HT exerted its cytotoxic effect via induction of apoptosis in the human leukemia cells HL-60. These data are consistent with previous reports using HL-60 cells and other human leukemia cell lines (2.Gorman A.M. Heavey B. Creagh E. Cotter T.G. Samali A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3.Katschinski D. Robins H.I. Schad M. Frede S. Fandrey J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3404-3410PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Takasu T. Lyons J.C. Park H.J. Song C.W. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2504-2508PubMed Google Scholar). We further demonstrate that the induction of apoptotic cell death by heat was modulated by the antioxidant capacity of the cells. CAT, glutathione peroxidase, and SOD are the main cellular ROS degrading enzyme systems. SOD converts the superoxide radical into hydrogen peroxide, which is metabolized by CAT and glutathione peroxidase. Treatment of HL-60 cells with CAT conferred partial protection against the induction of heat-induced apoptosis, whereas SOD did not affect the heat-induced apoptotic cell death. Thus, with respect to HT-induced apoptosis, hydrogen peroxide but not superoxide appears to be of greater importance. In line with this assumption, different effects of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anions on apoptosis are reported from studies with vascular smooth muscle cells and neutrophils (24.Rollet L.E. Grange M.J. Elbim C. Marquetty C. Gougerot P.M. Pasquier C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). ROS degrading enzymes like CAT and SOD are poorly cell permeable, and nonphysiological concentrations are needed to affect intracellular ROS concentrations. Although previous reports demonstrate that exogenous delivery of ROS degrading enzymes is sufficient to affect intracellular ROS concentrations (25.Sandstrom P.A. Buttke T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4708-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 26.Takeuchi A. Miyamoto T. Yamati K. Masuho Y. Hayashi M. Hayashi H. Onozaki K. Cancer Res. 1994; 55: 1586-1589Google Scholar, 27.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar), data from cells with endogenously elevated CAT activity would be much more convincing. Therefore, to further test the hypothesis of whether hydrogen peroxide is involved in HT-induced apoptosis, we made use of the closely related parental leukemia cell line HL-60 and its subline HL-60AR. HL-60 AR cells have increased endogenous CAT enzyme levels and activity (19.Bhalla K. Hindenburg A. Taub R.N. Grant S. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3657-3662PubMed Google Scholar). In line with the experiments in which exogenous ROS degrading enzymes were used to modulate intracellular ROS levels, the induction of apoptosis was significantly different in HL-60 and the HL-60AR cells. Although apoptosis was seen as early as 3–6 h after exposure to 43 °C for 1 h in the HL-60 cells, HL-60AR cells seemed to be partially protected against HT-induced apoptotic cell death at this time point. The partial resistance of HL-60AR cells at this time point was correlated to significantly diminished HT-induced ROS levels in HL-60AR cells, possibly because of the higher antioxidative capacity of the HL-60AR cells. The origin of the ROS has not yet been identified and needs further investigation. ROS are produced when oxygen is consumed in the electron transport chain reaction, and mitochondria can be a major source of ROS; ROS production by mitochondria during apoptosis has already been considered by several investigators (28.Kiningham K.K.

However, assuming that HL-60 and HL-60AR cells differ in their levels of hydrogen peroxide through higher CAT activity in HL-60AR cells, this difference does not explain the observation that 12–18 h after heat exposure when apoptosis dropped in the HL-60 cells maximal levels of apoptotic cell death were detected in HL-60AR cells. To gain insight into the mechanism for this late onset of apoptosis, different proteins with regulatory function in apoptotic pathways were investigated. Important general regulators of apoptotic cell death are the Bcl-2 proteins and the HSPs, i.e. HSP27 and HSP70 (32.Garrido C. Ottavi P. Fromentin A. Hammann A. Arrigo A.P. Chauffert B. Mehlen P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2661-2667PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar, 34.Jaattela M. Exp.

Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Whereas Bcl-2 proteins affect the apoptotic pathway via interaction with the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c, and finally the caspases, HSPs seem to exert their apoptotic effect downstream of caspase 3-like proteases (11.Jaattela M. Wissing D. Kokholm K. Kallunki T. Egeblad M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 36.Kluck R.M. Bossy W.E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Basal Bcl-2 expression was significantly higher in the HL-60AR cells compared with the HL-60 cells. After exposure to heat, however, protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bax was not significantly altered. Thus, it seems that these members of the Bcl-2 family are not involved in the HT-mediated induction of apoptosis. These data are in agreement with earlier reports of our group and others (3.Katschinski D. Robins H.I. Schad M. Frede S. Fandrey J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3404-3410PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Takasu T. Lyons J.C. Park H.J. Song C.W. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2504-2508PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, HT-dependent induction of HSP27 and HSP70 directly correlated with the apoptotic effect in HL-60 and HL-60AR cells. Whereas HSP27 and HSP70 mRNA and protein expression was significantly increased after exposure to heat in the HL-60 cells, the induction of HSP27 in particular was markedly diminished in the HL-60AR cells. This differential HSP expression in the HL-60 and HL-60AR cells implies that the HT-induced increase of HSPs is dependent on the accumulation of ROS. Strong support for this assumption was the observation that HSP27 expression was reduced by CAT. Taken together and in agreement with earlier reports (2.Gorman A.M. Heavey B. Creagh E. Cotter T.G. Samali A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17.Schoeniger L.O. Andreoni K.A. Ott G.R. Risby T.H. Bulkley G.B. Udelsman R. Burdick J.F. Buchman T.G.

Physiol. 1999; 178: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), our data support the notion that the induction of HSP27 is dependent on the cellular redox status. However, because the influence of the increased CAT activity was more pronounced for HSP27 compared with HSP70, one has to assume a higher sensitivity of HSP27 by the cellular redox status. A differential expression of HSP27 and HSP70 is in line with reports of others and may be due to specific transcriptional regulatory elements (2.Gorman A.M. Heavey B. Creagh E. Cotter T.G. Samali A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of heat shock genes requires the activation of the HSF-1, which binds to the consensus heat shock element located in the promoter region of the heat shock genes. Activation of HSF-1 requires phosphorylation, trimerization, and nuclear translocation. Recent studies suggest that hydrogen peroxide increases nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of HSF-1 (39.Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Polla B.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 40.Jornot L. Petersen H. Junod A.F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which is in line with our observation reported here and makes a redox mechanism in heat-induced signal transduction pathways during apoptosis very likely. Understanding of the regulation of HSP induction may be important for anticancer strategies, because it has been demonstrated that HSP27 can limit the efficacy of antitumor agents and enhance tumorigenicity (41.Ciocca D.R. Fuqua S.A. Lock L.S. Toft D.O. Welch W.J. McGuire W.L. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3648-3654PubMed Google Scholar,42.Garrido C. Fromentin A. Bonnotte B. Favre N. Moutet M. Arrigo A.P. Mehlen P. Solary E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5495-5499PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of HSPs in the HL-60 cells coincided with the drop of HT-induced apoptosis. HSPs may be induced as a cellular defense, which would support the concept of an inverse relationship of HSP induction and HT-induced cytotoxicity (43.Riabowol K.T. Mizzen L.A. Welch W.J. Science. 1988; 242: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the above hypothesis, the lack of protection via diminished HSP27 and, to lesser degree, HSP70 induction in the HL-60AR cells is sensitizing these cells to undergo apoptosis at later time points. Our data underscore the role of ROS in HT-induced apoptosis. However, the role of HT-induced accumulation of ROS appears to be ambiguous. Although a decrease in HT-mediated ROS generation via a higher endogenous antioxidative capacity confers partial resistance against HT-induced apoptosis at first, it might also affect the cellular defense, i.e. HSP production. Thus, ROS represent a common denominator of both pro- and antiapoptotic HT-induced pathways. We thank Dr. Bhalla (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC) for providing HL60AR cells."

We compare six different remodeling complexes: ySWI/SNF, yRSC, hSWI/SNF, xMi-2, dCHRAC, and dNURF. We find that each complex uses similar amounts of ATP to remodel nucleosomal arrays at nearly identical rates. We also perform assays with arrays reconstituted with hyperacetylated or trypsinized histones and isolated histone (H3/H4)2tetramers. The results define three groups of the ATP-dependent family of remodeling enzymes. In addition we investigate the ability of an acidic activator to recruit remodeling complexes to nucleosomal arrays. We propose that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes share a common reaction mechanism and that a key distinction between complexes is in their mode of regulation or recruitment.

The assembly of eukaryotic DNA into folded nucleosomal arrays is likely to have a major impact on the efficiency or regulation of nuclear processes that require access to the DNA sequence, including RNA transcription, DNA replication, recombination, and repair. In fact, it is now generally recognized that disruption or remodeling of chromatin structure is a rate-determining step for most of these nuclear DNA transactions (1.Cairns B.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2.Burns L.G. Peterson C.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Two classes of highly conserved chromatin remodeling enzymes have been implicated as regulators of the repressive nature of chromatin structure, the first class includes enzymes that covalently modify the nucleosomal histones (e.g. acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, ADP-ribosylation; reviewed in Ref. 4.Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar), and the second class is composed of multisubunit complexes that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA interactions (reviewed in Refs. 5.Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar and 6.Pollard K.J. Peterson C.L. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Each member of the ATP-dependent family of chromatin remodeling enzymes contains an ATPase subunit that is related to the SWI2/SNF2 subfamily of the DEAD/H superfamily of nucleic acid-stimulated ATPases (7.Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar).

Biol. 1998; 8: 843-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Although these complexes have a variable number of subunits (i.e. 3–15), and many different types of assays have been used to monitor the activity of individual complexes, each enzyme can apparently use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to alter chromatin structure and enhance the binding of proteins to nucleosomal DNA-binding sites (3.Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 5.Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the case of the ySWI/SNF, Drosophila Brahma, and hSWI/SNF complexes, remodeling is required for transcriptional regulation of target genes in vivo (Refs. 23.de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Hill D.A. Guidi C.J. Stephenson R.O. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and 24.Deuring R. Fanti L.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes have been further divided into three groups based on whether the sequence of the ATPase subunit is more related to yeast SWI2 (ySWI/SNF, yRSC, Brahma, and hSWI/SNF), Drosophila ISWI (ISW1, ISW2, dNURF, dCHRAC, dACF, and hRSF), or human Mi-2 (hNURD, xMi-2) (reviewed in Ref. 3.Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although each of these ATPases share a SWI2/SNF2-like ATPase domain, they harbor additional, unique sequence motifs adjacent to the ATPase domain that are characteristic of each group, the SWI2 group contains a bromodomain (25.Tamkun J.W. Deuring R. Scott M.P. Kissinger M. Pattatucci A.M. Kaufman T.C. Kennison J.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 561-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), the ISWI group contains a SANT domain (26.Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Gibson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 87-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and the Mi-2 group contains a chromodomain (27.Paro R. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Differences among some groups are also apparent in the nucleic acid cofactor required for stimulation of ATPase activity. For enzymes that contain a SWI2-like ATPase (ySWI/SNF, yRSC, and hSWI/SNF), ATPase activity is stimulated equally well by “free” DNA or nucleosomes (8.Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 10.Cairns B.R. Lorch Y. Li Y. Zhang M. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Du J. Laurent B. Kornberg R.D.

Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ATPase activity of enzymes that contain an ISWI-like or Mi-2-like ATPase is optimally stimulated by nucleosomes (18.Tong J.K. Hassig C.A. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 19.Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol.

In the case of ISWI-like ATPases, this requirement for nucleosomes may reflect obligatory interactions with the trypsin-sensitive, histone N-terminal domains (30.Georgel P.T. Tsukiyama T. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4717-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here we report the first direct comparison of the biochemical properties of six different chromatin remodeling enzymes (ySWI/SNF, yRSC, dCHRAC, dNURF, hSWI/SNF, and xMi-2) which encompass all three previously suggested groups. Surprisingly, each complex shows similar ATPase activity on nucleosomal array substrates, and they are each able to facilitate nucleosome mobilization within an array at nearly equivalent rates. We have also investigated the nucleosome substrate requirements for each enzyme by using arrays reconstituted with hyperacetylated or trypsinized histone octamers, as well as histone (H3/H4)2 tetramers. ATPase and remodeling assays with these different substrates identify new common features, as well as new distinctions among enzymes. In addition, we test the ability of the GAL4-VP16 chimeric transcriptional activator to recruit these remodeling complexes to a nucleosomal array substrate. We report that ySWI/SNF is uniquely potent for recruitment by GAL4-VP16 in this assay. Our data are consistent with the differential regulation of ATP-dependent enzymes that each share a similar mechanism of nucleosome remodeling. The array DNA template contains 11 tandem, head-to-tail repeats of a 208-base pair sea urchin 5 S rRNA gene (31.Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Template was isolated by digestion of plasmid pCL7c (208-11S) or pCL8b (208-11S-Gal4) with NotI,HindIII, and HhaI (New England Biolabs) followed by fast protein liquid chromatography purification on Sephacryl-500 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) essentially as described (31.Logie C.

Array DNA template was end-labeled by Klenow fill-in reaction with [α-32P]dATP as described (31.Logie C. Peterson C.L.

Chicken erythrocyte histone octamers were purified from chicken whole blood (Pel-Freez Biologicals) as described previously (33.Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Hyperacetylated histone octamers were purified from butyrate-treated HeLa cells as described (34.Workman J.L. Taylor I.C. Kingston R.E. Roeder R.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 419-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Trypsinized histone octamers and (H3/H4)2 tetramers were purified as described (33.Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E.

(H3/H4)2 tetramers were dialyzed against Buffer T (1m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) prior to array reconstitution. ySWI/SNF complex was purified from yeast strains CY396 or CY743(sin3Δ) as described in Logie and Peterson (31.Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The concentration of complex was determined to be approximately 300 nm by comparative Western blot and ATPase assays (31.Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). yRSC (10.Cairns B.R.

Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) were purified as described previously. Approximate concentrations were estimated from total protein concentration in the purified fractions and complexes were assumed to be 100% active. Thus, our concentration estimates are likely to be an overestimate. Most complexes had a high degree of purity, but in the case of hSWI/SNF A, purity was estimated to be ∼10%. We confirmed that the activity monitored was in fact due to hSWI/SNF by antibody inhibition, addition of antisera directed to the BRG1 subunit of hSWI/SNF eliminated remodeling activity, whereas addition of preimmune sera had no effect. 1D. Hill and A. N. Imbalzano, unpublished observations. For all the studies described here, each assay was performed with two independent preparations of each remodeling complex, with the exception of yRSC. Histone proteins used for array reconstitutions were analyzed by 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. Octamer concentrations were determined by A 230 (37.Stein A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 130: 103-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Histone octamers were reconstituted onto the 208-11S DNA templates (or 208-11S-Gal4 for recruitment assay) in a slide-a-lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce) by salt gradient dialysis as described previously (38.Hansen J.C. van Holde K.E. Lohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4276-4282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each repeat of the 208-11S template (or 208-11S-Gal4 for recruitment assay) is flanked by EcoRI restriction enzyme sites. In addition, a unique MspI site is located 30 base pairs from the predicted dyad axis of symmetry of each positioned nucleosome. Array quality, saturation, and positioning was determined by EcoRI or MspI digestion using approximately 20 nm array in Remodeling Buffer (5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol) as described previously (31.Logie C.

The gel was briefly soaked in 2 μg/ml ethidium bromide and photographed under ultraviolet illumination. Saturation of arrays was analyzed by digestion withEcoRI and comparison of the ratio of nucleosome bound repeat to uncomplexed 208-base pair 5 S repeat. Positioning was analyzed by digestion with MspI (32.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 39.Boyer L.A. Shao X. Ebright R.H. Peterson C.L. J.

Whereas, nucleosomal, trypsinized, and hyperacetylated arrays were inaccessible to digestion with MspI, (H3/H4)2 tetramer arrays digested with MspI released a mononucleosome size fragment indicating that the (H3/H4)2 tetramers protect less DNA as expected (40.Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). ATPase reactions were performed with respect to the optimal temperature for remodeling complex activity: 27 °C for xMi-2, dCHRAC, and dNURF, 30 °C for yRSC and ySWI/SNF, and 37 °C for hSWI/SNF using 100 μm ATP and 0.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.1% Tween, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as described (31.Logie C.

Released phosphate was monitored with time by resolution of Pi from ATP on plastic plates coated with PEI cellulose (EM Science) with 0.75 m KPO4 (pH 3.5) as solvent and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Coupled array remodeling-restriction reactions were performed in a final concentration of 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 500 units/ml HincII (New England Biolabs) as described previously (31.Logie C.

Assays were performed with respect to the optimal temperature for remodeling complex activity (see above). HincII cleavage was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis, and first-order rates were determined by curve fitting. In multiple independent experiments, the first-order rates of restriction enzyme cleavage for each particular combination of array and remodeler varied by less than 20%. In order to quantify the nucleosome remodeling activity of ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes, we have developed a biochemical assay where nucleosome remodeling activity is coupled to restriction enzyme activity such that remodeling is revealed as an enhancement of restriction enzyme cleavage rates (31.Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This assay uses a nucleosomal array substrate in which the central nucleosome of an 11-mer nucleosomal array contains a uniqueSalI/HincII site located at the predicted dyad axis of symmetry (31.Logie C.

Restriction enzyme kinetics are biphasic in this system; the first phase is rapid and reflects the fraction ofSalI/HincII restriction sites that are not occluded by a nucleosome (due primarily in our assays to nucleosomes that occupy minor translational positions; see Refs. 32.Logie C.

The second phase is slow and reflects a dynamic equilibrium between the occluded and “open” nucleosomal DNA states (44.Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 45.Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In previous studies, addition of yeast SWI/SNF and ATP stimulated the second phase of SalI/HincII digestion 20–30-fold (32.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 41.Logie C. Tse C. Hansen J.C. Peterson C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2514-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently we have found that SWI/SNF remodeling leads to a rapid redistribution of nucleosome positions within these arrays and that the apparent rate of remodeling determined in this assay provides an estimate of the rate of nucleosome mobilization (46.Jaskelioff M. Gavin I. Peterson C.L. Logie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3058-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Purified preparations of ySWI/SNF, yRSC, hSWI/SNF, dCHRAC, dNURF, and xMi-2 were analyzed in parallel for nucleosome-stimulated ATPase activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each complex was titrated in an ATPase reaction which contained 100 μm ATP and 12 nm of a reconstituted, 11-mer nucleosomal array. Surprisingly, the approximate concentration of each remodeling complex that was required to achieve equivalent velocities of ATP hydrolysis were similar; for ySWI/SNF (2 nm), yRSC (2 nm), hSWI/SNF (5 nm), dCHRAC (2 nm), and dNURF(4 nm), each complex catalyzed the hydrolysis of 450–600 nmol of ATP/min (Fig. 1 A, see also Ref. 41.Logie C. Tse C. Hansen J.C. Peterson C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2514-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). xMi-2 was slightly less active in this assay as ∼15 nm was required to achieve this level of ATPase activity (Fig. 1 A). Given that our estimates of active enzyme concentrations are only approximate (see “Experimental Procedures”), the data shown in Fig. 1 A indicate that each of these enzymes have nucleosome-stimulated ATPase activities that are similar within an order of magnitude. The similar levels of ATPase activity among complexes was unexpected given that each complex has different associated subunits which, at least in the case of the hSWI/SNF complex, can have a large impact on the ATPase activity of the catalytic subunit (i.e. BRG1; Ref. 28.Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). To assess the capacity of the six different complexes to remodel an 11-mer nucleosomal array, each remodeling enzyme (1–5 nmySWI/SNF, yRSC, hSWI/SNF, dCHRAC, dNURF, or 15 nm xMi-2) was added to 1.5 nm nucleosomal array and the initial rates of HincII digestion were measured in parallel reaction time courses in the presence of ATP. We found that all six complexes enhanced the rate of HincII digestion essentially equivalently (Fig. 1 B, see also Ref. 41.Logie C. Tse C. Hansen J.C. Peterson C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2514-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar for a detailed comparison of ySWI/SNF and yRSC). The dCHRAC complex reproducibly yielded an approximately 2-fold lower rate of HincII digestion than all other complexes which probably reflects the fact that a significant amount of the ATPase activity of dCHRAC appears to be contributed by topoisomerase II (see below). Since the initial rate of HincII digestion provides an indirect measurement of the rate of remodeling, these data indicate that all six enzymes use similar amounts of ATP to remodel nucleosomal arrays at similar rates. Furthermore, since it appears that this coupled restriction enzyme-remodeling assay monitors the rate of nucleosome mobilization (46.Jaskelioff M. Gavin I. Peterson C.L. Logie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3058-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), all six enzymes can apparently redistribute nucleosomes within an array at comparable rates. A hallmark of our nucleosomal array assay is that the SWI/SNF-dependent enhancement of restriction enzyme accessibility requires continuous ATP hydrolysis (32.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 46.Jaskelioff M. Gavin I. Peterson C.L. Logie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3058-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This requirement reflects a state of constant redistribution of nucleosome positions in the presence of ATP, and the subsequent inactivation of SWI/SNF “freezes” a random positioning of nucleosomes which is characterized by a general occlusion of restriction enzyme sites (46.Jaskelioff M. Gavin I. Peterson C.L. Logie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3058-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We carried out similar remodeling/“reversal” assays with hSWI/SNF, dCHRAC, dNURF, or xMi-2 and in all cases the enhanced rates ofHincII digestion were lost after ATP was enzymatically removed with apyrase (data not shown; for analysis of yRSC, see Ref.41.Logie C. Tse C. Hansen J.C. Peterson C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2514-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, these results indicate that all six complexes use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to create a dynamic, reversible state of nucleosome mobilization. Our results are consistent with previous demonstrations of mononucleosome mobilization catalyzed by ySWI/SNF (46.Jaskelioff M. Gavin I. Peterson C.L. Logie C. Mol. Cell.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3639-3649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key intermediate in cAMP signaling is cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA1 (15.Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). PKA acts as a key sensor of cellular cAMP levels and mediates the flow of signals to downstream effector pathways by phosphorylating their targets. PKA is a heterotetrameric holoenzyme composed of two catalytic subunits (C2) and a homodimer of regulatory subunits (R2). The R2 homodimer not only inhibits the catalytic activity of the C subunits but also stabilizes C subunits against proteolytic degradation in the PKA heterotetramer. Binding of cAMP to the R subunits of the holoenzyme results in dissociation of R and C subunits, which are then catalytically active. These general features of PKA signaling are shared by most eukaryotic organisms. PKA can be formed from several types of C and R subunits that can endow the PKA heterodimer with different signaling and subcellular localization properties. The three subtypes of C subunits (Cα, Cβ, and Cγ) have virtually identical kinetic and physiological properties (15.Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). By contrast, the different R subunit types, RI and RII, exhibit distinct cAMP binding affinities and are differentially localized in cells, leading to PKA holoenzymes termed PKAI or PKAII, respectively. PKAI holoenzyme is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas the majority of PKAII associates with cellular structures and organelles (16.Scott J.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 50: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This subcellular localization is largely mediated by anchoring of RII subunits to protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs). RII subunits bind to AKAPs with nanomolar affinity (17.Carre I.A. Edmunds Jr., L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2135-2137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas RI subunits only bind weakly to AKAPs (18.Burton K.A. Johnson B.D. Hausken Z.E. Westenbroek R.E. Idzerda R.L. Scheuer T. Scott J.D. Catterall W.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11067-11072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Adding to this complexity, higher vertebrates express two types of RI and RII genes that have different spatial patterns of expression (19.Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, genetic and molecular approaches have led to the identification of a type I R subunit (pka-RI) and three genes for catalytic subunit isoforms, pka-C1 (also known asDC0), pka-C2, and pka-C3 (20.Kalderon D. Rubin G.M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1539-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Both RI and RII PKA subunits have also been detected biochemically. PKA-RI is detectable during larval stages and early and mid-pupation (21.Foster J.L. Guttman J.J. Hall L.M. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although its transcripts can be detected in the adult mushroom bodies of the brain (5.Goodwin S.F. Del Vecchio M. Velinzon K. Hogel C. Russell S.R. Tully T. Kaiser K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8817-8827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this expression pattern, apka-RI mutant shows learning defects (5.Goodwin S.F. Del Vecchio M. Velinzon K. Hogel C. Russell S.R. Tully T. Kaiser K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8817-8827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKA-RII is expressed much more abundantly than PKA-RI in adultDrosophila (21.Foster J.L. Guttman J.J. Hall L.M. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its expression is largely restricted to the nervous system, where it is also preferentially expressed in mushroom bodies (22.Muller U. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 33: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Drosophila gene encoding PKA-RII has not been previously identified. From the analysis of pka-C1 and other cAMP signaling genes such as amnesiac (amn, a PACAP-like adenylate cyclase-activating peptide), pka-RI (5.Goodwin S.F. Del Vecchio M. Velinzon K. Hogel C. Russell S.R. Tully T. Kaiser K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8817-8827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rutabaga(rut, Ca2+/CaM-responsive adenylate cyclase), and dunce (dnc, cAMP phosphodiesterase), there is functional evidence for the involvement of cAMP signaling in learning and memory (3.Davis R.L. Cherry J. Dauwalder B. Han P.L. Skoulakis E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149-150: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), ovarian development (23.Lane M.E. Kalderon D.

Cell. 1998; 93: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) in Drosophila. In addition, PKA signaling functions in the widely used hedgehog signaling pathway (reviewed in Ref. 24.Perrimon N. Cell. 1996; 86: 513-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Despite the aforementioned analyses, separable roles for PKAIversus PKAII signaling have been difficult to discern. In mouse, knockout of the RIIβ gene leads to experience-dependent locomotor defects and hypersensitization to repeated amphetamine exposures (14.Brandon E.P. Logue S.F. Adams M.R. Qi M. Sullivan S.P. Matsumoto A.M. Dorsa D.M. Wehner J.M. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3639-3649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These phenotypes could be due to the loss of the RIIβ subunit, but there are compensatory increases in other RI and RII subunits that could also explain the effects. Similar compensation is seen in RIα-deficient mice (25.Amieux P.S. Cummings D.E. Motamed K. Brandon E.P. Wailes L.A. Le K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3993-3998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In flies, the pka-RI mutant shows a learning deficit, but this may not be the full extent of pka-RIfunctions, since this mutant retains significant PKA-RI expression (5.Goodwin S.F. Del Vecchio M. Velinzon K. Hogel C. Russell S.R. Tully T. Kaiser K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8817-8827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we identify the Drosophila pka-RII gene and mutations that virtually abolish its expression yet are homozygous-viable. We used these PKAII-deficient mutants to analyze the involvement of PKAII in various biological processes in Drosophila. The EP(2)2162 (26.Rorth P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12418-12422Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) line was obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP). For genetic background controls, randomly selected EP lines (EP(2)0844, EP(X)1529, and EP(X)1192) were used, as well asw 1118. Autophosphorylation analysis was carried out as described in Foster et al. (21.Foster J.L. Guttman J.J. Hall L.M. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, protein extracts were prepared from whole flies by homogenizing the frozen flies in Buffer A (5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and subsequently centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The protein concentration of supernatants was determined by the Bradford method. A volume of extract containing 30 μg of protein was incubated with 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) without additional cold ATP in the presence or absence of 10 μmcAMP in a total volume of 20 μl of Buffer B (10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 10 min on ice. The reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl of 2× SDS gel loading buffer. 20 μl of assay mixture was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. A volume of whole fly extract containing 15 μg of protein from each genotype was separated in an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked with 3% dried nonfat milk in TBS (25 mmTris, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, pH 8.0) for 30 min and incubated with anti-RII antiserum (generously provided by Dr. D. Kalderon) for 2 h. After washing three times with TBS, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit goat IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at room temperature and then washed with TBS three times. Immunoreactivity was visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Kodak Image Station CF440 (Eastman Kodak Co.) was used to develop the image and to analyze the relative density of signals. cAMP binding activity was measured by the method described in Kumon et al. (27.Kumon A. Nishiyama K. Yamamura H. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3726-3735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A volume of extract containing 30 μg of protein was incubated with 1 μCi of 3′,5′-(2′,8′-3H]cAMP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in a total volume of 100 μl of Buffer C (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 10 mm MgCl2) for 2 h on ice. Reaction mixtures were subsequently filtered through nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the filters were washed 10 times with Buffer C. The radioactivities of dried nitrocellulose filters were measured. A volume of extract containing 30 μg of protein was incubated with 50 μm Kemptide, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Life Technologies, Inc.), in a total volume of 40 μl of Buffer D (10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP supplemented with 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) in the presence and/or absence of 10 μm cAMP and 1 μm of PKA inhibitor-(6–22)-amide (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 min at 30 °C. Incorporation of phosphates to Kemptide was measured by spotting the 20 μl of assay mixture onto Whatman P-81 paper and subsequent washing with 1% phosphoric acid. Calculations of kinase activity were based on the fraction inhibited by PKA inhibitor-(6–22)-amide of total incorporation. To visualize nuclei, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining was performed according to the procedure of Ruohola et al. (48.Ruohola H. Bremer K.A. Baker D. Swedlow J.R. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1991; 66: 433-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To highlight cell outlines and ring canals, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was added at the same time as 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Male flies kept at 18 °C were exposed to four cycles of 12-h light–12-h dark (LD, where zeitgeber time 0 (ZT0) is lights on and 12 (ZT12) is light off), followed by 10–12 days in constant dark (DD) conditions in a locomotor activity monitor (Trikinetics, Waltham, MA). Wild type and mutant flies were tested simultaneously in a given experiment. The free running periods of individual flies during DD were estimated by χ2periodogram analyses. Only data from flies that survived to the end of the activity monitoring were used for further analyses. Humidified ethanol vapor from a 50% ethanol:H2O (v/v) solution was pumped in parallel into the top of two 50-ml tubes (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ). The tubes have a number of small holes near the bottom to allow escape of vapors. 30 unanesthetized male flies were transferred to each tube, and the number of flies immobilized on the bottom was counted every 5 min. In test runs, the identical genotypes run in parallel showed no significant difference in KO50, the time elapsed until 50% of flies are immobilized to the bottom of a tube. Ethanol in the whole body extracts was determined as described in Moore et al. (11.Moore M.S. DeZazzo J. Luk A.Y. Tully T. Singh C.M. Heberlein U. Cell. 1998; 93: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). A volume of extract containing 30 μg of protein was added to the 500 μl of alcohol reagent (Sigma) and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and absorbance at 340 nm was measured. This was converted to ethanol concentration by assaying ethanol standards provided by the manufacturer. Free-base cocaine was administered as described previously (28.McClung C. Hirsh J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 109-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To evoke the substantial initial response required for sensitization to the subsequent exposure in pka- RII EP(2)2162, higher doses of cocaine were used. The second exposure was given 6 h after the first exposure. To generate revertants, homozygouspka- RII EP(2)2162 flies were crossed with a transposase line (y, w; Bc/CyO, Δ2–3) and the male progeny with variegated eyes were collected and crossed withy, w; Gla/CyO. White eye progeny were collected and crossed individually with y, w; Gla/CyO and maintained as stocks. Reversion was verified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers (forward, 5′-GATGCGATCACCATAACGGCCCTTA-3′,and reverse, 5′-GCGCGAAGCTGGAGTTAATTTGCG A-3′) for the region that the P element had been inserted. Subsequent nucleotide sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products was carried out at the University of Virginia Health Science Center Biomolecular Research Facility. We identified a cDNA encoding a Drosophila homolog of a type II regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA-RII) in the BDGP EST data base through BLAST searches based on the primary protein sequences of known PKA-RII proteins. These searches identified a single cDNA clone, LD44591, in BDGP cDNA collections, which was subsequently sequenced in its entirety. The cDNA encodes a deduced 42.7-kDa protein that retains significant similarities to vertebrate PKA-RII proteins and the previously identified Drosophila PKA-RI (Fig.1). The most striking similarities are observed in four cyclic nucleotide-binding domain signatures (residues 151–167, 187–204, 269–285, and 309–326) that form two cAMP/cGMP-binding motifs (residues 124–239 and 242–362, indicated bybars in Fig. 1). Also observed is a PKA autophosphorylation site (residues 81–84, indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 1), a unique feature of type II PKA regulatory subunits (29.Rosen O.M. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7788-7794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also contains amino acid sequences that have been identified by peptide sequencing from biochemically purified Drosophila PKA-RII (30.Inoue H. Yoshioka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), indicated by dashes in Fig. 1). Genomic DNA sequences corresponding toDrosophila PKA-RII cDNA were retrieved from the BDGP genomic sequence data base, and polymerase chain reaction amplification and subsequent DNA sequencing were carried out to determine the full genomic DNA sequence. Ten exons are dispersed throughout the >15-kilobase pair genomic region that is localized in the proximal part of chromosome 2R in polytene region 46D1–46D2 (Fig.2 A). The data base searches also led to the identification of a P insertion mutant, EP(2)2162, inserted 89 base pairs upstream of the predicted transcription start site corresponding to the sequence of LD44591 clone in a position that could block transcription of pka-RII. This insertion line is homozygous-viable and fertile with no obvious behavioral or developmental phenotypes. To see the effect of this insertion on the expression of PKA-RII protein, we tested the cAMP-sensitive autophosphorylation of PKA-RII in whole fly extracts from wild type and EP(2)2162 lines (see “Experimental Procedures”). ATP concentration in the reactions was maintained low enough to allow predominant intramolecular RII autophosphorylation that is blocked by cAMP addition and subsequent C subunit dissociation (31.Rangel-Aldao R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7526-7529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation reaction leads to the phosphorylation of ∼57- and ∼70-kDa proteins (Fig.2 B). The 57-kDa protein, which is phosphorylated in a cAMP-sensitive manner, is reduced by >95% in the EP(2)2162 extracts (Fig. 2 B), and the phosphorylation of the 70-kDa protein is increased about 2-fold. Given that cAMP-sensitive phosphorylation occurs only on the PKA-RII that is electrophoretically determined to be about ∼52 kDa in its dephosphoform and ∼57 kDa in its phosphoform in Drosophila (21.Foster J.L. Guttman J.J. Hall L.M. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this result indicates that EP(2)2162 does not express a functional PKA-RII. Consistent with this, by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2 C), RII immunoreactivity is reduced ∼10-fold in EP(2)2162 extract. In addition, the EP(2)2162 extract contains significantly reduced cAMP binding activity (Fig.2 D) attributable to the absence of PKA-RII, a major cellular cAMP-binding protein (32.Kuo J.F. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Taken together, the EP element in EP(2)2162 disrupts the normal expression of PKA-RII causing a severe, if not null, mutation of pka-RII, which we subsequently refer to as pka-RII EP(2)2162. Since BLAST searches against the Drosophila euchromatic genomic sequence data base fail to show any additional pka-RII candidate genes (data not shown), pka-RII EP(2)2162 likely represents the first animal in which PKAII activity is effectively eliminated. We note that the PKA-RII cDNA encodes a deduced 42.7-kDa protein, significantly smaller than the apparent size by electrophoretic mobility. A similar size discrepancy is observed in bovine PKA-RII, with deduced molecular mass of 45 kDa and apparent molecular mass of 58 kDa (33.Takio K. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2544-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This suggests that the structural properties of PKA-RII proteins that induce the size discrepancy are conserved among these diverse organisms. In mouse, loss of PKA regulatory subunits by genetic manipulations leads to reduction of cAMP-inducible PKA activity mainly due to proteolytic degradation of free PKA C subunits (25.Amieux P.S. Cummings D.E. Motamed K. Brandon E.P. Wailes L.A. Le K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3993-3998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and compensatory up-regulation of the other PKA regulatory subunits (14.Brandon E.P. Logue S.F. Adams M.R. Qi M. Sullivan S.P. Matsumoto A.M. Dorsa D.M. Wehner J.M. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3639-3649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the effect of selective loss of PKA-RII on PKA activity inpka-RII EP(2)2162, we assayed PKA activity in the total protein extracts from wild type andpka-RII EP(2)2162 whole flies (Fig.3). In the absence of exogenous cAMP, the low basal level of PKA activity is significantly increased in thepka-RII EP(2)2162 extract (Fig. 3 a), consistent with an increase in free C subunits due to loss of RII subunits. However, in the presence 10 μm cAMP, thepka-RII EP(2)2162 extract shows only ∼40% of the activity seen in wild type extract (Fig. 3 b). The inducibility of PKA activity by excess cAMP is ∼70-fold in extracts from wild type flies and ∼12-fold in extracts frompka-RII EP(2)2162 with the reduction of cAMP action attributable to the loss of this major cAMP signaling component. Since defects in oogenesis have previously been reported for hypomorphicpka-C1, a PKA catalytic subunit mutant (23.Lane M.E. Kalderon D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1229-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 34.Lane M.E. Kalderon D. Mech. Dev. 1995; 49: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we investigated whether pka-RII EP(2)2162 ovaries show similar phenotypes (Fig. 4). Approximately 43% (n = 150) of ovarioles frompka-RII EP(2)2162 flies show defects in follicle formation and maturation. These defects include multinucleate nurse cells, too many or too few nurse cells within a follicle, absence of interfollicular stalks, and an abnormally large number of somatic epithelial cells at the posterior end of the follicle. These phenotypes are very similar, but not identical, to those seen in pka-C1mutants. In pka-C1 ovaries, multinucleate nurse cells often still contain the ring canal that would have connected the two nurse cells (34.Lane M.E. Kalderon D. Mech. Dev. 1995; 49: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but in pka-RII EP(2)2162 ovaries, multinucleate cells (brackets, Fig. 4, b andd) have no internal ring canals. Follicles with multinucleate cells also seem to have fewer nurse cells than normal.pka-RII EP(2)2162 homozygotes also have large follicles where double and triple the normal number of nurse cells is observed, and often, these follicles are not separated from the next follicle by an interfollicular stalk. The similarities betweenpka-C1 and pka-RII EP(2)2162 phenotypes indicate that PKAII is a major contributor to PKA signaling during ovarian development. PKA is also involved in the maintenance of locomotor circadian rhythmicity in Drosophila, functioning downstream of the brain-based circadian pacemaker in an output pathway (9.Majercak J. Kalderon D. Edery I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5915-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We analyzed locomotor rhythmicity of pka-RII EP(2)2162. About 42% of pka-RII EP(2)2162 flies retain normal circadian rhythmicity in constant environmental conditions (Fig.5 C), consistent with the locomotor analyses of pka-C1 (9.Majercak J. Kalderon D. Edery I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5915-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), a PKA catalytic subunit mutant. pka-RII EP(2)2162 entrains normally to LD conditions but the rhythmicity rapidly dampens through following DD conditions (Fig. 5 B). In 42% of flies showing rhythmicity, a normal period of ∼23.7 h is observed. About 85% of wild type and randomly selected EP lines consistently show normal rhythmicity (Fig. 5, A and C, data not shown). Functional evidence for the involvement of cAMP signal transduction pathway in the ethanol intoxication inDrosophila has been reported (11.Moore M.S. DeZazzo J. Luk A.Y. Tully T. Singh C.M. Heberlein U. Cell. 1998; 93: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Mutations in the geneamn, which is thought to encode a positive regulator of cAMP signaling, increase sensitivity to ethanol intoxication, as assayed by increased rate of passing through an inebriometer. We devised a simple apparatus that allows comparison of ethanol intoxication sensitivity of two groups of flies in parallel, by measuring time for flies to fall to the bottom of a tube through which humidified ethanol vapor is pumped (see “Experimental Procedures”). Multiple alleles of amnwere tested using this apparatus. Consistent with the previous report using the inebriometer (11.Moore M.S. DeZazzo J. Luk A.Y. Tully T. Singh C.M. Heberlein U. Cell. 1998; 93: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), these amn alleles show shorter KO50 time than wild type or random EP lines (data not shown). In contrast, pka-RII EP(2)2162 shows robust resistance to ethanol (Fig.6 A) with ∼6 min longer KO50 time than wild type flies (Fig. 6 B). To verify that the observed phenotype is not due to the altered ethanol permeability or metabolism rate, the amount of ethanol in the whole body extracts of pka-RII EP(2)2162 and wild type lines was measured (see “Experimental Procedures”). There are no significant differences in permeability and metabolism rates betweenpka-RII EP(2)2162 and wild type lines (data not shown). In vertebrates, PKA signaling is a key pathway modulating responses to chronic administration of cocaine. We tested the responsiveness of pka-RII EP(2)2162 to cocaine, a potent motor stimulant in flies (28.McClung C. Hirsh J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 109-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The response ofpka- RII EP(2)2162 to the first dose of cocaine is much lower than that of wild type flies and other randomly selected EP lines (Fig. 7). Significantly higher doses of cocaine (180–200 μg) are required to elicit substantial initial responses, which are induced at 75–90 μg of cocaine in wild type lines. Furthermore, subsequent doses of cocaine failed to elicit robust sensitization in pka-RII EP(2)2162 flies, whereas wild type flies show prominent sensitization (Fig. 7), measured as an enhanced response to the second cocaine exposure. To ascertain that the phenotypes reported are due to the EP(2)2162 element, multiple complete and partial revertants were recovered by mobilizing the P element inpka-RII EP(2)2162 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Phenotypes were analyzed against their background strain (y,w) and parental strain (pka-RII EP(2)2162). Complete revertants,pka-RII rev7 and pka-RII rev23, show none of the behavioral and developmental defects that are observed in pka-RII EP(2)2162 (data not shown). Similarly, imprecise excision of the P element resulting in deletion extending to the pka-RII gene yields biochemical and behavioral phenotypes indistinguishable frompka-RII EP(2)2162, indicating thatpka- RII EP(2)2162 is a severely hypomorphic, if not a null, mutant. Type II PKA is the predominant isoform in adult Drosophila (21.Foster J.L. Guttman J.J"

In the present study, we reinvestigated activation of stripped steroid receptors isolated from either L cells or WCL2 cells. Surprisingly, we found, using highly purified proteins, that only Hsp90 and Hsc70 are required for the activation of glucocorticoid receptors in the presence of steroids; in the absence of steroids, either p23 or molybdate are also required as reported previously. Addition of Hop or Ydj1 had no affect on the rate or magnitude of the activation of the stripped receptors, and quantitative Western blots confirmed that neither Hop or Hsp40 were present in our protein preparations or in the stripped receptors. Furthermore, a truncated recombinant Hsp70 that does not bind Hop or Hsp40 was as effective as wild-type Hsp70 in activating stripped receptor. Since Hsc70 does not bind directly to Hsp90 but both proteins bind to Hop, it has been suggested that Hop acts as a bridge between Hsp90 and Hsp70. However, we found that after Hsc70 or Hsp90 bind directly to the stripped receptors, they are fully reactivated by Hsp90 or Hsc70, respectively. We, therefore, conclude that Hsp90 and Hsc70 bind independently to stripped glucocorticoid receptors and alone are sufficient to activate them to bind steroids.

GR1 isolated from the cytosol in such multi-protein complexes bind glucocorticoid, but, when the receptors are immunoadsorbed and then stripped of Hsp90 and other associated proteins by treatment with high salt, they no longer do so (3.Hutchison K.A.

Although addition of Hsp90 to the stripped receptors does not reactivate them, they can be reactivated by treating them with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) in the presence of ATP (3.Hutchison K.A.

Chemp. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, considerable effort has gone into determining what factors in RRL, in addition to Hsp90, are required for reactivation of immunoadsorbed stripped GR (5.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Fractionation of RRL and reactivation of stripped GR with the various fractions revealed that, in addition to ATP, three proteins are essential for reactivation of stripped GR: Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hop (5.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Pratt and associates (6.Hutchison, K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) suggested that these three proteins bind together in a complex termed the foldosome. They then suggested that the foldosome interacts with the hormone binding domain of GR in an ATP-dependent reaction that activates its hormone binding activity, possibly by partially unfolding the hormone-binding domain exposing its steroid binding site. Since Hsp70 does not directly interact with Hsp90, it was thought that Hop mediated the binding of Hsp70 to Hsp90 in the foldosome (7.Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9.Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In addition to the three proteins, Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hop, that form the foldosome, two additional proteins, p23 and Hsp40 (Ydj1), have been reported to be involved in activating hormone binding by GR (5.Dittmar K.D.

Although Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hop alone are able to activate GR, the activated receptors are unstable. Therefore, unless steroids are actually present during the activation process, the receptors will not bind steroids unless a fourth protein, p23, is present and binds to Hsp90 to stabilize the activated receptor complex (5.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 7.Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar); for reasons that are not clear, molybdate can substitute for p23 in this stabilization reaction (8.Dittmar K.D.

Although a basal level of activation can be achieved by Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hop, Pratt and associates showed that catalytic amounts of a J-domain protein such as Ydj1 increase the level of activation (11.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). J-domain proteins often act as partner proteins of Hsp70, by facilitating the binding of substrates to Hsp70, but the mechanism of action of J-domain proteins in facilitating activation of steroid receptors by Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hop is unclear. BAG-1 also modulates the ability of GR to bind hormone in a concentration-dependent manner (12.Kanelakis K.C. Morishima Y. Dittmar K.D. Galigniana M.D. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34134-34140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). There are several difficulties with the foldosome model for activation of GR. First, in contrast to Hsp70 and Hsp90, Hop apparently acts catalytically rather than stoichiometrically in activating the progesterone receptors and perhaps GR as well (25.Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth C.M. McMahan N. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Second, in contrast to Hsp90 and possibly Hsp70, Hop is not present in the activated steroid receptor complex (1.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar, 14.Pratt W.B. Dittmar K.D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Third, there is strong evidence that Hsp70 as well as Hsp90 can bind directly to GR (1.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar, 15.Srinivasan G. Post J.F.M. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Chem. 1990; 265 (10130): 20123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), raising questions as to whether a complex of Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hop (26.Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honoré B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is indeed required for activation. Finally, elimination of Sti1, the homolog of Hop in yeast, had no effect on the formation of the Hsp70-Hsp90-steroid receptor complex in vivo (17.Chang H.C.J. Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 17: 318-325Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has been studying the properties of various Hsp70s mutated at their active sites. Preparatory to studying the ability of these Hsp70 mutants to participate in reactivation of stripped GR, we reinvestigated the reactivation process using highly purified Hsc70, Hsp90, Hop, and the J-domain protein Ydj1. To our surprise, we found that we could reactivate the stripped GR with just highly purified Hsp70 and Hsp90; Hop was not required, and Ydj1 reduced rather than increased the level of activation. We conclude that Hsp70 and Hsp90 bind directly and independently to GR, and the binding of these two proteins is all that is required to reactivate the stripped receptors to bind steroids.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), except that the purified Hsp90 was passed through the hydroxylapatite column twice to remove any contaminant Hop. Human p23 was purified from bacterial lysate by chromatography on DE52 as described (21.Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing p23 were identified by SDS-PAGE pooled, concentrated by ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against buffer C (20 mmimidazole, pH 7.0, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm ammonium sulfate, 1 mmdithiothreitol), aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. Ydj1 was purified from E. coli as described previously (22.King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Biol.

L929 mouse fibroblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced saline solution and suspended in 1.5 volumes of buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.35, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmsodium molybdate, and 1 tablet of Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture plus 5 ml of buffer. Cells were ruptured by Dounce homogenization and centrifuged for 30 min at 37,000 rpm to prepare the cytosol. The supernatant was aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. WCL2 cell cytosol was provided by Gordan Hager's laboratory (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). GR was immunoadsorbed at 4 °C from either WCL2 or L929 cell cytosol using either FiGR or BuGR2 antibodies prebound with protein A-Sepharose. GR was stripped of the associated proteins by incubating the immune pellets with TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 0.5 m NaCl and subsequent washing with TEG buffer and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Immune pellets containing GR stripped of Hsp90 and associated proteins were incubated with 50 μl of RRL or with various mixtures of proteins (5 μm Hsp90, 1 μm Hsp70, 1 μm Hop, 5 μm p23, and Ydj1 if necessary) and adjusted to 50 μl with HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.35), containing 20 mm sodium molybdate, 5 mm ATP, 25 mm creatine phosphate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase. The assay mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes using a rotator. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer with 5 mm dithiothreitol (TEG buffer with 20 mm sodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid-binding capacity and, in some experiments, for receptor-associated proteins. Immune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in 100 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 20 mm molybdate plus 50 nm[3H]triamcinolone acetonide. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM buffer and counted by liquid scintillation. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide bound per FiGR immune pellet from 100 μl of cytosol. To assay GR and associated proteins, immune pellets were resolved on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with 2 μg/ml BuGR2 for GR, 1 μg/ml for hsp90, 1 μg/ml for Hsc70, 1 μg/ml DS14F5 mouse ascites for Hop, and 1 μg/ml of anti-Hsp40 antibody. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counter antibody, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by ECL. In the experiments on reactivation of GR by RRL or purified proteins, we employed essentially the same procedure used by Pratt and associates (5.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) except that they activated the receptor at 30 °C and incubated overnight with hormone, whereas we activated at 25 °C and incubated with hormone for 2 h. However, we found no difference in our results whether we used their procedure or our own. We immunoadsorbed receptors from the cytosol of either WCL2 cells or L cells using BuGR2, stripped them with 0.5 m NaCl, and then reconstituted the heterocomplex by incubating the stripped receptors with either RRL or purified proteins at 25 °C. We routinely obtained 80–100% restoration of steroid binding activity with RRL and about 50–60% reconstitution with pure proteins, i.e. about 60–65% of the activity obtained with RRL (Fig.1, A and B). Surprisingly, where our results significantly differ from those of Pratt's laboratory is that, with both steroid receptors obtained from WCL2 cells (Fig. 1 A) and from L cells (Fig. 1 B), addition of purified Hop to stripped receptor did not significantly affect restoration of steroid binding activity of the receptor by the purified proteins. Furthermore, the activation of GR for hormone binding occurred even in the absence of p23. As observed by Pratt's laboratory (7.Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 8.Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), when reconstitution of the stripped receptors was carried out in the presence of steroids, it was not necessary for p23 to be present because, even though the reconstituted receptor complex is unstable in the absence of p23, it binds steroid before its activated conformation decays. Our results show that both with steroid receptors obtained from WCL2 cells (Fig.2 A) and with those from L cells (Fig. 2 B), we obtained the activation of GR not only in the absence of p23 but also in the absence of Hop. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that Hop is not required for activation of stripped receptors; Hsp90 and Hsc70 alone are sufficient for reactivation of GR for hormone binding. Although our results showed that Hop is not necessary for reactivation of the stripped GR, it still was possible that it might increase the rate of reactivation. We, therefore, measured the rate of reactivation using purified proteins both in the presence and absence of Hop. Our results (Fig. 3) showed that, as previously reported for reactivation by RRL, the rate of reactivation of the stripped receptor by purified Hsp90, Hsc70, p23, and Hop had a half-life of about 2 min. Furthermore, we found that the rate of reactivation was almost identical in the absence of Hop. Therefore, Hop is not only unnecessary for reactivation, it also does not affect the rate of reactivation by Hps90, Hsc70, and p23. Although the foldosome model (1.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar, 6.Hutchison, K. A., Dittmar, K. D., and Pratt, W. B. (1994) 269, 27894–27899Google Scholar) implies that approximately equal amounts of Hop, Hsp70, and Hsp90 are required for reactivation of stripped GR, reactivation of the stripped progesterone receptor required much less Hop than Hsp70 and Hsp90; only a 1:1 molar ratio of Hop to progesterone receptor was required (25.Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth C.M. McMahan N. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To determine whether this level of Hop was present in the stripped GR or in the purified Hsc70 and Hsp90 used in the reconstitution experiments, we carried out quantitative Western blots (Fig. 4). These experiments were carried out with 80 nm active GR plus either 1 μm Hsc70, 5 μm Hsp90, or both present. In addition, we determined the level of Hop present in the purified Hsc70 and Hsp90 in the absence of receptor. Before stripping, 80 nm active GR contained only about 0.4 nm Hop (Fig. 4 B, lane 1) in agreement with other studies, suggesting that even unstripped receptors contain only a small amount of Hop since it appears to be transiently associated with the activated complex. Following stripping, Hop was undetectable by Western blotting showing that the stripped receptors contained much less than the 0.2 nm Hop standard (Fig. 4 B,lane 9). Furthermore, after Hsc70, Hsp90, or both were added to the receptors, Hop was still undetectable nor was Hop detectable in the purified Hsc70 or Hsp90. We also performed this experiment using recombinant Hsp90 from baculovirus/Sf9 cells and recombinant Hsp70 from E. coli, and again we obtained similar levels of reactivation of the GR. Therefore, the level of Hop present in our reactivation experiments was less than 0.25% of the active steroid receptor and less than 0.1% of the Hsc70 and Hsp90 present, strongly suggesting that our results are not due to the presence of catalytic amounts of Hop. There is evidence that Hop binds to the 10-kDa C-terminal end of Hsc70 (24.Demand J. Luders J. Hohfeld J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Therefore, assuming that Hsp70 and Hsc70 act similarly in this regard, a truncated Hsp70 missing its 10-kDa C-terminal end should be as effective as wild-type Hsp70 in the reactivation process if Hop is not required for reactivation of GR. When we tested this prediction, our results showed that wild-type and truncated Hsp70 were equally effective in reactivation of GR and, furthermore, in neither case did Hop have a significant effect on reactivation (Fig.5). These data provide further evidence that Hop is not required for reactivation of GR. The 10-kDa C-terminal end of Hsc70 not only binds Hop but also the J-domain protein Hsp40 (24.Demand J. Luders J. Hohfeld J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Therefore, our observation that the truncated Hsp70 was as effective as wild-type Hsp70 in reactivating GR suggests that, like Hop, J- domain proteins may also have little or no effect on reactivation of GR. To investigate this question, we first determined the level of contaminant Hdj1 present in our mixture of GR, Hsc70, and Hsp90. Based on the quantitative Western blots in Fig.6, we estimated that 80 nmactive GR contained less than 0.04 nm Hsp40. This small amount of Hsp40 was removed when the receptor was stripped. However, upon readdition of 1 μm Hsc70, 5 μm Hsp90, or both, we found that the level of Hsp40 returned to about 0.04 nm, less than 0.1% of the active GR and less than 0.01% of the Hsc70 and Hsp90. Since, in previous studies, the maximum effect of the J-domain protein Ydj1 occurred at levels approximately equal to that of active receptor and about one-tenth the level of Hsp70 and Hsp90 (11.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 24.Demand J. Luders J. Hohfeld J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), it seems highly unlikely that the small amount of Hsp40 present in our system affected reactivation of GR. In agreement with this view, we found that addition of 0.25 or 1 μmYdj1 decreased rather than increased reactivation of GR (Fig.7). Likewise, addition of recombinant Hdj1 also did not affect the reactivation of GR (data not shown). We find, therefore, that, like Hop, Hsp40 does not play a significant role in reactivation of stripped GR.Figure 7Activation of GR in the absence of Ydj1.GR was immunoadsorbed from 100 μl of WCL2 cell cytosol, receptor-associated proteins were stripped from the immune pellets with 0.5 m NaCl, and the immune pellets were then incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with buffer (lane 1); RRL (lane 2); purified Hsp90, Hsc70, p23, ATP, and 0 (lane 3), 0.25 μm (lane 4), or 1 μm (lane 5) Ydj1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since our results suggest that only Hsc70 and Hsp90 are required for reactivation of GR and both Hsc70 and Hsp90 bind directly to GR, we were interested in determining whether, following the binding of one of these two proteins to the receptor, reactivation would occur when the second protein bound. Such an experiment can only be carried out if, following stripping, the receptor does not irreversibly denature while it is being incubated with the first protein at 25 °C before the second protein is added. Therefore, we first tested whether the stripped receptor retains its ability to be reactivated when incubated for various times at 25 °C. We found that, following incubation of the stripped receptor for 1 h at 25 °C, it could still be fully reactivated by RRL (data not shown). Similarly, incubation of the stripped receptor for 20 min at 25 °C had no effect on its ability to be reconstituted with purified proteins (Fig.8, lanes 2 and3). Therefore, the stripped receptor does not irreversibly denature when incubated at 25 °C. We next incubated the stripped receptor with Hsp90 and p23 at 25 °C in the presence and absence of ATP and then removed unbound Hsp90 and p23. In agreement with other studies, we found that stripped receptor with bound Hsp90 and p23 was completely inactive (data not shown). However, when the receptor with bound Hsp90 and p23 was then incubated with Hsc70 in the presence of ATP, it regained considerable steroid binding activity particularly when the initial incubation with Hsp90 and p23 was carried out in the presence of ATP (Fig. 8,lanes 4 and 5). Similar results were obtained when the stripped receptor was first incubated with Hsc70, unbound Hsc70 removed, and then Hsp90 and p23 added in the presence of ATP. No activity was observed following the initial incubation with Hsc70, but considerable activity was recovered following incubation with Hsp90 and p23 in the presence of ATP. Interestingly, more activity was recovered when the stripped receptor was incubated with Hsc70 in the absence than in the presence of ATP, possibly because somewhat more Hsc70 was initially bound to the receptor in the absence of ATP. In the present study, we showed that GR isolated from either WCL2 cells or L cells and stripped of their associated proteins can be reconstituted in the presence of ATP with the addition of only two proteins, Hsc70 and Hsp90. In earlier studies on reconstitution of GR, others found that, in addition to Hsc70 and Hsp90, reconstitution of stripped GR required Hop (5.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B.

Since Hsp70 does not bind directly to Hsp90, it was suggested that Hop linked Hsp70 to Hsp90 in a complex, the foldosome (5.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

A., Dittmar, K. D., and Pratt, W. B. (1994) 269, 27894–27899Google Scholar, 7.Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the studies on Hop, Pratt and associates (5.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) used a bacterial extract containing recombinant Hop rather than purified Hop. Therefore, it was not clear from their data whether Hop acted stoichiometrically with Hsp70 and Hsp90, as might be expected from the foldosome model, or whether it acted at a much lower concentration. In the latter case, it is possible that, as our data suggest, Hsp70 and Hsp90 play a unique role in reconstitution of GR with Hop only playing a modulatory role. Even in this case, however, our data differ in that we were able to reconstitute GR in the complete absence of Hop and, moreover, we could not detect any significant difference in the rate of reactivation in the presence and absence of Hop. This difference from the results of Pratt and associates may be related to the fact that GR can assume multiple conformations, and this may particularly be the case for the stripped receptor. Therefore, it is possible that subtle differences in the conformation of GR may account for whether or not Hop plays a modulatory role in the reconstitution of GR by Hsp90 and Hsp70. In this regard, the GR and progesterone receptors differ significantly in their properties following stripping of Hsp90 and associated proteins, perhaps because here, too, subtle differences occur in the conformations of the two receptors. In contrast to GR, which immediately loses its ability to bind substrate following stripping but can then be reactivated, the progesterone receptor retains its ability to bind substrate following stripping and only slowly loses this activity during incubation at 25 °C. However, once it loses its activity, in contrast to GR, it cannot be reactivated. Toft and associates (25.Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth C.M. McMahan N. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) have shown that if Hsp90, Hsp70, Hop, and Ydj1 are present during incubation at 25 °C, the progesterone receptor does not lose its substrate binding ability. Interestingly, in these studies (25.Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth C.M. McMahan N. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), although Hop and Ydj1 were required along with Hsp70 and Hsp90 to maintain the activity of the progesterone receptor, they were not required at stoichiometric levels equal to Hsp70 and Hsp90, as might be expected if they were components of a foldosome. Rather, they were present at much lower concentrations, about equal to the concentration of the progesterone receptor. Therefore, although the earlier data suggest that Hop and Ydj1 play a modulatory role in maintaining the activity of the stripped progesterone receptor, Hsp70 and Hsp90 appear to be the primary proteins required for maintaining its activity in agreement with our results on GR. This view is also supported by data showing that the yeast homolog of Hop, Sti1, is not required for activation of GR in vivo (17.Chang H.C.J. Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 17: 318-325Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Based on our data showing that Hsc70 and Hsp90 bind independently to GR and that the order of their binding has little effect on reactivation of the stripped receptor, we propose, as shown in Fig.9, that Hsc70 and Hsp90 bind to separate sites on the stripped receptor and that this binding in the presence of ATP is sufficient to reactivate the stripped receptor. Future studies using mutant Hsp70s and purified GR will be required to determine whether both ATP binding and hydrolysis by Hsc70 are required for reconstitution of the stripped receptor.

The adhesiveness of β2 integrins can be transiently stimulated after cellular activation through receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors and can be stably activated with phorbol esters, Mn2+, or activating mAb. The mechanisms of activation of β2 integrins appear to include both conformational changes that regulate the affinity or multivalent affinity (avidity) for ligand and association with the cytoskeleton. Regions in the N-terminal segments of integrin α and β subunits are important for ligand binding. All integrin α subunits contain seven repeats of ∼60 residues each that are predicted to fold into a β-propeller domain containing seven β-sheets (7.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Some integrins, including the leukocyte integrins, contain a functionally important inserted (I) domain between β-propeller sheets 2 and 3. The I domain has a doubly twisted fold that is found in nucleotide-binding enzymes and G proteins, with a central hydrophobic β-sheet surrounded by amphipathic α-helices (8.Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 9.Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C.

Five residues in a central pocket coordinate with Mg2+ either directly or via water molecules to form a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). During ligand binding, the sixth coordination position of the Mg2+is hypothesized to be occupied by an acidic residue in the ligand (8.Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). This residue in ICAM-1 is likely to correspond to Glu-34, which is by far the most critical residue for binding to LFA-1 (12.Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Mutation in I domains of the residues that form the primary or secondary coordination shell of the Mg2+ abolishes ligand binding (reviewed in Ref. 8.Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Specificity for ICAM-1 maps to amino acid residues on either side of the Mg2+ (13.Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mAbs that map to the I domain, but not mAbs that map to surrounding regions in the β-propeller domain, block ligand binding by LFA-1 (13.Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These results show that the I domain in the α subunit of LFA-1 constitutes a ligand binding interface for ICAM-1. The domain structure for integrin β subunits is less well defined than for α subunits. A region that is highly conserved among integrin β subunits is located between residues 104 and 341 of the β2 subunit. This region is 94% identical between mouse and human β2, and amino acid substitutions that cause LAD map to this region (reviewed in Ref. 14.Bilsland C.A.G. Springer T.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ligand cross-linking, mutational, and mAb mapping studies suggest that this conserved region is functionally important (15.Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25235-25238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Shih D.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A MIDAS-like DXSXS motif is present in the conserved region, and the conserved region has been proposed to have an I domain-like fold (8.Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 18.Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mutation of the Asp and two Ser residues of the DXSXS motif as well as other residues in the conserved region with oxygenated side chains abolishes ligand binding in several β integrins. Alignment of hydropathy plots shows good similarity between the first half of the α subunit I domain and the β subunit conserved region (8.Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar); however, the second half diverges, suggesting that there are important structural differences in this region. The end of the putative I-like domain is therefore difficult to define. The only previously published three-dimensional model of an I-like domain, for that of the β3 subunit (18.Tozer E.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21978-21984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), proposed that it terminated at the equivalent of residue 284 in β2. A different structure-sequence alignment has been proposed that places the domain terminus at residue 341 (19.Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); however, no specific three-dimensional model was proposed. Cysteine-rich regions are present N-terminal and C-terminal to the β-subunit I-like domain and are linked by a long range disulfide bond. The N-terminal cysteine-rich region is homologous to a repeat found in plexins, semaphorins, and integrins (PSI domain) (20.Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). mAbs that activate integrins have been mapped to the C-terminal cysteine-rich region in β1 and β3 integrins (21.Du X.

Romer J.T. Spitali M. Shock A. Ortlepp S. Figdor C. Robinson M.K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Epitopes for several other activating mAbs defined for β2 integrins, CBR LFA-1/2 (28.Petruzzelli L. Maduzia L. Springer T. J.

Immunol. 1993; 23: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), have not been well localized. While there is no evidence that it participates in ligand binding, the C-terminal region may be important in transducing signals from inside the cell that regulate ligand binding. To explore the structure and function of the β2 subunit, we have mapped epitopes of a panel of 17 mouse anti-human β2 mAbs and one rat anti-mouse β2 mAb, including function-blocking, nonblocking, and activating mAbs. Nonblocking mAbs map outside the I-like domain, and activating mAbs map to the C-terminal region. The function-blocking antibodies map to the I-like domain, and we have been able to define individual human/mouse amino acid substitutions responsible for five different antibody epitopes in this region. Several epitopes involve residues that are distant in the primary structure and provide constraints on the folding of this region that are used to predict its structure, in conjunction with secondary structure and threading prediction algorithms, sequence-structure alignments, and molecular modeling.

Trowbridge (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA). Both human and murine β2 cDNA were in AprM8 (13.Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Chimeras were named according to the species origin of their segments. For example, h98m indicates that residues 1–98 are from the human β subunit and residues 99 to the C terminus are from the mouse β subunit. Amino acid sequence numbering was according to the mature human sequence (42.Kishimoto T.K. O'Connor K. Lee A. Roberts T.M. Springer T.A. Cell. 1987; 48: 681-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The primers used for generating chimeras and substitution mutants are listed in Table I. In most of the cases, silent mutations were introduced into the primers to create a restriction site for testing of incorporation of the mutations. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to construct chimeras h612m, m612h, m521h, m122h, m163h, and h254m. To construct h612m, a DNA fragment from residue 612 to the C terminus of murine β2 subunit (mβ2) was generated by PCR, digested with BstBI andNotI, and ligated to a 7.7-kilobase pair DNA fragment generated from human β2 (hβ2) with the same enzymes. Chimeras m612h and m521h were constructed by insertion of PCR fragments (HindIII-612 or HindIII-521) amplified from mβ2 into HindIII and BstBI or HindIII andEco47III sites of hβ2. The HindIII site is located on the 5′ end of the cloning site of the vector AprM8. Constructs m122h and m163h were made by insertion of the PCR fragments (HindIII-122 or HindIII-163) from mβ2 into HindIII sites created in the human to mouse mutants R122N or D163E. h254m was made by ligation of a PCR fragment (KasI–MluI) from mβ2 into the KasI and MluI sites of h344m.Table INucleotide sequences used for constructing the human/mouse chimeras or point mutantsMutantsOverlap sequences aThe complementary overlap sequences of primers for overlap extension PCR.

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). In brief, two successive PCRs were used to generate a chimeric fragment, which was then digested with restriction enzymes and ligated into the hβ2, mβ2, or certain chimeric constructs. In the first PCR, two separate PCRs were used to generate one fragment from hβ2 and a neighboring fragment from mβ2. Two oligonucleotide primers at the overlap region were complementary for at least 24 bases. A silent substitution in the sequence of the overlap oligonucleotide was included to introduce a restriction site for screening of clones and for construction of subsequent chimeras. Chimeras h344m and m344h were constructed by inserting chimeric PCR fragments into HindIII and BstBI sites on h612m or hβ2, respectively. A silent mutation was included to introduce a MluI site on residue 344. The constructs, h302m, h163m, and h98m, or m302h and m254h, were made by insertion of the chimeric PCR fragments into restriction sitesHindIII and MluI in h344m or m344h, respectively. To facilitate the construction of point mutants in the conserved region, a silent mutation was introduced into hβ2 to create a uniqueMluI restriction site at residue 344 by PCR overlap extension as described above. The PCR fragment containing theMluI site was ligated into the HindIII andBstBI sites of hβ2. The mutant, HmH, was verified by sequencing and expression on the COS cell surface and binding to ICAM-1 (not shown). The mutant N339Y was generated by PCR amplification with primers that overlapped the Bsu36I and MluI sites and encoded mutations near the MluI site. The PCR fragment was then transferred into the Bsu36I and MluI sites of HmH. PCR overlap extension was used to produce the other point mutants. To create mutants L270M, A290S/N292S, S302K/R303K, E325D, and H332Q, 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream primers containing theBsu36I and MluI sites, respectively, were used to generate PCR fragments that were then ligated into the HmH. Similarly, mutants R122N, R133Q, D163E, E175A, N190D, and M218I were generated by using primers encompassing the HindIII and KasI sites. The PCR fragments were digested with these enzymes and ligated into hβ2. The double point mutants R133Q/H332Q and R133Q/N339Y were constructed by replacing the HindIII–KasI fragment of H332Q or N339Y with the HindIII–KasI fragment of R133Q. The triple point mutant R133Q/H332Q/N339Y was made by PCR amplification with R133Q/H332Q as template and primers that contained the Bsu36I and MluI site and that encoded the N339Y mutation near the MluI site. All point mutants were verified by sequencing about 100 base pairs around the mutation sites. Individual human residues were introduced into the murine β subunit sequence by PCR overlap extension (43.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Briefly, the outer 5′ and 3′ primers were selected to include unique restriction sites near the mutation in the β subunit cDNA. Mutations were introduced by a pair of inner complementary primers. After PCR, the products were restriction-digested and ligated into the β subunit cDNA vector cut with the same enzymes. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing of the region subjected to PCR. JY or SKW3 cells used for aggregation assays were harvested near confluence (about 5 × 105cells/ml). After 20 min of preincubation with ascites (1:200) or purified mAbs (10 μg/ml), cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml in 100 μl of L-15 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. The reactions were performed in microtiter plates gently shaken for 30 min for JY cells or 2 h for SKW cells at 37 °C. The amount of aggregation was scored as described (13.Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). cDNAs in AprM8 expression vector were purified by Wizard Midiprep kits (Promega, Madison, WI) and ethanol-precipitated. COS cells were transiently co-transfected with wild-type, mutant, or chimeric β2 subunits and human αL subunit cDNA constructs using DEAE-dextran (44.Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Transfected COS cells were treated with trypsin-EDTA on day 2 and replated. On day 3, cells were harvested in 5 mm EDTA/phosphate-buffered saline and washed with L-15 medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum. Results with human → mouse mutations were repeated, and mouse → human knock-in mutations were tested, using transfection of 293T cells with calcium phosphate precipitates (45.DuBridge R.B. Tang P.

Immunofluorescence flow cytometry was performed as described (47.Hibbs M.L. Wardlaw A.J. Stacker S.A. Anderson D.C. Lee A. Roberts T.M. Springer T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml purified mAb or a 1:200 dilution of ascites on ice for 30 min and then stained with a 1:20 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. After washing, the cells were resuspended and fixed in PBS containing 1% formaldehyde. Transfected COS cells were labeled with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and assayed for binding to ICAM-1 as described (13.Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Binding of mutant transfected cells to ICAM-1 was expressed as a percentage of wild-type transfectant binding,i.e. 100 × (mutant − mock binding)/(wild-type − mock binding). Triplicates in each experiment were averaged and considered as a single data point for calculation of S.D. among at least three different experiments.

Whereas PSD-95 and PSD-93 occur only at postsynaptic sites in hippocampal neurons, SAP-102 also occurs in axons. In heterologous cells, PSD-95 and PSD-93 mediate cell surface ion channel clustering, but SAP-102 and SAP-97 do not. This selective ion channel clustering activity by MAGUKs is explained by differential palmitoylation, as PSD-93 and PSD-95 are palmitoylated though SAP-97, and SAP-102 are not. Rather than being palmitoylated, we find that N-terminal cysteines from SAP-102 tightly bind to zinc. And, appending the N terminus of SAP-102 to PSD-95 results in localization of the chimera to both axons and dendrites.

Although mechanisms for organization of these synaptic signaling complexes are unclear, recent studies suggest a general role for PDZ domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUK)1 in receptor clustering at pre- and postsynaptic sites (1Kennedy M.B.

Immunohistochemical studies indicate that PSD-95 and PSD-93 occur primarily in a somatodendritic distribution and are specifically enriched at the PSD (11Rao A. Kim E. Sheng M. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1217-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this postsynaptic localization, targeted disruption of PSD-95 in mouse disrupts N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity (12Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M. Webster L.C. Watabe A.M. Makhinson M. He Y. Ramsay M.F. Morris R.G. Morrison J.H. O'Dell T.J. Grant S.G. Nature. 1998; 396: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that SAP-102 can be found at postsynaptic sites (7Muller B.M. Kistner U. Kindler S. Chung W.K. Kuhlendahl S. Fenster S.D. Lau L.-F. Veh R.W. Huganir R.L. Gundelfinger E.D.

Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although SAP-97 knockout mice have not yet been reported, SAP-97 is the mammalian homologue of Drosophila discs large (DLG), and flies lacking DLG show prominent presynaptic defects (14Budnik V. Koh Y.H. Guan B. Hartmann B. Hough C. Woods D. Gorczyca M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 627-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Mechanisms for differential localization and function of MAGUK proteins remain uncertain. MAGUK proteins share extensive sequence homology in their PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase domains. Significant differences between these proteins occur primarily at their N termini, suggesting roles for these regions in differential functions of these proteins. Importantly, PSD-95 contains a pair of cysteine residues that are sites for protein palmitoylation (15Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), a post-translational modification that is essential for postsynaptic sorting (16Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In contrast, SAP-97 lacks N-terminal cysteines, and it is not palmitoylated. PSD-93 is alternatively spliced at the N terminus to yield two major isoforms: the first, which we now term PSD-93α, has cysteines at positions 5, 7, and 12; and the second, which we term PSD-93β, has cysteines at positions 3 and 5, like PSD-95 (9Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S. Craven S.E. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally SAP-102 has cysteines at positions 7, 8, 10, and 13 (7). It is uncertain whether PSD-93 or SAP-102 are palmitoylated and whether this regulates cellular trafficking and ion channel clustering by these proteins. Here, we report that both PSD-95 and PSD-93 occur prominently at postsynaptic sites in hippocampal neurons, whereas SAP-102 localizes to both dendrites and axons in these cells. Similarly, we find that PSD-95 and both isoforms of PSD-93 mediate surface ion channel clustering, although SAP-97 and SAP-102 do not. Metabolic labeling studies show that PSD-95 and both isoforms of PSD-93 are robustly palmitoylated and that SAP-97 and SAP-102 are not. Mutants of PSD-95 and PSD-93 that disrupt palmitoylation also block surface receptor clustering, indicating a critical role for this lipid modification in ion channel aggregation at the plasma membrane. Rather than being palmitoylated, we find that N-terminal cysteines in SAP-102 tightly bind to zinc and that this unique N terminus of SAP-102 confers axonal targeting in addition to postsynaptic sites within dendrites in neurons. These data suggest that lipid modifications and heavy metal associations with the N termini of MAGUKs mediate differential functions and subcellular localizations of these synaptic scaffolds. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Kv1.4 (17Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), PSD-95 (9Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S. Craven S.E. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J.

Neuron. 1999; 24: 659-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies to PSD-95 (#046; Affinity Bioreagents) and GFP (Quantum,CLONTECH). GAD-65 antibody was a gift from Dr. Steinunn Baekkeskov (Dept. of Medicine, UCSF). All antisera were affinity-purified on columns containing the immunizing antigen linked to Affi-Gel-10 resin. For immunoblotting, protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Primary antibodies were diluted in block solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with membranes overnight at 4 °C. Labeled bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subcloning of wild-type, mutant, and chimeric forms of PSD-93, SAP-97, and SAP-102 as N-terminal fusions with GFP in pGW1 were analogous to those of PSD-95 previously described (15Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Sequences of all polymerase chain reaction primers are available upon request. Proper introduction of all mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). For studies of palmitoylation, transfected COS7 cells were labeled in media containing 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid (50 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer containing TEE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% SDS. After extracting for 20 min at 4 °C, Triton X-100 was added to 1% to neutralize the SDS, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the samples were then incubated with GFP antibodies (1:150 dilution, CLONTECH) for 1 h at 4 °C. After the addition of 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer containing TEE, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 1 mmdithiothreitol for 2 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For fluorography, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Gels were treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min, dried under vacuum, and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −80 °C for 3 to 5 days. Hippocampal cultures were transfected as described previously (16Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Briefly, acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons from E18 rats were transfected in suspension by lipid-mediated gene transfer. Cells were then plated at a density of 600/mm2 on glass coverslips (Fisher) and maintained in Neurobasal media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with B27. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100 3 times for 5 min each, the cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween containing 3% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific antibody interactions. Primary antibodies were added in block solution for 1 h at room temperature, followed by donkey anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Cy2 or Cy3 fluorophores (diluted 1:200 in block solution) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then mounted on slides (Frost Plus slides; Fisher) with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.), and images were taken under fluorescence microscopy with a 100× oil immersion objective (numerical aperture = 1.4) affixed to a Leica upright microscope. Quantification of polarized protein expression in dendrites versus axons was performed on 10–15 neurons from 2–3 independent transfections. Images of neurons were acquired with a CCD camera and quantitated using Metamorph imaging software (Universal Imaging). The exposure time of the camera was adjusted to limit photobleaching and so that maximum pixel intensity was approximately one-half to three-fourths saturating for cells with low to moderate expression levels, as determined by total pixel counts. The average background fluorescence of untransfected cells was subtracted. The degree of polarized expression was determined by calculating the average pixel intensity in the axonversus that in the dendrites. The average pixel intensity was calculated through three dendrites and three sections of the axon (each 20 μm in length). These averages were then converted into a ratio of axonal versus dendritic expression. The data were analyzed by paired t test. Adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were fixed by transcardial perfusion with an aldehyde mixture consisting of 4% paraformaldehyde and 3% acrolein, buffered with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Sodium borohydride was used to terminate tissue fixation. Brain sections (40 μm) containing primary visual cortex were prepared using a Vibratome. Sections were blocked in saline buffered with 0.01 mphosphate (phosphate-buffered saline) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After an overnight incubation with affinity-purified anti-SAP-102 antibody (1 μg/ml), sections were processed for immunolabeling with the avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex using the ABC Elite kit (Vector) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Aldrich) and hydrogen peroxide as substrates (19Hsu S.M. Raine L. Fanger H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (13365) Google Scholar). These sections were post-fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, then with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, and stained as a whole with 4% uranyl acetate. Sections were dehydrated for infiltration with the EMBED 812 resin (EM Sciences) for ultrathin sectioning. Sections (80 nm) were examined without lead citrate counterstaining. A GST fusion protein corresponding to amino acids 1–118 of SAP-102 was expressed and purified fromEscherichia coli and dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6. The SAP-102 N-terminal peptide, corresponding to amino acids 1–20, was synthesized by Anaspec. The fully reduced peptide was prepared by solubilizing in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, reducing with 50 mm dithiothreitol at 90 °C for 30 min, precipitating with 10% trichloroacetic acid at −20 °C for 15 min, centrifuging at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and washing twice in ether. This reduced peptide was desiccated and stored at −70 °C until use. Immediately before use, the peptide was resuspended (100 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing various concentrations of ZnCl2, and spectra were recorded on a Cary 1E UV-visible spectrophotometer. Difference spectra were calculated by subtracting absorbance for peptide alone from absorbance for peptide with ZnCl2. SAP102 1–20 peptide was prepared as above. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter, and each recording of peptide with ZnCl2 was corrected for the spectrum of the corresponding concentration of ZnCl2without peptide. To characterize differential functions for the neuronal MAGUK proteins, we compared their cellular distribution in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures. Low density neuronal cultures were maintained in neurobasal medium, and mature neurons at 2–3 weeks in culture were analyzed by immunofluorescence. As previously reported (11Rao A. Kim E. Sheng M. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1217-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PSD-95 and PSD-93 localize exclusively to small puncta that correspond to synaptic sites (Fig. 1), as they co-localize with synaptophysin (Ref. 11Rao A. Kim E. Sheng M. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1217-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). These synaptic puncta occur along dendritic processes (Fig. 1) that are positive for the dendritic marker microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2). By contrast, SAP-102 shows a more diffuse localization in the hippocampal neurons; it is present in the dendritic cytoplasm and is modestly enriched at synapses (Fig. 1). Unlike PSD-95 and PSD-93, SAP-102 also occurs in processes that are labeled by the axonal marker neurofilament-H (Fig. 1). Axonal staining for SAP-102 is likely specific as it is blocked by preadsorbing the antibody with the immunizing antigen (data not shown). Furthermore, the affinity-purified antibody used for staining recognizes only SAP-102 by Western blot analysis of crude brain extracts (18Firestein B.L. Brenman J.E. Aoki C. Sanchez-Perez A.M. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 24: 659-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether SAP-102 localizes to postsynaptic and presynaptic sites in brain, we performed electron micrographic immunohistochemical staining of rat cerebral cortex using horseradish peroxidase-3,3′ diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as the label. Consistent with previous studies (7Muller B.M. Kistner U. Kindler S. Chung W.K. Kuhlendahl S. Fenster S.D. Lau L.-F. Veh R.W. Huganir R.L. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 255-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) we find that SAP-102 occurs at the PSD of some cortical synapses (Fig. 2). However, we find that SAP-102 also localizes to axons and is particularly enriched at a subset of presynaptic terminals (Fig. 2). These results are consistent with the observed dendritic and axonal localizations of SAP-102 in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig.1). PSD-95 and SAP-102 share highly conserved PDZ, SH3, and GK domains, but each contains a unique N terminus, suggesting possible roles for the N termini in differential targeting of these proteins. To determine whether the N terminus of SAP-102 regulates its differential localization, we transfected hippocampal neurons with GFP fusion proteins and determined their sorting to dendrites and axons by labeling transfected cells with MAP-2 and neurofilament-H antibodies (data not shown). We find that exogenous PSD-95 is enriched in dendrites, whereas SAP-102 is present in both dendrites and axons (Fig. 3,A, B, and C). In the axons, SAP-102 shows diffuse staining but is also enriched at presynaptic sites, where it co-localizes in GABAergic neurons with the presynaptic marker GAD-65 (Fig. 3 C; lower panels). Replacing the palmitoylation motif of PSD-95 with the unique N terminus of SAP-102 mediates localization of the chimera to both axons and dendrites (Fig.3, A and B) in a pattern similar to SAP-102. These results indicate that the N terminus of SAP-102 may use a different mechanism than that of PSD-95 to localize to postsynaptic sites and to localize presynaptically. Recent studies demonstrate that N-terminal palmitoylation of PSD-95 is necessary for postsynaptic targeting (16Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that differential palmitoylation of the MAGUK proteins accounts for the differential subcellular localization of these proteins. To address this, cells transfected with neuronal MAGUK proteins were metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitate, and following immunoprecipitation and SDS/PAGE, protein palmitoylation was detected by autoradiography. As previously reported (15Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we find that PSD-95 is robustly palmitoylated (Fig. 4). We also find that both isoforms of PSD-93, the α isoform, which has cysteines at positions 5 and 7, and the β isoform, which has cysteines at positions 3 and 5, are robustly palmitoylated (Fig. 4). On the other hand SAP-97 and SAP-102 are not detectably palmitoylated (Fig. 4). Previous studies have shown that mutations of cysteines 3 or 5 from PSD-95 disrupt palmitoylation (15Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Similarly, we find that mutating cysteine 5 or cysteine 7 of PSD-93α to serine abolishes protein palmitoylation (Fig.5 and data not shown).Figure 5PSD-95 and PSD-93 but not SAP-97 or SAP-102 can mediate cell surface ion channel clustering. COS cells were co-transfected with Kv1.4 and each of the neuronal MAGUKs. Cells were fixed 48 h post-transfection and double-labeled with antibodies to the appropriate MAGUK (green) and Kv1.4 (red). PSD-95 and both isoforms of PSD-93 co-cluster with Kv1.4, as evidenced by formation of large irregular patches on the cell surface. By contrast, SAP-97 and SAP-102 do not induce cell surface ion channel clustering but rather form intracellular clusters that accumulate on the nuclear membrane and in intracellular perinuclear structures.Scale bar = 10 μm. A palmitoylation-deficient mutant of PSD-93α PSD-93 (C5,7S) does not induce membrane ion channel clustering but rather forms intracellular structures in a pattern similar to SAP-97 and SAP-102. Scale bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At postsynaptic sites, certain MAGUK proteins cluster ion channels with downstream protein networks (2Sheng M. Wyszynski M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Craven S.E. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 495-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 20Kornau H.-C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Some aspects of this clustering activity can be reproduced in heterologous cell co-transfections. In this assay co-transfection of PSD-95 with an interacting ion channel results in co-localization of both proteins to surface patches on the plasma membrane (17Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). To determine systematically which MAGUK proteins have ion channel clustering activity in this assay we individually co-transfected each of the neuronal MAGUKs with K+ channel Kv1.4. When expressed alone, the neuronal MAGUKs or the K+channel occur diffusely throughout the COS cells (Fig. 5). As previously reported (17Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), co-transfection of PSD-95 with Kv1.4 results in surface clustering of both molecules (Fig. 5), whereas co-transfection of SAP-97 with Kv1.4 results in prominent perinuclear intracellular structures (21Kim E. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here we find that both isoforms of PSD-93 (α and β) form membrane clusters with Kv1.4. On the other hand, co-transfection of SAP-102 with the K+ channel results in prominent co-localization on the nuclear membrane, and both proteins also accumulate in large round structures in the cytoplasm in a pattern similar to SAP-97 (Fig. 5). These data demonstrate that postsynaptic MAGUKs, PSD-95, and PSD-93 can mediate plasma membrane clustering of interacting ion channels, but the more diffusely localized MAGUKs, SAP-97, and SAP-102 cannot. These results also show that only palmitoylated MAGUKs are capable of clustering ion channels on the plasma membrane. To evaluate a role for protein palmitoylation in the differential cell surface ion channel clustering activity of neuronal MAGUKs, we transfected COS cells with various mutant and chimeric MAGUKs together with Kv1.4. As previously reported (22Hsueh Y.P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), mutation of cysteines 3 and 5 of PSD-95 prevents ion channel clustering with Kv1.4. In co-transfections with this palmitoylation-deficient isoform of PSD-95, staining for both PSD-95 and Kv1.4 occurs along the nuclear membrane and in large perinuclear structures (data not shown). Similarly, co-transfections with palmitoylation-deficient forms of PSD-93α (C5,7S) also show no clustering and yield prominent staining of the nuclear membrane and of intracellular juxtanuclear spots (Fig. 5 and data not shown). This pattern is similar to that observed in co-transfections of Kv1.4 with wild-type SAP-97 or SAP-102. To further establish a role for palmitoylation in cell surface channel clustering, we evaluated chimeras in which the palmitoylated N termini of PSD-95 or PSD-93α replaced the N terminus of SAP-97 or the palmitoylated N terminus of PSD-93α replaced the N terminus of PSD-95. These constructs, which induce palmitoylation of the chimeras, also mediate cell surface clustering activity (Fig.6). Kv1.4 does not co-cluster on the plasma membrane with a chimera in which a cysteine mutant form of the PSD-93α N terminus is fused to PSD-95 (Fig. 6). It is striking that SAP-102, which contains four N-terminal cysteines at positions 7, 8, 11, and 13 is not palmitoylated and does not mediate surface ion channel clustering. The presence of these cysteines in the absence of palmitoylation suggests other important functions for this unusual cluster of cysteines. Also conspicuous in the N terminus of SAP-102 are 3 histidine residues at positions 2, 4, and 6. This concentrated cluster of histidine and cysteine residues at the N terminus suggests a possible role in heavy metal binding, as histidine and cysteine residues often participate in metal ligation (23Berg J.M.

Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In fact, the N-terminal sequence of SAP-102 bears considerable homology to RING fingers and LIM domains, which both bind to zinc (24Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To evaluate possible zinc binding by SAP-102, we purified a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal 100 amino acids of SAP-102 fromE. coli. Optical absorption spectroscopy provided evidence that this fusion protein binds zinc. The spectra obtained with reduced SAP-102 and 0–50 μm ZnCl2 show that the absorbency increases as Zn2+ is added (Fig.7 A). There is a maximum at ∼240 nm in the difference spectra, indicating charge transfer transitions between the metals and sulfur ligands. Our Zn2+spectra are quite similar to those found for other protein-metal complexes such as those of zinc finger or metallothionein proteins (23Berg J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar,25Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. EXS (Basel). 1995; 73: 259-277PubMed Google Scholar). No metal binding to GST alone, as evidenced by a spectral shift with 1–10 μm ZnCl2, was detected (Fig.7 B). To determine whether zinc binds to the unique cysteine-and histidine-rich region, we evaluated binding to a synthetic 20-mer peptide corresponding to the extreme N terminus of SAP-102. Similar to what was found with the fusion protein, we found that zinc addition specifically induces a dramatic change in the absorbance spectrum with an absorbance maximum at 240 nm (Fig. 7 C). Difference ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy with 0.5 to 4.0 mequivalents of ZnCl2 shows that binding occurs at a stoichiometry of one Zn2+ per mole of SAP-102 peptide. Circular dichroism studies demonstrate that zinc binding dramatically alters the secondary structure of the N-terminal SAP-102 peptide. The circular dichroism spectrum of the reduced apo-peptide displays a minimum near 200 nm (Fig. 7 D), which is expected for a disordered polypeptide. The addition of ZnCl2 produces marked changes in the spectrum, with an increase in the negative ellipticity, consistent with gain of secondary structure. Again, titration of the peptide showed a plateau at one molar equivalent of added ZnCl2 (Fig. 7 D). This study demonstrates that the N termini of neuronal MAGUKs determine in large part the differential cellular distribution and neuronal functions for these proteins. PSD-93 and PSD-95 are robustly palmitoylated, and both are enriched at postsynaptic sites in neurons and mediate cell surface ion channel clustering in heterologous cells. By contrast SAP-97 and SAP-102 are not modified by this lipidation also occur in neuronal axons. The addition of the N terminus of SAP-102 to PSD-95 enhances its axonal localization and accumulation at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites. The central role for palmitoylation in surface ion channel clustering by MAGUKs is demonstrated by analysis of chimeric constructs. Appending the N-terminal palmitoylation consensus of PSD-95 or PSD-93α onto SAP-97 induces ion channel clustering on the plasma membrane. Considering that the palmitoylated N termini of PSD-95 and PSD-93 are critical for protein function, it is interesting to note that PSD-93 is alternatively spliced in this region (9Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S. Craven S.E. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA cloning from a rat brain library identified four distinct N-terminal forms of PSD-93. The two forms most commonly isolated, termed here PSD-93α and PSD-93β, contain N-terminal cysteines, whereas the other two minor forms of PSD-93 do not contain these cysteines (9Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S. Craven S.E. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, alternative splicing of the PSD-93 N-terminal domains is tightly controlled in a tissue-specific fashion (9Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S. Craven S.E. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because alternative N-terminal splicing can alter ion channel clustering activity of MAGUK proteins, this may provide an important mechanism for modulating synaptic assembly and plasticity. Why might PSD-95 and PSD-93, two major components of the postsynaptic density, be palmitoylated? As previous work has shown that this modification is essential for postsynaptic targeting (16Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), it is possible that palmitoylation functions primarily as a signal for postsynaptic sorting. However, many postsynaptic proteins are not palmitoylated, which suggests other functions for palmitoylation of MAGUKs. Unlike other lipid modifications, palmitoylation is readily reversible, and dynamic modulation of this lipidation may afford plasticity (26Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In non-neuronal cells, many palmitoylated proteins occur together in caveolae, cholesterol-rich cave-like invaginations of the plasma membrane (27Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Kubler E. Koleske A.J. Sargiacomo M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Whereas neurons lack anatomical caveolae and lack the scaffolding protein caveolin, cholesterol-rich low density membrane fractions have been isolated from brain (28Wu C. Butz S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Palmitoylated PSD-95 and PSD-93 may be analogous to caveolin and function to assemble signal transduction cascades at specialized lipid domains. Indeed several intracellular enzymes that associate with the PSD-95/N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor complex activity, including Fyn (29Tezuka T. Umemori H. Akiyama T. Nakanishi S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (30Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar), are found in low density lipid compartments (31Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 32Keshet G.I. Ovadia H. Taraboulos A. Gabizon R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Whereas PSD-95 and PSD-93 play critical roles in assembling signaling machinery at the PSD, we find that SAP-102 also occurs in axons. Insight into roles for MAGUK proteins in axons are suggested by the phenotype of Drosophila dlg, a MAGUK of invertebrates (33Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar).Discs large mutant flies show structural defects at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction (14Budnik V. Koh Y.H. Guan B. Hartmann B. Hough C. Woods D. Gorczyca M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 627-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) but also have presynaptic defects, which include increased neurotransmitter release (14Budnik V. Koh Y.H. Guan B. Hartmann B. Hough C. Woods D. Gorczyca M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 627-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Both the pre- and postsynaptic defects are rescued by presynaptic but not postsynaptic expression of DLG (14Budnik V. Koh Y.H. Guan B. Hartmann B. Hough C. Woods D. Gorczyca M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 627-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Furthermore, presynaptic expression of either SAP-97 or SAP-102 can rescue the phenotype of dlg mutants (34Thomas U. Phannavong B. Müller B. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because SAP-102 contains N-terminal cysteines, it was surprising to find that SAP-102 is not palmitoylated and does not mediate ion channel clustering on the plasma membrane. Instead, we find that the N terminus of SAP-102 contains a unique cysteine- and histidine-rich motif that binds to zinc. This zinc binding is high affinity and saturable, such that 1 mol of zinc binds/mol of SAP-102. Zinc binding to the N terminus of SAP-102 is reminiscent of several other presynaptic proteins that contain conserved zinc binding motifs including, RIM (35Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), rabphilin, bassoon (36tom Dieck S. Sanmartı́-Vila L. Langnaese K. Richter K. Kindler S. Soyke A. Wex H.

These proteins, many of which contain PDZ domains together with N-terminal zinc fingers, appear to regulate synaptic vesicle trafficking and fusion. It will now be important to determine how the N-terminal zinc binding motif of SAP-102 regulates both targeting and function at pre- and postsynaptic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1986782337,"The regulation of gene expression by cell surface receptors often involves the stimulation of signaling pathways including one or more members of the MAPK superfamily of serine-threonine kinases. Upon their activation in the cytosol, MAPKs can translocate to the nucleus and affect the activity of a variety of transcription factors. Recently, it has been observed that a novel member of the MAPK superfamily, ERK5, can be potently activated by transforming G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and that ERK5 participates in the regulation of c-jun expression through the activation of MEF2 transcription factors. How cell surface receptors, including GPCRs, stimulate ERK5 is still poorly understood. In this study, we have used transiently transfected COS-7 cells to begin delineating the biochemical route linking GPCRs to ERK5. We show that receptors that can couple to the Gq and G12/13 families of heterotrimeric G proteins, m1 and thrombin receptors, respectively, but not those coupled to Gi, such as m2 receptors, are able to regulate the activity of ERK5. To investigate which heterotrimeric G proteins signal to ERK5, we used a chimeric system by which Gαq- and Gα13-mediated signaling pathways can be conditionally activated upon ligand stimulation. Using this system, as well as the expression of activated forms of G protein subunits, we show that the Gαq and Gα12/13 families of heterotrimeric G proteins, but not the Gαi, Gαs, and βγ subunits, are able to regulate ERK5. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the stimulation of ERK5 by GPCRs involves a novel signaling pathway, which is distinct from those regulated by Ras and Rho GTPases.

To date, MAPKs have been classified into at least six subfamilies: p44mapk and p42mapk, also called extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2, respectively (referred in here as MAPK); c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), also termed stress-activated protein kinases; p38 MAPKs; ERK5, also known as big MAPK 1; and the recently identified ERK7 (3.Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and MOK (4.Miyata Y. Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (see Ref. 5.Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar for a review). These kinases are activated by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, hormones, antigens, and cytokines and can also be stimulated in response to a diverse array of cellular stresses, such as UV irradiation, oxidative stress, and heat and osmotic shock (2.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar).Many cell surface receptors can effectively stimulate MAPK cascades to signal to the nucleus, including the large family of receptors that transduce signals through the activation of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) (6.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). For example, receptors coupled to Gαi proteins can potently stimulate MAPK (7.Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and that appears to be mediated primarily through the release of βγ subunits (8.Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) and the activation of a complex biochemical route involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (9.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and several nonreceptor and receptor tyrosine kinases (see Refs. 6.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar for reviews). In turn, activation of these tyrosine kinases leads to the phosphorylation of an adaptor protein, Shc, and the recruitment of the Grb2·Sos complex to the plasma membrane thus stimulating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras GTPases. This promotes the activation of a kinase cascade including Raf and MEK, which culminates with the activation of MAPK (1.Marshall C.J.

Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Similarly, JNK and p38 MAPKs have been shown to be activated by ligands acting on GPCRs, by the release of βγ dimers (18.Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). ERK5 exhibits an extended C-terminal tail, which is absent in other types of MAPKs, suggesting that the regulation and function of this kinase might be different from that of other MAPKs (25.Lee J.D.

In this study, we have used transfected and endogenously expressed GPCRs and the co-expression of GPCRs with chimeric G protein α subunits to begin delineating the biochemical route linking GPCRs to ERK5. We show that the Gαq and Gα12/13 families of heterotrimeric G proteins α subunits, but not the Gαi, Gαs, or βγ subunits, are able to regulate ERK5 activity.

Similarly, JNK and p38 MAPKs have been shown to be activated by ligands acting on GPCRs, by the release of βγ dimers (18.Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

However, signaling pathways from GPCRs to these MAPKs are still largely unknown, although they appear to involve the activation of the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 by βγ dimers and RhoA and Rac1 by members of the Gα12/13 class of G proteins (18.Coso O.A.

Recently, we have observed that a novel member of the MAPK superfamily, ERK5, can be potently activated by transforming GPCRs and provided evidence that ERK5 participates in the regulation of c-junexpression by GPCRs through the activation of members of the MEF2 class of transcription factors (24.Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). ERK5 exhibits an extended C-terminal tail, which is absent in other types of MAPKs, suggesting that the regulation and function of this kinase might be different from that of other MAPKs (25.Lee J.D.

In this study, we have used transfected and endogenously expressed GPCRs and the co-expression of GPCRs with chimeric G protein α subunits to begin delineating the biochemical route linking GPCRs to ERK5. We show that the Gαq and Gα12/13 families of heterotrimeric G proteins α subunits, but not the Gαi, Gαs, or βγ subunits, are able to regulate ERK5 activity. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that the stimulation of the ERK5 cascade by GPCRs involves a novel pathway, which is distinct from those regulated by Ras and Rho GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W2046180931,"Gene targeting studies have demonstrated that the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-6 lies upstream in a transcriptional cascade that controls differentiation of the visceral endoderm. To understand the function of GATA-6 in the visceral endoderm and to identify genes regulated by GATA-6 in this tissue, subtractive hybridization was performed using template cDNAs derived from differentiated wild-type embryonic stem (ES) cells and GATA-6−/− ES cells, respectively. These analyses revealed that the gene encoding Dab2, a mitogen-responsive phosphoprotein, is differentially expressed in wild-type and GATA-6-deficient ES cells. Consistent with these findings, Dab2 is expressed in the visceral endoderm of wild-type embryos but not in the visceral endoderm of GATA-6-deficient embryos. Cotransfection experiments demonstrate that the human Dab2 promoter can be transactivated by forced expression of GATA-6 in NIH-3T3 cells. In contrast, forced expression of GATA-4 does not transactivate the human Dab2 promoter and Dab2 is expressed in the visceral endoderm of GATA-4 null embryos. Surprisingly, the specificity of GATA-6-induced transactivation of the Dab2 promoter is not mediated through its zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the mitogen-responsive phosphoprotein Dab2 is a downstream target of GATA-6 in the visceral endoderm. Moreover, these data demonstrate that molecular mechanisms have evolved that direct, and distinguish, the functional specificity of GATA family members when they are developmentally coexpressed.

However, the molecular mechanisms governing the functional specificity of each GATA factor in the developing embryo are poorly understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that a primordial function of GATA factors is to regulate specification and/or differentiation of endoderm and endodermally derived tissues. In C. elegans,end-1 encodes a single zinc finger GATA factor (6.Zhu J. Hill R.J. Heid P.J. Fukuyama M. Sugimoto A. Priess J.R. Rothman J.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2883-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Inend-1 mutants, the E cell, which normally gives rise to endoderm, instead gives rise to mesoderm and ectoderm (6.Zhu J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3809-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). InDrosophila, mutation of the GATA factor serpentresults in transformation of the endodermally derived midgut to ectoderm (5.Rehorn K.P. Thelen H. Michelson A.M. Reuter R. Development. 1996; 122: 4023-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GATA-4/5/6 subfamily of vertebrate GATA factors is expressed in an overlapping pattern in the primitive endoderm and some endodermally derived tissues (8.Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, GATA-4/5/6 are expressed in the developing heart (8.Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As early as the egg cylinder stage, GATA-4 and GATA-6 are coexpressed in the visceral and parietal endoderm (9.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 10.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Subsequently, GATA-4, -5 and -6 are coexpressed in the primitive gut epithelium where the genes continue to be expressed throughout postnatal development (8.Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev.

In addition, coincident with formation of the embryonic lung bud, GATA-6 is expressed in the endodermally derived bronchial epithelium (9.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Despite their overlapping patterns of expression in the visceral endoderm and heart, gene targeting studies demonstrated that GATA-4 and GATA-6 regulate distinct functions in the mouse embryo. GATA-4-deficient embryos die between embryonic days (E)1 8.5 and 10.5 and exhibit a gross defect in ventral morphogenesis, including failure to form a linear heart tube (20.Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 21.Molkentin J.D. Lin Q. Duncan S.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). GATA-4-deficient embryos contain intact yolk sacs and express high levels of early and late endodermal markers (20.Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 21.Molkentin J.D. Lin Q. Duncan S.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). However, lacZ-tagged GATA-4−/−embryonic stem (ES) cells contribute to the primitive heart tube of GATA-4−/−-C57BL/6 chimeric embryos, and wild-type extra-embryonic endoderm partially rescues the morphogenetic defects observed in GATA-4-deficient embryos, suggesting that endoderm-mediated signaling may be responsible for the defect(s) observed in GATA-4-deficient embryos (20.Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 29.Narita N. Bielinska M. Wilson D.B. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast, GATA-6-deficient embryos do not survive past the primitive streak stage (E7.5) (22.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 27.Koutsourakis M. Langeveld A. Patient R. Beddington R. Grosveld F. Development. 1999; 126: 723-732Crossref Google Scholar). The extra-embryonic visceral endoderm is specified in GATA-6-deficient embryos, but a specific block is observed in differentiation of the visceral endoderm, including absence and/or down-regulation of both early and late endoderm markers, which include HNF-4, GATA-4, and HNF-3β (22.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In GATA-6-deficient embryos, apoptosis is observed throughout the epiblast, which underlies the visceral endoderm, suggesting that GATA-6 regulates an endoderm-ectoderm signaling pathway required for survival of the embryo (22.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). To examine the molecular basis of the defect observed in GATA-6-deficient embryos, subtractive hybridization was performed. A cDNA clone encoding the mitogen-responsive 96-kDa phosphoprotein Dab2 was identified and shown to be differentially expressed in the visceral endoderm of wild-type and GATA-6-deficient embryos. In the studies described in this report, we demonstrate that the genes encoding Dab2 and GATA-6 are coexpressed in the visceral endoderm of the mouse embryo. In addition, we observe that the human Dab2 promoter is activated directly by forced expression of GATA-6, but not GATA-4, and the specificity of GATA-6-mediated transactivation of the Dab2 promoter is regulated by domains other than its zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Finally, we show that Dab2 is expressed in GATA-4-deficient embryos, indicating that GATA-4 does not regulate Dab2 in vivo. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that Dab2 is abona fide downstream target of GATA-6 in the visceral endoderm and is differentially regulated by GATA-6 and GATA-4 in the mouse embryo. The generation of GATA-6−/− RW ES cells has been described previously (22.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Wild-type and GATA-6−/− ES cells were differentiated in suspension into embryoid bodies as described (20.Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 22.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). After 10 days of differentiationin vitro, poly(A+) RNA was prepared from GATA-6+/+ and GATA-6−/− embryoid bodies using the FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Subtractive hybridization was performed utilizing 2 μg of poly(A+) RNA and the PCR-Select™ subtractive hybridization kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To identify novel differentially expressed cDNA clones, 1 × 106 cDNA clones from an E7.0 mouse embryo cDNA library (CLONTECH) were screened with the radiolabeled subtracted cDNA pool (cDNAs that are expressed in embryoid bodies derived from wild-type ES cells, which are not expressed in embryoid bodies derived from GATA-6−/−ES cells) as described previously (10.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, an aliquot of the subtracted cDNA pool was digested with EagI and subcloned into pBluescriptII SK (Stratagene) for direct automated DNA sequence analyses. Homology searches for each cDNA sequence were performed using the BLAST software program and the GenBank™ data base. Finally, to confirm differential patterns of expression, isolated cDNAs were radiolabeled and hybridized to Northern blots containing RNA prepared from wild-type and GATA-6−/− ES cell after 10 days of in vitro differentiation. The pBS/Dab2 plasmid encodes the mouse Dab2 cDNA (base pairs (bp) 1–3245) subcloned intoEcoRI/XhoI-digested pBluescriptII SK. The pDab2Pr.luc luciferase reporter plasmid under the transcriptional control of the 766-bp human Dab2 promoter (30.Albertsen H.M. Smith S.A. Melis R. Williams B. Holik P. Stevens J. White R. Genomics. 1996; 33: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was generating by subcloning the NheI/XhoI-linked human Dab2 promoter into pGL3basic (Promega). The following oligonucleotide primers were utilized to amplify the promoter from human genomic DNA: sense, 5′-CCGCTAGCCTTCTGCGTGGTTACAATGACTGC-3′; antisense, 5′-CCCTCGAGAGGCGATCCCGATGGAGAAGTCTC-3′. The pVP16/GATA-4 and pVP16/GATA-6 plasmids were generated by ligating in-frame cDNAs encoding the DNA-binding domains of GATA-4 (aa 209–328) and GATA-6 (aa 231–351), respectively, to the 139-aa transcriptional activation domain of the herpes simplex virusVP16 gene (31.Hop C. de Waard V. van Mourik J.A. Pannekoek H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and subcloning the fused cDNAs intoKpnI/XhoI-digested pcDNA3. The following oligonucleotides were used to amplify the different cDNA fragments: GATA-4 sense, 5′-CACTCTAGAGACTTCTCAGAAGGCAGAGAG; GATA-4 antisense, 5′-CACCTCGAGTCACTTAGATTTATTCAGGTTCTTGGG; GATA-6 sense, 5′-CACTCTAGAGACCTGTCGGAGAGCCGCGAG; GATA-6 antisense, 5′-CACCTCGAGTCATTTTGACTTATTTATATTTTTAGG; VP16 sense, 5′-CCGGTACCAGGATGGACTACAAAGACGATGAC; VP16 antisense, 5′-CACTCTAGACCCACCGTACTCGTCAATTCCAAG. In situhybridization analyses were performed as described previously (9.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Antisense and control sense cRNA probes that hybridize specifically to Dab2 were generated by digesting pBS/Dab2 with HincII andXhoI, respectively, and performing in vitrotranscription with [35S]UTP using T7 and T3 RNA polymerase. cRNA probes that hybridize to murine GATA-4 and GATA-6 mRNA, specifically, were generated as described previously (9.Morrisey E.E.

Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Nonradioactive in situ hybridization analyses were performed by hybridizing a digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probe of Dab2 to paraffin-embedded tissue sections, blocking with 2% preimmune sheep serum and incubating with a mouse monoclonal anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 1:2000 dilution at 4 °C. Slides were washed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mmlevamisole and developed in 20 mm Tris, pH 9.5, 50 mm MgCl2, 4.5 μl/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, and 3.5 μl/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. NIH-3T3 cells were grown as described previously (32.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol.

The expression vectors pcDNAG4 and pcDNAG6, encoding mouse GATA-4 and GATA-6, respectively, have been described (9.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In all cotransfection experiments, 2.5 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid pDab2Pr.luc, 25 μg of expression plasmid (pcDNAG6, pcDNAG4, pVP16/GATA-4, pVP16/GATA-6, or pcDNA3), and 1 μg of pMSVβgal reference plasmid were cotransfected into 1 × 106 NIH-3T3 cells using 20 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (32.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8515-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase as described previously (33.Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase values were used to normalize transfection efficiency. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. All experiments were performed in triplicate. GATA-6-deficient embryos fail to survive past the early primitive streak stage and exhibit a specific block in differentiation of the visceral endoderm, including absence of both early and late markers of endodermal differentiation (22.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 27.Koutsourakis M. Langeveld A. Patient R. Beddington R. Grosveld F. Development. 1999; 126: 723-732Crossref Google Scholar). To identify genes that are regulated by GATA-6 in the visceral endoderm, subtractive hybridization was performed utilizing mRNA harvested from in vitro differentiated embryoid bodies derived from wild-type (GATA-6+/+) and GATA-6-deficient (GATA-6−/−) ES cells. Of note, Southern blot analyses confirmed that mRNA levels of GATA-4 and α-fetoprotein, which we have previously reported to be down-regulated in the visceral endoderm of embryoid bodies derived from GATA-6−/− ES cells (22.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), were each enriched 50- to 100-fold in the subtracted cDNA pool (data not shown). Consistent with this finding, DNA sequence analysis of 72 random differentially expressed cDNA clones identified several genes that we reported previously are down-regulated in differentiated GATA-6−/− ES cells, including α-fetoprotein and HNF-4 (Table I) (22.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In addition, 22 previously unidentified differentially expressed cDNA clones were identified.Table IGroupings of genes isolated more than once and shown to be differentially expressed in embryoid bodies derived from GATA-6 +/+ and GATA −/− ES cellsGeneNo. of isolates in the 72 randomly sequenced clonesα-Fetoprotein8ApoB4Osteonectin4Type 4 collagen4mig-13HNF-42ETS-1 transcription factor2Dab22Insulin receptor2 Open table in a new tab To characterize and identify potentially novel cDNA clones that are regulated by GATA-6 in the primitive streak embryo, the differentially expressed cDNA pool was radiolabeled and hybridized to an E7.0 mouse embryonic library. 4 of 22 cDNA clones isolated from the E7.0 library encoded a protein variably designated as Dab2, p96, or DOC-2 (34.Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C. Ng S.W. Baldini A. Colitti C.V. Rock C.O. Berkowitz R.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 35.Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This protein will heretofore be designated Dab2. Dab2 was also identified in the random screen of 72 subcloned cDNAs that were differentially expressed (i.e. down-regulated) in the GATA-6−/−-differentiated ES cells (Table I). Consistent with previous reports, the mouse Dab2 cDNA encodes a 767-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 82 kDa (see Fig.1 A). The discrepancy between the predicted and observed molecular mass has been attributed to extensive cell-cycle-regulated phosphorylation on serine residues in the Dab2 protein (35.Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Dab2 protein contains a putative actin-binding motif (aa 25–29), homology to the Drosophila disabled gene (aa 40–180), and a proline-rich region (aa 600–767) that contains several SH3 binding motifs (35.Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that these SH3-binding domains physically associate with the scaffold protein Grb2 (36.Xu X.X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To confirm that Dab2 is differentially expressed in wild-type and GATA-6−/− ES cells during in vitrodifferentiation, Northern blot analyses were performed. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Dab2 mRNA was expressed in embryoid bodies derived from wild-type ES cells, but Dab2 gene expression was severely down-regulated in RNA prepared from embryoid bodies derived from GATA-6−/− ES cells (compare WTand −/− lanes). To determine whether Dab2 is regulated by GATA-6 in the mouse embryo, in situ hybridization analyses were performed on staged wild-type and GATA-6-deficient mouse embryos using a radiolabeled Dab2 antisense cRNA probe. As reported previously, E6.5 GATA-6-deficient embryos are smaller in appearance but contain morphologically identifiable visceral and parietal endoderm (22.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows that, in E6.5 wild-type mouse embryos, GATA-6 is expressed in the visceral endoderm. Similarly, Dab2 mRNA is expressed abundantly in the extra-embryonic visceral endoderm (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, Dab2 mRNA was not detectable in E6.5 GATA-6−/− mutant embryos (Fig.2 C). This observation was confirmed in multiple GATA-6−/− embryos. No hybridization of the control Dab2 sense cRNA probe to wild-type or mutant embryos was observed (data not shown). These data demonstrate that, in the late egg cylinder stage embryo (E6.5), GATA-6 and Dab2 are coexpressed in the visceral endoderm (compare Fig. 2 A with 2B). In addition, these data confirm that Dab2 is regulated by GATA-6 in the visceral endoderm of the embryonic mouse (compare Fig. 2 B with 2C). Relatively little is understood about the function of Dab2 in developing vertebrates. To characterize the temporal and spatial pattern of Dab2 gene expression in the embryonic mouse and to define the cell specificity of Dab2 gene expression,in situ hybridization analyses were performed. In the primitive streak mouse embryo (E7.5), the gene encoding Dab2 is expressed exclusively within the visceral endoderm at the extra-embryonic pole of the embryo (Fig.3 A, arrowhead). This pattern of expression overlaps with GATA-6, which is expressed throughout the visceral endoderm and within the primitive streak mesoderm (9.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). At E9.5, expression of Dab2 mRNA was observed throughout the yolk sac endoderm (Fig. 3 B, white arrowhead). Expression was also observed in the branchial arch mesenchyme (Fig. 3 B, black arrowhead) and the septum transversum (Fig. 3 B, arrow). To determine which cells within the developing yolk sac expressed Dab2, in situ hybridization analyses were performed on serial sections through E9.5 embryos using a digoxigenin-labeled Dab2 riboprobe. As shown in Fig. 3 C, Dab2 mRNA was restricted to the visceral endoderm. The Dab2 gene was not expressed in other cells within the yolk sac, including the blood islands. This pattern of expression in the visceral endoderm is similar to that of GATA-6 (20.Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data demonstrate that, in the embryonic mouse, Dab2 is expressed in the visceral endoderm of the yolk sac in a pattern that overlaps with GATA-6. The finding that Dab2 was not expressed in the visceral endoderm of GATA-6-deficient embryos suggested that the gene encoding Dab2 was regulated either directly or indirectly by GATA-6. To determine whether forced expression of GATA-6 directly activates the human Dab2 promoter in nonendodermally derived cells, NIH-3T3 cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid under the transcriptional control of the 766-bp human Dab2 promoter (30.Albertsen H.M. Smith S.A. Melis R. Williams B. Holik P. Stevens J. White R. Genomics. 1996; 33: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and an expression plasmid encoding GATA-6. Of note, DNA sequence analysis of the human Dab2 promoter revealed seven consensus GATA binding sites (Fig. 4 A) (30.Albertsen H.M. Smith S.A. Melis R. Williams B. Holik P. Stevens J. White R. Genomics. 1996; 33: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, a 7-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed when NIH-3T3 cells were cotransfected with the pcDNAG6 expression plasmid and the pDab2Pr.luc reporter plasmid above levels observed following cotransfection of pDab2Pr.luc and pcDNA3 control expression plasmid. Despite the fact that GATA-6 and GATA-4 are coexpressed in the visceral endoderm, GATA-6 and GATA-4 null embryos exhibit distinct phenotypes (9.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 20.Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether GATA-4 also activated the human Dab2 promoter. To test this possibility, NIH-3T3 cells were cotransfected with an expression plasmid encoding GATA-4 and the pDab2Pr.luc reporter plasmid. Surprisingly, forced expression of GATA-4 failed to activate the human Dab2 promoter (Fig. 4 B). This result was confirmed in multiple independent transfections. These data strongly suggested that the Dab2 promoter was differentially activated by GATA-4 and GATA-6 in the developing embryo. To confirm that Dab2 is in fact differentially regulated by GATA-6 and GATA-4in vivo, the pattern of Dab2 gene expression in wild-type and GATA-4-deficient embryos was determined. In contrast to GATA-6-deficient embryos, which do not express Dab2 mRNA (see Fig.2 C), abundant Dab2 mRNA was observed in the visceral endoderm of E9.5 GATA-4-deficient embryos (Fig.5 B). These data confirm that,in vivo, Dab2 is differentially regulated by GATA-6 and GATA-4 in the visceral endoderm of the embryonic mouse. It is noteworthy that we reported previously that GATA-6 is up-regulated in GATA-4−/− embryos (20.Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Previous studies have revealed that the specificity of GATA factors may be mediated in whole or part, by the two zinc fingers that mediate DNA-binding activity and heterodimerization with other transcriptional regulators (13.Lee Y.

In fact the phenotype of GATA-1 null ES cells can be partially rescued by forced expression of the zinc finger DNA-binding domain of GATA-1 (38.Blobel G.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the functional specificity of GATA-6 is mediated solely through its zinc finger DNA-binding domain, expression plasmids encoding the DNA-binding domains of GATA-6 and GATA-4, respectively, fused to the VP16 transcriptional activation domain were cotransfected with the pDab2Pr.luc promoter-driven reporter plasmid in NIH-3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, both the pVP16/GATA-4 and pVP16/GATA-6 constructs transactivated the human Dab2 promoter. These data demonstrate that the specificity of GATA-6-induced transactivation of the Dab2 promoter is not mediated solely through its zinc finger DNA-binding domain and may involve either N- or C-terminal regions of the protein. GATA-6 lies upstream in a transcriptional cascade that regulates differentiation of the visceral endoderm (22.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 27.Koutsourakis M. Langeveld A. Patient R. Beddington R. Grosveld F. Development. 1999; 126: 723-732Crossref Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which GATA-6 regulates differentiation of the visceral endoderm remain to be elucidated. In the studies described in this report, we demonstrate that the 96-kDa phosphoprotein, Dab2, is a direct and specific downstream target of GATA-6 in the visceral endoderm. Dab2 is expressed in the visceral endoderm of wild-type mouse embryos, but not in GATA-6-deficient embryos. In the primitive streak embryo, Dab2 and GATA-6 are coexpressed in the visceral endoderm. Finally, we demonstrate that forced expression of GATA-6, but not GATA-4, transactivates the human Dab2 promoter. Consistent with this finding, the gene encoding Dab2 is differentially expressed in the visceral endoderm of GATA-6- and GATA-4-deficient embryos. GATA-6-deficient embryos do not survive past the primitive streak stage (E7.5) and exhibit increased cell death within the embryonic ectoderm (despite the fact that GATA-6 is not expressed in these cells) (22.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The phenotype of GATA-6-deficient embryos led us to hypothesize that GATA-6-mediated signaling between the visceral endoderm and the embryonic ectoderm is required for survival of the primitive streak embryo. Thus it is noteworthy that Dab2 is growth factor responsive and has been implicated in inter- and intracellular signaling (34.Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C. Ng S.W. Baldini A. Colitti C.V. Rock C.O. Berkowitz R.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 35.Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 36.Xu X.X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Specific serine residues in Dab2 are phosphorylated in response to growth factors, including colony stimulating factor 1 (35.Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Moreover, Dab2 interacts with the scaffold protein Grb2, suggesting a role in the ras-Sos G protein signal transduction pathway (36.Xu X.X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, it will be interesting to examine the role that Dab2 plays in regulating signaling within the visceral endoderm in the primitive streak embryo. It remains unclear what directs the functional specificity of GATA factors when two or more factors are developmentally coexpressed in a given tissue. We reported previously that GATA-4 and GATA-6 are developmentally coexpressed within the visceral endoderm (9.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 10.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, GATA-4- and GATA-6-deficient embryos display distinct phenotypes. In GATA-6-deficient embryos, the primitive endoderm is specified, but these embryos do not express early or late markers of endoderm differentiation, including HNF-4 (22.Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 27.Koutsourakis M. Langeveld A. Patient R. Beddington R. Grosveld F. Development. 1999; 126: 723-732Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, GATA-4-deficient embryos express both early and late markers of endoderm differentiation but exhibit gross defects in ventral morphogenesis resulting from defective endoderm-mesoderm signaling in the embryo (20.Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 21.Molkentin J.D. Lin Q. Duncan S.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). In vitro structure-function analyses revealed that, in addition to a conserved DNA-binding domain, GATA-4, -5, and -6 possess N-terminal activation domains that are not conserved in other GATA family members (32.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8515-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, forced expression of either GATA-4, -5, or -6 transactivates the cardiac-specific troponin C promoter in noncardiac muscle cells (9.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 10.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 39.Ip H.S. Wilson D.B. Heikinheimo M. Tang Z. Ting C.N. Simon M.C. Leiden J.M. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7517-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the functional specificity of GATA-4 and -6 in the visceral endoderm was mediated by subtle differences in their patterns of expression. Therefore, it is surprising that the human Dab2 promoter, which contains multiple consensus GATA binding sites, is differentially activated by GATA-6 and -4 and that the gene encoding Dab2 is differentially expressed in GATA-6- and GATA-4-deficient embryos. Orkin and coworkers (38.Blobel G.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported previously that forced expression of the zinc finger DNA-binding (and heterodimerization) domain of GATA-1 alone is sufficient to partially rescue the phenotype observed in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Moreover, they observed that a “knock-in” of the GATA-3 cDNA into the GATA-1 locus partially rescues the block in erythroid differentiation observed in GATA-1-defective mice (40.Tsai F.Y. Browne C.P. Orkin S.H. Dev. Biol. 1998; 196: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the function of GATA factors in vivo may be mediated via their conserved DNA-binding domain. However, the finding that either the GATA-6 or GATA-4 zinc finger DNA-binding domain fused to the VP16 transcriptional activation domain transactivated the human Dab2 promoter suggests strongly that the divergent N- or C-terminal regions of GATA-4 and -6 play critical roles in regulating the function of these closely related transcription factors. Moreover, the finding that Dab2 is not expressed in GATA-6-deficient embryos, but is expressed in GATA-4 null embryos, demonstrates genetic consequences of this target gene specificity within the visceral endoderm in vivo. As such, these data begin to explain the differences in the phenotypes observed between GATA-6 and GATA-4-deficient embryos. Future experiments are necessary to determine whether post-translational modifications of each respective factor and/or the capacity to differentially associate with transcriptional activators and/or repressors underlies the functional specificity of GATA-6 and GATA-4 in the visceral endoderm."
https://openalex.org/W2092902908,"A novel human chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase, designated C6ST-2, was identified by BLAST analysis of expressed sequence tag using the sequence of a previously described human chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase (C6ST-1) as a probe. The new cDNA sequence revealed an open reading frame coding for a protein of 486 amino acids with a type II transmembrane protein topology. The amino acid sequence displayed 24% identity to the human C6ST-1, and the highest sequence identity was found in the COOH-terminal catalytic domain. The expression of a soluble recombinant form of the protein in COS-1 cells produced an active sulfotransferase with marked specificity for polymer chondroitin. In contrast, keratan sulfate and oligosaccharides containing the Galβ1–4GlcNAc sequence, which are good acceptor substrates for the C6ST-1, hardly served as acceptors. The identification of the reaction product indicated that the enzyme is a novel chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase (C6ST-2) that mainly transfers sulfate to N-acetylgalactosamine. The coding region of C6ST-2 was contained in a single exon and localized to chromosome Xp11. Northern blot analysis of human brain poly(A)+ RNA revealed a single transcript of 2.4 kilobase pairs. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that C6ST-2 is developmentally regulated in various tissues with expression persisting through adulthood in the spleen. Thus, we demonstrated the redundancy in chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferases capable of forming chondroitin 6-sulfate, which is important for understanding the mechanisms leading to specific changes in the sulfation profile of chondroitin sulfate chains in various tissues during development and malignant transformation.

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are increasingly implicated as important regulators of many biological processes, such as cell migration and recognition, extracellular matrix deposition, and morphogenesis (for reviews see Refs. 1.Kimata K.

Growing evidence indicates that many of their functions are associated with the sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG)1moieties (for a review see Ref. 3.Poole A.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfate GAG has a linear polymer structure that possesses repetitive, sulfated disaccharide units containing glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). These sulfated GAGs are generated by a family of sulfotransferases that transfer sulfate from its high energy donor PAPS to the C-2 or C-3 position of GlcA residues or to the C-4 or C-6 position of GalNAc residues. Sulfotransferases generate considerable structural diversity by transferring sulfate with remarkable specificity for the underlying oligosaccharide substrate (for a review see Ref. 4.Bowman K.G.

Chondroitin sulfate GAGs considerably change in the position and degree of sulfation during normal embryonic development, growth, and malignant transformation (3.Poole A.R. Biochem.

The regulated expression of sulfated GAGs appears to be dependent on many factors including the availability of PAPS to the Golgi lumen; various competing sulfotransferases; and co-localization of appropriate acceptors, sulfotransferases, and PAPS transporters within a particular Golgi cisternae. However, the most important determinant of sulfated GAGs expression is probably the regulated expression observed for each member of the sulfotransferase gene family (7.Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Tone Y. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31377-31381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Based on known sulfated structures for chondroitin sulfate, the sulfotransferase gene family has been estimated to consist of at least four independent gene products described above, although it is possible that more sulfotransferases with different specificities exist. In terms of chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase (C6ST) that catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from PAPS to the C-6 position of the GalNAc residue, only one orthologous gene, designated C6ST-1, has been cloned to date from chickens, mice, and humans (8.Fukuta M.

To search for additional members of the sulfotransferase gene family involved in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis, the C6ST-1 protein sequence was used to screen the translated data base of expressed sequence tags (EST). Here, we describe the cloning of a human cDNA encoding a novel chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase, designated C6ST-2, with high specificity for polymer chondroitin. [35S]PAPS and unlabeled PAPS were purchased from NEN Life Science Products and Sigma, respectively. Chondroitin (a chemically desulfated derivative of whale cartilage chondroitin sulfate A), various chondroitin sulfate isoforms, desulfated keratan sulfate from bovine cornea, completely desulfatedN-sulfated heparin from porcine intestine, four unsaturated standard disaccharides derived from chondroitin sulfate,i.e.Δ4,5HexAα1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate), Δ4,5HexAα1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), Δ4,5HexAα1–3GalNAc(4, 6-O-disulfate), and Δ4,5HexA(2-O-sulfate)α1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4), chondro-4-O-sulfatase (EC3.1.6.9), and chondro-6-O-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.10) were purchased from Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). GlcNAcβ1-O-CH3 was purchased from Nakarai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc was a gift from K. Yoshida (Seikagaku Corporation). SuperdexTM Peptide HR10/30 and HITRAPTM desalting columns were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. tBLASTn analysis of the EST data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) with sequences from human C6ST-1 (10.Tsutsumi K. Shimakawa H. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), revealed an EST (GenBankTM accession number AI088880). The EST clone (IMAGE™ catalog number 1686996) was obtained from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Sequencing of this clone revealed a partial open reading frame with significant sequence similarity to human C6ST-1 and a 3′-untranslated region containing a potential polyadenylation signal. An additional sequence was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE) with the human brain Marathon-ReadyTMcDNA kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using an antisense primer, 5′-CTTGGGAACCGAGGAGACTGGTTC-3′ (the nucleotide sequence corresponding to 237–260; see Fig. 1) and an anchor primer provided by the company. PCR reactions were carried out with Ex Taq polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto) in 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide for 25 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s and 68 °C for 4 min after 5 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s and 72 °C for 4 min. The PCR products were subcloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega, Tokyo) and sequenced using a 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Several clones were sequenced to compensate for misreading by Ex Taqpolymerase. The combined cDNA sequence of the EST clone and the 5′-RACE product showed a single open reading frame. After completion, the data base search of the Human Genome Project, which recently became available (November 23, 1999) showed a genome sequence (Human Genome Project accession number AL022165) identical to the cDNA sequence. Comparison between the cDNA and the genome sequence revealed the genomic organization of the novel sulfotransferase gene. The cDNA fragment of a truncated form of the novel sulfotransferase, lacking the first NH2-terminal 63 amino acids of the novel sulfotransferase, was amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer (5′-CGGGATCCGAACGCGAGCAGGGAGCGG-3′) containing an in-frameBamHI site and a 3′ primer (5′-CGGGATCCGTGACTGACCCGGATCCGTG-3′) containing aBamHI site located 20 bp downstream of the stop codon. PCR reactions were carried out with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s in 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The PCR fragment was subcloned into theBamHI site of pGIR201protA (15.Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1394-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the fusion of the novel sulfotransferase to the insulin signal sequence and the protein A sequence present in the vector. An NheI fragment containing the fusion protein was inserted into the XbaI site of the expression vector pSVL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The expression plasmid (6 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM(Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Two days after transfection, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with and then resuspended in the assay buffer and tested for sulfotransferase activity using various polymer GAGs and oligosaccharide derivatives (see “Materials”) as sulfate acceptor substrates and [35S]PAPS as a sulfate donor. The reaction mixtures contained 10 μl of the resuspended beads, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2,3-dimercaptopropan-1-ol, 5 mm EDTA, 20 nmol of a given oligosaccharide acceptor or 100 μg of an acceptor polymer GAG, 24 μg of polylysine, 10 μm[35S]PAPS (about 1.0 × 105 dpm) in a total volume of 60 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was subjected either to gel filtration on a HITRAPTM desalting column when various polymer GAGs were used as acceptors or to anion exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column (YMC Co., Kyoto) using a linear salt gradient from 16 to 530 mm of NaH2PO4, as described previously (16.Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), when oligosaccharide derivatives were used as acceptors. The radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. The reaction products were isolated by gel filtration on a HITRAPTMdesalting column equilibrated with 0.25 mNH4HCO3/7% 1-propanol. The radioactive peak containing the product was pooled and evaporated to dryness. The isolated products were digested with 20 mIU of chondroitinase ABC. The digest was analyzed by an anion exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column as described previously (16.Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To confirm the disaccharide structure, chondro-4-O-sulfatase or 6-O-sulfatase digestion of the chondroitinase ABC digest was conducted with the remainder of the 35S-labeled isolated product as described previously (7.Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Tone Y. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31377-31381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A commercial human brain Multiple Tissue Northern blot II (CLONTECH) membrane was used for the analysis. 2 μg of polyadenylated RNA was loaded in each lane. The membrane was probed with a gel purified, radiolabeled (>1 × 109 cpm/μg), 1.3-kb PCR fragment amplified as described above. Commercial human multiple tissue cDNA panels (CLONTECH) were used for the analysis. The manufacturer normalizes each cDNA sample against six housekeeping genes. To verify this, we determined the levels of amplification of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, whose transcript is always present in the tissues at a constant level (17.Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Using the normalized cDNA input, we performed the amplification of a transcript, using a serial number of cycles (27, 30, and 33 cycles) to find the conditions for a semiquantitative amplification. The best results were obtained by carrying out 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 75 s in a total volume of 50 μl using the 5′ and 3′ primers described above, which were designed to span the intron in the novel sulfotransferase gene to discriminate a PCR product amplified from cDNA from, if any, one amplified from contaminating genomic DNA. A 10-μl aliquot of the amplified PCR products were then visualized by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. To confirm that the amplified DNAs were derived from the novel sulfotransferase mRNA, the amplified fragments were gel purified, subcloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences of the amplified DNAs were identical to that of the novel sulfotransferase cDNA (data not shown). We found a short sequence of 494 bp (GenBankTM accession number AI088880) through an EST approach in which we screened human EST data bases for sequences that were homologous to a human C6ST-1 (10.Tsutsumi K. Shimakawa H. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The EST clone from human brain was fully sequenced and found to be a sequence containing a partial open reading frame with significant sequence similarity to human C6ST-1 and a 3′-untranslated region containing a potential polyadenylation signal. An additional sequence was then obtained by 5′-RACE using the human brain cDNA as a template (see “Experimental Procedures”). The combined cDNA sequence of the EST clone and the 5′-RACE product showed a 5′-untranslated region of 10 bp, a single open reading frame of 1458 bp coding for a protein of 486 amino acids with four potential N-glycosylation sites, and a 3′-untranslated region of 0.7 kb, including a poly(A)+ tail (Fig.1). Northern blot analysis indicated that the mRNA was about 2.4 kb in length in various human brain tissues (see below), suggesting that the cDNA was approximately full-length. The open reading frame had a high G + C content of 71%. The deduced amino acid sequence corresponded to a 54,294-Da polypeptide. The predicted translation initiation site conformed to the Kozak consensus sequence for initiation (18.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar), and an in-frame stop codon was present upstream of the assigned initiating ATG codon. A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (19.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17170) Google Scholar) revealed one prominent hydrophobic segment of 19 amino acid residues in length in the NH2-terminal region, predicting that the protein has a type II transmembrane topology characteristic of many Golgi-localized sulfotransferases and glycosyltransferases cloned to date (Fig. 1). An additional characteristic feature in the amino acid sequence of the newly cloned gene was a cluster of six consecutive arginine residues in the cytoplasmic tail, which was located three residues from the amino terminus (Fig. 1). Data base searches indicated that the amino acid sequence displayed 24, 27, 40, 27, and 27% identity to human C6ST-1 (10.Tsutsumi K. Shimakawa H. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), respectively. The highest sequence identity was found in the COOH-terminal catalytic domain, in which three highly conserved motifs (I–III), reported in previous studies (13.Bistrup A. Bhakta S. Lee J.K. Belov Y.Y. Gunn M.D. Zuo F.-R. Huang C.-C. Kannagi R. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 14.Lee J.K. Bhakta S. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), were observed (Fig. 2). Motifs I and II contained elements that conformed to the recently described consensus binding motifs for the high energy sulfate donor, PAPS, which were predicted from the x-ray crystallographic analyses of estrogen sulfotransferase (20.Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and N-sulfotransferase (21.Sueyoshi T. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Wall F.E. Pedersen L.G. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These elements are found in all sulfotransferases cloned to date. Notably, six invariant cysteines were observed in the catalytic domain. Comparison of the primary structure of the newly cloned gene product and the five other cloned sulfotransferases indicates that the C6ST-2 sequence is the longest of those for the six enzymes, which range from 386 to 486 amino acids in length (Fig. 2). This sequence conservation strongly suggests that the newly cloned gene product is a novel sulfotransferase. Comparison of the newly cloned cDNA sequence with the genome sequence deposited in the Human Genome Project Data Base revealed the genomic structure and the chromosomal localization of the newly cloned gene. The gene spans over 24 kb, consists of at least two exons, and exhibits an intron-less coding region as shown in Fig.3. The intron/exon junctions followed the GT/AG rule (22.Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3296) Google Scholar) and were flanked by conserved sequences (data not shown). This gene is located on human chromosome Xp11. To facilitate the functional analysis of the putative sulfotransferase, a soluble form of the protein was generated by replacing the first 63 amino acids of the putative sulfotransferase with a cleavable insulin signal sequence and a protein A IgG-binding domain as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and then the soluble putative sulfotransferase was expressed in COS-1 cells as a recombinant enzyme fused with the protein A IgG-binding domain. The fused enzyme expressed in the medium was absorbed on IgG-Sepharose beads to eliminate endogenous sulfotransferases, and then the enzyme-bound beads were used as an enzyme source. The bound fusion protein was assayed for sulfotransferase activity using a variety of GAG acceptor substrates. As shown in TableI, activity was detected with polymer chondroitin and desulfated keratan sulfate, although the latter showed 20-fold less sulfate incorporation. In contrast, no activity was detected with various chondroitin sulfate isoforms or completely desulfated N-sulfated heparin. No detectable sulfotransferase activity was recovered by the affinity purification from a control pSVL transfection sample. These findings clearly indicate that the expressed protein is a sulfotransferase with marked specificity for polymer chondroitin.Table IComparison of polymer GAG acceptor specificity of C6ST-1 and -2AcceptorRelative rateC6ST-2C6ST-1%Chondroitin100100Chondroitin sulfate A029Chondroitin sulfate B023Chondroitin sulfate C026Chondroitin sulfate D040Chondroitin sulfate E01Desulfated keratan sulfate538CDSNS-heparin aCDSNS-heparin, completely desulfated N-sulfated heparin.00The recombinant C6ST-1 or -2 was incubated for 1 h with 100 μg each of the various acceptor substrates listed in the table under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction products were separated from [35S]PAPS and its degradation products by gel filtration chromatography on a HITRAP™ desalting column and were quantified by liquid scintillation counting.

Open table in a new tab The recombinant C6ST-1 or -2 was incubated for 1 h with 100 μg each of the various acceptor substrates listed in the table under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction products were separated from [35S]PAPS and its degradation products by gel filtration chromatography on a HITRAP™ desalting column and were quantified by liquid scintillation counting.

The values represent the averages of two independent experiments, where the two series of experiments gave essentially identical results. To identify the sulfotransferase reaction products, polymer chondroitin was labeled with [35S]sulfate by incubation with [35S]PAPS as a sulfate donor and the enzyme-bound beads as an enzyme source, and the products were isolated by gel filtration and then digested with chondroitinase ABC. The digest was analyzed using an anion exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.4, the digest yielded quantitatively a single 35S-labeled peak at the position of Δ4,5HexAα1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) (panel A), which was shifted to the position of inorganic sulfate by subsequent digestion with chondro-6-O-sulfatase (panel B) but not with chondro-4-O-sulfatase (panel C). These findings indicate that the sulfate was incorporated exclusively into the GalNAc C-6 position in a nonsulfated disaccharide unit, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc. Thus, the enzyme was identified as a novel chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase, designated C6ST-2 with marked specificity for a GlcAβ1–3GalNAc sequence. To distinguish the substrate specificity of C6ST-2 from that of previously cloned C6ST-1, the recombinant soluble C6ST-2 was compared with recombinant human C6ST-1 (10.Tsutsumi K. Shimakawa H. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) for their utilization of a variety of GAG acceptor substrates as well as various compounds structurally related to sulfated GAGs including GlcNAcβ1-O-CH3 and GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc. As shown in Tables I and II, C6ST-2 mainly utilized polymer chondroitin consisting of a nonsulfated disaccharide unit, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc, whereas C6ST-1 utilized various substrates including polymer chondroitin, various chondroitin sulfate isoforms, desulfated keratan sulfate, and GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc, which is essentially consistent with the previous findings that recombinant C6ST-1 efficiently catalyzes the sulfation of keratan sulfate as well as chondroitin sulfate (8.Fukuta M.

Acta. 1998; 1399: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, although both enzymes utilized the GlcAβ1–3GalNAc sequence as their best substrates, C6ST-2 exhibited a more strict specificity, exhibiting negligible sulfate incorporation into galactosides that are good acceptor substrates for C6ST-1. These findings indicate that the two chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferases differ in their substrate specificity and that C6ST-2 mainly transfers sulfate to the C-6 position of GalNAc in a nonsulfated disaccharide unit, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc.Table IIComparison of the oligosaccharide acceptor specificity of C6ST-1 and -2AcceptorSulfotransferase activity aThe values represent the averages of two independent experiments, where the two series of experiments gave essentially identical results.C6ST-2C6ST-1pmol/ml medium/hGlcNAcβ1-O-CH3ND bND, not detected (<0.01 pmol/ml medium/h).NDGlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcND5.1The recombinant C6ST-1 or -2 was incubated for 1 h with 20 nmol each of the various individual oligosaccharides listed in the table under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction products were subjected to anion exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column using a linear salt gradient from 16 to 530 mm of NaH2PO4 as described previously (16.Sugahara K.

Northern blot analysis of mRNA demonstrated a single band of 2.4 kb for all human brain tissues examined (Fig. 5). The expression of the C6ST-2 gene was next determined in various human tissues using PCR-based methods with normalized cDNA pools. A single amplified DNA of the expected size (1328 bp) was obtained from most cDNA preparations of the 18 adult and 8 fetal human tissues examined, although the amounts of the amplified cDNAs varied considerably (Fig. 6). Notably, expression was not detected in adult skin and appears to be developmentally regulated in various tissues with expression persisting through adulthood in the spleen.Figure 6Differential expression of the C6ST-2 gene in various human tissues. The procedures used are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The arrow indicates the expected position for a PCR product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We cloned the second chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase, C6ST-2, which is homologous to but distinct from previously cloned C6ST-1. The two chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferases exhibit distinct but overlapping acceptor substrate specificities as shown in Tables I and II. Polymer chondroitin is the best substrate for both enzymes, yet C6ST-2 exhibits a more strict specificity, exhibiting negligible sulfate incorporation into other substrates. Although no chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase with the specificity demonstrated for C6ST-2 has been reported so far, it has been suggested that at least one such sulfotransferase might exist, based on the observation that C6ST-1 knockout mice synthesize a small amount of chondroitin 6-sulfate and the mice are apparently normal and viable through adulthood (24.Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu H. Ishihama H. Nakamura E. Kurosawa N. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: S13-S14Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has now been confirmed by the cDNA cloning of C6ST-2. It is likely that additional distinct chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferases exist. For example, because neither C6ST-1 nor -2 transferred sulfate to the C-6 position of a GalNAc residue in a monosulfated disaccharide unit, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate), another chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase responsible for the synthesis of a disulfated disaccharide unit, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4, 6-O-disulfate) probably exists. Likewise, a chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase that transfers sulfate to a monosulfated disaccharide unit, GlcA(2-O-sulfate)β1–3GalNAc to form GlcA(2-O-sulfate)β1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) may also exist. The presence of multiple sulfotransferase isoforms has been reported for heparan sulfate d-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferases, where four homologous enzymes with distinct but overlapping acceptor specificities have been identified (25.Liu J. Shworak N.W. SinaØ P. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Fritze L.M.S. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5185-5192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, three heparan sulfate d-glucosaminyl 6-O-sulfotransferases have recently been reported (26.Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The recombinant C6ST-2 showed high specificity toward polymer chondroitin (Table I). No other chondroitin sulfate isoforms were utilized by the enzyme despite these chondroitin sulfate isoforms containing a small but significant amount of a nonsulfated disaccharide unit, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc. In strong contrast, the recombinant C6ST-1 utilized the nonsulfated disaccharide unit, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc in these isoforms (Ref. 10.Tsutsumi K. Shimakawa H. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and Table I). These findings suggest that the prior sulfation of the acceptor substrates strongly influences subsequent sulfations especially by C6ST-2. Thus, it will be interesting to determine how a preceding sulfation of saccharide residues on the reducing and/or the nonreducing side(s) of saccharide sequences influences the 6-O-sulfation of the penultimate GalNAc using sulfated hexasaccharides such as GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O- or 6-O-sulfate)β1–4GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O- or 6-O-sulfate) when such hexasaccharides become available. C6ST-2 may provide functional redundancy with C6ST-1, as implied by the C6ST-1 knockout experiment that showed no apparent anomalies (24.Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu H. Ishihama H. Nakamura E. Kurosawa N. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: S13-S14Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Alternatively or in addition, C6ST-2 may play a unique role in the expression of the sulfation pattern of chondroitin sulfate in some tissues in view of the different specificity (Tables I and II) and distinct tissue expression of C6ST-1 and -2. Each gene exhibits a unique tissue-specific pattern of expression. In fetal tissues, abundant expression of the C6ST-2 gene was seen in the heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and spleen. Particularly striking is the abundant expression of the C6ST-2 gene in the adult spleen, with modest expression in the lung, pancreas, ovary, peripheral blood leukocytes, and small intestine (Fig. 6). In contrast, human C6ST-1 exhibited abundant expression in the adult heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, and thymus and very little in adult lung and peripheral blood leukocytes (23.Fukuta M. Kobayashi Y. Uchimura K. Kimata K. Habuchi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a deficiency in chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase activity is reportedly associated with a heritable form of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (27.Toledo S.P. Mouraõ P.A. Lamego C. Alves C.A. Dietrich C.P. Assis L.M. Mattar E. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1978; 2: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28.Mouraõ P.A. Kato S. Donnelly P.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 98: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that the chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase appears to be essential for normal skeletal development. Therefore, the products of the genes may not provide functional back-up in all cells. More detailed characterization of the C6ST-1 knockout mice will be required. In addition, generation and analysis of C6ST-2 knockout mice will provide further insights into the possible distinct functions of these genes. Data base searches indicated that the amino acid sequence of C6ST-2 displayed 24, 27, 40, 27, and 27% identity to the human C6ST-1 (10.Tsutsumi K. Shimakawa H. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), KSGal6ST (11.Fukuta M. Inazawa J. Torii T. Tsuzuki K Shimada E. Habuchi O. J. Biol.

Commun. 1999; 263: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), respectively, showing that they constitute a family of highly conserved enzymes. Although C6ST-2 showed the highest sequence homology among the other five family members to Gn6ST that transfers sulfate exclusively to β-linked GlcNAc at the nonreducing end of an N-acetyllactosamine sequence (12.Uchimura K. Muramatsu H. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Kurosawa N. Mitsuoka C. Kannagi R. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22577-22583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the recombinant C6ST-2 did not show the enzyme activity toward oligosaccharides such as GlcNAcβ1-O-CH3and GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc (Table II). Conversely, both C6ST-1 and -2 utilized polymer chondroitin as the best substrates despite the lowest sequence homology between C6ST-1 and -2 among the six cloned sulfotransferases. Thus, it is difficult to predict the substrate specificity of a sulfotransferase simply from its primary sequence analysis. Specificity studies using appropriate oligosaccharide substrates are inevitable. The genomic organization has been elucidated for several sulfotransferases involved in GAG formation. The protein-coding sequences of the human heparan sulfateN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 and -2 genes are distributed over 14 and 13 exons that span approximately 35- and 6.5-kb lengths (29.Gladwin A.J. Dixon J. Loftus S.K. Wasmuth J.J. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1996; 32: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30.Humphries D.E. Lanciotti J. Karlinsky J.B. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), respectively. Comparison of the genomic organization of these genes shows a similar genetic exon-intron organization within the coding sequences (30.Humphries D.E. Lanciotti J. Karlinsky J.B. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, the genomic organization of the human C6ST-1 gene is relatively simple, its protein-coding sequence being divided into only two exons that span approximately 8 kb of the genomic sequence (10.Tsutsumi K. Shimakawa H. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, the gene structure of the human KSGal6ST (31.Mazany K.D. Peng T. Watson C.E. Tabas I. Williams K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1407: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), Gn6ST, 2H. Sakaguchi, H. Kitagawa, and K. Sugahara, submitted for publication. high endothelial cell Gn6ST (HEC-Gn6ST) (13.Bistrup A. Bhakta S. Lee J.K. Belov Y.Y. Gunn M.D. Zuo F.-R. Huang C.-C. Kannagi R. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. J.

Commun. 1999; 263: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) exhibits an intron-less coding region. Human C6ST-2 falls into the same pattern. Interestingly, chromosomal assignments of the three sulfotransferases, human KSGal6ST, Gn6ST, and C6ST-2, indicate that these genes are localized on different human chromosomes, 11p11.1-p11.2, 7q31, and Xp11 (Refs. 11.Fukuta M.

These findings strongly suggest that the three sulfotransferases diverged from an ancestor gene early in evolution. It remains to be determined whether the three other sulfotransferase genes, C6ST-1, HEC-Gn6ST, and I-Gn6ST, are likewise dispersed in the human genome. We thank Dr. K. Yoshida for the donation of the enzyme substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1984932299,"What defines the boundaries between methylated and unmethylated domains in the genome is unclear. In this study we used bisulfite genomic sequencing to map the boundaries of methylation that flank the 5′- and 3′-ends of the CpG island spanning the promoter region of the glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1) gene. We show that GSTP1 is expressed in a wide range of tissues including brain, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, pancreas, bone marrow, prostate, heart, and blood and that this expression is associated with the CpG island being unmethylated. In these normal tissues a marked boundary was found to separate the methylated and unmethylated regions of the gene at the 5′-flank of the CpG island, and this boundary correlated with an (ATAAA)19–24 repeated sequence. In contrast, the 3′-end of the CpG island was not marked by a sharp transition in methylation but by a gradual change in methylation density over about 500 base pairs. In normal tissue the sequences on either side of the 5′-boundary appear to lie in separate domains in which CpG methylation is independently controlled. These separate methylation domains are lost in all prostate cancer whereGSTP1 expression is silenced and methylation extends throughout the island and spans across both the 5′- and 3′-boundary regions.

These separate methylation domains are lost in all prostate cancer whereGSTP1 expression is silenced and methylation extends throughout the island and spans across both the 5′- and 3′-boundary regions. glutathioneS-transferase polymerase chain reaction Almost all organisms with a genome of greater than 109base pairs methylate their DNA, generally at the 5′-position of cytosine in CpG dinucleotides. In vertebrate genomes CpG sites occur about one-fifth of that expected on the basis of base composition. This has been attributed to the inherent mutability of 5-methyl cytosine to thymine (1Schmutte C. Jones P.A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, CpG-rich clusters, termed CpG islands, are found interspersed in large regions of the CpG-depleted sequence (2Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar). The maintenance of these CpG islands is indicative of a functional role, and it is now well established that they commonly span gene regulatory or gene promoter regions (3Antequera F. Bird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11995-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that CpG islands facilitate the expression of housekeeping genes by influencing nucleosomal positioning and that conditions that alter the formation of this array, such as methylation, may indirectly affect CpG island-dependent gene expression (4Patel S.A. Graunke D.M. Pieper R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5813-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Unlike CpG sites in the remainder of the genome, CpG islands are nearly always maintained in an unmethylated state (5Bird A.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Methylation of CpG islands can occur, however, for example on the inactive X chromosome, in promoters of imprinted genes and in aberrant methylation associated with oncogenesis (6Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.P. Advances in Cancer Research. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all of these cases methylation of CpG islands spanning the gene promoter regions is strongly associated with transcriptional silencing (7Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). As yet there is no clear understanding of what permits CpG islands to be preferentially unmethylated, what defines the boundary of the unmethylated region, and what leads to the aberrant methylation of CpG islands commonly seen in cancer. It has been suggested that maintenance of the unmethylated CpG islands is dependent on continued active transcription and/or on the binding of specific proteins that may protect them from methylation (8Cross S.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Analysis of the CpG island of the adenine phosphoribosyl transferase gene in transgenic mice, using mutated promoters, has shown that Sp1 sites are important for maintaining this CpG island in its unmethylated state (9Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 10Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Thus loss of specific proteins or interference with their binding or loss of active transcription may all contribute to CpG island promoter methylation in cancer. The GSTP1 gene that encodes glutathioneS-transferase-π (GST-π)1 contains a typical CpG island promoter region and is widely expressed in most tissues, with the exception of liver (11Terrier P. Townsend A.J. Coindre J.M. Triche T.J. Cowan K.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 845-853PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that GSTP1 becomes methylated in a high proportion of prostate cancers and that this methylation is accompanied by gene silencing (12Cookson M.S. Reuter V.E. Linkov I. Fair W.R. J. Urol. 1997; 157: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Lee W.-H. Morton R.A. Epstein J.I. Brooks J.D. Campbell P.A. Bova G.S. Hsieh W.-S. Isaacs W.B. Nelson W.G.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Detailed bisulfite sequencing analysis of the CpG island spanning the core promoter region of the GSTP1gene showed that methylation is extensive at essentially all CpG sites in prostate cancer DNA (14Millar D.S. Ow K.K. Paul C.L. Russell P.J. Molloy P.L. Clark S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CpG island is completely unmethylated in normal prostate tissue. However methylation was found to occur outside the CpG island in the CpG-depleted 3′-region of theGSTP1 gene in both normal and cancer tissue (14Millar D.S. Ow K.K. Paul C.L. Russell P.J. Molloy P.L. Clark S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this paper we have extended the bisulfite sequence analysis of the methylation profile of the GSTP1 CpG island/promoter to include the flanking regions where the normal and prostate cancer methylation profiles diverge. This has allowed identification of a defined “boundary” region of methylation at the 5′-flank, which is marked by a repeating ATAAA sequence. DNA from three primary prostate cancer samples and corresponding normal DNA from the diseased prostate were isolated as follows. Tissue samples were isolated from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Tissue slices, about 4-mm thick, were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and histology was performed on adjacent slices to identify regions of tumor and normal tissue. Tissue samples were isolated from the frozen slice using a punch and ground into a powder under liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. DNA was isolated using TrizolTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. DNA was further treated with RNase A and then proteinase K before phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA from the prostate tumor cell lines LNCaP and PC3 was prepared as described previously (14Millar D.S. Ow K.K. Paul C.L. Russell P.J. Molloy P.L. Clark S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA from the following normal tissues were obtained at autopsy from a 74-year-old male: brain (cerebellum), lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, liver, pancreas, prostate, heart, bone marrow, and blood. All tissues were examined by the pathologist and deemed disease-free. Sodium bisulfite converts cytosine residues to uracil residues in single-stranded DNA under conditions whereby 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. All cytosine residues remaining in the target sequence after PCR amplification represent previously methylated cytosines. The bisulfite reaction was carried out on 1–2 μg of HindIII-digested patient DNA for 16 h at 55 °C under conditions described by Clark et al. (15Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar) and Clark and Frommer (16Clark S.J. Frommer M. Saluz H.P. Wiebauer K. DNA and Nucleoprotein Structure In Vivo. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, Texas1995: 123-135Google Scholar). The samples were purified using Wizard DNA Clean-Up System desalting columns (Promega), eluted in 50 μl of H2O, and incubated with 5 μl of 3 m NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C. The solutions were neutralized by the addition of NH4OAc, pH 7, to 3 m, and the DNA was ethanol precipitated, dried, resuspended in 10 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1 mm EDTA in the case of tissue samples and 50 μl for cell line DNA and stored at −20 °C. PCR amplification reactions were performed within 24 h of bisulfite conversion. PCR amplifications were performed in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 2 μl of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA, 200 μm of each of the four dNTPs, 6 ng/μl of each of the primers, 1–2 mmMgCl2, 2 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), and reaction buffer consisting of 67 mm Tris, 16.6 mm ammonium sulfate, 1.7 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol in buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA).

Open table in a new tab The PCR fragments (I-IV) were cloned using the pCR-ScriptTM Amp SK(+) cloning kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturers instructions. Individual clones were either sequenced manually using Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (USB) or using PRISMTM DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (PE/ABI) with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and the automated 373A DNA Sequencer (ABI). For automated direct PCR sequencing and quantitative Genescan analysis, PCR products were reamplified using a Biotinylated/M13-tailed primer mixture containing GST11-M13 and GST12 primers (see TableI). The direct PCR sequencing reactions were performed using a PRISM Sequenase Dye Primer Sequencing Kit (PE/ABI) on an automated 373A DNA Sequencer (ABI). Details of the Genescan analysis are described by Millar et al. (14Millar D.S. Ow K.K. Paul C.L. Russell P.J. Molloy P.L. Clark S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The percent methylation is calculated using peak height of Cversus peak height of C plus peak height of T for each position. Multiple tissue Northern blots I and II were purchased from CLONTECH and probed with a PCR fragment generated (see Table I) from exon 7 of theGSTP1 transcript according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were then stripped and reprobed with the β-actin internal probe supplied to determine the loading levels of each mRNA species. Blots were exposed and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Like many “housekeeping” genes the GSTP1 gene contains a typical CpG island that extends from ∼400 base pairs upstream to 800 base pairs downstream of the transcription initiation site (Fig. 1 A). We have previously shown that the core promoter region is unmethylated in normal prostate cells but becomes methylated in prostate cancer. To understand the mechanism responsible for abnormal methylation of this CpG island in prostate cancer tissues we have now: 1) extended the methylation analysis of the GSTP1 gene across the entire CpG island in a range of normal tissues, particularly in relation to the extent of the unmethylated domain and the nature of its boundaries and 2) compared the methylation profile of the GSTP1 gene in these domains to the methylation profile in prostate cancer cells. The GST-π protein is known to be widely expressed in most tissues (11Terrier P. Townsend A.J. Coindre J.M. Triche T.J. Cowan K.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 845-853PubMed Google Scholar), but it is not known if the methylation pattern is equivalent in these tissues. Therefore, we examined the expression and methylation profile of the GSTP1 gene in a number of normal tissues including heart, brain placenta, lung, liver skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood. Fig.2 shows the tissue distribution of expression of GSTP1 by hybridization to multiple tissue mRNA Northern blots. Extensive expression was seen in almost all tissues, in agreement with data obtained from immunohistochemical analysis and studies of GST enzyme expression (11Terrier P. Townsend A.J. Coindre J.M. Triche T.J. Cowan K.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 845-853PubMed Google Scholar). However, lowered GSTP1 expression was observed in the liver; this is also consistent with previous data on protein levels (17Mathew J. Cattan A.R. Hall A.G. Hines J.E. Nelson R. Eastham E. Burt A.D. J. Clin. Pathol. 1992; 45: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Mehta R. Davis H.G. Laver G.W. Rowsell P.R. Bondy G.S. Cancer Lett. 1994; 84: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We first examined the methylation profile of the CpG-rich promoter and upstream flanking region. This region spanned 66 CpG sites (−56 CpG to +10 CpG relative to the transcription start site) and was analyzed by PCR amplification of two separate regions (PCRI and -II, Fig.1 B). The methylation profiles were analyzed by either direct PCR sequencing or cloning and sequencing. The core promoter region PCR fragment (PCRII; spanning CpGs −28 to +10) was analyzed by direct sequencing of the PCR product from each tissue sample. Direct sequencing gives an average of the methylation level at any one CpG site in the mixture of molecules amplified, as described by Millaret al. (14Millar D.S. Ow K.K. Paul C.L. Russell P.J. Molloy P.L. Clark S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The 5′-upstream PCR fragment (PCRI; spanning CpGs −56 to −30) contained a number of polymorphisms and therefore could not be used reliably for direct sequence analysis; consequently levels of methylation for the 5′-upstream region were determined by cloning the PCR product and sequencing individual clones. The polymorphisms found in the 5′-upstream region include variation in the number and fidelity of (ATAAA)19–24 repeats as well as sequence polymorphisms that include CpG site −48 and −33 (14Millar D.S. Ow K.K. Paul C.L. Russell P.J. Molloy P.L. Clark S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). An example of the methylation profile obtained for the clones generated from the PCR fragment amplified from normal prostate DNA is shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen the methylation profile is heterogenous; in fact a heterogenous methylation profile was common to all the normal tissue samples tested. The methylation data generated from the clonal analysis was averaged for each CpG site and as such corresponds to the direct PCR sequencing analysis. Analysis of the extent of methylation at individual CpG sites in the normal tissues, prostate, blood, brain, spleen, smooth muscle, lung, bone marrow, pancreas, and heart showed no methylation at all in the core promoter region (CpGs −28 to +10) (Fig.4 B). The exception was in normal liver DNA where significant methylation was seen in a cluster of sites, from CpG site −7 to CpG site +7 encompassing the transcription start site. A similar methylation profile was observed in two other samples of normal liver DNA that were sequenced (data not shown). Interestingly, liver was the only normal tissue examined that showed reduced GSTP1 expression, indicating a correlation between the methylation of these sites and expression. In the 5′-upstream region (CpGs −56 to −30), a marked changed was observed in the methylation pattern of all the normal tissues examined (Fig. 4 A). There was essentially no methylation in all the normal tissues up to and including CpG site −43; in contrast further upstream, from CpG site −44 and beyond, there was extensive methylation at most CpG sites. However, considerable variability was noted between different tissues in the level and pattern of methylation. Some sites (CpG sites −56, −55, and −53) were heavily methylated (75–100%) in nearly all tissues, whereas CpG site −52 and −48 was notable in that it was commonly unmethylated or undermethylated in some tissues. Also the six CpG sites, −44 to −49, were not methylated in smooth muscle cell DNA. Interestingly the abrupt transition from the DNA domain that is extensively methylated in all normal tissues to that which is unmethylated, between CpG sites −44 and −43, corresponds to the location of an (ATAAA)19–24repeat sequence (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, this pattern of methylation was found to occur in both GSTP1 alleles (data not shown). Immediately upstream of the (ATAAA)19–24repeat are two members of the Alu interspersed repeat sequence family (Fig. 1). The CpG sites (spanning CpGs −56 to −44) in the Alu sequence immediately adjacent to the (ATAAA)19–24 repeat were hypermethylated in all normal tissues examined (Fig.4 A). The (ATAAA)19–24 repeat thus corresponds to a distinct boundary that separates the methylated Alu repeat DNA at the 5′-flank of the CpG island from the unmethylated DNA within the CpG island. In contrast there is no clear sequence boundary at the 3′-end of theGSTP1 CpG island. Moreover the 3′-flank of the CpG island does not contain any Alu repeats or any other obvious repeat sequences. We previously noted that in normal prostate tissue the CpG island, up to CpG site 33 as well as sites 52 and 53, was unmethylated whereas the 3′-end of the GSTP1 gene from CpG site 69 to 103 was extensively methylated (14Millar D.S. Ow K.K. Paul C.L. Russell P.J. Molloy P.L. Clark S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To locate the exact methylation boundary at the 3′-end of CpG island, we have now sequenced a further 1 kilobase, from CpG site 13 in intron 1 to CpG site 67 in intron 4 (PCRIII and -IV, Fig. 1 B), from four normal prostate tissue samples. As shown in Fig. 5, there is no methylation in the CpG sites within the CpG island; however, there is considerable heterogeneity in the methylation profile at the 3′-flank of the CpG island and more CpG sites become methylated further downstream from the CpG island region. Interesting, the first site that is methylated is CpG 31, which is located at the junction of intron 1 and exon 2. The profile of each of the four normal prostate samples is different but all lack a distinct methylation boundary gradually increasing in methylation density over a 500-base pair region (see Fig.7).Figure 7Schematic methylation profile of theGSTP1 gene. A schematic representation of methylation profiles across the GSTP1 gene from normal tissue and prostate cancer tissues is shown in the panel underneath the map of the GSTP1 gene. The open box indicates unmethylated DNA sequences, the black boxes indicate highly methylated sequences, and the striped box indicates a low level of heterogeneous methylation. The methylation profiles shown reflect the data obtained from PCRs I-IV combined with methylation data previously obtained from PCRIII and -IV for normal and prostate cancer samples (14Millar D.S. Ow K.K. Paul C.L. Russell P.J. Molloy P.L. Clark S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). PCR3-(2381–2646) incorporates CpG sites 68–74, which are located in intron 4 and exon 5, PCR4-(3845–4161) incorporates CpG sites 96–103, which are located in exon 7 and the 3′-untranslated region. The methylation profile outside the PCR regions analyzed is speculative.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that the core promoter region (CpGs −28 to +10) and all sites examined in the body and 3′-end of the gene are extensively methylated in prostate cancer DNA (14Millar D.S. Ow K.K. Paul C.L. Russell P.J. Molloy P.L. Clark S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We have now extended this analysis to examine the extent of methylation in the region upstream of the core promoter in the region (CpGs −56 to −30) where we have found a marked boundary of methylation in normal tissue. We examined the methylation state in two prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3, which expressesGSTP1 and LNCaP, a GSTP1 nonexpressing cell line. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR we have shown that the treatment of LNCaP cells with 5-azacytidine, a demethylating agent, reactivatesGSTP1 mRNA expression (data not shown). In addition, we analyzed prostate tumor DNA from three patients (BC, CC, and DC) and DNA isolated from a histologically normal region of the prostate of one of these patients (BN). For LNCaP cells that do not express GSTP1 the extensive high level of methylation seen in the core promoter region was found to continue through the upstream region to and beyond the ATAAA boundary (Fig. 6 A). The methylation profile of DNA from PC3 cells that express GSTP1 was distinctly different from that of LNCaP cells. There was very little methylation in the upstream region except beyond the boundary region from (CpG −46 to −56). The low methylation observed is consistent with the generally lower methylation level seen in the core promoter (Fig. 6 B). Immunohistochemical analysis of both cell lines (data not shown) demonstrated that in the fully methylated LNCaP cells the GST-π protein was not expressed. PC-3 cells on the other hand harbored two distinct classes of cells. The majority of the cells expressed abundant GST-π protein, whereas in a subset of cells the GST-π protein could not be detected. This is consistent with the methylation patterns observed, that is the patterns represent an average of the methylation profile of the pooled DNA that contain a mixture of methylated and unmethylated molecules. In all three primary prostate cancer specimens (BC, CC, and DC), extensive methylation was seen downstream of the ATAAA boundary (−43 CpG to +10 CpG) (Fig. 6, A and B). The methylation pattern was heterogenous at any one CpG site and varied between patient samples. The levels of methylation across the promoter region varied from 25 to 75% methylation for each CpG site, as determined by direct PCR sequencing (Fig. 6 B). However, when we examined clones derived from the core promoter PCRII fragment we found that two distinct classes of molecules existed, those that were completely unmethylated and clones that showed extensive methylation through this region (data not shown). Because the cancer samples are not homogeneous and contain a mixture of normal and cancerous prostate epithelial cells, as well as stromal elements, it is likely that the unmethylated clones derive from contaminating normal cells. Therefore in the analysis of the clonal data from PCRI, presented in Fig.6 A, we have only presented the frequency of methylation of individual CpG sites among the population of methylated molecules. This explains why the methylation pattern in the cancer samples appears to be more intense from CpG −43 to −30 than from CpG −28 to CpG +10. As we have reported for GSTP1 and other genes methylated in cancer (14Millar D.S. Ow K.K. Paul C.L. Russell P.J. Molloy P.L. Clark S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19Stirzaker C. Millar D.S. Paul C.L. Warnecke P.M. Harrison J. Vincent P.C. Frommer M. Clark S.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2229-2237PubMed Google Scholar, 20Melki J.M. Vincent P.C. Clark S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3730-3740PubMed Google Scholar), individual differences in methylation of specific CpG sites, e.g. CpG site −36, were evident between the different patients. Beyond the boundary region (CpG −43), the extent and pattern of methylation was essentially similar in the three cancer samples and in the two normal prostate DNA samples studied, normal prostate and BN (Fig. 4 A and 6 A). It is well established that CpG islands remain unmethylated in normal cells and are generally associated with transcriptionally active genes (5Bird A.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, in cancer hypermethylation of CpG islands is a common aberration and this is often associated with gene silencing (6Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.P. Advances in Cancer Research. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). What has not yet been established is what defines the unmethylated CpG island domain, that is are there distinct sequence boundaries between methylated and unmethylated sequences or do the methylation profiles merge, and moreover how are these boundaries disrupted or bypassed in a cancer cell. To define the sequence boundaries between the methylated and unmethylated domains of a CpG island, we have finely mapped the methylation profile of the upstream and downstream ends of theGSTP1 CpG island in a number of normal tissues including prostate tissue. The GSTP1 gene was chosen because it has a typical CpG island spanning the promoter and exons 1–3 of the gene, it is known to be expressed in a range of normal tissues, and it is frequently hypermethylated in prostate cancer. A schematic representation of the methylation profiles across theGSTP1 CpG island found in normal prostate tissues and corresponding cancer samples is shown in Fig.7. In the normal prostate samples there is a marked transition from extensively methylated DNA upstream of theGSTP1 promoter region to the unmethylated domain of the CpG island and this coincides with the position of an (ATAAA)19–24 repeat. The boundary between the methylated and unmethylated domains in most other tissues examined also correlates well with the position of the ATAAA repeat sequence, even though in brain and smooth muscle the 5′-boundary position is less marked. The boundary separating the methylated and unmethylated DNA domains at the 3′-end of the GSTP1 CpG island is less clearly defined. There is considerable heterogeneity of methylation through a 500-base pair region spanning the end of the CpG island in intron 2 and extending into exons 3 and 4. In prostate cancer the distinct exclusion of methylation from the CpG island is lost, and the CpG island becomes methylated in both GSTP1 alleles. The nature of the sequences in the boundary region may give a clue as to the mechanism that normally protects the GSTP1 CpG island from methylation. The ATAAA repeat sequence that flanks the 5′-CpG island is present in about 20 copies and may itself act as a barrier to the methylation of the GSTP1 island in normal cells or could just be fortuitously located 5′ or 3′ to the “real” barrier sequence. The sequence immediately adjacent and extending 5′ from the ATAAA repeat is a member of the Alu family of interspersed repeated DNA sequences, most closely matching subfamily Sx. The 3′-end of the Alu sequence corresponds exactly with the start of the ATAAA repeat. Indeed the ATAAA repeat may be an expansion of the residual poly(A) tail of the Alu element. It has been noted previously that unmethylated CpG islands are often flanked by methylated Alu sequences (21Graff J.R. Herman J.G. Myohanen S. Baylin S.B. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22322-22329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In particular Graffet al. (21Graff J.R. Herman J.G. Myohanen S. Baylin S.B. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22322-22329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) showed that Alu sequences upstream of the E-cadherin and VHL genes were methylated in normal tissues, whereas adjacent CpG island sequences were not; however, the precise junction of the methylated and unmethylated domains was not determined in this study. CpG islands are not always flanked by Alu sequences, however, as noted for the 3′-end of the GSTP1 island. Indeed the 3′-boundary of the GSTP1 CpG island, which is diffuse in nature, does not correspond to any identifiable sequence motif. However the start of methylation does correlate with transition from high CpG density of the island to more sparsely spaced CpG sites in the body of the gene. Moreover some of the first CpG site that was found to be methylated (CpG site 31, 1546 base) is located at the junction between intron 1 and exon 2. This location is similar to another boundary of methylation we have previously identified at the 3′-end of the HIC1 CpG island, which also occurs at an exon/intron boundary (22Melki J.M. Vincent P.C. Clark S.J. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1999; 13: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As for theGSTP1 CpG island the HIC1 intron sequences are unmethylated, whereas adjacent exon sequences show substantial, but not complete methylation. As discussed above, the boundaries of CpG islands do not appear to harbor common sequence elements at their flanking ends. Indeed the ATAAA repeat sequence boundary found directly 5′ to the GSTP1 CpG island appears to be unique as we have not detected such a structure in other CpG island genes analyzed. However a similar pentanucleotide repeat element has been identified downstream of an Alu sequence in the 3′-untranslated region of a zinc finger cDNA sequence (23Chen H. Kalaitsidaki M. Warren A. Avamopoulos D. Antonarakis S. Genomics. 1992; 15: 621-625Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The ATAAA repeat could be fortuitously located 5′ or 3′ to a real barrier sequence, which protects CpG islands from methylation. Alternatively the ATAAA repeat may itself act as a distinct barrier to CpG island methylation of the GSTP1 gene in normal cells but is inert in prostate cancer cells. The repeat sequence may provide binding sites for specific protein factors, in particular members of the high mobility group-I(Y) family of mammalian nonhistone proteins. These have been demonstrated to bind specifically to the minor groove of A-T-rich sequences and to function as gene transcriptional regulatory proteins (24Friedmann M. Holth L.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Reeves R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Moreover elevated high mobility group-I(Y) gene expression has been associated with progressive neoplastic transformation (25Ram T.G. Reeves R. Hosick H.L. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2655-2660PubMed Google Scholar). Tamimiet al. (26Tamimi Y. van der Poel H.G. Denyn M.-M. Umbas R. Karthaus H.F.M. Debruyne F.M. Schalken J.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5512-5516PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that in prostate cancer high expression of high mobility group-I(Y) was observed in prostate tumors with higher Gleason grades. It will therefore be of interest to determine if the increased level of high mobility group-I(Y) expression plays a role in the initiation of hypermethylation of theGSTP1 CpG island in prostate cancer. Whether hypermethylation in the tumor cell is initiated from the ends of the CpG island or at “hypermethylation centers” within the CpG island is unclear. From studies of transfected DNA, Graff et al. (21Graff J.R. Herman J.G. Myohanen S. Baylin S.B. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22322-22329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) have suggested that methylation may progressively encroach from methylated Alu sequence regions flanking CpG islands. Others have suggested that methylation is initiated at “centers” within the islands and progressively spreads (27Toth M. Lichtenberg U. Doerfler W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3728-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The GSTP1gene from all the separate prostate cancer tissues was found to be extensively methylated throughout the entire CpG island. However, the DNA samples studied were isolated from cells many generations after the initiation of the methylation process. It is therefore difficult to infer how the process may have begun. In the case of the PC3 (Fig. 5) and DU145 (data not shown) prostate cancer cell lines, methylation is found in the core CpG-rich promoter region but does not extend through the 5′-flanking region. This pattern of methylation within the island is also seen in DNA from liver, where GST-π is expressed at low levels. This would suggest that in these cells at least methylation could have been initiated at sites within the CpG island or spread from the 3′-methylated flanking sequences. The susceptibility to initial methylation events in cancer may be determined by transcriptional activity (or lack of) or by the loss of or interference to binding of specific transcription factors such as Sp1 (9Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 10Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Interestingly it has been noted that strong expression of GST-π protein in normal prostate epithelium is limited to the basal cells and that many differentiated secretory epithelial cells do not stain with anti-GST-π antibodies (12Cookson M.S. Reuter V.E. Linkov I. Fair W.R. J. Urol. 1997; 157: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus methylation of the GSTP1 gene in prostate cancer cells may be preceded by a loss of expression of the gene in normal epithelium. These observations indicate that early GSTP1 gene inactivation in prostate cancer cells may be a mechanism that predisposes the CpG island promoter region to thede novo methylation pathway resulting in the spread of methylation throughout the island in both alleles.

https://openalex.org/W2028096667,"RSP5 is an essential gene inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and was recently shown to form a physical and functional complex with RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II). The amino-terminal half of Rsp5 consists of four domains: a C2 domain, which binds membrane phospholipids; and three WW domains, which are protein interaction modules that bind proline-rich ligands. The carboxyl-terminal half of Rsp5 contains a HECT (homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain that catalytically ligates ubiquitin to proteins and functionally classifies Rsp5 as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. The C2 and WW domains are presumed to act as membrane localization and substrate recognition modules, respectively. We report that the second (and possibly third) Rsp5 WW domain mediates binding to the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA pol II large subunit. The CTD comprises a heptamer (YSPTSPS) repeated 26 times and a PXY core that is critical for interaction with a specific group of WW domains. An analysis of synthetic peptides revealed a minimal CTD sequence that is sufficient to bind to the second Rsp5 WW domain (Rsp5 WW2) in vitro and in yeast two-hybrid assays. Furthermore, we found that specific “imperfect” CTD repeats can form a complex with Rsp5 WW2. In addition, we have shown that phosphorylation of this minimal CTD sequence on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues acts as a negative regulator of the Rsp5 WW2-CTD interaction. In view of the recent data pertaining to phosphorylation-driven interactions between the RNA pol II CTD and the WW domain of Ess1/Pin1, we suggest that CTD dephosphorylation may be a prerequisite for targeted RNA pol II degradation.

RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain glutathioneS-transferase phosphate-buffered saline Yes kinase-associated protein small peptides synthesized on devivatized membranes RSP5 (reversion of Sptphenotype) is an essential gene in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene was originally isolated in a screen for suppressors of SPT3 mutations (1.Eisenmann D.M. Arndt K.M. Ricupero S.L. Rooney J.W. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).SPT3 is part of the multicomponent protein named SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5acetyltransferase), which has been implicated in at least two facets of RNA pol II1activity. These include the function of the TATA box-binding protein Spt15 and the activity of Gcn5 histone acetyltransferase (1.Eisenmann D.M. Arndt K.M. Ricupero S.L. Rooney J.W. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 2.Roberts S.M. Winston F. Genetics. 1997; 147: 451-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Rsp5 was recently shown to form a physical and functional complex with RNA pol II (3.Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to its interaction with RNA pol II, Rsp5 possesses multiple and diverse substrates, suggesting that Rsp5 affects a wide range of cellular processes. For example, RSP5 is known to down-regulate the activity of several plasma membrane-associated proteins, including Fur4 uracil permease, Gap1 amino acid permease, and the integral membrane protein proton ATPase (5.Hein C.

Rsp5 was recently proposed to be a component of a complex regulating an early stage of endocytosis (9.Wendland B. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Mutations in RSP5 have also been shown to regulate stability of a minichromosome (10.Uesono Y. Fujita A. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the cytoplasmic/mitochondrial distribution of Mod5, an enzyme that modifies tRNA (11.Zoladek T. Tobiasz A. Vaduva G. Boguta M. Martin N.C. Hopper A.K. Genetics. 1997; 145: 595-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Rsp5-mediated ubiquitination has been implicated in mitochondrial inheritance (12.Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The primary structure of Rsp5 reveals a multidomain topology (Fig.1). The amino-terminal half of Rsp5 consists of four domains: a C2 domain, which may bind membrane phospholipids and inositol phosphates in a calcium-regulated manner; and three WW domains (WW1, WW2, and WW3), which are protein interaction modules that bind proline-rich ligands. The carboxyl-terminal half of Rsp5 contains a HECT (homologous to E6-APcarboxyl terminus) domain (13.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The HECT domain encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity, which ligates ubiquitin in the process of targeted protein degradation (14.Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Presumably, the C2 and WW domains act as membrane localization and substrate recognition modules for Rsp5, respectively (3.Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 15.Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol.

The WW domain is a small protein interaction module composed of 40 amino acids that fold into a three-stranded, anti-parallel β-sheet, which constitutes a hydrophobic pocket for binding proline-rich ligands (17.Bork P.

Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Based on their binding specificity, the WW domains can be divided into two major and three minor groups (21.Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Group I WW domains, exemplified by the YAP and Dystrophin WW domains, bind proteins with PPXY motifs (18.Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar,22.Rentschler S. Linn H. Deininger K. Bedford M.T. Espanel X. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although the first proline of the PPXY motif greatly enhances binding to Group I WW domains, our laboratory (24.Chen H.I.

The description for Group I WW domain binding motifs indifferently uses the phrases PXY core motifs and PPXY motifs. Group II WW domains, exemplified by WW domains of FE65- and Formin-binding proteins, bind to PPLP motifs (26.Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Among the remaining three groups of WW domains, Groups III and V bind proline-rich sequences (21.Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar,28.Komuro A. Saeki M. Kato S. J. Biol.

Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 977-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, Group IV WW domains were shown to interact with short sequences containing phosphorylated serine or phosphorylated threonine followed by proline. Interestingly, the binding of Group IV WW domains to their ligands was shown to be phosphorylation-dependent (29.Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 30.Morris D.P. Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol.

The RNA pol II large subunit is the major component of the transcriptional machinery responsible for regulated expression of >90% of genes (31.Dahmus M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The yeast homolog of RNA pol II contains, in its CTD, a heptamer sequence (YSPTSPS) repeated perfectly 22 times and imperfectly four times (Fig. 1). An examination of the CTD sequence revealed a PXY core motif within the tandemly repeated heptamer peptide YSPT SPSY SPTSPS (32.Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The CTD has many potential sites for phosphorylation by CTD kinases, most notably serines 2 and 5, and dephosphorylation by CTD phosphatases (31.Dahmus M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition to these interactions, a well known function of the CTD is the ability to recruit many transcriptional components (33.Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Our research is focused on the structural and functional characterization of the WW domain as a protein interaction and signaling module (34.Sudol M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Following the complete sequencing of theS. cerevisiae genome, we hypothesized that we could predict protein ligands binding to yeast WW domains based on determinations of their consensus binding motifs. Finally, we decided to further investigate a potential interaction between Rsp5 WW domains and the RNA pol II CTD because the PXY motif was found to be a minimal basic core that could interact with Group I WW domains (23.Nguyen J.T. Turck C.W. Cohen F.E. Zuckermann R.N. Lim W.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 24.Chen H.I. Einbond A. Kwak S.J. Linn H. Koepf E. Peterson S. Kelly J.W.

Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our strategy for identifying cognate ligands was to utilize phage display combinatorial peptide libraries and to determine the optimal ligand preference for each yeast WW domain, including the three Rsp5 WW domains. After obtaining the consensus sequences from binding phages, the yeast data base was searched for proteins containing the motifs in an effort to identify potential ligands for subsequent biochemical and genetic validation of WW domain-ligand complexes. Data base searches and pull-downs with the Rsp5 WW domains revealed a potential interaction with RNA pol II, and this interaction was extensively characterized. We report that Rsp5 WW2 (and possibly WW3) mediates binding to the CTD of RNA pol II. We were able to uncover a minimal CTD peptide that is sufficient to bind to Rsp5 WW2 in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid assay. In addition, we have shown that phosphorylation of the minimal CTD sequence on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues may act as a negative regulator of the Rsp5 WW2-CTD interaction. In view of the recent data pertaining to phosphorylation-driven interactions between the RNA pol II CTD and the Ess1/Pin1 rotamase (30.Morris D.P. Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31583-31587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we suggest that CTD dephosphorylation may be a prerequisite for targeted RNA pol II degradation. The Rsp5 WW domains and the CTD of RNA polymerase II were amplified and cloned into pGEX-2TK vectors, allowing us to purify GST fusion proteins. The 5′- and 3′-primers of each construct are as follows (dashes indicate restriction enzyme sites): 5′-Rsp5-WW1, ACTCAGGGATCC-AGCGGTACAACAGCTGCT; 3′-Rsp5-WW1, GTACTAGAATTC-AGGAATTATCTGATGATCCACC; 5′-Rsp5-WW2, ACTCAGCCCGGG-TTCCTCTGTAACAGTTCAAGTG; 3′-Rsp5-WW2, TACGACGAATTC-TGGTGGTATTTGTAGGGCCATAAG; 5′-Rsp5-WW3, CTATACGGATCC-ATTCAGCAACAACCGGTCTCC; 3′-Rsp5-WW3, GTACTAGAATTC-GACATTGTCCCGGCAATATTCT; 5′-CTD, ACTCAGGGATCC-GATTATGGTGAAGCCACGTCTCC; and 3′-CTD, GTACTAGAATTCCGTCTTGCTTTGGAGAATATGC. The other constructs, YAP, MSB1, p53BP2, and WBP-1 PPXY and Mena -PPLP, were previously described (24.Chen H.I. Einbond A. Kwak S.J. Linn H. Koepf E. Peterson S. Kelly J.W. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17070-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26.Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol.

The primers were designed with additional restriction enzyme sites,BamHI or SmaI and EcoRI, for ligation into the pGEX-2TK vector. Amplified sequences of the domains were ligated in frame to the pGEX-2TK vector. Since the WW domains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, the clones were verified by DNA sequencing and expression of the GST fusion protein. To identify RNA pol II among the proteins isolated as described under “Pull-down Experiments with Yeast Lysates,” monoclonal antibodies H5 and H14 were used (gifts of David Bregman) (36.Kim E. Du L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Antibody H5 recognizes a CTD heptapeptide with phosphorylated serine 2, and antibody H14 recognizes a CTD heptapeptide with phosphorylated serine 5 (37.Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M.

We modified two plasmids to perform an in vivo test of protein interactions (see “Yeast Two-hybrid Assay”). Briefly, pGAD424 (CLONTECH) contains the Gal4 activation domain and a site for generating fusion proteins consisting of the activation domain and a translated gene of interest. The plasmid pGBT9 (CLONTECH) contains the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and also contains sites suitable for cloning. We modified the multiple cloning sites of pGAD424 and pGBT9 so that we were able to subclone the DNA fragment containing the second Rsp5 WW domain into pGAD424 and the DNA containing the minimal CTD peptide into pGBT9. The resulting clones were named pGAD424-Rsp5-WW2 and pGBT-OneCTD. For pGBT9-OneCTD, we annealed two complementary oligonucleotides synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. The DNA fragments contained two unique restriction enzymes at the ends of the complementary sequences to ensure proper insertion into pGBT9. After annealing and ligating the DNA, clones were selected, sequenced for proper insertion of sequences, and named pGBT9-OneCTD. Expression of the GST fusion proteins was induced after adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to bacterial cells at logarithmic growth and growing the cells for an additional 2 h at 30 °C. The culture was centrifuged, and the cell pellet was redissolved in PBS and 1% Triton X-100, sonicated, and centrifuged. The clarified lysate was aliquoted into 1-ml Eppendorf tubes and stored at −80 °C prior to use. Examination of the quality of the expressed fusion protein was performed using the following procedure. The lysates were incubated in the presence of glutathione beads for 30 min, washed with PBS and 1% Triton X-100, washed with PBS, and redissolved in loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 50% glycerol, 55 mg of β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% Coomassie Brilliant Blue). The beads were boiled for 2 min, and proteins were resolved on a 10.5% gel by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After running the gel for ∼1 h at 100 V or until the loading buffer ran to the bottom of the gel, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue Dye for 30 min, and the unbound dye was removed. The vectors containing the Rsp5 WW domains (pGEX-2TK) have a thrombin-cutting site and protein kinase A phosphorylation site between GST and the WW domain. The fusion proteins were incubated with glutathione-linked agarose beads and washed with PBS and 1% Triton X-100, PBS, and heart muscle kinase buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 12 mm MgCl2). The beads were incubated for 30 min with 60 μl of heart muscle kinase buffer plus 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 units of protein kinase A (Sigma), and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). The beads were washed in a flow-through column with PBS and 1% Triton X-100 and with PBS before elution with 10 mm free glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). The radioactive proteins were stored on ice until use as described under “Far Western Blotting” or “Pull-down Experiments with Yeast Lysates.” Using each WW domain of Rsp5, we searched for preferred binding motifs using various combinatorial peptide libraries. Details concerning the construction of the libraries were discussed previously (38.Linn H. Ermekova K.S. Rentschler S. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, we used two libraries; one library displays 14-merX 6PPX 6 peptides, and the other displays 16-merX 6PXXPX 6peptides, where X denotes any amino acid residue and P represents the position of the fixed proline residue. Each library consists of 1.5 × 109 unique clones. After three rounds of “panning” each Rsp5 WW domain immobilized in wells of microtiter plates, phages were selected for their ability to bind the WW domains and not the GST fusion protein itself. The inserts of selected phages were sequenced and translated for peptide sequences. The consensus sequences identified for each Rsp5 WW domain were used to search the yeast data base for proteins containing the binding motifs. The general and specific data base searches, listed in Table II, utilized the Pam30 advanced BLAST algorithm, filters off, expected number set to 10 million, and word size set to 2. The PXY search employed the φ BLAST program using the SPSYS pattern (39.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Wild-type yeast cells, W303-1A (Matα, ura3-1, leu2-3,112, trp1-1, can1-100, ade2-1, his3-11,15 [psi +]), were grown in YPD (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose) medium overnight. The cells were washed with sterilized water and resuspended in protein extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors. The resuspended cells were divided into 500-μl aliquots using 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. An equivalent amount of 0.2-mm glass beads was added, and the solution was vortexed vigorously for 5 min and placed on ice for 5 min. After vortexing two additional times, the solutions were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 13,000 rpm. The clarified supernatants were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, and the pellets were discarded. Using 800 μg of prepared yeast extracts, beads containing Rsp5 WW1, WW2, or WW3 were incubated in binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween, and 1% bovine serum albumin) for a minimum of 12 h at 4 °C. Each preparation was washed twice with binding buffer without bovine serum albumin, and the binding proteins were released in loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol. Next, the samples were assayed for proteins binding to respective WW domains. The samples were run on 10.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in Western Wash solution (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.9% NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 5% milk and probed for 6 h at 4 °C with their respective radiolabeled WW domains used in the binding experiments. Afterward, the blots were washed at least three times with Western Wash solution containing 5% milk and exposed to film. The GST fusion proteins were resolved on 10.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transferring the gel to nitrocellulose membranes, the blot was blocked for at least 4 h at 4 °C with Western Wash solution containing 5% milk. The blots were probed with radioactively labeled GST-Rsp5 WW domains or GST-yeast CTD and washed as described above. Small peptides were synthesized on derivatized cellulose membranes (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.) as described previously (40.Frank R. Doring R. Tetrahedron. 1988; 44: 6031-6040Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 41.Blankenmeyer-Menge B. Nimitz B. Frank R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 1701-1704Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Each membrane was blocked, incubated with radiolabeled probe, and washed using 1× blocking buffer (supplied by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.) in Western Wash solution. The membranes were blocked for 6 h at 4 °C, probed for 12 h at 4 °C, and washed three times for 15 min each at room temperature (24.Chen H.I. Einbond A. Kwak S.J. Linn H. Koepf E. Peterson S.

The two yeast plasmids (pGAD424-Rsp5-WW2 and pGBT9-OneCTD) were transformed individually into HF7c cells (42.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4837) Google Scholar). For pGAD424-Rsp5-WW2, clones were selected on agar plates minus leucine; and for pGBT9-OneCTD, clones were selected on agar plates minus tryptophan. Simultaneously, the clone containing pGBT9-OneCTD was grown and additionally transformed with pGAD424-Rsp5-WW2. Clones containing both pGAD424-Rsp5-WW2 and pGBT9-OneCTD plasmids were selected on agar plates minus leucine and tryptophan. A selected clone containing both plasmids was grown on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and observed for its ability to grow. We decided to identify potential ligands for each WW domain of Rsp5 and used the following approach. After screening phage-displayed combinatorial peptide libraries, we determined the optimal peptide sequence for ligands to each WW domain and identified potential interacting proteins containing these sequences in the yeast proteome. The results of “Phage Display Analysis” for each Rsp5 WW domain are presented in Table I. The consensus sequence for each Rsp5 WW domain is as follows: WW1, (D/P)PP(S/P"
https://openalex.org/W1988147607,"Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and tau, which is involved in Alzheimer's disease, are major cytoskeletal proteins in neurons. These proteins are involved in microtubule assembly and stability. To further characterize MAP2, we took a strategy of identifying potential MAP2 binding partners. The low molecular weight MAP2c protein has 11 PXXP motifs that are conserved across species, and these PXXP motifs could be potential ligands for Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. We tested for MAP2 interaction with SH3 domain-containing proteins. All neuronal MAP2 isoforms bound specifically to the SH3 domains of c-Src and Grb2 in anin vitro glutathione S-transferase-SH3 pull-down assay. Interactions between endogenous proteins were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation using brain lysate. All three proteins were also found co-expressed in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. Surprisingly, the SH3 domain-binding site was mapped to the microtubule-binding domain that contains no PXXP motif. Src bound primarily the soluble, non-microtubule-associated MAP2c in vitro. This specific MAP2/SH3 domain interaction was inhibited by phosphorylation of MAP2c by the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 but not by protein kinase A. This phosphorylation-regulated association of MAP2 with proteins of intracellular signal transduction pathways suggests a possible link between cellular signaling and neuronal cytoskeleton, with MAP2 perhaps acting as a molecular scaffold upon which cytoskeleton-modifying proteins assemble and dissociate in response to neuronal activity.

MAP2 belongs to a family of heat stable microtubule-associated proteins found in eukaryotic cells. Other family members include MAP4, a ubiquitous protein, and tau, a neuronal protein involved in Alzheimer's disease (4.Lee G. Curr. Opin.

Members of this family share a common microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) consisting of approximately 100–130 amino acid residues near the carboxyl terminus of the molecule. The MTBD contains three or four tandem imperfect repeats of 18 amino acid residues separated by a variable inter-repeat region of approximately 12 amino acid residues (7.Lewis S.A. Wang D.H.

The interactions among PP1, PP2A, tau, and microtubules were postulated to regulate the phosphorylation state of tau, and alterations to these interactions could lead to the development of tauopathies seen in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's (12.Goedert M.

This increasing body of evidence suggests that microtubule-based structural proteins like MAP2 and tau could play other physiological roles in addition to the regulation of microtubule assembly. Like tau, MAP2 is a phosphoprotein, and its cellular activities are regulated by phosphorylation. The phosphorylation state of MAP2 is modulated by neural activity in vivo (15.Aoki C. Siekevitz P. J.

Commun. 1996; 218: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The precise binding sites on MAP2 for these proteins have yet to be identified. Except for the MTBD at the carboxyl terminus and the type II regulatory subunit of PKA binding region (30 amino acids) in the amino terminus of MAP2, the rest of the molecule (≥65%) has no assigned function. It is possible that MAP2 possesses some as yet uncovered role in the neuron, in addition to its contribution to cellular structural integrity. This paper presents evidence of a novel interaction of MAP2 with the non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase c-Src and the adaptor protein Grb2. The data support the emerging idea that members of signal transduction pathways interact with microtubule-associated proteins and could thereby regulate the organization and dynamics of the cytoskeleton.

Construction of the expression plasmid pET3aMAP2c, which encodes the full-length rat MAP2c protein, has been described (1.Gamblin T.C. Nachmanoff K. Williams R.G. Halpain S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12576-12586Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutant forms of MAP2c were made by PCR cloning using pET3aMAP2c or one of the subsequently constructed expression plasmids described below as PCR templates. The open reading frames in all constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing conducted at Scripps Nucleic Acid Core facility with PE Biosystems instrument 373 A using the Taq DNA polymerase, fluorescence dye detection, and dideoxy terminator chemistry (42.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Custom designed primers with unique restriction enzyme recognition sites were used to amplify specific regions of MAP2c cDNA and to facilitate ligation of the amplified PCR fragments into expression vectors. DNA amplifications were conducted in a model 9600 DNA thermal cycler (PE Biosystems). The amplification protocol consisted of 30 cycles of the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 57 °C for 1 min, and chain extension at 72 °C for 1 min (5 min for the last cycle) with recombinant Pfu DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's procedure. The PCR fragments encoding the amino acids 1–299, 1–310, 154–467, and 296–467 of MAP2c were digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into a previously NdeI/BamHI-digested pET-11a plasmid. The PCR fragment encoding amino acids 300–400, the MTBD, was digested with NcoI and BamHI and ligated into a previouslyNcoI/BamHI-digested pET-32a plasmid. The new constructs were transformed into cloning host E. coli strain DH5α, XL-1 Blue, XL-2 Blue, or JM109 and were also transformed into expression host E. coli BL21(DE3) by the CaCl2transformation method. Stable transformants were selected on LB plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. To make internal deletion MAP2c constructs, separate DNA fragments of MAP2c were amplified by PCR and then ligated together. The expression plasmid Δ134–141 encoding MAP2c, lacking the amino acids 134–141, was made by amplifying the DNA sequence encoding the amino acids 1–133 and 142–467. Both PCR products were gel-purified and digested withBssSI. The 1–133 fragment was further digested withNdeI, whereas the 142–467 fragment was digested withBamHI. The digested DNA fragments were gel-purified again and ligated into the NdeI/BamHI-digested expression vector pET-3a. The ligation of these two fragments introduced an additional valine at the junction between the amino acids 133 and 142. The Δ134–141 construct was transformed into JM109 and BL21(DE3). The expression plasmids Δ219–290, Δ290–297, and Δ290–400, which encode MAP2c lacking regions 219–290, 290–297, and 290–400, respectively, were constructed using a similar strategy, except that the PCR products were initially digested withBsiWI prior to digestion with NdeI orBamHI. In making the double deletion construct Δ134–141, 219–290, a PCR fragment corresponding to the region 142–467, Δ219–290, was amplified from the Δ219–290 single deletion plasmid described above. This PCR fragment was digested with BssSI and BamHI, gel-purified, and then ligated to theNdeI/BssSI-digested fragment 1–133. For the double deletion construct Δ134–141, 290–297, a PCR fragment corresponding to the region 1–289, Δ134–141, was amplified from the Δ134–141 single deletion plasmid described above. This PCR fragment was sequentially digested with BsiWI followed byNdeI, gel-purified, and then ligated to theBsiWI/BamHI-digested fragment 298–467. To construct the Δ219–297 plasmid, the Δ219–290 plasmid was digested with NdeI and BsiWI, and the larger fragment, which encodes the region 1–218, was gel-purified. The Δ290–297 plasmid was digested with BsiWI and BamHI, and the smaller fragment, which encodes the region 298–467, was gel-purified. The 1–218 NdeI/BsiWI fragment was ligated to the 298–467 BsiWI/BamHI fragment and then inserted into an NdeI/BamHI-digested pET-3a plasmid. To construct the triple deletion Δ134–141, 220–297 plasmid, the Δ134–141, 219–290 plasmid was digested withNdeI and BsiWI, and the larger fragment, which encodes the region 1–218, Δ134–141, was gel-purified. This fragment was ligated to the 298–467 BsiWI/BamHI fragment and then inserted into an NdeI/BamHI-digested pET-3a plasmid. These constructs were transformed into cloning bacteriaE. coli JM109 and expression host bacteria BL21(DE3). Induction of protein expression in bacteria and purification of full-length and mutant non-fusion MAP2c proteins were performed as described (1.Gamblin T.C. Nachmanoff K. Williams R.G. Halpain S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12576-12586Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with modifications. The concentration of NaCl was reduced to 0.1 m. The boiled supernatant collected was further purified by SP ion exchange chromatography. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and loaded onto a 0.6 × 1.0-cm SP column pre-equilibrated with 5 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Buffer A) at room temperature. The rMAP2c bound to the SP column at pH 5.5, whereas most of the bacterial proteins were found in the run-through. The column was washed with 20 ml of Buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl, and rMAP2c protein was step eluted with Buffer A containing 0.3 m NaCl. Fractions of 300 μl were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing rMAP2c were pooled and dialyzed against 500 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C overnight, divided into small aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. The rMAP2c proteins obtained were of ≥90% purity, and the average yield was 0.7 mg/50 ml of bacterial culture. The MAP2c MTBD fragment cloned into the expression plasmid pET-32a was expressed as a histidine-tagged thioredoxin fusion protein (HisTrxMTBD). The induction of HisTrxMTBD and the histidine-tagged thioredoxin (HisTrx) protein expression from pET-32a was initiated atA 600 = 0.6–0.9 with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Protein expression was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 3 h. Bacteria harvested from a 50-ml culture was lysed in 10 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl (Buffer B) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysis using lysozyme and sonication were performed as described (1.Gamblin T.C. Nachmanoff K. Williams R.G. Halpain S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12576-12586Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, filtered through a 0.45 μm filter, and loaded onto a 0.5 × 1.5-cm Talon-NX column that had been pre-equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed with 5 ml of Buffer B followed by 5 ml of Buffer B containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and the histidine-tagged protein was step eluted with Buffer B containing 100 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Fractions of 500 μl were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the histidine-tagged protein were pooled, dialyzed against 250 ml of Buffer B with 5 mm EDTA and 0.02% NaN3 at 4 °C overnight, divided into small aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. The proteins were of ≥95% purity, and the average yield was 0.5 mg/50 ml of bacterial culture. Expression and purification of the GST and GST-SH3 fusion proteins using glutathione-Sepharose beads were carried out according to the manufacturer's procedure. A 5-μl aliquot of a ∼50% (v/v) slurry of protein-bound glutathione-Sepharose beads contained about 15–20 μg of GST-SH3 fusion protein as determined by SDS-PAGE. For the microtubule binding competition experiments, the GST-SH3 fusion proteins were eluted from the beads with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against 1× PBS at 4 °C overnight and stored at –80 °C. To obtain the thrombin-cleaved Grb2-N-SH3 fragment, the GST-Grb2-N-SH3 fusion protein was affinity-purified from 5 liters of bacterial culture and dialyzed against 4 liters of 0.5× PBS at 4 °C, with two changes over a period of 12 h, to remove the reduced glutathione. The protein concentration of the dialyzed fusion protein was then diluted to 0.4 mg/ml with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Thrombin was added to a final concentration of 10 units/mg protein, and the digestion was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 36 h. The digested mixture was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter and applied onto a 1.0 × 5.0-cm glutathione-Sepharose column to remove the larger GST fragment. The run-through solution containing the Grb2-N-SH3 fragment was concentrated using a 3000 MWCO membrane and further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex 30 (2 × 50 cm) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1 mm NaN3 at a flow rate of 90 ml/h. Fractions of 3 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Grb2-N-SH3 fragment eluted at about 125 ml. Fractions containing Grb2-N-SH3 were pooled, concentrated, and stored at –80 °C. Approximately 5 μg of total rMAP2c bacterial lysate, 1–2 μg of partially purified rMAP2c (boiled, high salt bacterial supernatant), 1–2 μg of SP purified rMAP2c, and 1 μg of phosphorylated or control-phosphorylated rMAP2c were incubated with 5 μl of a 50% slurry of protein bound glutathione-Sepharose beads in a 200-μl volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (Buffer C) at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle mixing. In competition assays using HisTrxMTBD or HisTrx proteins, 0.4 μg (80 nm) of rMAP2c was mixed with increasing amounts of HisTrxMTBD or HisTrx protein (0.2–6 μm) and incubated with 0.8 μl of the 50% slurry of protein bound glutathione-Sepharose beads in a final volume of 100 μl. In the binding assays in which rat brain or transfected COS-7 cell lysates were used, 0.3–1.0 mg of total lysate protein were incubated with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein bound glutathione-Sepharose beads in a final volume of 500 μl. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 1.3 ml of Buffer C containing 150 mm NaCl, and washed a third time with Buffer C at 150 mm NaCl but minus Nonidet P-40. The presence of rMAP2c bound on the beads was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-MAP2 antibody HM2 (1:1000). The presence of histidine-tagged protein was detected by monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody HIS-1 (1:3000). COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 2 mm pyruvate at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. When the cultures reached approximately 80% confluency, they were transfected with 8.5 μg of pEGFP-N1-MAP2c plasmid in the presence of 42 μl of Superfect reagent for 3 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 60–70 h posttransfection, cells were rinsed once in ice-cold 1× PBS and harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mmNaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). A pulse of sonication (Fisher Sonifer, setting 6, 5 s) was given to ensure complete cell lysis, and the lysate was centrifuged at 13,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Expression of the rMAP2c-GFP fusion protein in the transfected COS-7 cells was verified by immunoblot analysis using monoclonal anti-MAP2 antibody HM2. The clarified lysate was used in the GST-SH3 binding assay. Preparation of dissociated rat hippocampal cultures from E18 rat embryos, and growth and maintenance of these cultures were performed as described (43.Halpain S. Hipolito A. Saffer L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9835-9844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 15 days in vitro, the cultures were double-stained for MAP2 (HM2, 1:1000) and Src (sc-18, 1:1000), or MAP2 and Grb2 (sc-255, 1:1000) as described (43.Halpain S. Hipolito A. Saffer L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9835-9844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using Alexa-568 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) and Alexa-488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) as secondary antibodies. Digital images were obtained using a 60× oil immersion objective on an Olympus IX-70 microscope coupled with a Photometrix PXL cooled CCD camera (43.Halpain S. Hipolito A. Saffer L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9835-9844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adult rat forebrain or hippocampus and neonatal (postnatal day 1 (P1)) brain tissue were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin at 4 °C. The homogenates were sonicated to ensure complete lysis and centrifuged as described above. The clarified brain lysates were used in the GST-SH3 binding and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Clarified brain lysates (1 mg of total protein) were incubated with 25 μg of rabbit anti-Src (sc-18), rabbit anti-Grb2 (sc-255), rabbit anti-MAP2 (no. 4170), 2R. Ozer and S. Halpain, submitted for publication. irrelevant IgG, rabbit preimmune serum (no. 4170pis), or lysis buffer alone in a final volume of 400 μl at 4 °C overnight with gentle mixing. A 100-μl aliquot of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads in 1× PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin was added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 5 min, washed six times briefly with 1 ml of 1× PBS, boiled in Laemmli SDS-sample buffer for 2 min (44.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Phosphorylation reactions were carried out in a 50-μl volume containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmbenzamide, 5 mm ε-caproic acid, 15 μg of rMAP2c, and 45 units of either PKA or MAPK (p42, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2) or 12 units of GSK-3β, and 0.8 μm ATP with or without 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) at 30 °C. At the indicated times, 13 μl were removed and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min to terminate the reaction. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 13,500 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant collected was used in the GST-SH3 binding assay described above. Control reactions were carried out in the absence of added ATP. Microtubules were polymerized from tubulin at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in assembly buffer (20 mm NaPO4, 100 mml-glutamate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm GTP) and stabilized by 20 μm Taxol as described (45.Butner K.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Binding assay was performed according to Ref. 46.Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. J.

Normal cells are often induced into pathways that lead to cell growth arrest, senescence, and/or apoptosis in response to activated Ras expression. These are important protective anti-tumorigenic responses that restrict the propagation of cells bearing activated oncogenes. Here we show that induction of Ha-RasVal-12 in Rat-1 fibroblasts resulted in G1 growth arrest and apoptosis with loss of viable cells that is accompanied by a marked decrease in cyclin D1 levels via increased ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent cyclin D1 turnover. This is in contrast with a rat intestinal epithelial cell line in which induction of Ha-RasVal-12 results in transformation associated with sustained proliferation and increased levels of cyclin D1, that is not accompanied by anoikis or apoptosis. Expression of the cyclin D1 mutant (T286A) that contains an alanine for threonine 286 substitution and is resistant to ubiquitin-proteasome degradation in the Ha-RasVal-12 expressing Rat-1 cells resulted in a sustained transformed phenotype with no accumulation of cells in G1. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK1/2) pathway partially reversed the Ras-mediated decrease in cyclin D1. Induction of Ha-RasVal-12 resulted in activation of Akt kinase and inactivation of glycogen-synthase-3β kinase that are associated with reduction of cyclin D1 protein. These results suggest that Ras-mediated cyclin D1 degradation in Rat-1 cells appears to be partially dependent on activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and independent of glycogen-synthase-3β kinase pathway.

Cooperating with SV-40 large T antigen, Ras oncoprotein successfully transforms primary cell cultures (3Lloyd A.C. Obermuller F. Staddon S. Barth C.F. McMahon M. Land H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). SV-40 large T antigen binds to retinoblastoma protein and prevents it from inhibiting E2F-mediated transcriptional activation and thereby enables G1/S transition to proceed. The resultant G1acceleration contributes to the Ras-mediated transformation. Expression of the D-type cyclins is dependent on continuous mitogenic stimulation. Progression through the mid to late G1 phase of the mammalian cell cycle is dependent upon the cyclin D1-mediated activation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 (or the related CDK6) (19Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4976) Google Scholar). The activated cyclin D-dependent kinases phosphorylate and inactivate the retinoblastoma protein, thereby preventing its inhibition of transcription factors (including the E2Fs) that are essential for DNA synthesis. Cyclin D1 overexpression has been reported to cooperate with activated Ha-Ras to induce transformation of primary rat embryo fibroblasts that are not transformed by expression of activated Ha-Ras alone (20Lovec H. Sewing A. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. Moroy T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 323-326PubMed Google Scholar).

Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on threonine 286 is required for its rapid degradation. A cyclin D1 mutant (T286A) containing an alanine for threonine 286 substitution fails to undergo efficient polyubiquitination and is markedly stabilized (t½ ∼3.5 h) (34Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Diehlet al. (35Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar) also recently reported that cyclin D1 is phosphorylated by glycogen-synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) specifically on Thr-286 and this triggers rapid cyclin D1 turnover. They also found that activation of Ras may increase the stability of cyclin D1 via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt with phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3β. In this study, we attempted to explore the mechanism responsible for oncogenic Ras induced G1 growth arrest and apoptosis in Rat-1 fibroblasts. Induction of Ha-RasVal-12 in Rat-1 fibroblasts resulted in a marked decrease in cyclin D1 levels via increased ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent cyclin D1 turnover. To determine the role of reduced cyclin D1 in growth arrest of Rat-1 cells, cyclin D1 mutant (T286A) that is resistant to ubiquitin-proteasome degradation was transfected into the Rat-1:iRas cells. Expression of cyclin D1(T286A) resulted in a sustained transformed phenotype with no accumulation of cells in G1. Inhibition of MAP kinase pathway partially inhibited the Ras-mediated down-regulation of cyclin D1. Inactivation of GSK3β kinase did not reverse the Ras-mediated cyclin D1 turnover. These results suggest that Ras induced G1 arrest in Rat-1 cells may occur through increased ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated cyclin D1 turnover at a GSK3β-independent manner. Rat-1:iRas cell line with an inducible activated Ha-ras Val-12cDNA was a gift from Dr. Hiroshi of Tokyo University of Technology. The Ha-ras Val-12 cDNA is under the transcriptional control of the Lac operon in an eukaryotic expression system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Rat-1:iRas cells were maintained in DMEM containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), and 150 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem, SanDiego, CA). IPTG (isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) at a concentration of 5 mm was used to induce the expression of mutated Ha-Ras. Proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) was purchased from Sigma. A rat intestinal epithelial cell line (RIE-1) transfected with the similar Ha-RasVal-12 expression vectors is referred as RIE-iRas cells. To establish Rat-1:iRas/D1 and Rat1:iRas/D1(T286A) cell lines, stable transfections were performed by using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). An 1.3-kilobaseEcoRI-EcoRI fragment containing the open reading frame for mouse cyclin D1, or a Flag-tagged 1 kilobaseBamHI-BamHI fragment of cyclin D1(T286A) cDNA (a gift from Dr. C. J. Sherr) were ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pZeoSV2(+) (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resultant pZeoSV2/D1 and pZeoSV2/D1(T286A) vectors were then transfected into the Rat-1:iRas cells and selected in DMEM containing hygromycin, geneticin, and zeocin (250 μg/ml) to generate the Rat-1:iRas/D1 and Rat-1:iRas/D1(T286A) clones. Total cellular RNA was extracted as described previously (36Ko T.C. Sheng H.M. Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Beauchamp R.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). RNA samples were separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were hybridized with cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer extension (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After hybridization and washes, the blots were subjected to autoradiography. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (36Ko T.C. Sheng H.M. Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Beauchamp R.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-pan Ras antibody was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), anti-cyclin D1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), the anti-Bcl-2 antibody was from Transduction (Lexington, KY), and anti-p53, anti-p16, and anti-Cdk4 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p21 antibody was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Phosphorylated Akt and Phosphorylated GSK-3a/b antibodies were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in 20 mm EDTA and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The supernatant containing fragmented DNA was clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 1600 × g. After the cell lysates were digested with proteinase K (2.5 mg/ml) and RNase A (5 mg/ml) the DNA was separated on 1.6% agarose gel. Cells were seeded into 100-mm plates and treated with 5 mm IPTG for the indicated hours. Cells were fixed in 70% ETOH, digested in 1 ml of 0.1% RNase (Sigma), and stained with propidium iodide (Sigma). The DNA was analyzed by a flow cytometer. The cell cycle profile was expressed as percentage of cells in each cell cycle stage. Rat-1:iRas cells were treated with IPTG or vehicle for 24 h. One hour prior to harvesting, culture medium was replaced with methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence or absence of IPTG. Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (RIPA, 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). An equal amount of protein from each sample was immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin D1 antibody-conjugated agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Cyclin D1 protein degradation was determined by pulse-chase experiments. The cells were labeled with 300 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 1 h and then washed three times with DMEM. Fresh DMEM containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine was added into the cultures. Cell lysates were collected at intervals. An equal amount of protein from each sample was immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin D1 antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. 1 × 104 cells were mixed with Sea-plaque-agarose at a final concentration of 0.4% in DMEM, and overlaid onto a 0.8% agarose layer in 35-mm plates. The plates were incubated for 10 days. Colonies were photographed by using an inverted microscope. For detection of GSK-3β activity in immune complexes, Rat-1:iRas cells were treated with 5 mmIPTG for the indicated times. Cell lysates were collected in IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sucrose, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm NaVO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). GSK-3β containing complexes were precipitated with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed to GSK-3β (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and mixed with 1 μg of bacterially expressed GST-D1 or GST-D1(T286A) (gifts of Dr. C. J. Sherr) in 20 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl, 2.5 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). After the mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE prior to autoradiography. The expression of activated Ha-Ras in Rat-1:iRas cells is markedly induced after treatment with IPTG (5 mm) with a detectable increase by 2 h and a marked increase by 24 h (Fig.1 A). After the induction of Ras, the Rat-1:iRas cells acquired a transformed appearance characterized by growth in overlapping clusters indicating the loss of contact inhibition by 24 h after induction of Ha-Ras expression. The IPTG-treated Rat-1:iRas cells began to detach from the culture surface (anoikis) by 48 h and most of cells were detached and floating by 72 h after IPTG treatment (Fig. 1 A), suggesting the induction of cell death. Flow cytometry analysis showed a 42.7% increase in accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and a 50.9% decrease in the S phase fraction after the Ha-RasVal-12 was expressed in Rat-1:iRas cells for 48 h (Fig. 1 B). The floating Rat-1:iRas cells exhibited clumping and fragmentation of chromatin indicating programmed cell death (data not shown). DNA fragmentation assays revealed a time-dependent increase internucleosomal DNA fragmentation after Ha-Ras expression in the Rat-1:iRas cells (Fig. 1 C), confirming the induction of apoptosis by activated Ha-Ras. These results suggested that expression of oncogenic Ha-Ras resulted in morphological transformation, but subsequent G1 growth arrest and apoptosis in Rat-1 fibroblasts. Recent studies have demonstrated that growth arrest and apoptosis after activated Ras expression can result from activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, p16INK4a, or p21Waf-1/Cip1 (2Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 7Palmero I. Pantoja C. Manuel S.

In order to explore the mechanism by which activation of Ha-Ras results in growth arrest in Rat-1 cells we examined the expression of several potential molecular targets of the activated ras oncogene that potentially contribute to the phenotypic response described above. Western analyses show that induction of Ha-RasVal-12 did not result in a significant increase in the levels of p21Waf-1/Cip1, p16INK4a, or p53 in Rat-1 cells (Fig. 1 D). Cells that are fully transformed by oncogenic ras often exhibit an increased rate of cell proliferation that is accompanied by an increase in the expression of cyclin D1. In contrast, we found the expression of cyclin D1 protein to be markedly decreased in the Rat-1:iRas cells (Fig. 2 A, lower panel) after induction of Ha-Ras. Interestingly, despite the reduction in levels of cyclin D1 protein, induction of Ha-Ras resulted in a modest increase in cyclin D1 mRNA levels during the same interval (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). These observations raised the question of whether the decrease in cyclin D1 expression was the cause, or simply a consequence, of the G1 arrest and apoptosis that occurred after induction of oncogenic ras. To further investigate the functional significance and regulation of cyclin D1 in cells expressing activated Ha-RasVal-12, we transfected the Rat-1:iRas cells with the mouse wild-type cyclin D1 cDNA to achieve high level constitutive expression of cyclin D1. Several clones of Rat-1:iRas cells were identified that expressed high levels of the transfected cyclin D1 mRNA and protein under basal conditions (referred to as Rat-1:iRas/D1 cells). The regulation of cyclin D1 expression in response to the induction of Ha-Ras is shown for a representative clone (number 14) of the Rat-1:iRas/D1 cells (Fig. 2 B). Northern analysis revealed that the endogenous cyclin D1 mRNA (∼3.7 kilobases) was increased in Rat-1:iRas-CcnD1 clone number 14. The expression of exogenous cyclin D1 mRNA can be seen as the 1.3-kilobase band in Fig. 2 B. The decreased levels of cyclin D1 protein did not correlate with the levels of either endogenously or exogenously expressed cyclin D1 mRNA during the 72 h of observation after IPTG treatment. Despite abundant endogenous and exogenous cyclin D1 mRNA levels, cyclin D1 protein levels decreased by 70–80% from 24 to 72 h after the induction of activated Ha-Ras. Flow cytometry showed 46% of the Rat-1:iRas/D1 cells to be in G1 phase and 44% of cells in S phase prior to the induction of Ras (Fig. 2 C). By 48 h after induction of Ha-Ras, the G1 fraction was increased to 67.5% and the cell number in S phase fraction was reduced to 25%. Forced expression of the wild-type mouse cyclin D1 did not delay or prevent the onset of G1 arrest or apoptosis caused by Ha-Ras expression in the Rat-1:iRas/D1 cells, and as with the Rat-1:iRas cells, most of the cells were detached from the culture plate by 72 h after IPTG treatment. The decrease in cyclin D1 protein could potentially be due to a decreased rate of synthesis or an accelerated rate of degradation. The Rat-1:iRas/D1 cells were treated with either vehicle or IPTG for 24 h and then were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h. The levels of labeled cyclin D1 protein were reduced by 35–40% by 24 and 48 h after the addition of IPTG (Fig.3 A). A pulse-chase experiment revealed that cyclin D1 protein degradation was accelerated in the Ras-induced Rat-1:iRas/D1 cells (Fig. 3 B). The t½ of cyclin D1 protein in Rat-1:iRas/D1 cells without Ras induction was 29.7 ± 5.5 min (mean ± S.E. from three separate experiments). The t½ of cyclin D1 protein in Ras-induced Rat-1:iRas-cyclin D1 cells was 9.5 ± 3.0 min (mean ± S.E. from three separate experiments). Previous studies have shown that levels of G1 cyclins are largely regulated by their degradation rate via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (34Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J.

Rat-1:iRas cells were treated with vehicle or 5 mm IPTG for either 8 or 24 h prior to ALLN (25 μm) treatment and the levels of cyclin D1 protein were determined at time intervals after the addition of ALLN. The level of cyclin D1 protein was markedly reduced in cells treated with IPTG as compared with untreated cells. Addition of ALLN rapidly restored the levels of cyclin D1 in the IPTG-treated cells. These results suggested that expression of oncogenic ras caused a modest decrease in the rate of cyclin D1 protein synthesis, and a 3-fold increase in the rate of cyclin D1 degradation that involved proteasome function. In order to determine whether the reduction of cyclin D1 levels was the consequence or the cause of cell growth arrest and apoptosis after induction of Ha-Ras, we transfected a cyclin D1 mutant (T286A) that is resistant to ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation into the Rat-1:iRas cells (34Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Several selected clones expressed the Flag-tagged cyclin D1 at high levels (Fig. 4 A). The level of cyclin D1 expressed by the Rat-1:iRas/D1(T286A) cells was significantly greater than the level in the Rat-1:iRas cells in the absence of IPTG treatment. While there was a modest decrease in the cyclin D1 levels in the Rat-1:iRas/D1(T286A) cells by 14–36% between 24 and 72 h after induction of Ha-Ras by IPTG, the level remained more than 3-fold greater than the level in the uninduced Rat-1:iRas cells (Fig.4 B). Pulse-chase experiments revealed that cyclin D1(T286A) protein was very stable (t½ ∼ 3 h) and induction of Ras did not result in notable alteration of the stability of cyclin D1(T286A) (Fig. 4 C). Flow cytometry demonstrated that induction of Ha-Ras in the Rat-1:iRas/D1(T286A) cells did not cause G1 growth arrest (Fig.5 A). The S-phase fraction was 50% prior to induction of Ha-Ras, and 42.4% at 72 h after the induction of Ha-Ras in the Rat-1:iRas/D1(T286A) cells. This is in contrast with the marked decrease in the S-phase fraction in the Rat-1:iRas cells expressing only endogenous wild-type cyclin D1 (as shown in Fig. 1) or exogenous wild-type cyclin D1 (as shown in Fig. 2). The Rat-1:iRas/D1(T286A) cells were able to survive induction of Ha-Ras, grew to high density, and formed foci (Fig. 5 B). In addition, the IPTG-treated Rat-1:iRas/D1 cells were incapable of long-term survival or colony formation in soft agarose. Ten days after plating the plates seeded with the Ha-Ras expressing Rat-1:iRas/D1 cells contained only cell debris (Fig. 5 C, upper panel), however, all 4 selected clones of the Rat-1:iRas/D1(T286A) cells analyzed formed colonies in soft agarose after induction of Ha-Ras by IPTG treatment (Fig. 5 C, lower panel). These results suggest that activation of the Ras signaling pathway triggers increased turnover of cyclin D1 through ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated pathway. Expression of the cyclin D1 mutant (T286A) is sufficient to rescue the Rat-1 fibroblasts from oncogenic Ha-Ras induced growth arrest and cell death.Figure 5The phenotype of Rat-1:iRas/D1(T286A) cells.

Mcd4p and Gpi7p are large proteins of about 120 kDa having an amino-terminal lumenal domain and multiple transmembrane domains in the carboxyl-terminal portion. They have regions conserved in phosphodiesterases and nucleotide pyrophosphatases within the amino-terminal lumenal domain (12.Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C.

It is likely that they are involved in transfer of EtNP to mannoses, although their enzyme activities remain to be demonstrated.In the yeast genome, there is a third gene, YLL031c, homologous toMCD4 and GPI7 (12.Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although YLL031c has not been shown to be involved in GPI biosynthesis, its disruption in yeast caused a phenotype similar to those of other GPI anchoring mutants; namely, germinated spores had lethal growth defect after one to two generations with heterogeneous bud sizes (18.Zhang N.

Therefore, it is likely that YLL031cp is involved in EtNP transfer to Man3. Man1 is modified at position 2, whereas Man2 and Man3 are modified at position 6. Consistent with these different positions of modification, Gpi7p and YLL031cp share an amino acid identity (38%) that is higher than that of Gpi7p and Mcd4p (24%) and that of YLL031cp and Mcd4p (21%) (12.Benachour A.

Here, we report molecular cloning of a mouse YLL031c homologue termed Pig-o (phosphatidylinositol glycan, class O) and show that PIG-O and PIG-F are involved in the addition of EtNP to Man3. We also show that mammalian cells have another mechanism of adding EtNP to Man3 that requires PIG-F but not PIG-O.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we cloned and characterized Pig-oand analyzed the roles of PIG-O and PIG-F in GPI biosynthesis. The first conclusion of this study is that PIG-O and PIG-F act together in transferring EtNP to Man3. This is based on two results: 1)Pig-o knockout cells and class F cells defective in PIG-F accumulated the same major GPI intermediate, H6, which bears three mannoses lacking EtNP on Man3; and 2) PIG-O and PIG-F formed a protein complex in the ER, and the stability of the former was dependent upon the latter. The second conclusion is that although this mechanism of EtNP transfer to Man3 is predominant, there must be a second mechanism that also requires PIG-F but not PIG-O. This conclusion is supported by two observations: 1) Pig-o knockout cells express a low level of GPI-anchored proteins, whereas class F cells are completely deficient in the surface expression of GPI-anchored protein; and 2)Pig-o knockout but not class F cells generated a minor GPI with more than three mannoses that has EtNPs on Man1 and Man3.Association of PIG-O and PIG-FBoth PIG-O and PIG-F were found exclusively in the ER, where the GPI anchor is synthesized, and they specifically associated with each other. PIG-F, which is a very hydrophobic protein, may associate with the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic region of PIG-O.The expression of PIG-O was dependent upon PIG-F, i.e. the level of PIG-O expression was at least three times higher in the presence than in the absence of PIG-F. However, the expression of PIG-F was not affected by a lack of PIG-O. Presumably, most PIG-O was associated with PIG-F, whereas some PIG-F may exist free from PIG-O. These results suggest that PIG-O acts together with PIG-F in the ER and that PIG-F may have at least one more partner that is involved in the second mechanism of transferring EtNP to Man3 (see below for further discussion).Common and Different Phenotypes of Pig-o Knockout and Class F Mutant CellsPig-o knockout and class F cells share common defective phenotypes but they have some differences too. Both cells are deficient in the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins. However, low levels of Thy-1 and ScaI remained on thePig-o knockout F9 cells. In contrast, class F cells are completely deficient in the surface Thy-1 expression. Therefore, PIG-O is involved in but not essential for GPI-anchoring of proteins, whereas PIG-F is essential for it. Both Pig-o knockout and class F cells did not generate a mature GPI, H8, but accumulated a GPI intermediate, H6. H6 has three mannoses and EtNP modification on Man1 but lacks EtNP on Man3 (10.Hirose S. Prince G.M. Sevlever D. Ravi L. Rosenberry T.L. Ueda E. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16968-16974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, both cells are defective in the transfer of EtNP to Man3 (see Fig. 7 for the pathway). Class F cells generated one minor GPI, termed F-1, whereas Pig-o knockout cells generated two minor GPIs, termed KO-1 and KO-2. We concluded that F-1 and KO-1 are the same GPI (see below for discussion), but KO-2 was seen only in Pig-o knockout cells.Possible Structures of GPIs, KO-1/F-1 and KO-2KO-1 and F-1 had similar mobilities on TLC, slightly slower than that of H7. H7 bears three mannoses with EtNPs on Man1 and Man3. After the treatment with α-mannosidase, KO-1 and F-1 behaved similarly and became a GPI migrating slightly more slowly than H6. H6 bears three mannoses with EtNP on Man1. KO-1 must have EtNP on Man1 because its generation was inhibited by YW3548/BE49385A. Although we did not analyze the number of mannose residues in KO-1 and F-1, we speculate based on these results that they have three or four mannoses with EtNP on Man1 and Man2 (Fig.7).KO-2 migrated more slowly than H7, and after α-mannosidase treatment, its product behaved similarly to H7 on TLC. KO-2 has EtNP on Man1 because its generation was inhibited by YW3548/BE49385A. KO-2, therefore, has more than three, most likely four, mannoses with EtNP on Man1 and Man3.Two Mechanisms of Transfer of EtNP to Man3 in Mammalian CellsThe complex of PIG-O and PIG-F should be responsible for the addition of EtNP to Man3 in H6 to generate H7 and subsequently H8. It is very likely that PIG-O bears a catalytic site because three family members, Mcd4p/Pig-n, Gpi7p, and PIG-O, correspond to EtNP additions to Man1, Man2, and Man3, respectively, and because they have regions with homology to various phosphodiesterases and nucleotide pyrophosphatases. Consistent with the idea that these regions are involved in the catalytic site, the temperature-sensitive mutant allele of MCD4 had a mutation within one of these regions (15.Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These regions are within the lumenal domains, suggesting that transfer of EtNP to Man3 occurs on the lumenal side of the ER.PIG-F is required for the stable expression of PIG-O. It is unlikely that this is the only role of PIG-F because PIG-O expressed in the absence of PIG-F did not cause the surface Thy-1 expression in class F cells. PIG-F may play some role in the addition of EtNP to Man3.In the absence of PIG-O, GPI-anchored proteins were expressed at low levels. Because KO-2 may have Man3 with EtNP on it, it seems possible that KO-2 accounts for the residual GPI-anchoring in Pig-oknockout cells. Generation of KO-2 should require PIG-F because it was not seen in class F cells. Consistent with the notion that KO-2 is competent for attachment to proteins, class F cells are completely deficient in the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins. Because PIG-F may not be a catalytic component, it would act together with a catalytic component other than PIG-O to generate KO-2. Because Gpi7p is responsible for addition of EtNP to Man2 at position 6 in yeast and EtNP on Man3 is also at position 6, a mammalian homologue of Gpi7p seems to be a candidate of the second partner for PIG-F. Human and mouse sequences homologous to Gpi7p are found in the GenBankTM data base. They should be cloned and characterized to determine whether they represent a functional homologue of Gpi7p and act with PIG-F in transferring EtNP to Man3.Note Added in ProofTwo papers describing functions of yeast orthologues of PIG-F and PIG-O were recently published (Taron, C. H., Wiedman, J. M., Grimme, S. J., and Orlean, P. (2000) Mol. Biol. Cell 11, 1611–1630; Flury, I., Benachour, A., and Conzelmann, A. (May 22, 2000) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M003844200).

Mcd4p and Gpi7p are large proteins of about 120 kDa having an amino-terminal lumenal domain and multiple transmembrane domains in the carboxyl-terminal portion. They have regions conserved in phosphodiesterases and nucleotide pyrophosphatases within the amino-terminal lumenal domain (12.Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C.

It is likely that they are involved in transfer of EtNP to mannoses, although their enzyme activities remain to be demonstrated. In the yeast genome, there is a third gene, YLL031c, homologous toMCD4 and GPI7 (12.Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol.

Although YLL031c has not been shown to be involved in GPI biosynthesis, its disruption in yeast caused a phenotype similar to those of other GPI anchoring mutants; namely, germinated spores had lethal growth defect after one to two generations with heterogeneous bud sizes (18.Zhang N.

Therefore, it is likely that YLL031cp is involved in EtNP transfer to Man3. Man1 is modified at position 2, whereas Man2 and Man3 are modified at position 6. Consistent with these different positions of modification, Gpi7p and YLL031cp share an amino acid identity (38%) that is higher than that of Gpi7p and Mcd4p (24%) and that of YLL031cp and Mcd4p (21%) (12.Benachour A.

Here, we report molecular cloning of a mouse YLL031c homologue termed Pig-o (phosphatidylinositol glycan, class O) and show that PIG-O and PIG-F are involved in the addition of EtNP to Man3. We also show that mammalian cells have another mechanism of adding EtNP to Man3 that requires PIG-F but not PIG-O. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we cloned and characterized Pig-oand analyzed the roles of PIG-O and PIG-F in GPI biosynthesis. The first conclusion of this study is that PIG-O and PIG-F act together in transferring EtNP to Man3. This is based on two results: 1)Pig-o knockout cells and class F cells defective in PIG-F accumulated the same major GPI intermediate, H6, which bears three mannoses lacking EtNP on Man3; and 2) PIG-O and PIG-F formed a protein complex in the ER, and the stability of the former was dependent upon the latter. The second conclusion is that although this mechanism of EtNP transfer to Man3 is predominant, there must be a second mechanism that also requires PIG-F but not PIG-O. This conclusion is supported by two observations: 1) Pig-o knockout cells express a low level of GPI-anchored proteins, whereas class F cells are completely deficient in the surface expression of GPI-anchored protein; and 2)Pig-o knockout but not class F cells generated a minor GPI with more than three mannoses that has EtNPs on Man1 and Man3.Association of PIG-O and PIG-FBoth PIG-O and PIG-F were found exclusively in the ER, where the GPI anchor is synthesized, and they specifically associated with each other. PIG-F, which is a very hydrophobic protein, may associate with the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic region of PIG-O.The expression of PIG-O was dependent upon PIG-F, i.e. the level of PIG-O expression was at least three times higher in the presence than in the absence of PIG-F. However, the expression of PIG-F was not affected by a lack of PIG-O. Presumably, most PIG-O was associated with PIG-F, whereas some PIG-F may exist free from PIG-O. These results suggest that PIG-O acts together with PIG-F in the ER and that PIG-F may have at least one more partner that is involved in the second mechanism of transferring EtNP to Man3 (see below for further discussion).Common and Different Phenotypes of Pig-o Knockout and Class F Mutant CellsPig-o knockout and class F cells share common defective phenotypes but they have some differences too. Both cells are deficient in the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins. However, low levels of Thy-1 and ScaI remained on thePig-o knockout F9 cells. In contrast, class F cells are completely deficient in the surface Thy-1 expression. Therefore, PIG-O is involved in but not essential for GPI-anchoring of proteins, whereas PIG-F is essential for it. Both Pig-o knockout and class F cells did not generate a mature GPI, H8, but accumulated a GPI intermediate, H6. H6 has three mannoses and EtNP modification on Man1 but lacks EtNP on Man3 (10.Hirose S. Prince G.M. Sevlever D. Ravi L. Rosenberry T.L. Ueda E. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16968-16974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, both cells are defective in the transfer of EtNP to Man3 (see Fig. 7 for the pathway). Class F cells generated one minor GPI, termed F-1, whereas Pig-o knockout cells generated two minor GPIs, termed KO-1 and KO-2. We concluded that F-1 and KO-1 are the same GPI (see below for discussion), but KO-2 was seen only in Pig-o knockout cells.Possible Structures of GPIs, KO-1/F-1 and KO-2KO-1 and F-1 had similar mobilities on TLC, slightly slower than that of H7. H7 bears three mannoses with EtNPs on Man1 and Man3. After the treatment with α-mannosidase, KO-1 and F-1 behaved similarly and became a GPI migrating slightly more slowly than H6. H6 bears three mannoses with EtNP on Man1. KO-1 must have EtNP on Man1 because its generation was inhibited by YW3548/BE49385A. Although we did not analyze the number of mannose residues in KO-1 and F-1, we speculate based on these results that they have three or four mannoses with EtNP on Man1 and Man2 (Fig.7).KO-2 migrated more slowly than H7, and after α-mannosidase treatment, its product behaved similarly to H7 on TLC. KO-2 has EtNP on Man1 because its generation wa"

We now report the mapping of a paxillin-binding site in the α4 cytoplasmic domain and an assessment of its role in the α4tail-specific integrin functions. By using truncation mutants and a peptide competition assay, we found that a region of 9 amino acid residues (Glu983-Tyr991) within the α4 cytoplasmic domain contains a minimal sequence sufficient for paxillin binding. Alanine scanning of this region implicated Tyr991 and Glu983 as critical residues. The role of these residues was confirmed by introducing these Ala substitutions into the full-length α4 tail sequence. Y991A or E983A substitution disrupted the interaction of α4 integrins with paxillin. These same two point mutations reversed the effects of the α4 tail on cell spreading. The key features of the identified paxillin-binding sequence are present in all α4 integrins sequenced to date, including that from Xenopus laevis.

The α4 integrin subunit is indispensable for these biological processes, possibly because α4 regulates cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and gene expression differently from other integrin α subunits (8Hemler M.E.

Biol. 1992; 57: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). α4integrins increase cell migration and oppose cell spreading and focal adhesion formation.

Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To investigate the unusual biological properties of α4integrins, we previously analyzed the binding of cellular proteins to the α4 cytoplasmic domain using α4 tail affinity chromatography (12Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We reported that the α4cytoplasmic tail binds tightly to the signaling adaptor protein, paxillin. In the current study, we have characterized the α4 cytoplasmic domain sequences required for paxillin binding and examined effects of mutations that disrupt paxillin binding on an α4 tail-specific function. Here we report that a region of 9 amino acid residues (Glu983-Tyr991) within the α4 cytoplasmic domain is sufficient for paxillin binding. An alanine substitution at either Glu983or Tyr991 within this region can disrupt the α4 tail-paxillin association. Furthermore, introduction of E983A or Y991A point mutation into the α4 tail can abolish the effects of the α4 tail on cell spreading. Thus, the integrity of the paxillin-binding site is required for some of the unusual biological responses to ligation of the α4integrins.

Briefly, 1 mg of each recombinant integrin cytoplasmic domain dissolved in 5 ml of 20 mm Pipes, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.8 (PN buffer), plus 1 ml of 100 mm sodium acetate was bound to 100 μl of Ni2+-charged His-Bind resins (Novagen) at 4 °C overnight. Resins were then washed twice with PN buffer and stored in an equal volume of PN buffer plus 0.1% NaN3. Jurkat T cells (or human platelets) were lysed on ice for 30 min with buffer A: 10 mm Pipes, 50 mm NaCl, 150 mm sucrose, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 6.8, plus 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (plus 0.1 mm E-64, a calpain inhibitor, for platelets). After sonication, the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. 500–1000 μg of the clarified cell lysate was supplemented with 3 mmMgCl2 and then added to 50 μl of integrin tail-coated resins as described above. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C with rotation overnight. Resins were washed three times with buffer A. Bound proteins were extracted with 50 μl of reducing SDS sample buffer, were separated on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (PAGE), and analyzed for total protein by Coomassie Blue staining or for specific proteins by immunoblotting.

For detection, an additional sequence, YPYDVPDYA (HA-tag), recognized by monoclonal antibody 12CA5, was joined to the C terminus of the paxillin. Aliquots of recombinant HA-tagged GST-paxillin were mixed with 300 μl of buffer A plus 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA), added to 20 μl of model protein-loaded resins, and incubated at room temperature with rotation for 2 h. Resins were then washed three times with the same buffer. Bound proteins were extracted with reducing SDS sample buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, and detected with antibody specific for HA-tag. For the peptide competition assay, binding assays were performed in the presence of competing peptide at concentrations indicated in each experiment. CHO cell lines were cell surface-labeled with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in an immunoprecipitation buffer: Tris-HCl, 20 mm, pH 7.4; NaCl, 150 mm; EDTA, 10 mm; benzamidine HCl, 10 mm; sodium azide, 0.02%; Triton X-100, 1%; Tween 20, 0.05%; PMSF, 2 mm; aprotinin, 5 μg/ml; and leupeptin, 5 μg/ml (17Chen Y.-P.

After clarification by centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, cell lysate was then incubated with protein G-Sepharose coated with antibody d-57 or an irrelevant mouse IgG overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with the immunoprecipitation buffer four times, and the precipitated polypeptides were extracted with SDS sample buffer. Precipitated cell surface biotin-labeled polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and detected with streptavidin-peroxidase followed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In parallel, lysates of unmodified cells were precipitated with anti-αIIbβ3, d-57, and co-precipitated paxillin was detected by immunoblotting the reduced immunoprecipitates with biotin-labeled anti-paxillin antibody (clone 349). Assays of cell adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen (Fg) or fibronectin (FN) were performed as described previously (18Ylanne J. Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, for cell adhesion assay, 24-well plates were coated with 10 μg/ml Fg in a coating buffer: NaCl, 150 mm; NaH2PO4, 50 mm; and Na2HPO4, 50 mm, pH 8.0, at 4 °C overnight and blocked with 1% heat-denatured BSA at 37 °C for more than 1 h. CHO cells were labeled with fluorescent dye (CellTracker Green CMFDA; Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's instructions. Equal numbers of the labeled cells were then plated on the Fg-coated wells and incubated in a 37 °C incubator for 30 min. At the end of the experiment, unattached cells were washed away with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fluorescence of attached cells was detected using a Cytofluor II fluorescence reader (Millipore). For cell spreading assays, coverslips in 24-well plates were incubated with 10 μg/ml of either Fg or FN resuspended in coating buffer at 4 °C overnight and blocked with 1% heat-denatured BSA at 37 °C for more than 1 h. Cells were detached, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1 mg/ml BSA, and resuspended in the same medium at a concentration of 1–2 × 105 cells/ml. The cells (5–10 × 104 cells/well) were permitted to attach to the coverslips at 37 °C for 1 h. Unattached cells were washed away with PBS. Attached cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, and examined by phase microscopy. Cells that exhibited flattening, and the presence of lamellipodia under microscope examination were scored as spreading cells. Photographic images were acquired with a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a Sensys-cooled charge-coupled device video camera. Two independent observers assessed the percentage of cells that exhibited spread morphology in each experiment. To identify the amino acid residue(s) within the α4cytoplasmic domain that are responsible for paxillin binding, we first examined the binding of native paxillin to an immobilized α4 tail. The α4 tail bound paxillin and a faint 55-kDa paxillin-related polypeptide from extracts of Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1 B). The 55-kDa polypeptide is most likely the paxillin-related protein, Hic-5 (19Shibanuma M. Mochizuki E. Maniwa R. Mashimo J. Nishiya N. et al.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 17: 1224-1235Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar,20Hagmann J. Grob M. Welman A. van Willigen G. Burger M.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2181-2188PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined paxillin binding of a series of C-terminal truncation mutants of α4 (Fig. 1 A). The C-terminal 5 amino acid residues of α4 were dispensable for paxillin or Hic-5 binding (Fig. 1). However, further N-terminal deletions in α4 (990X, 985X, and 982X; each “X” is a stop codon) dramatically reduced binding of both proteins (Fig.1 B). To minimize possible contributions from other cellular proteins, we repeated these experiments using purified recombinant paxillin and similar results were obtained (data not shown). Thus, the amino acid residues N-terminal of Ser994 within the α4 tail are required for binding of paxillin and Hic-5. To localize the paxillin-binding site in the α4 tail, we assessed the capacity of synthetic α4 cytoplasmic domain peptides (Fig. 2 A) to compete for the binding of purified paxillin to the α4 tail. A peptide containing the entire α4 tail sequence completely blocked paxillin (100 nm paxillin added) binding, whereas full-length αIIb tail peptide had no inhibitory effect (data not shown). The estimated concentration of immobilized recombinant α4 tail model protein was ∼70 μm, and the soluble peptide inhibited binding completely at a concentration of 54 μm (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the soluble α4 tail peptide specifically inhibited paxillin binding. We next synthesized three pentadecapeptides that spanned the α4 tail with 5–8 residue overlaps (Fig. 2 A). The middle peptide, α4(Ser978-Ile992), competed for paxillin binding with an IC50 of ∼200 μm(Fig. 2 B). As expected from the previous results with C-terminal truncation mutants, the N-terminal pentadecapeptide, α4(Lys968-Glu982), was without effect (Fig. 2) at concentrations up to 540 μm. Similarly, the C-terminal peptide, α4(Arg985-Asp999), also manifested little activity at this concentration. Thus, α4(Ser978-Ile992) contains a minimal recognition sequence for paxillin binding. Furthermore, a scrambled peptide with an identical composition to α4(Ser978-Ile992) (WRSLDYENIEQISSR) had no inhibitory effect on paxillin binding at a concentration of 540 μm (data not shown). Thus, α4(Ser978-Ile992) peptide specifically blocks paxillin binding. Additional peptides were synthesized to further define the recognition specificity. Peptides Arg974-Ile992 and Ser978-Ser994, which extended the α4(Ser978-Ile992) sequence by 4 or 2 residues, respectively, showed similar activity to that of α4(Ser978-Ile992) (TableI). However, deletion of Ile992 (Ser978-Y991) reduced activity. Similarly, deletion of Ser978 to Glu982 resulted in a 3-fold reduction in activity. Nonetheless, the nonapeptide, Glu983-Ile992, still blocked paxillin binding with an IC50 of 670 μm. Thus, Glu983-Ile992 contains a minimal sequence required to block paxillin binding. The >10-fold difference in activity between α4(Glu983-Ile992) and the full-length α4 cytoplasmic domain suggests that additional flanking sequences are required for maximal activity.Table IQuantification of the inhibition of paxillin binding by α4 peptidesα4 cytoplasmic domain:968KVGFFKRQYKSILQEENRRDSWSYINSKSNDD998PeptideIC50μmArg974-Ile992250Ser978-Ser994140Ser978-Ile992220Ser978-Tyr991450Glu983-Ile992670Recombinant HA-tagged GST-paxillin was added to Ni2+-charged resins loaded with α4 model protein in the absence of presence of each competing synthetic peptide at different concentrations.

Bound paxillin was quantified by scanning densitometry of these immunoblots using the NIH Image program. IC50 is the concentration of peptide at which 50% binding of recombinant paxillin was inhibited. Two experiments were performed, and similar results were obtained. To assess the role of individual amino acid residues within α4(Glu983-Ile992) that are important for paxillin binding, we synthesized α4(Ser978-Ile992) peptides that each contained a single alanine substitution within this region (Fig.3) and examined their capacity to compete for paxillin binding. Alanine substitution of Tyr991abolished (IC50 > 1100 μm) and Glu983 markedly reduced (IC50 ∼ 800 μm) the inhibitory effect of α4(Ser978-Ile992) peptide on paxillin binding (Fig. 3). In contrast, alanine substitution of Arg985, Glu982, or Trp989 had little effect (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Alanine substitution of Arg986 partially blocked the inhibitory capacity of α4(Ser978-Ile992) (IC50 ∼ 450 μm, Fig. 3). Thus, analysis of competition by synthetic peptides implicated 2 amino acid residues, Glu983, and Tyr991, as being essential for paxillin binding. To confirm that the effect of alanine substitution resulted in differences in paxillin binding, we examined the effect of these alanine substitutions on the paxillin binding properties of the intact α4 tail. Recombinant full-length α4 tail model proteins containing alanine substitutions at Glu983, Arg985, Arg986, and Tyr991 (Fig.4 A) were assayed for binding to recombinant paxillin. Alanine substitution of either Glu983 or Tyr991 reduced paxillin binding (Fig.4 B) to near background levels. In contrast, substitution at Arg985 had no effect and substitution at Arg986had much less effect on paxillin binding (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, the previous truncation experiment (Fig. 1) suggested that Hic-5 and paxillin bind to the same site in the α4 tail. Furthermore, the same point mutations that disrupted paxillin binding also blocked Hic-5 binding (Fig. 4 C). Thus, Tyr991 and Glu983 are important amino acid residues for paxillin and Hic-5 binding to the α4cytoplasmic domain. To examine the binding of the α4 tail mutants to native paxillin, we used Jurkat T cell lysate as a source of the protein. Affinity chromatography with model proteins containing α4(Y991A) or α4(E983A) mutations exhibited markedly reduced paxillin and Hic-5 binding relative to wild-type α4 (Fig. 5 A,upper panel). Thus, α4(Y991A) and α4(E983A) mutations also disrupted native paxillin binding to the α4 tail. To examine the effect of these mutations in the context of an intact integrin, we joined the cytoplasmic domain of α4 to the transmembrane and extracellular domains of integrin αIIb to form an αIIbα4 chimera. This chimeric α subunit was co-transfected with a chimeric β subunit, β3β1A, in CHO cells. To examine the effect of Y991A and E983A mutations on the association of paxillin with an intact integrin, we introduced these mutations into αIIbα4 chimera. The αIIbα4β3β1A, αIIbα4(Y991A)β3β1A, and αIIbα4(E983A)β3β1A chimeric integrins were expressed in CHO cells and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the extracellular domain of αIIbβ3. Similar quantities of recombinant integrin were precipitated from each cell line (Fig. 5 B,lower panel). Approximately 12-fold less paxillin was co-precipitated with either αIIbα4(Y991A)β3β1A or αIIbα4(E983A)β3β1A than with wild-type αIIbα4β3β1A chimeric integrin (Fig. 5 B, upper panel). Thus, α4(Y991A) and α4(E983A) mutations also disrupted the association of an intact integrin with paxillin. The α4 cytoplasmic domain inhibits cell spreading and focal adhesion formation (11Kassner P.D. Alon R. Springer T.A. Hemler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To examine the functional effect of these mutants, we assayed adhesion and spreading of cells expressing these chimeras. Cell expressing the Y991A and E983A mutant chimeras spread extensively on Fg, a ligand for the αIIbβ3 extracellular domain (Fig.6 A). In contrast, cell spreading was markedly retarded in cells expressing the wild-type chimera or a chimera containing an α4 mutation that retains the capacity to bind paxillin, α4(R985A). These differences were not due to a change in αIIbβ3-dependent cell adhesion to Fg (αIIbα4β3β1A, 60 ± 18%; αIIbα4(Y991A)β3β1A, 57 ± 3%; αIIbα4(E983A)β3β1A, 69 ± 13%; and αIIbα4(R985A)β3β1A, 52 ± 6% adherence at 30 min). Furthermore, they were not due to generalized defects in cell spreading, because all cell lines spread well on fibronectin, a ligand for endogenous hamster integrin α5β1 (data not shown). Thus, mutations that disrupt the paxillin binding function of the α4 cytoplasmic domain resulted in increased cell spreading. The present studies have defined a sequence motif required for paxillin binding to the α4 integrin cytoplasmic domain. We defined a core paxillin-binding sequence by analysis of truncation mutants, and inhibition of paxillin binding to the α4 tail by synthetic peptides. Critical Glu, Arg, and Tyr residues were identified within this core sequence (Fig.7 A). A core motif of E(X)2–3R(X)4 Yis conserved in the α4 tails in all species so far sequenced. Because this motif is present in Xenopus, it is likely that the paxillin binding function of α4 is evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, the absence of this motif from α tails that fail to bind paxillin (Fig. 7 B) provides an explanation for the specificity of paxillin binding to α4. High resolution structural studies will be required to define the specific functional role of each of the residues important in paxillin binding. The paxillin-binding site identified in the α4 tail is distinct from that in other paxillin-binding proteins. For example, the paxillin-binding site of PTP-PEST is composed of a sequence containing a proline-rich region (Fig. 7 C), which is absent in the paxillin-binding site of the α4 cytoplasmic domain. Furthermore, the identified paxillin-binding sites of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and vinculin are also distinct from that of the α4 tail (Fig. 7 C). In addition, an excess of a recombinant protein derived from the focal adhesion targeting sequence of FAK, which contains its paxillin-binding site (21Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Airro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), did not inhibit paxillin binding to the α4tail. 2S. Liu and M. H. Ginsberg, unpublished data. Consequently, our data suggest that α4 can bind simultaneously to paxillin that is associated with PTP-PEST or FAK. Future studies will be required to test this possibility. The interaction of paxillin with α4 is of high affinity and is required for many of the biological functions of α4 integrins (12Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). As shown here, paxillin-binding activity is present in small synthetic peptides derived from the α4 tail and can be ablated by single point mutations. These features of the α4-paxillin interaction suggest that small peptides or peptidomimetics that disrupt the interaction could be used to inhibit α4-dependent cellular functions."

Recently we described an additional chromogranin A fragment, catestatin (bovine chromogranin A344–364), which acts specifically as a potent (IC50 ∼200–400 nm) nicotinic cholinergic antagonist to inhibit catecholamine release (9Simon J.P. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 10Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), suggesting a novel autocrine feedback mechanism controlling sympathochromaffin exocytosis. Initial studies of catestatin relied on synthetic peptides (10Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar); hence, the existence of the peptide in vivo remains unexplored, as do its precise cleavage sites from chromogranin A. In this study, we explored processing of the catestatin region of chromogranin A in secretory granules of chromaffin cells and sympathetic nerves, as well as in human pheochromocytomas. We documented catestatin cleavage from chromogranin A and determined the precise endogenous cleavage sites bounding catestatin in bovine and human chromaffin granules by chromatographic separations coupled with amino-terminal amino acid sequencing, immunoprecipitation, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)1 mass spectrometry. We confirmed catestatin's regulated secretion by chromaffin cells. A major form of catestatin was processed at dibasic sites (bovine chromogranin A332–364 or human chromogranin A340–372), while a smaller form was also identified (bovine chromogranin A343–362). Both larger and smaller size forms were synthesized; each displayed specific antagonism of nicotinic cholinergic-stimulated catecholamine release, while the smaller form had greater potency of inhibition. All preparative steps on tissues or protein fractions were conducted at 0–4 °C. Bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin granules were prepared by centrifugation on 0.3 m/1.6 m sucrose density step gradients, as described previously (10Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H.

After granule hypotonic lysis and centrifugal removal of granule membranes, the soluble proteins and peptides in the supernatant were size-fractionated on a 2.6 × 80-cm Sephacryl S-300 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), eluting with the volatile buffer 0.3 m ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, as described previously (11Barbosa J.A. Gill B.M. Takiyyuddin M.A. O'Connor D.T. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 174-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The buffer was removed by lyophilization before further studies. In some experiments, bovine chromaffin granule proteins/peptides (200 μl containing 8 mg of protein) were size-fractionated on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 FPLC gel filtration column (10 × 300 mm, 24-ml bed volume; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), eluting at 1 ml/min with 0.3 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, collecting fractions every 0.5 ml (0.5 min). Eluted fractions were analyzed for protein by on-line absorbance at 280 nm (A 280) and then lyophilized (to remove the volatile buffer) and resuspended in the same volume of radioimmunoassay (RIA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100; see below). Chromaffin granules from human pheochromocytomas were also prepared by centrifugation on 0.3 m/1.6 m sucrose density step gradients, followed by hypotonic lysis and membrane removal by centrifugation, as described previously (10Mahata S.K.

Postganglionic sympathetic nerves were obtained by dissection of splenic nerve in samples from the local slaughterhouse. Nerves were placed in ice-cold 0.3 m sucrose at an ∼10:1 ratio of tissue to buffer and then minced, homogenized, gauze-filtered, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min (to remove nuclei and debris). Supernatants were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 h to pellet a crude fraction of neuronal large dense core vesicles (12O'Connor D.T. Klein R.L. Thureson-Klein A.K. Barbosa J.A. Brain Res. 1991; 567: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which were lysed by resuspension in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7, and freezing/thawing. Bovine or human chromogranin A was isolated from chromaffin granule soluble core proteins by affinity chromatography (to remove dopamine β-hydroxylase) followed by gel filtration, as described previously (13Syversen U.

Recombinant human chromogranin A was expressed in Escherichia coli by a modification of previously described methods (14Taupenot L. Remade J.E. Helle K.B. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Regul.

Synthetic peptides (20–100-μmol scale) were prepared by the solid phase method, using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protection chemistry. Purification was by C-18 reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC). Authenticity of the resulting peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry, using either MALDI or electrospray ionization. Polyclonal rabbit antisera recognizing the catestatin region of chromogranin A (Fig. 1), either bovine chromogranin A344–364 (RSMRLSFRARGYGFRGPGLQL) or human chromogranin A352–372 (SSMKLSFRARAYGFRGPGPQL), were developed by a modification of protocols previously described for other chromogranin peptides (11Barbosa J.A.

The polyclonal antibody recognizing the catestatin region of chromogranin A was further purified on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Hi Trap protein A column in 0.02 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), eluted with 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 3), and the pH was then adjusted back to 7.0 with Tris-HCl (pH 8.8).

To identify methionine-containing peptides (by oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide, thereby adding the mass of a single oxygen at 16 daltons), 10 μl were oxidized by adding sufficient 3% H2O2 to achieve 10 μm final H2O2 concentration. 1–2 μl were characterized by MALDI mass spectrometry on a Voyager-Elite mass spectrometer with delayed extraction (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Samples were embedded in an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (18Siuzdak G. Mass Spectrometry for Bio/Technology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 161Google Scholar) and then irradiated with a nitrogen laser at 337 nm, and the ions produced were accelerated with a deflection potential of 30,000 V. Ions were then differentiated according to their mass/charge ratio (m/z) using a time-of-flight mass analyzer. The mass error of this method is characteristically ≤0.1% (i.e. ≤1000 ppm; Ref. 18Siuzdak G. Mass Spectrometry for Bio/Technology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 161Google Scholar). After suspension of bovine chromaffin granule protein samples in loading buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), 0.8–50 μg of protein were electrophoresed through SDS-PAGE 10–20% acrylamide gradient gels, in the presence of Tris-Tricine buffer (Novex, San Diego, CA). This gradient gel system resolves peptides as small as 2 kilodaltons (19Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Human pheochromocytoma chromaffin granule samples were electrophoresed on 10% nongradient acrylamide gels. After SDS-PAGE, gels were stained for total protein with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 in water/methanol/acetic acid (50:40:10%) (20Smith B. Walker J.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1984: 41-55Google Scholar), followed by destaining in water/methanol/acetic acid (82.5:10:7.5%). Parallel gels were electroeluted onto nitrocellulose paper (BA85; Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH), followed by immunoreactive catestatin staining by immunoblotting (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The primary immunoblotting antibodies were rabbit anti-bovine catestatin (chromogranin A344–364; RSMRLSFRARGYGFRGPGLQL; titer 1:1000 (v/v)), rabbit anti-bovine chromogranin A316–329 (titer 1:500), rabbit anti-bovine chromogranin A367–391 (titer 1:500 (v/v)), or rabbit anti-human catestatin (chromogranin A352–372; SSMKLSFRARAYGFRGPGPQL; titer 1:2000 (v/v)) (10Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Second antibody staining was visualized by either enhanced chemiluminescence (horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, titer 1:4000 (v/v); Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit) or color development (goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, titer 1:2000 (v/v); Bio-Rad). After RP-HPLC of bovine chromaffin granule peptides (see below), 50 μl of each 500-μl HPLC fraction were vacuum-dried, resuspended in 100 μl of water, adsorbed by vacuum filtration onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a slot-blotting device (Minifold II; Schleicher and Schuell), and immunoblotted using the anti-bovine catestatin primary antibody (at 1:500 (v/v)) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (at 1:7000 (v/v)) with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometry analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet. Gel filtration size-fractionated bovine chromaffin granule peptides were further separated by RP-HPLC using a 25 × 0.5-cm C-18 column, equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with a linear 0–60% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, over 60 min, at 1 ml/min. The elution was monitored by A 214 (peptide bond absorbance), and fractions were collected at 0.5-min (0.5-ml) intervals. 50-μl aliquots from each fraction were vacuum-dried and subjected to anti-catestatin slot immunoblotting (see above), and slot-blot positive fractions were further subjected to amino-terminal microsequencing (100 μl; see below) and MALDI mass spectrometry (1–2 μl; see above). Eluted HPLC fractions (100-μl aliquots from 500-μl fractions) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile/H2O column buffer were analyzed for amino-terminal sequence by automated Edman microsequencing (10–100 pmol; ABI 494 Procise® sequencing system with ABI 610 data analysis system; Applied Biosystems/Perkin Elmer). Molecular weights from MALDI mass spectra were interpreted, and peptide fragments within the chromogranin A primary structure were assigned by the program PAWS (Protein Analysis WorkSheet, version 8.1.1, for Macintosh; ProteoMetrics; freeware available on the Internet), assigning average isotopic MH+ values for chromogranin A peptides (18Siuzdak G. Mass Spectrometry for Bio/Technology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 161Google Scholar). Sequencing results were analyzed at each Edman cycle by the algorithm “Hydrosites” (for Macintosh) to deconvolute multiple amino-terminal sequences derived from the same parent molecule at a given cycle (22Caporale C. Sepe C. Caruso C. Garzillo A.M. Buonocore V. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 81-88PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were subjected to a test of activity by inhibition of secretagogue-stimulated norepinephrine release from [3H]norepinephrine-prelabeled PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, over a 30-min secretion period, as described previously (10Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 23Mahata M. Mahata S.K. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. Hypertension. 1996; 28: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The stimuli to catecholamine release were either nicotinic cholinergic (60 μm nicotine) or membrane depolarization (by 55 mm KCl). In some control experiments, the peptide was immunoadsorbed overnight (4 °C, 1:100 antibody titer in secretion buffer) prior to test of secretion. Primary cultures of bovine chromaffin cells were prepared as described previously (24Hook V.Y.H. Noctor S. Sei C.A. Toneff T. Yasothornsrikul S. Kang Y. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1-11Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Secretion was stimulated over a 15-min period. The stimuli were either nicotinic cholinergic (100 μm nicotine), membrane depolarization (by 55 mm KCl, in the presence or absence of 1 mmCa2+), or vehicle (mock). Secretion media were collected, concentrated on a Millipore Ultrafree 10K filter, and analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Synthetic catestatin (bovine chromogranin A344–358; RSMRLSFRARGYGFR) was radioiodinated with125I by the IODO-GEN method (Pierce) on its endogenous tyrosine (Tyr355) to a specific activity of 3457 Ci/mmol, by Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Mountain View, CA). The RIA incubation mixture contained 100 μl of rabbit anti-bovine chromogranin A344–364 in RIA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100) at a titer of 1:1000 (v/v), and 100 μl of unlabeled catestatin (bovine chromogranin A344–358; RSMRLSFRARGYGFR) calibration standards (2.5–5000 pg) or sample (unknown). After 24 h at 4 °C, 10,000 cpm of 125I-labeled chromogranin A344–358 in 100 μl of RIA buffer was added. After a second 24-h 4 °C incubation, the second antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG (Calbiochem), titer 1:20 (v/v)) and carrier antiserum (2% bovine serum albumin) were added. After 2 h at ambient temperature, 500 μl of RIA buffer was added, samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 25 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was discarded, and the samples were counted for 1 min in the γ-counter (ICN Biomedicals Inc.). Fetal bovine serum and adult equine serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Results are expressed as the mean value ± one S.E. Chromaffin granule soluble core proteins (chromogranins) were size-fractionated by gel filtration (Fig.2); fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), and low molecular weight peptide-containing fractions 42–52 were pooled for further study. After peptide adsorption and batch elution from a C-18 hydrophobic affinity matrix (SepPak), this fraction inhibited nicotinic cholinergic-stimulated catecholamine release from [3H]norepinephrine-prelabeled PC12 pheochromocytoma cells; 60 μm nicotine stimulated 19.1 ± 0.39% release of cellular norepinephrine, but inclusion of as little as 1.25 μg/ml of the peptide fraction diminished nicotinic-stimulated release to 1.7 ± 0.19% (10Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To determine whether the catestatin region of chromogranin A is discretely excised at particular amino acid residues, we turned to mass spectrometry on chromogranin A fragments formed endogenously in chromaffin granules. The low molecular weight peptide fraction (Fig. 2, fractions 42–52) was immunoprecipitated by a bovine catestatin (chromogranin A344–364) antibody and subjected to MALDI mass spectrometry (Fig.3). The initial spectrum revealed a major peak at m/z = 3829 (Fig. 3 B), which, within the 431-amino acid bovine chromogranin A primary structure (25Iacangelo A. Affolte H.U. Eiden L.E. Herbert E. Grimes M. Nature. 1986; 323: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 26Benedum U.M. Baeuerle P.A. Konecki D.S. Frank R. Powell J. Mallet J. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), corresponds uniquely to chromogranin A332–364 (LEGEEEEEEDPDRSMRLSFRARGYGFRGPGLQL; calculatedm/z = 3827.2); the 0.047% difference between experimental and calculated m/z values is within the range of acceptable error of the MALDI method (0.1%m/z; Ref. 18Siuzdak G. Mass Spectrometry for Bio/Technology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 161Google Scholar). Preimmune serum did not recognize a peak of this mass (Fig. 3 A). Since mass spectra of peptides are susceptible to shifting by formation of peptide-cation (such as Na+) adducts, we repeated the spectrum on granule peptides that had been desalted by adsorption to a C-18 matrix (Fig.3 C); an m/z = 3827 peak remained the principal component, with some diminution in surrounding minor peaks. To confirm that this peak represents catestatin, the granule peptide sample was gently oxidized with H2O2 to convert any methionine residues into methionine sulfoxide, as described by Wang et al. in studies of β-amyloid processing by mass spectrometry (17Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar); since bovine catestatin contains a single methionine residue (bovine chromogranin A Met346; Fig. 1), this procedure provides a further specific diagnostic for the identity of the catestatin region. After oxidation, the major peak was now found atm/z = 3844 (Fig. 3 D), a mass shift corresponding to the added 16-dalton oxygen atom in Met346-sulfoxide. In a second approach to determine the boundaries of endogenous catestatin cleavage, the chromaffin granule low molecular weight peptide fraction (gel filtration fractions 42–52; Fig. 2) was first separated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 4, bottom), and fractions were immunoblotted with anti-bovine catestatin. HPLC fraction 27, containing intense catestatin immunoreactivity (Fig. 4,middle), was then analyzed (Fig. 4, top) by both MALDI mass spectrometry and amino-terminal amino acid sequencing. MALDI revealed two peaks, at m/z = 3718 and 2300 (Fig. 4, top). In the catestatin region of bovine chromogranin A (Fig. 1), m/z = 3718 is compatible with chromogranin A333–364(EGEEEEEEDPDRSMRLSFRARGYGFRGPGLQL), whilem/z = 2300 is compatible with chromogranin A343–362 (DRSMRLSFRARGYGFRGPGL). Fraction 27 was amino-terminally sequenced over 10 residue cycles, with the result suggesting two peptides (22Caporale C. Sepe C. Caruso C. Garzillo A.M. Buonocore V. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 81-88PubMed Google Scholar): (a) EGEEEEEEDP … , corresponding to bovine chromogranin A333–342, the first 10 amino acids of the 3718 m/z peptide EGEEEEEEDPDRSMRLSFRARGYGFRGPGLQL (chromogranin A333–364), and (b) DRS … , corresponding to bovine chromogranin A343–345, the first three amino acids of the 2300m/z peptide DRSMRLSFRARGYGFRGPGL (chromogranin A343–362). Bovine splenic nerve was homogenized, desalted by adsorption to/elution from a C-18 matrix (SepPak), immunoprecipitated by an anti-catestatin (bovine chromogranin A344–364) antibody, and subjected to MALDI mass spectrometry. MALDI revealed a peak at m/z = 3832 (Fig. 5, top), which, in the catestatin region of bovine chromogranin A (Fig. 1), is within 0.125% of 3827.2, the calculated MH+ of chromogranin A332–364 (LEGEEEEEEDPDRSMRLSFRARGYGFRGPGLQL). After oxidation by H2O2, the m/z = 3832 peak diminished, while anm/z = 3843 peak became more prominent (Fig.5, bottom), a mass shift corresponding to the added 16-dalton oxygen atom in Met346-sulfoxide in chromogranin A332–364 (predicted MH+ = 3843.2). After anti-catestatin immunoprecipitation of human pheochromocytoma chromaffin granules, m/zvalues of 3770–3771 were noted (Fig. 6), corresponding uniquely within the chromogranin A primary structure to chromogranin A340–372(KRLEGQEEEEDNRDSSMKLSFRARAYGFRGPGPQLRR; calculated m/z = 3771.1), which is bounded on either side by dibasic recognition sites for prohormone cleavage (underlined) (Fig. 1). Upon H2O2 oxidation, in each case these m/z 3770–3771 peaks shifted to m/z = 3787, consistent with the addition of an oxygen (16 daltons) to form Met354-sulfoxide. Other peaks in this region did not shift upon oxidation. Experimental and calculated m/z values are well within the 0.1% expected experimental error of MALDI mass determination (18Siuzdak G. Mass Spectrometry for Bio/Technology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 161Google Scholar). To test the activity and specificity of the bovine catestatin peptides predicted by MALDI mass spectrometry and amino-terminal sequencing (Figs. 3 and 4), we synthesized both longer (chromogranin A332–364; LEGEEEEEEDPDRSMRLSFRARGYGFRGPGLQL) and shorter (chromogranin A344–364; RSMRLSFRARGYGFRGPGLQL) versions of catestatin as well as whole chromogranin A and evaluated their effects on catecholamine release from PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (Fig. 7). As previously reported for the shorter version of catestatin (10Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), the longer version also selectively inhibited catecholamine release evoked by nicotinic cholinergic stimulation but not that evoked by membrane depolarization (Fig. 7 A). Both peptides and chromogranin A showed concentration-dependent inhibition of nicotine-induced secretion (Fig. 7 B): intact chromogranin A had an IC50 of ∼4.2 μm, chromogranin A344–364 had an IC50 of ∼0.35 μm, and the chromogranin A332–364IC50 was ∼2.01 μm. At high dose (10 μm) each peptide completely blocked nicotinic-stimulated secretion, while whole chromogranin A only partially blocked secretion. A peptide corresponding to the catestatin region (chromogranin A352–372; SSMKLSFRARAYGFRGPGPQL) of human chromogranin A (see Fig. 1) also inhibited nicotinic cholinergic-stimulated catecholamine secretion (by 74% at 10 μm peptide), and the inhibition was specifically reversed by a rabbit antiserum directed toward the catestatin region of human chromogranin A (chromogranin A352–372; SSMKLSFRARAYGFRGPGPQL), although not by preimmune serum (Fig. 7 C). Chromaffin granule soluble core proteins were size-fractionated on a standard calibrated gel filtration column (Fig. 8), and fractions were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Four major peaks of catestatin immunoreactivity occurred in fractions 16–22, 25–27, 28–34, and 35–40 (Fig. 8). Peak 1 contained 71.7 nmol of catestatin immunoreactivity and 54% of the total catestatin immunoreactivity, while peak 2 contained 19.1 nmol and"

Thus, the kinase is targeted by the corresponding cascade depending on the extracellular stimulus (2.Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell.

A close homologue of 3pK, MK2, is involved in stress response mediated through p38. Among the substrates of MK2 are the small heat shock proteins (Hsp27/25) (3.Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors E12 and E47 are encoded by the E2A gene and are generated by differential splicing of E12- and E47-specific bHLH-encoding exons (7.Murre C.

These E-proteins are characterized by their ability to bind to the consensus DNA sequence CANNTG, referred to as E-box, either as homodimers in B-cells or as heterodimers with tissue-specific Class II HLH proteins in other cell types (9.Murre C.

Initially identified in B-cells as immunoglobulin enhancer-binding proteins, the E2A gene products classified as Class I HLH proteins are also involved in cell differentiation, lineage commitment, and the expression of many tissue-specific genes (11.Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Through phosphorylation, DNA binding and transactivation of a variety of transcription factors are regulated (12.Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). For example, the dimerization of myogenin with E2A products was shown to enhance phosphorylation of myogenin, thereby reducing the transcriptional activity of myogenin, suggesting that phosphorylation of this myocyte enhancer factor (MEF) negatively interferes with muscle-specific gene expression (13.Zhou J. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6232-6243Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding activity of MyoD homodimers but not MyoD-E12 heterodimers was inhibited by phosphorylation (14.Mitsui K. Shirakata M. Paterson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24415-24420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Johnson et al. (16.Johnson S.E. Wang X. Hardy S. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of casein kinase II (CKII) increased the transcriptional activities of MRF4 and MyoD in vivo via a mechanism involving phosphorylation of its binding partner, E47. A direct effect of E47 phosphorylation was reported by Sloan et al. (17.Sloan S.R. Shen C.P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), providing evidence that phosphorylation hinders binding of E47 homodimers but allows E47 heterodimer binding. This suggests a differential regulation of the E-protein in B-cellversus non-B-cell-specific gene regulation. E47 contains more than 100 potential phosphorylation sites and is known to be phosphorylated in many cell types. However, there is only limited information with regard to E47 kinases. So far, CKII and PKA have been described to phosphorylate E47 in vitro (16.Johnson S.E. Wang X. Hardy S. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell.

In the present study, we show that 3pK and MK2 interact with E47in vivo and are able to phosphorylate E47 in vitro. Furthermore, the expression of 3pK or MK2 results in repression of E47-induced transcriptional activity, suggesting a role for these kinases in the regulation of this transcription factor. Plasmids expressing 3pK wild type, the ATP-binding site mutant 3pK K73M (3pK KM), and the constitutively active mutant 3pK TT201/313EE (3pK TTEE) in bacteria and eukaryotic cells as a GST fusion protein were cloned as described recently (2.Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A GFP-tagged version of 3pK was cloned in the pRSPA vector background. A GFP-tagged version of MK2 was kindly provided by M. Gaestel (Halle, Germany). pcDNA3HA-3pK was generated by inserting theNheI-SpeI fragment of pPC97-3pK into pcDNA3HA. The BamHI insert of pGEX KG-3pK was ligated in the yeast two-hybrid vector pAS2.1 (CLONTECH) to produce pAS2.1-3pK KM. pGAD10-E47 (amino acids 1–494) was constructed by ligating the 5′ 1492-base pair NotI fragment of pGAD10-E47 into pGAD10. The 3′ 912-base pair XhoI fragment was inserted in pGAD10 to create pGAD10-E47 (amino acids 372–651). For pGAD10-E47 (amino acids 18–229), the original pGAD10-E47 was cut with SacI and religated. 5′-cgcgtacacctgctgcctcccaacacctgctgcctcccaacacctgctgcctcccaacacctgcc-3′ and 5′-tcgaggcaggtgttgggaggcagcaggtgttgggaggcagcaggtgttgggaggca gcaggtgat-3′ primers (E-boxes are underlined) containing four E-box sequences were annealed and cloned into the MluI andXhoI sites of the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega). The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using a human heart MATCHMAKER cDNA library cloned into pGAD10 (CLONTECH). Yeast strain Y190 was manipulated according the MATCHMAKER Library User Manual (CLONTECH). A sequential transformation protocol was used with pAS2.1-3pK KM as bait. Positive clones were identified by growth on SD/−TRP/−LEU/−HIS/+25 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma) plates and activity of thelacZ reporter gene in filter assays. DNA sequence analysis showed that 1 colony of 128 β-Gal-positive colonies contained a human full-length E47 cDNA. Direct two-hybrid tests with the interaction partner and pAS2.1-3pK KM were performed according to standard protocols. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in humidified air with 6% CO2. Production of rabbit anti-glutathioneS-transferase (GST) antiserum was described earlier (2.Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). An anti-GST monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by S. Feller (Würzburg, Germany). Polyclonal rabbit anti-E47 IgG (sc-763 X) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. HA-tagged proteins were detected with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5). Cells were transfected by a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method according to a modified Stratagene protocol (2.Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.3% (v/v) FCS for 48 h after transfection. For activation of 3pK or MK2, HEK293 cells were stimulated with 0.5 mm sodiummeta-arsenite (Sigma) for 30 min prior to harvesting. Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer (TLB) (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and an inhibitor mix containing 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice for 10 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and supernatants were incubated with different antisera for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with 25 μl of protein A-agarose and washed extensively with TLB. For in vitro coprecipitation experiments, 15 μg of recombinant GST-E47 were synthesized according to the manufacturer's manual (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B. These complexes were added to precleared TLB lysates (500 μg of total protein) of transfected or untransfected HEK293 cells, incubated for 6–12 h, and washed twice either with high salt TLB (0.5m NaCl) or with RIPA (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, supplemented with inhibitors). After resuspension in Laemmli buffer and SDS-PAGE, proteins were detected by immunoblot. COS7 cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 20 min at room temperature, washed, and then incubated with ice cold acetone for 7 min at −20 °C. After being blocked with 10% FCS for 20 min at 37 °C, cells were incubated with either a mouse monoclonal antibody to GST or with the anti-E47 antiserum at 1 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and blocked again with FCS for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with a Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG or a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG antiserum in a 1:200 dilution (Dako) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, and mounted with Moviol (Aldrich) in Glycerol/H20 supplemented with 2.5% diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Merck). In vitro kinase assays with bacterially expressed 3pK and GST-E47 were performed with equal amounts (1.6 μg) of active 3pK or inactive 3pK and 10 μg Sepharose-bound GST-E47 as a substrate added to the kinase buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmbenzamidine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate). Immunoprecipitated versions of tagged HA-3pK, HA-MK2, or E47 were combined and washed twice in RIPA buffer supplemented with 0.5m NaCl before being subjected to the kinase buffer. The kinase assays (30 min) were performed at 30 °C with 5 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.1 mm ATP. 24 h after transfection, COS7 cells were harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Na-MES, pH 7.8, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 2% Triton X-100). 50 μl of precleared cell extracts were added to 50 μl of luciferase assay buffer (125 mm Na-MES, pH 7.8, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 25 mm magnesium acetate, and 2 mg/ml ATP). Immediately after the injection of 50 μl of 1 mm D-luciferin (AppliChem), luminescence was measured for 5 s in a luminometer (Berthold). The luciferase activities were normalized on the β-galactosidase activity of cotransfected β-Gal vector. The β-galactosidase assay was performed with 20 μl of precleared cell lysate according to a standard protocol (19.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mean values and standard deviations from three independent experiments are shown. To unravel the unknown physiological function of 3pK, we searched for binding partners in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The only in vitro and in vivo substrate for 3pK identified to date is the small heat shock protein Hsp27. Hsp27 phosphorylation may regulate actin filament dynamics, thought to be mediated by 3pK and MK2 (23.Huot J. Houle F. Rousseau S. Deschesnes R.G. Shah G.M. Landry J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Because both kinases are found in the nucleus of cells (Fig.2 B and Ref. 22.Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), 3pK and MK2 may also have nuclear targets. Indeed, MK2 was shown to phosphorylate the nuclear transcription factors CREB as well as SRF (5.Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 6.Heidenreich O. Neininger A. Schratt G. Zinck R. Cahill M.A. Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Kraft R. Kostka S. Gaestel M. Nordheim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14434-14443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and to modulate their transcriptional activity. 3pK is also able to phosphorylate CREBin vitro and to interact with several nuclear proteins in vivo. 2B. Neufeld, S. Ludwig, and U. R. Rapp, unpublished data. We used a human heart cDNA library and a kinase inactive version of 3pK as a bait, because wild-type 3pK autonomously led to the transactivation of the reporter genes. It has recently been demonstrated that substitution of a lysine residue by methionine in the putative ATP-binding site of a kinase allows a more stable binding with its substrates, thus leading to a stronger transcriptional activation of the two-hybrid reporter gene (20.Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In the two-hybrid screen, we found the full-length human basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor E47 to be a 3pK interaction partner (Fig.1). To narrow down the interacting domain of E47 that binds 3pK, we cloned several deletion mutants of E47 for direct two-hybrid tests (Fig. 1). Interestingly, deletion of 157 amino acids of the extreme C terminus including the acidic and the basic helix-loop-helix domain abolished the interaction, suggesting that this region is necessary for the binding of E47 to 3pK. The N-terminal deletion of amino acids 18–229 containing the first activation domain did not weaken the interaction, whereas a further N-terminal truncation of E47 up to amino acid 371 eliminated binding. This finding indicates that in addition to the loop-helix transactivation domain and the acidic domain located in the C-terminal half, an N-terminal region is also necessary for binding to 3pK. To confirm independently the 3pK-E47 two-hybrid interaction, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments as well as colocalization studies. Transfected E47 specifically coprecipitates with HA-3pK (Fig.2 A, lane 4), whereas no coprecipitated proteins were detectable in the control samples (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 3). Fig. 2 B shows that GST- and GFP-tagged versions of 3pK and MK2 are located in the nucleus of transfected COS7 cells and GFP-tagged kinases colocalize with E47. It is noteworthy that neither GST nor GFP fusion affects kinase activity of 3pK (Ref. 2.Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar and data not shown). These experiments indicate that 3pK and E47 interact in vivoin yeast as well as in mammalian cells. We further analyzed whether MK2 also interacts with E47. Recombinant GST-tagged E47 or GST alone was bound to glutathione-Sepharose and added to precleared HEK293 lysates containing either HA-3pK, HA-MK2, or no kinase. After the pull-down, the beads were washed twice either under moderate (high salt TLB) or high stringency conditions (RIPA) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Under both conditions, 3pK and MK2 were pulled down with GST-E47 (Fig.3, lanes 2 and 6) but not when GST was bound to the Sepharose (Fig. 3, lanes 3and 7) or when lysates of untransfected cells were used (Fig. 3, lane 4). Thus, 3pK and MK2 overlap in their ability to bind to E47 even under highly stringent conditions, demonstrating a high binding affinity of the kinases to E47. E47 is phosphorylatedin vivo at several different sites in many cell types (17.Sloan S.R. Shen C.P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,18.Shen C.P. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4518-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); however, there is only limited information about the identity of these E47 kinases. Several bHLH proteins, including E47, contain potential PKA and CKII phosphorylation motifs, which have since been confirmed in in vitro kinase phosphorylation studies (14.Mitsui K. Shirakata M. Paterson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24415-24420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16.Johnson S.E. Wang X. Hardy S. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24.Hardy S. Kong Y. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5943-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some of the PKA substrates such as the transcription factor CREB are also phosphorylated by MAPKAP kinases at the same sites, indicating that these kinases have overlapping sequence preferences. We therefore performed in vitro kinase assays to determine whether 3pK and MK2 are able to phosphorylate E47. HA-3pK, HA-MK2, or E47 were separately transfected in HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitated, washed, and mixed prior to the kinase reaction (Fig. 4 A). As a source of activated 3pK and MK2, cells were stimulated with arsenite resulting in a strong activation of both kinases, as shown by autophosphorylation. In the presence of active kinases, E47 was strongly phosphorylated (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and 6). Because the 3pK immunoprecipitates might contain additional kinases eventually responsible for this phosphorylation, we also used bacterially expressed and purified proteins for the experiments shown in Fig. 4 B. A GST fusion protein of E47 (GST-E47) was incubated with active or inactive recombinant 3pK (Fig. 4 B). In the presence of the active kinase, GST-E47 is phosphorylated, whereas the inactive version failed to phosphorylate E47. The negative control shows that the GST part is not a substrate. These results clearly demonstrate the ability of the MAPKAP kinases 3pK and MK2 to phosphorylate E47 in vitro. The E47 amino acid sequence shows four potential minimal consensus motifs for phosphorylation by MAPKAP kinases, three in the extreme N terminus and one at Ser-529, phosphorylated not in B-cells but in non-B cells (17.Sloan S.R. Shen C.P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-529 in concert with Ser-514, both lying in close proximity to the basic DNA-binding domain, was found to inhibit DNA binding of E47 homodimers, whereas hypophosphorylated E47 allows DNA binding of homodimers as it occurs in B-cells (17.Sloan S.R. Shen C.P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for phosphorylation regulated DNA binding of Max homodimers (25.Berberich S.J. Cole M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphate modification is an important step in the regulation of bHLH transcription factors. It has been postulated that the overall negative net charge in close proximity to the basic DNA-binding region may weaken the contact of homodimers with DNA (17.Sloan S.R. Shen C.P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The colocalization and interaction of the two MAPKAP kinases with E47 suggest that the kinases are involved in the regulation of the transcriptional activity of the bHLH protein. Transcriptional activity of E47 was analyzed using a four E-box (4xE)-containing promoter gene construct that is strongly activated in the presence of the transcription factor (Fig. 5). We observed that coexpression of both 3pK and MK2 repressed the transcriptional activity of E47 on the 4xE-box promoter (Fig. 5,black and gray bars) in a dose-dependent manner to levels near those observed in the absence of E47. Expression of the kinases alone had no effect on the activity of the 4xE-box promoter in the absence of E47 (data not shown), indicating that the effect we observed is due to a cooperative action between the kinases and the transcription factor. Repression of the promoter was not observed when increasing amounts of SAPKβ were coexpressed with E47 (Fig. 5, white bars), indicating that this phenomenon is specific for 3pK and MK2. We used SAPKβ instead of the dominant negative 3pK in this assay, because 3pK KM is aberrantly located in the cytoplasm of the cell and may artificially discern E47 from the nucleus. The phosphorylation status of different bHLH proteins was found to be correlated with a reduced transcriptional activation of tissue-specific genes, including those involved in cell differentiation (13.Zhou J. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6232-6243Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15.Winter B. Braun T. Arnold H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9869-9878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Johnson S.E. Wang X. Hardy S. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This kinase-dependent transcriptional repression is consistent with a previous report showing that overexpression of CKII results in a dramatic reduction of E47 homodimer-directed transcription, suggesting that CKII may act as a positive regulator of myogenesis by preventing E-protein homodimers from binding to muscle gene regulatory elements (16.Johnson S.E. Wang X. Hardy S. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, by binding and/or phosphorylating E47, MAPKAP kinases may also prevent E47 homodimer binding, thereby reducing homodimer-dependent transactivation. In summary, we demonstrate that 3pK and MK2 are E47 kinases and that they bind to the bHLH transcription factor with high affinity and repress its transcriptional activity. These data link the E47 function to the MAPK signaling network and suggest that the MAPK-activated protein kinases are regulators of E47-controlled gene expression and differentiation."

Equilibrium dialysis analysis using H14CO3−showed that a truncated CmpA protein lacking the N-terminal 31 amino acids, expressed in Escherichia coli cells as a histidine-tagged soluble protein, specifically binds inorganic carbon (CO2 or HCO3−). The addition of the recombinant CmpA protein to a buffer caused a decrease in the concentration of dissolved CO2 because of the binding of inorganic carbon to the protein. The decrease in CO2 concentration was accelerated by the addition of carbonic anhydrase, indicating that HCO3−, but not CO2, binds to the protein. Mass spectrometric measurements of the amounts of unbound and bound HCO3− in CmpA solutions containing low concentrations of inorganic carbon revealed that CmpA binds HCO3− with high affinity (K d = 5 μm). A similar dissociation constant was obtained by analysis of the competitive inhibition of the CmpA protein on the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase at limiting concentrations of HCO3−.

The cells accumulate Ci in the cytoplasm as HCO3− and convert it into CO2 in carboxysomes, the polyhedral inclusion bodies to which ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is localized, to elevate the CO2concentration around the CO2-fixing enzyme (1.Price G.D.

Biol. 1999; 50: 539-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The transport of inorganic carbon has been the least understood step of carbon assimilation in cyanobacteria. We have, however, recently identified a high affinity HCO3−transporter (BCT1) of Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 (3.Omata T. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Okamura M. Gohta S. Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The transporter is encoded by the four genes cmpA,cmpB, cmpC, and cmpD (4.Omata T. Carlson T.J. Ogawa T. Pierce J. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5.Omata T. Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. III. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 807-810Crossref Google Scholar), which form a low CO2-inducible operon (3.Omata T. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Okamura M. Gohta S. Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The cmpA,cmpB, cmpC, and cmpD genes are strongly similar to the genes encoding the nitrate/nitrite transporter,nrtA, nrtB, nrtC, and nrtD, respectively, of the same organism (6.Omata T. Ohmori M. Arai N. Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6612-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Omata T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 151-157Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8.Omata T. Andriesse X. Hirano A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similar to nrtB,cmpB encodes a hydrophobic protein with structural similarities to the integral membrane components of ABC transporters;cmpC and cmpD encode the ATP-binding cassette proteins strongly similar to nrtC and nrtD, respectively. The product of cmpA is a 42-kDa cytoplasmic membrane protein, which is 46.5% identical to the nrtA gene product that functions as the membrane-anchored substrate (nitrate and nitrite)-binding protein (9.Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The similarity of CmpA to NrtA and its involvement in HCO3− uptake strongly suggest that the product of cmpA is the substrate-binding protein of the HCO3− transporter. In this work, we have biochemically verified this assumption by showing high affinity binding of HCO3− to a recombinant CmpA protein. Although contamination by atmospheric CO2 made it impossible to determine the dissociation constant of CmpA and HCO3− by the equilibrium dialysis technique using H14CO3−, use of a mass spectrometer enabled measurements of the amounts of free and bound H12CO3− in CmpA solutions containing low concentrations of H12CO3−, allowing kinetic analysis of binding of HCO3− to the protein. The dissociation constant was estimated also from the competitive inhibition of CmpA on the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase) reaction in the presence of limiting amounts of HCO3−. Both methods resulted in dissociation constant of 5 μm for CmpA and HCO3−, demonstrating that thecmpA gene encodes a HCO3−-binding protein. A 1.3-kilobase pair DNA fragment, carrying a truncated cmpA coding region lacking the first 93 bases, was cloned between the BamHI andSmaI sites in the polylinker of the expression vector pQE-32 (QIAGEN). The resulting plasmid (pQECMPA) carried a chimeric gene, which encodes a fusion protein consisting of an N-terminal amino acid segment carrying six consecutive histidine residues (MRGSH6GI) and truncated CmpA lacking the N-terminal 31 amino acids. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli M15 (pREP4) (QIAGEN), expression of the chimeric gene was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), and the histidine-tagged protein was purified on Ni2+- (or Co2+-) nitrilotriacetic acid resin (10.Hochuli E. Döbeli H. Schacher A. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 411: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The purified protein solution was dialyzed for 18 h at 15 °C against a buffer containing 20 mm TES-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl, with continuous sparging with N2gas. Analysis by equilibrium dialysis, using H14CO3−, of the binding of Ci to the recombinant CmpA protein was performed at 30 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl; 1.36-ml aliquots of protein solution (8.0 mg/ml) were dialyzed for 2 h against the same volume of the buffer supplemented with 100 μmH14CO3− (1 × 105 dpm), using paired Teflon cells separated by dialysis membrane (Spectrum). The radioactivity of 14C in each of the cells was determined with a scintillation counter (LSC-5100; Aloka). Aliquots of protein solution (10.9 mg/ml) were placed in dialysis tubes and dialyzed separately against various volumes of a buffer containing 20 mm TES-NaOH, pH 7.0 or 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl for 18 h at 30 °C. To lower the Ci concentration in buffer, the buffer was sparged continuously with N2 gas during the dialysis, with each beaker partially sealed within a plastic “glove.” Different final Ci concentrations were obtained by varying the rate of sparging with N2 and the volume of the dialysis buffer. Using gas-tight syringes, known volumes of the protein solution and the dialysis buffer were withdrawn from the dialysis system and immediately injected into the stoppered cuvette for determination of total12Ci with a mass spectrometer (see below). The concentration of the bound Ci was calculated by subtraction of total Ci concentration in the dialysis buffer from that in the protein solution. The concentration of free HCO3− was calculated from the total Ci concentration in the dialysis buffer and the distribution between CO2 and HCO3− at the pH of the dialysis buffer (see below). The CO2 concentration in the aqueous solution was measured by the use of a thermostatted glass cuvette connected to a mass spectrometer (VG Micromass 6), as described previously (11.Badger M.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 517-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Badger M.R. Bassett M. Comins H.N. Plant Physiol. 1985; 77: 465-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mass spectrometer was calibrated for CO2 concentration by injection of 2 μl of 100 mm NaHCO3 solution into 4 ml of 0.2n HCl in the stoppered cuvette. This calibration was then used to calculate the distribution between CO2 and HCO3− in the cuvette at the pH of assay buffer by injection of 20 μl of 100 mm NaHCO3into the cuvette and the measurement of the resulting CO2concentration. The total Ci concentrations in the sample solutions were measured by injection of known volumes of the solutions into 0.2 n HCl and measuring the resulting CO2concentration. The Ci species that binds to CmpA was determined by examination of the disequilibrium of CO2 and HCO3−, caused by the addition of free CmpA into buffer containing low concentrations of the Cispecies. The protein solution used, containing 19.6 mg/ml (equal to 400 μm) of the recombinant CmpA protein and 0.040 μm free CO2 (72 μm total Ci), was prepared by dialysis of a protein solution for 18 h at 15 °C against a buffer containing 20 mmTES-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl, with continuous sparging with N2 gas as described above. A 0.5-ml aliquot of the protein solution was injected into 2.5 ml of the buffer containing 6 μm CO2 (170 μm total Ci) with or without 1800 units/ml of carbonic anhydrase (CA) (Sigma), which had been placed in the glass cuvette thermostatted at 15 °C. The decrease in CO2 concentration in the solution was followed with a mass spectrometer. In control experiments, the dialysis buffer equilibrated with the protein solution, containing 0.040 μm CO2 (1.1 μm total Ci), was injected in place of the protein solution. Dependence of PEPCase activity on HCO3− concentration in assay buffer was determined in the presence and absence of the recombinant CmpA protein, which was prepared by dialysis for 18 h at 4 °C against a buffer containing 50 mm TES-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 20 mm MgCl2, with continuous sparging of the buffer with N2 gas. PEPCase activity was assayed at 30 °C by spectrophotometrically measuring consumption of NADH due to the coupled reduction of oxaloacetate to malate, catalyzed by malate dehydrogenase (13.Lane M.D. Maruyama H. Easterday R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 277-283Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Following a 3-min preincubation of the PEPCase in a 1.32-ml assay mixture containing 50 mm TES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.8 mm NADH, 0.5 mm NaHCO3, 0.17 units of PEPCase from maize (gift from Dr. Hal Hatch, CSIRO, Canberra), and 90 units of malate dehydrogenase from pig heart (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), with or without 4.2 mg of the CmpA protein, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 84 μl of 100 mmphosphoenolpyruvate. The rate of reaction was calculated from the slope of the time course of the decrease in NADH and plotted against the HCO3− concentration at that time point. The HCO3− concentration was calculated from the difference between the NADH concentration at the time point and that after cessation of the reaction due to complete consumption of HCO3−, using the molar ratio of 1:1 for the amounts of HCO3− and NADH consumed in the reaction. Extracts of E. coli and protein samples were suspended in the sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and lysed by heat treatment at 100 °C for 5 min. After gel electrophoresis in the buffer system of Laemmli (14.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), polypeptides were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein concentration was determined with Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). The deduced CmpA polypeptide has a presumed lipoprotein signal peptide (amino acids 1–28). Truncated CmpA (amino acids 32–450) lacking the presumed signal peptide was expressed as a histidine-tagged protein inE. coli. The expression of a 44-kDa protein was induced by IPTG (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). The 44-kDa protein was collected in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1, lane 3) and was purified to near homogeneity by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Fig. 1, lane 4) or Co2+nitrilotriacetic acid resin (data not shown). Table I shows the distribution of 14C between 1.36-ml aliquots of the solution of the recombinant CmpA (8 mg/ml) and the dialysis buffer after equilibrium dialysis with NaH14CO3. Under the experimental conditions, the protein solution contained 64% higher levels of 14C than the dialysis buffer. The accumulation of14C in the protein solution was abolished by an excess amount of NaH12CO3 but not with equivalent concentrations of NaNO3, NaNO2, Na2SO4, and Na2SO3, indicating that the truncated CmpA specifically binds Ci. In parallel experiments with no added CmpA and NaH14CO3, however, mass spectrometric analysis showed that the solutions in the dialysis cells contain 150–200 μm of 12Ci due to contamination by atmospheric CO2. Kinetic analysis of the binding of Ci to the recombinant CmpA at low Ciconcentrations (<100 μm) was thus problematical by this method.Table IBinding of inorganic carbon to recombinant CmpA proteinCompetitive substrate14Ci in the protein solution (A)14Ci in the dialysis buffer (B)A − Bdpm × 10 −4dpm × 10 −4dpm × 10 −4None6.704.082.62NaH12CO34.884.840.04NaNO36.554.032.52NaNO26.413.912.50Na2SO46.674.162.51Na2SO36.183.722.471.36 ml of the protein solution (8 mg/ml) was equilibrated with an equal volume of dialysis buffer containing 1 × 105 dpm (0.14 μmol) of H14CO3−, and the distribution of 14Ci between the CmpA solution and the dialysis buffer was determined. The competitive substrates were added to a final concentration of 3 mm to the dialysis buffer. Open table in a new tab 1.36 ml of the protein solution (8 mg/ml) was equilibrated with an equal volume of dialysis buffer containing 1 × 105 dpm (0.14 μmol) of H14CO3−, and the distribution of 14Ci between the CmpA solution and the dialysis buffer was determined. The competitive substrates were added to a final concentration of 3 mm to the dialysis buffer. A mass spectrometer assay was employed to determine the Cispecies that binds to CmpA protein. When 0.5 ml of buffer containing 0.040 μm free CO2 (1.1 μm total free Ci) was injected into 2.5 ml of the same buffer containing 6 μm CO2 (170 μmtotal Ci), concentration of the dissolved CO2decreased by 1.0 μm in 25 s (Fig.2 A). CA did not affect the rate of decrease in the CO2 concentration (Fig.2 A), indicating that injection of buffer did not cause disequilibrium of the CO2 to HCO3− ratio and that the CO2 decrease was due solely to Ci dilution. After injection of 0.5 ml of the protein solution (19.6 mg/ml) that had been equilibrated with the buffer containing 0.040 μmCO2, the CO2 concentration decreased by 2.6 μm in 400 s, verifying the ability of the recombinant CmpA protein to bind Ci. From the difference in the extent of decrease in dissolved CO2 caused by injection of the buffer and the protein solution, the concentration of the Ci-binding site that bound Ci after the injection was calculated to be 45 μm. In the presence of CA, the extent of decrease in dissolved CO2 was the same as that in the absence of CA, but the decrease was faster and completed in 25 s after the injection of the protein solution (Fig.2 A). These results indicated that the binding of Ci to the protein caused temporary disequilibrium of CO2 versus HCO3−in favor of CO2, strongly suggesting that the CmpA protein binds HCO3− rather than CO2. The time course of decrease in CO2 due to binding of Ci to CmpA, excluding the dilution effect, was calculated by subtracting the data obtained by the addition of buffer from those obtained by the addition of protein solution (Fig. 2 B). From the curves, the initial rates of decrease in CO2concentration were calculated to be 0.118 μm/s and 0.0152 μm/s in the presence and absence of CA, respectively. When 50 μm NaHCO3 was added to the buffer in the absence of CA, the initial rate of increase in CO2 concentration was 0.0180 μm/s (data not shown), which was similar to the initial rate of decrease in CO2 concentration caused by removal of 45 μm of Ci from medium due to binding to CmpA. Furthermore, a hypothetical CO2-binding protein would have been expected to cause a rapid and pronounced decline in the CO2 concentration, in the absence of CA, followed by a slow return back to the equilibrium level. This clearly did not occur. These results also support the notion that it is HCO3− that bound to CmpA. Although the equilibrium dialysis using14C-labeled HCO3− showed specific binding of Ci to the CmpA protein, kinetic analysis of Ci binding was hardly possible by this method because of contamination by atmospheric 12CO2. We therefore performed equilibrium dialysis with no added Ci, with continuous sparging of the dialysis buffer with N2 gas to keep the concentrations of Ci in the buffer low, and used mass spectrometry for quantitation of12Ci in the aqueous solutions. Different final Ci concentrations were obtained by varying the rate of sparging with N2 and the volume of the dialysis buffer. The concentration of HCO3− bound to CmpA was calculated by subtracting the total Ci concentration in the dialysis buffer from that in the protein solution. The free HCO3− concentration was calculated from the total Ci concentration in the dialysis buffer and the fraction of HCO3− in total Ci at 30 °C at the pH of assay buffer (74 and 96.5% at pH 7.0 and pH 7.5, respectively). The recombinant CmpA protein was found to bind HCO3− with similar binding kinetics at pH 7.0 and pH 7.5 (Fig.3). From the Scatchard plots (15.Scatchard G. Annu. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar) of the data, the dissociation constant for HCO3− was calculated to be 5.8 and 5.0 μm at pH 7.0 and pH 7.5, respectively. The concentration of the bound HCO3− under saturation was calculated to be 203 and 200 μm at pH 7.0 and pH 7.5, respectively. These values were similar to the protein concentration used, 220 μm, as calculated from the protein concentration of 10.9 mg/ml and the calculated molecular mass of 49,113 Da, suggesting that one molecule of protein carries one substrate-binding site. Fig. 4 A compares the dependence of PEPCase activity on HCO3− concentration in assay buffer in the absence and presence of the recombinant CmpA protein. In the absence of CmpA, the maize PEPCase preparation used in this study showed a saturation kinetics with aK m(HCO3−) value of 32 μm, which was similar to the previously reported value (20 μm) (16.Uedan K. Sugiyama T. Plant Physiol. 1976; 57: 906-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance with the ability of CmpA to bind HCO3− with high affinity, the presence of CmpA was found to competitively inhibit the PEPCase reaction. The inhibitory effect was more prominent at lower concentrations of HCO3−, resulting in a sigmoidal response of the rate of PEPCase reaction on the HCO3− concentration. At a given concentration of total HCO3− in the CmpA solution, the concentration of free HCO3− was obtained as the HCO3− concentration that supported the same rate of PEPCase reaction in the absence of CmpA. The concentration of CmpA-bound HCO3− was then calculated by subtraction of the free HCO3−concentration from the total HCO3−concentration. Fig. 4 B shows the relationship between the concentrations of free HCO3− and CmpA-bound HCO3− thus obtained. From the Scatchard plot (15.Scatchard G. Annu. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar) of the data (Fig. 4 B,inset), the dissociation constant was calculated to be 5.4 μm. The calculated concentration of the bound HCO3− under saturation was 60.5 μm. Repeated measurements using the same protein sample yielded a K d value of 5.35 ± 0.11 μm with the concentration of the binding site being 60.6 ± 2.2 μm (n = 3), showing the reproducibility of the method for determination of the parameters. The calculated concentration of the HCO3−binding site was close to the protein concentration used, 61 μm, as calculated from the protein concentration of 3.0 mg/ml and the molecular mass of the protein, suggesting the presence of one substrate-binding site per one molecule of the protein. These results were essentially the same as those obtained by the equilibrium dialysis analyses using a mass spectrometer as the means of Ci quantitation. Bacterial ABC importers require a substrate-binding protein that has high affinity for its specific substrate (17.Higgins C.F. Hyde S.C. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Gill D.R. Gallagher M.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 571-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 18.Tam R. Saier J.M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, a recombinant CmpA protein was shown to bind HCO3− (Fig. 2), which conforms with our previous finding that the ABC transporter encoded by thecmpABCD operon acts as an inducible, high affinity transporter for HCO3− inSynechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 (3.Omata T. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Okamura M. Gohta S. Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant of the CmpA protein, approximately 5 μm for HCO3− (Figs. 3 and 4), is low enough to account for the apparent K m value of the HCO3− transporter for HCO3−, 15 μm (3.Omata T. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Okamura M. Gohta S. Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the cmpA gene product functions as the substrate-binding protein of the HCO3− transporter. The CmpA protein was originally found as a major protein of the cytoplasmic membrane of the cells grown under CO2-limited conditions (19.Omata T. Ogawa T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 525-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is tightly bound to the cytoplasmic membrane despite the hydrophilicity of the predicted sequence (4.Omata T. Carlson T.J. Ogawa T. Pierce J. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that NrtA, a paralog of CmpA, is a substrate-binding lipoprotein, which is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane by the lipid moieties attached covalently to the N-terminal Cys residue of the mature protein (9.Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Maturation of the lipoproteins requires signal peptidase II for cleavage of the signal peptide from anS-glyceride derivative of prolipoproteins with the modified Cys residue at the signal cleavage site (20.Inukai M. Takeuchi M. Shimizu K. Arai M. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1978; 31: 1203-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Similar to the case in NrtA, the predicted amino acid sequence around the presumed signal cleavage site of CmpA, LKGC (9.Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), conforms to the consensus sequence recognized by signal peptidase II, (L/V/I)(A/S/T/G)(G/A)C, in which one mismatch is acceptable in the first two amino acids (21.von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the mature CmpA protein, purified from the cytoplasmic membrane of low CO2-grown Synechococcus cells, was shown to be blocked (4.Omata T. Carlson T.J. Ogawa T. Pierce J. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The His-tagged recombinant CmpA protein was expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli (Fig. 1), confirming the hydrophilicity of the protein without the signal peptide. These observations, together with its tight binding to the membrane, suggest that the mature form of CmpA is a lipoprotein. The NrtA protein, which functions as the substrate-binding protein of the ABC transporter encoded by the nrtABCD genes, is 46.5% identical to CmpA and binds nitrate and nitrite with high affinity (K d = 0.3 μm) (9.Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A gene (cynA) 2F. Jalali and G. S. Espie, GenBankTM accession no. AF001333. encoding another paralog of CmpA forms a gene cluster with the cynBDgenes, which encode membrane components of an ABC transporter presumably involved in uptake of cyanate (NCO−) (22.Harano Y. Suzuki I. Maeda S. Kaneko T. Tabata S. Omata T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5744-5750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CynA protein, which is 28 and 26% identical to CmpA and NrtA, respectively, is hence supposed to be the substrate-binding protein of the putative cyanate transporter. Tam and Saier (18.Tam R. Saier J.M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously identified eight groups of substrate-binding proteins, which are distinct in primary amino acid sequences and the nature of the substrate. The CmpA, NrtA, and CynA proteins appear to constitute the ninth distinct group of substrate-binding proteins, which are involved in binding of monoanions, together with the orthologs of NrtA (NrtA ofAnabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 (23.Cai Y.P.

Miyajima N. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), the protein encoded by an open reading frame (bases 87,787–86,411 on the c374 segment of genomic DNA sequence; Cyanobase) of Anabaenasp. strain PCC 7120). It should be also noted that there is another class of CmpA/NrtA homologs in cyanobacteria. These are the C-terminal domain of CmpC and that of NrtC. CmpC and NrtC are each one of the two ATP-binding subunits of the bicarbonate- and nitrate/nitrite transporters, respectively, and are composed of two distinct domains. Whereas their N-terminal domains are strongly similar to the ATP-binding subunits of other ABC transporters and to each other, their C-terminal domains are 30% identical to CmpA, NrtA, and to each other. The C-terminal domain of NrtC is required not for nitrate/nitrite transport but for ammonium-promoted inhibition of the transport (30.Kobayashi M. Rodrı́guez R. Lara C. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27197-27201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), indicating that it is a regulatory domain of the transporter. The similarity of the regulatory domain of NrtC to CmpA/NrtA and the capacity of CmpA/NrtA for substrate binding suggest that the regulation of nitrate/nitrite transport might involve binding of a certain compound, probably an anion, to the regulatory domain. Although it is unknown what kind of regulation the HCO3− transporter is subject to, it is inferred by analogy that the C-terminal domain of CmpC has a regulatory role in HCO3−transport. Biochemical and molecular biological studies on the NrtC and CmpC proteins are being performed to elucidate the structure-function relationships of the C-terminal domains of these proteins."

We have determined the transient kinetic parameters that dictate the ATP hydrolysis cycle of mammalian myosin I by examining the properties of MI1IQ. Transient kinetics reveal that the affinity of MI1IQ for actin is 12 nm. The ATP-induced dissociation of actin-MI1IQ is biphasic. The fast phase is dependent upon [ATP], whereas the slow phase is not; both phases show a Ca2+ sensitivity. The fast phase is eliminated by the addition of ADP, 10 μm being required for half-saturation of the effect in the presence of Ca2+ and 3 μm ADP in the absence of Ca2+. The slow phase shares the same rate constant as ADP release (8 and 3 s−1 in the presence and absence of Ca2+, respectively), but cannot be eliminated by decreasing [ADP]. We interpret these results to suggest that actin-myosin I exists in two forms in equilibrium, one of which is unable to bind nucleotide. These results also indicate that the absence of the COOH-terminal 5 calmodulin binding domains of myr-1 do not influence the kinetic properties of MI130 and that the Ca2+ sensitivity of the kinetics are in all likelihood due to Ca2+ binding to the first IQ domain.

Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One member of the class I myosins, MYR-1, is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. myr-1 contains up to 6 IQ domains; alternate splice forms containing 4, 5, or 6 IQ domains exist (2.Ruppert C. Kroschewski R. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The 130-kDa myosin I isolated from rat liver is a myr-1 gene product (3.Coluccio L.M. Conaty C. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1993; 24: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4.Coluccio L.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although quantitation of calmodulin has indicated that this preparation contains 6 mol of calmodulin/130-kDa myosin I heavy chain (4.Coluccio L.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), isoforms corresponding to the 5 IQ and 4 IQ variants are also expressed in liver (2.Ruppert C. Kroschewski R. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and may be present.The 130-kDa myosin I translocates actin filaments slowly and in a Ca2+-sensitive manner (5.Williams R. Coluccio L.M. Cell Motil Cytoskel. 1994; 27: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At 10 μm free Ca2+ and above, motility is inhibited. This decrease in motility can be reversed by the addition of exogenous calmodulin, indicating that a calcium-induced dissociation of calmodulin might be responsible for the decrease in motility. Laser trap analyses have indicated that the 130-kDa myosin I translocates actin in a two-step process (6.Veigel C. Coluccio L.M. Jontes J.D. Sparrow J.C. Milligan R.A. Molloy J.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The authors proposed that the two mechanical steps are coupled to Pi and ADP release, respectively. Transient kinetic analyses have indicated that the mechanical step coupled to ADP release is unlikely to contribute to force generation or to motility, but could be a system for providing a strain-sensitive ADP release mechanism. This, together with the slow ATP-induced dissociation of actin-myosin I, suggests that this myosin is best suited for maintenance of tension (7.Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21575-21580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).We have coexpressed in baculovirus calmodulin and a fragment representing the first 728 amino acids of MYR-1, which codes for the amino-terminal motor domain and 1 IQ domain; we refer to this complex as MI1IQ 1 (8.Perreault-Micale C. Shushan A.D. Coluccio L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21618-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). MI1IQ translocates actin filaments in vitro.Unlike the parent molecule, the rate of actin translocation is not affected by the Ca2+ concentration over the range ofpCa 4–7 and the rates of movement of MI130 and MI1IQ are comparable.The availability of a homogeneous preparation from the baculovirus expression system has allowed us to explore in detail the kinetics of this construct representing the motor domain and the first IQ domain. Our results indicate that the truncated myosin I possesses kinetic properties indistinguishable from the parent molecule. Thus, the 5 deleted IQ domains and their associated calmodulins play no role in defining the unloaded properties of the myosin I head. Furthermore, our results indicate that, when bound to actin, myosin I exists in two conformations in equilibrium and that ATP can bind to only one of the two conformations. The equilibrium between the two forms is sensitive to both Ca2+ and ADP concentrations and we propose that the conformational change between the two forms may correlate with (i) the double step observed in laser trap studies with this molecule (6.Veigel C. Coluccio L.M. Jontes J.D. Sparrow J.C. Milligan R.A. Molloy J.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and (ii) the ADP-dependent conformational change identified by electron microscopy for a closely related myosin I, brush border myosin I (9.Jontes J.D. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Milligan R.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10.Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).RESULTSThe transient kinetics of the interaction of MI1IQwith actin and ATP were examined and compared with our previous measurements on the native protein, MI130 (7.Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21575-21580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In all cases the results were very similar. Fig.1 A shows the fluorescent transient observed upon addition of 100 μm ATP to a 25 nm complex of MI1IQ and pyrene-labeled actin in the presence of Ca2+. The transient was well described by a single exponential with a k obs of 2.4 s−1 and corresponds to the dissociation of actin from the complex. At low ATP concentrations (25–200 μm), the reaction was monophasic andk obs was linearly dependent upon [ATP] with an apparent second order rate constant, K 1 k +2, of 5.3 × 104m−1s−1. Above 200 μm ATP, the reaction became biphasic and could be described by a two exponential term (Fig. 1 B). The slow phase was independent of [ATP] with a k obs of 8 s−1and an amplitude of 25–30% of the total transient. The fast phase showed a hyperbolic dependence upon [ATP], and the best fit gave a maximum observed rate constant of 79 s−1 with 1.5 mm ATP required for half saturation ofk obs (see Fig. 1 C). By analogy with other actomyosin systems, the maximal rate and the ATP concentration at half the maximal rate were assigned to k +2, and1/K 1, respectively, the rate constant for an isomerization of the actin-myosin complex, which limits the dissociation of actin and the affinity of ATP for the actin-myosin complex (Table I).Table ITransient kinetic analysis of native rat MI 130 and expressed fragment MI 1IQRate/eq constantUnitsMI130(7)MI1IQRb S1 (22)+Ca2+−Ca2++Ca2+−Ca2+Nucleotide binding to acto-MK 1 · k +2μm−1s−10.0230.0170.0530.032.11/K 1mm3.21.91.51.25.7k +2s−17432.5793612,000K ADμm≤10≤10103200k −ADs−1628.03.5>500k +ADμm−1s−10.81.1Actin binding −ADPK Anm13131230 +ADPK DAnm60–11060–1101000ATP bindingK 1 · k +2μm−1s−10.10.10.10.12.3k +3 +k −3s−1130Mant ATPK 1 · k +2μm−1s−10.10.13.2 Open table in a new tab Repeating the measurement in the absence of Ca2+ gave similar results, except that the slow component of the transient comprised 50% of the total amplitude with k obsof 3.4 s−1 and the best fit to the [ATP] dependence of the k obs of the fast component gave k +2 = 36 s−1and 1/K 1 = 1.2 mm for an apparent second order rate constant (−Ca2+) of 3 × 104m−1s−1 (Fig. 1 C).We had previously observed for MI130 that the fast phase of the transient was eliminated by incubating the proteins with 20 μm ADP before initiating the reaction by mixing with ATP. A similar result was observed here for the expressed myosin I fragment (Fig. 2 A). In this case we were able to titrate the fast phase of the transient, and a plot of the amplitude against [ADP] in the presence and absence of Ca2+ is shown in Fig. 2 B. A fit of the amplitude to a hyperbola gave a best fit of 10 and 3 μm, respectively, in the presence and absence of Ca2+, and this is assigned to the affinity of ADP for the A.MI1IQ complex ( K AD). The k obs of the slow phase remained almost constant over the range of [ADP] used (8.5 s−1 in Ca2+; 2.45 s−1, −Ca2+) and was assigned to k −AD, the rate of ADP dissociation from A.MI1IQ.ADP. Since K AD = k −AD/ k +AD, it is possible to calculate k +AD, the apparent second order rate constant of ADP binding to A·MI1IQ. This gave values of 0.8 × 106m−1 s−1(+Ca2+) and 1.1 × 106m−1 s−1(−Ca2+), i.e. the apparent second order rate constant of ADP binding is Ca2+ independent and 15–40 fold faster than the apparent second order rate constant of ATP binding to A·MI1IQ.Figure 2Influence of ADP on the ATP-induced dissociation of actin-MI130. A, addition of 2.5 mm ATP to 25 nmpyrene-actin-MI130 in the absence of ADP resulted in a rapid increase in fluorescence best described by a double exponential (k obs = 43.8 and 8.5 s−1 and amplitudes of 18.8 and 9.4%, respectively). In the presence of 20 μm ADP, the change in fluorescence can be described by a single exponential with ak obs = 10.3 s−1 and an amplitude of 19.8%; however, the data can be equally described by a double exponential with k obs = 37.7 and 8.5 s−1 and amplitudes of 3.8% and 17.3%, respectively. B, titration of the amplitude of the fast phase against [ADP] added to the protein before mixing with ATP in the presence and absence of Ca2+. The data were fitted to a hyperbola in each case, and the apparent affinity ( K AD) for ADP is 10 μm in the presence of Ca2+ and 3 μm in its absence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that the rate of ADP binding is faster than ATP binding, we examined the rates of competitive binding of ADP and ATP to A·MI1IQ. A·MI1IQ at 30 nm was mixed in the stopped flow apparatus with 1 mm ATP and 0–40 μm ADP. The amplitude of the fast phase decreased, whereas k obs increased with increasing [ADP] (data not shown). This demonstrates that ADP effectively competes with ATP even at less than one-tenth of the concentration. If the rate of ADP dissociation from the A·M·D complex is much less than the rate at which ADP and ATP bind to A·M (i.e.[A·M·D] k −AD ≪ [ATP] K 1 k +2 + [ADP] k +AD), thenk obs = [ATP] K 1 k +2 + [ADP] k +AD. At a fixed ATP concentration,k obs increased from 23 to 42 s−1 at 20 μm ADP and further increased to 73 s−1 at 40 μm. The data over this limited range are therefore compatible with a value of k +AD of 0.95–1.25 × 106m−1s−1 in agreement with the estimate above.The slow phase of the ATP-induced dissociation of A·MI1IQhas a k obs that is very similar to k −AD, the rate constant of ADP dissociation from the A·MI1IQ·D complex even in the absence of added ADP. It is possible, therefore, that the slow phase represents a fraction of A·MI1IQ that is isolated with ADP bound. Extensive treatment of the protein with apyrase did not eliminate the slow phase of the reaction. In contrast, if the protein was treated with 20 μm ADP such that the fast phase was eliminated, then treatment with apyrase restored the fast phase but only to the same extent as in the original measurement. Thus, apyrase treatment does eliminate the protein bound ADP effectively. We therefore conclude that the slow phase is not caused by the presence of ADP bound to the protein.Another possibility is that ATP could be the source of contaminating ADP. ATP normally contains about 1% ADP. If ADP binds to the protein faster than ATP (as shown above), then the contaminant ADP could bind a fraction of the protein to produce the slow phase. The true substrate for myosin is MgATP, and the product is MgADP. Since ATP binds Mg2+ more tightly than ADP, reducing the free Mg2+ concentration to a minimum should reduce the contaminant MgADP concentration; however, under limiting Mg2+ concentrations, the slow phase remained constant (data not shown). Furthermore, addition of up to 5% ADP into the ATP had no effect on the amplitude of the slow phase (see above). These results indicate that the slow phase is not due to ADP contamination in the ATP.The effect of Ca2+ on the rate of ADP release from MI130 was measured by determining in buffers containing fixed amounts of Ca2+, the rate of the ATP-induced dissociation of pyrene-labeled actin-MI in the presence of saturating amounts of ADP (Fig. 3). Thek obs was plotted as a function of [Ca2+], and the line represents the best fit to the Hill equation with midpoint of 6.8 ± 0.6 μmCa2+ and k obs in the presence and absence of Ca2+ of 8.0 and 1.5 s−1, respectively. The slope of the graph that defines the Hill coefficient was poorly defined as 3 ± 1.5. These data indicate that binding of Ca2+ to the myosin I complex is positively cooperative.Figure 3Calcium dependence of the observed rate of ADP displacement from A· MI130 (squares) and A· MI1IQ (circles). The observed rate constant for ADP release was estimated from the observed rate of ATP-induced dissociation of 25 nm pyrene-labeled actin-MI in the presence of 50 μm [ADP]. Thek obs was plotted as a function of [Ca2+], and the line represents the best fit of the MI130 data to the Hill equation with a Ca2+ affinity of 6.9 ± 0.8 μm withk obs in the presence and absence of Ca2+ of 8.3 ± 0.4 and 1.5 ± 0.2 s−1, respectively. The Hill coefficient was not well defined by the data, and an acceptable fit could be achieved with any value from 2 to 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The binding of ATP to MI1IQ was followed using intrinsic protein fluorescence and gave results that were indistinguishable from those of MI130 (data not shown), indicating a second order rate constant for ATP binding of 0.1 × 106m−1 s−1that was independent of Ca2+. There was no evidence of a slow component of the reaction; however, the signal to noise ratio was very poor in these measurements, and the possibility of a slower component cannot be eliminated.The affinity of MI1IQ for actin was measured by monitoring the amplitude of the ATP-induced dissociation of pyrene-labeled A·MI1IQ as a function of [MI1IQ] (15.Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Using 30 nm pA and 400 μm ATP, the amplitude of the reaction was measured for MI1IQ from 10 to 150 nm (Fig. 4). Analysis of the data gave a value of K A of 12 nm, in good agreement with the value obtained for the native protein by a less direct method (7.Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21575-21580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Figure 4Titration of actin with MI.A, 30 nm phalloidin-stabilized pyrene-labeled actin was incubated with 10, 20, and 150 nmMI1IQ before mixing with 200 μm ATP. In each case the reaction was well described by a single exponential withk obs of 3.8 s−1. The amplitude increased with increasing MI concentration, and a plot of the amplitudes against [MI] is in B. The best fit to the quadratic equation describing the binding isotherm (see “Experimental Procedures”) gave a K d of 12 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur results demonstrate that MI1IQ is essentially indistinguishable from MI130 in terms of its interaction with actin and nucleotide, indicating that the presence of the 5 additional IQ domains and associated calmodulins in the parent molecule has no effect on these properties (Table I). The truncated myosin I shows the same actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity as the parent molecule (8.Perreault-Micale C. Shushan A.D. Coluccio L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21618-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the ATP, ADP, and actin binding to A·MI1IQ are identical to the parent. Since the actin and nucleotide binding to MI1IQ are unchanged, the coupling between actin and nucleotide binding is also expected to remain unaffected by the missing IQ domains and their associated calmodulins. In addition, the Ca2+ sensitivity of all of the above properties is identical to that of the parent molecule, MI130. These results demonstrate that the Ca2+sensitivity of these properties is not a function of the missing calmodulins and must result from Ca2+ binding to the first calmodulin or from a novel independent Ca2+ binding site in the motor domain.All of the events in the acto-MI ATPase cycle that we have measured are significantly faster than the turnover rate and are therefore not rate-limiting in the ATPase reaction. It is therefore likely that Pi release is rate-limiting, as has been observed for other myosins, and in this case the Pi release must be regulated by Ca2+, as previously observed for scallop muscle myosin II (19.Wells C. Bagshaw C.R. Nature. 1985; 313: 696-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A biphasic fluorescent transient was observed upon introduction of ATP to complexes of pyrene-labeled actin with both MI130 and MI1IQ. The amplitudes and rates of the two phases were similar for the two proteins, and in both cases the rate constant of the slow phase was very similar to the rate constant limiting ADP release from A·MI. To address the possibility that the slow component was due to ADP present either in association with the expressed myosin I or as a trace contaminant in the ATP, several experiments designed to reduce ADP levels were performed. In all cases, the slow phase remained unaltered.For the native protein we considered the alternative possibility that the slow phase in the ATP dissociation reaction was due to the presence of a fraction of damaged myosin I, e.g. missing one or more of the calmodulins, or that a contaminant myosin I could be present and therefore responsible for the biphasic nature of the ADP-induced dissociation. It seems unlikely, however, that the same contaminant would be present in both myosin I preparations (i.e. the native protein isolated from liver and the expressed fragment from insect cells) since they derive from different cell types and involve different purification schemes. We are therefore forced to conclude that this represents an intrinsic property of both the expressed protein and the parent MI130.The simplest explanation of the biphasic nature of the ATP-induced dissociation is that the protein exists in two forms: one to which ATP can bind readily (at an apparent second order rate constant of 5.3 × 104m−1s−1 in the presence of Ca2+) and the other, which cannot bind ATP without first isomerizing. One possible model is shown in Fig. 5, where the nucleotide pocket must open before nucleotide can bind. (In this model, we have assumed a direct link between the opening of the nucleotide pocket and an ADP-induced structural change, i.e.“wagging” of the myosin neck; see below.) The rate constant for the opening of the pocket is very similar to the net rate constant of ADP dissociation suggesting a similar process limits ADP release ( k +α = k +αD = 8 s−1, Fig. 5). From the data presented in Figs. 1 and 2, we can define the rate and equilibrium constants of each of the transitions shown in Fig.5. The assignment of the constants is described in the legend to Fig.5, and the values are listed in TableII.Figure 5Proposed model depicting the isomerization of the nucleotide-binding pocket that must occur before ATP or ADP can bind or ADP can be released. The conformational change is represented as a swing of the converter domain of the myosin head with respect to the actin binding domain, which is coupled to the accessibility of the nucleotide binding pocket. The data in Figs. 1 and2 allow assignment of all of the rate and equilibrium constants. Analysis of the amplitudes of the ATP-induced dissociation reaction in the presence of Ca2+ shows a 60:30 ratio of the two forms. This ratio defines the equilibrium constant between the two forms of A·M, K α, with a value of ∼2.5. Since k +α = 8 s−1(the slow phase of ATP binding) and K α = k +α/ k −α, then k −α = 3.2 s−1. In the absence of Ca2+, the amplitudes of the two phases are similar, consistent with the equilibrium lying closer to the closed form of A·M with K α = 1–2 and since k +α = 3.4 s−1, k −α is unchanged by Ca2+ at 3–4 s−1. Since (i) the rate constant of ADP dissociation from A·M·D ( k +αD) and the rate constant of the isomerization of A·M ( k +α) are similar and (ii) they are both reduced 2–3-fold on removal of Ca2+, it suggests that the two events are closely related and may represent the same isomerization of the A·M complex as shown. The displacement of ADP from A·M occurs in a single phase and suggests little occupancy of A·M′·D; therefore, in both the presence and absence of Ca2+, K αD ≤ 0.1. The affinity of ADP for the complex, K AD, is defined by K ADP· K αDand has a value of 10 μm in the presence of Ca2+ and 3 μm in the absence of Ca2+. Although K ADP and K αD are not defined individually, K αD is k +αD/ k −αDand therefore K AD= K ADP· k +αD/ k −αDor, after rearranging, k −αD/ K ADP= k +αD/ K AD. Since k +αD has a value of 8 s−1 (+Ca2+) and 3.4 s−1 (−Ca2+), the apparent ADP on rate, k −αD/ K ADP, has a value of 0.8 × 10−6m−1 s−1in the presence of Ca2+ or 1.1 × 10−6m−1in the absence of Ca2+. This is in good agreement with the directly measured values and is independent of calcium. In this interpretation the rate of the conformational change giving access to the site is Ca2+-dependent but independent of ADP bound to the pocket, whereas reversal of the conformational change is ADP-dependent and Ca2+-independent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIDerived rate and equilibrium constants for the reaction scheme of Fig. 5K αk +αk −αK αDk +αDk −αD/ K ADPK ADPs −1s −1s −1μm −1 s −1μm+Ca2+2–383–4≤0.180.8≥100−Ca2+1–23.43–4≤0.13.41.1≥30 Open table in a new tab The evidence points toward a significant proportion (∼30%) of the conformation with a closed nucleotide pocket being present in the absence of nucleotide. By increasing the rate constant of pocket closing, ADP causes almost all of the myosin I to be in the closed pocket form. In contrast, the presence of Ca2+ increases the proportion of the open pocket form by increasing the rate of the opening of the pocket in both the presence and absence of ADP. In terms of nucleotide binding, Ca2+ lowers the affinity of A·MI for ADP by increasing the net rate constant of ADP release ( k +αD). Ca2+ also increases the rate of ATP-induced dissociation of actin ( k +2, Scheme I and Table I) from A·MI, but does not affect the affinity of ATP for A·MI ( K 1). Thus, Ca2+ can stimulate the detachment of actin from A·MI·D by increasing the rate of ADP release and the rate of the subsequent dissociation by ATP. Note, however, that the effects of Ca2+ are small (in all cases, values do not differ by more than a factor of 3) and therefore probably do not represent an on/off switch but rather a modulator of activity.At physiological nucleotide concentrations of 1 mm ATP and 10–50 μm ADP, the net rates of nucleotide binding to A·MI will be 18 s−1 for ATP and 10–50 s−1 for ADP in the absence of Ca2+. Thus, the A·MI that has released ADP is as likely to rebind ADP as to bind ATP. The low efficiency for binding ATP and detaching from actin supports our proposal that myosin I is designed for tension maintenance not motility (7.Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21575-21580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The presence of Ca2+ increases the net rate of ATP binding ( K 1 k +2) but does not alter the rate of ADP rebinding k −αD/ K ADP.The possibility that myosin I exists in two conformational states, as shown by the kinetic evidence presented here, is of great interest since an isomerization of A·MI·D can be responsible for the second displacement seen in laser trap assays for MI130, brush border myosin I (6.Veigel C. Coluccio L.M. Jontes J.D. Sparrow J.C. Milligan R.A. Molloy J.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), a close relative to MI130, and smooth muscle myosin S1 (smS1) (20.Veigel C. Kendrick-Jones J. Sellers J.R. Sparrow J.C. Molloy J.E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A145Google Scholar). It is also required for the structural changes or “tail wagging” seen in three-dimensional reconstructions from electron micrographs for some actomyosins including brush border myosin I and smS1 (9.Jontes J.D. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Milligan R.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 21.Whittaker M. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Smith J.E. Faust L. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1995; 378: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). If our assignment is correct, then the identified isomerization provides a direct link between the accessibility of nucleotide to its binding pocket and the mechanical transient and lends strong support for the role of nucleotide release in providing a strain-sensing mechanism (22.Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We previously argued that a MI cross-bridge bearing the typical isometric tension could have ADP release reduced up to 100-fold. In the current model, the strain would act directly on the isomerization shown in Fig. 5. Any load or strain on the cross-bridge would inhibit the swing of the tail against the load. The effect would be to reduce k +αDand hence K α.The Ca2+ sensitivity of the A·MI isomerization also establishes a link between the binding of Ca2+ (presumably to the remaining calmodulin), and the biochemical, structural, and mechanical events discussed above. If the protein isomerization is a mechanical sensor that slows down the rates of both ADP release and ATP binding in the presence of strain, then the effect of Ca2+may be far more dramatic for a head bearing strain. Ca2+could act on the strained head by binding to calmodulin to alter the elasticity of the calmodulin-IQ complex and so reduce the strain leading to acceleration of the isomerization, ADP release, and cross-bridge detachment. The other 5 calmodulin-IQ domains could also contribute to the Ca2+-assisted release of strain if they are elastically distorted in a strained cross-bridge. All that is required is for the Ca2+-induced change in calmodulin conformation to alter the rest length of each calmodulin-IQ domain such that the strain on a A·MI·D head is modulated. It has previously been noted that Ca2+ binding reduces the affinity of calmodulin for the IQ domain but probably not enough to cause calmodulin dissociation at cellular concentrations of calmodulin.A remaining question about the A·MI conformation is its relation to conformational changes in MI alone and t"
https://openalex.org/W1979302622,"Recently we have reported that the membrane-associated form of the γ-aminobutyric acid-synthesizing enzyme, l-glutamate decarboxylase (MGAD), is regulated by the vesicular proton gradient (Hsu, C. C., Thomas, C., Chen, W., Davis, K. M., Foos, T., Chen, J. L., Wu, E., Floor, E., Schloss, J. V., and Wu, J. Y. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 24366–24371). In this report, several lines of evidence are presented to indicate that l-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) can become membrane-associated to synaptic vesicles first through complex formation with the heat shock protein 70 family, specifically heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70), followed by interaction with cysteine string protein (CSP), an integral protein of the synaptic vesicle. The first line of evidence comes from purification of MGAD in which HSC70, as identified from amino acid sequencing, co-purified with GAD. Second, in reconstitution studies, HSC70 was found to form complex with GAD65 as shown by gel mobility shift in non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Third, in immunoprecipitation studies, again, HSC70 was co-immunoprecipitated with GAD by a GAD65-specific monoclonal antibody. Fourth, HSC70 and CSP were co-purified with GAD by specific anti-GAD immunoaffinity columns. Furthermore, studies here suggest that both GAD65 and GAD67 are associated with synaptic vesicles along with HSC70 and CSP. Based on these findings, a model is proposed to link anchorage of MGAD to synaptic vesicles in relation to its role in γ-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission.

Kuriyama K. Brain Res. 1968; 8: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). There are two well characterized GAD isoforms in the brain, namely GAD65 and GAD67, referring to GAD with molecular masses of 65 and 67 kDa, respectively (for review, see Ref.2.Erlander M.G. Tobin A.J. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). GAD67 is mostly soluble and is distributed evenly throughout the cell, whereas GAD65 is concentrated at the nerve terminals (3.Kaufman D.L. Houser C.R. Tobin A.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) and constitutes the majority of the membrane-associated GAD (MGAD) (4.Christgau S. Schierbeck H. Aanstoot H.J. Aagaard L.

Despite its importance, our knowledge regarding the regulation of GAD activity is quite limited. Recently, we have shown that soluble GAD (SGAD) is activated by dephosphorylation, mediated by a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, and is inhibited by phosphorylation, mediated by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (6.Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7.Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6464-6467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Conversely, MGAD is activated by protein phosphorylation, which depends on the integrity of the electrochemical gradient of synaptic vesicles (5.Hsu C.C. Thomas C. Chen W. Davis K.M. Foos T.

Hence, GAD activity appears to be regulated differently depending on whether it exists as a soluble or membrane-anchored protein. Judging from the amino acid sequences, it is unlikely that GAD65and/or GAD67 can be integral membrane components, since neither contains a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids long enough to span the membrane (greater than 20 residues), a typical feature for integral membrane proteins. Furthermore, both isoforms lack the appropriate consensus sequences for the attachment of GAD to membranes through fatty acylation via esterification, orN-myristoylation (2.Erlander M.G. Tobin A.J. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Now evidence is presented here to show that GAD can become membrane-associated through interactions with a member of the heat shock protein 70 family, heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70), which is then anchored to synaptic vesicles through interactions with an intrinsic synaptic vesicle protein, cysteine string protein (CSP). In addition, a model is also proposed to show the anchoring mechanism of GAD to synaptic vesicles and a functional link between GABA synthesis and vesicular GABA transport at the nerve terminals. Fresh porcine brains were obtained from a local abattoir. Bovine brain HSC70 and biotinylated HSC70 were obtained fromStressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Collegeville, PA). Anti-GAD65 and anti-GAD67 are polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against recombinant human GAD67(HGAD67) and human GAD65 (HGAD65) expressed in separate bacterial systems (8.Davis K.M. Foos T. Bates C.S. Tucker E. Hsu C.C. Chen W.Q. Jin H. Tyburski J.B. Schloss J.V. Tobin A. Wu J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Subtype-specific polyclonal antibodies of GAD65 and GAD67 were prepared by preadsorbing anti-HGAD65 serum with an excess of recombinant HGAD67 to remove GAD67-specific antibodies. Similarly, the specific anti-HGAD67 serum was obtained by pretreatment of anti-HGAD67 serum with an excess of recombinant HGAD65 as described previously (8.Davis K.M. Foos T. Bates C.S. Tucker E. Hsu C.C. Chen W.Q. Jin H. Tyburski J.B. Schloss J.V. Tobin A. Wu J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GAD6, a GAD65-specific monoclonal antibody, was purchased from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-HSP70 sera were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-CSP rabbit sera were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Benzethonium hydroxide (hyamine base, 1 m solution in methanol), pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), 2-aminoethylisothiuronium bromide (AET), dithiothreitol, ATP, AMP-PNP, Nycodenz, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma. Ceramic hydroxylapatite, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, tetramethylenediamine, ammonium persulfate, β-mercaptoethanol, and protein assay kit were purchased from Bio-Rad. [l-14C]Glutamic acid was purchased from NEN Life Science Products, and Western-Lite Plus immunodetection kit was purchased from Tropix Inc. (Bedford, MA). HiTrap protein A columns,N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose columns, and ECL reagent were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were of the purest grade commercially available. GAD was assayed by a radiometric method measuring the formation of 14CO2 from [l-14C]glutamic acid as described previously (9.Wu J.Y. Denner L.A. Wei S.C. Lin C.T. Song G.X. Xu Y.F. Liu J.W. Lin H.S. Brain Res. 1986; 373: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Unless mentioned otherwise, all purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C, and in standard GAD buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm AET, 0.2 mm PLP at pH 7.2. In a typical preparation, a 15% (w/v) porcine brain homogenate was made with a glass-Teflon homogenizer in standard GAD buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmtheophylline. Preparation of crude synaptosomes was performed as described previously (6.Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7.Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6464-6467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh porcine brains were homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose (w/v, 15 g/100 ml), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and the nuclear fraction. The post-nuclear supernatant solution was centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet thus obtained was the crude synaptosomal fraction referred to as P2. Purification of MGAD was conducted, as described previously with slight modifications (10.Nathan B. Hsu C.C. Bao J. Wu R. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7249-7254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Nathan B. Bao J. Hsu C.C. Yarom M. Deupree D.L. Lee Y.H. Tang X.W. Kuo C.Y. Burghen G.A. Wu J.Y.

A. 1994; 91: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The P2 fraction obtained from the preceding step was first lysed in GAD buffer, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The liquid thus obtained was referred to as supernatant (S1). The resulting pellet, P2M, was solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in standard GAD buffer solution. The solubilized MGAD was further purified through conventional column chromatography consisting of an anion exchange (DEAE-52), an adsorption (ceramic hydroxylapatite), and a gel filtration column (Sephadex G-200). In addition to the conventional column procedures, MGAD was also purified by anti-GAD immunoaffinity column as described previously (13.Wu J.Y. Su Y.Y.T. Lam D.M.K. Schousboe A. Chude O. Res. Methods Neurochem. 1981; 5: 129-177Crossref Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Specific anti-GAD IgG was prepared from anti-GAD sera using protein A column chromatography. Briefly, anti-GAD sera were first loaded on protein A columns, followed by washing with eight column volumes of buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7. The column was then eluted with six column volumes of buffer containing 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 3.0. Fractions were neutralized to pH 7.0 with pre-titrated amount of 1n NaOH. Anti-GAD IgG thus purified was coupled toN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-GAD IgG immunoaffinity columns were then used for purification of GAD and GAD-associated protein complex as detailed in the following section. Recombinant human brain GAD65 and GAD67, referred to as HGAD65 and HGAD67, respectively, were prepared as described recently (8.Davis K.M. Foos T. Bates C.S. Tucker E. Hsu C.C. Chen W.Q. Jin H. Tyburski J.B. Schloss J.V. Tobin A. Wu J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, HGADs were overexpressed in DH5α Escherichia coli, which were transformed with either a HGAD65 or HGAD67 recombinant pGEX-3X plasmid, as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. GST-HGAD fusion proteins were first purified by glutathione affinity column chromatography, followed by cleavage of the fusion proteins with factor Xa. Final purification of free HGAD65 and HGAD67 were achieved using repetitive glutathione affinity columns (8.Davis K.M. Foos T. Bates C.S. Tucker E. Hsu C.C. Chen W.Q. Jin H. Tyburski J.B. Schloss J.V. Tobin A. Wu J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Biotinylated bovine HSC70 (2 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with either HGAD65 (2 μg) or HGAD67 (2 μg) in a final volume of 10 μl of 50 mm Tris-citrate (pH 7.2). The resulting protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on 5–25% NG-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Running conditions were modified from the procedure described previously (14.Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4270-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One volume of the protein sample was mixed with two volume of sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 500 mg/ml glycerol, and 2.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue. The samples were loaded on to a stacking gel, containing 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% acrylamide/bisacrylamide. The separating gel contained a 5–25% gradient of acrylamide/bisacrylamide with 1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. Electrophoresis was carried out for 8 h at 150 V of constant voltage in a running buffer consisting of 50 mmTris and 200 mm glycine at pH 8.8, followed by transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Complexes of biotinylated HSP70 and GAD proteins on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were visualized either with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin using Western-Lite Plus (Tropix Inc.) or by isoform-specific anti-GAD antibody and the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Synaptic vesicles were purified from rat brains as described previously (15.Floor E. Feist B.E. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1433-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, synaptic vesicles isolated from the microsomal fraction by density gradient (10–30% Nycodenz gradient) centrifugation were further purified sequentially on Sephacryl S-1000 and CPG-3000 size-exclusion columns in buffer consisting of 0.16 m KCl, 5 mm NaHPO4, pH 6.6, 1 mm EGTA, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and saturated (∼1 μm) 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl ether. Final purification was achieved by equilibrium centrifugation at 100,000 × g on a 4–26% gradient of Ficoll (M r ∼ 400,000). Five hundred microliters of Triton X-100-solubilized and partially purified MGAD preparations from porcine brain P2M sample were used as the starting material for immunoprecipitation. GAD samples (500 μl) were first precleared by incubation with 100 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. The supernatant solutions obtained after centrifugation at 1000 × g for 3 min were then incubated with 50 μl of anti-GAD65 monoclonal antibody, GAD6, at 4 °C for 12 h. Protein A-Sepharose (50 μl) was added to each mixture and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 3 min. The resulting pellet was then washed six times in standard GAD buffer. Both the supernatant and pellet were assayed for GAD activity to ensure presence of GAD in the pellet. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-HSP70. Quantitative densitometry analyses of immunoblots were made with the Quantity One™ imaging densitometer (model GS-700; Bio-Rad). Anti-GAD65 and anti-GAD67immunoaffinity columns as described in the preceding section were used to purify GAD-associated protein complex, using crude brain extracts of S1 and solubilized P2M fraction. In a typical experiment, 80 ml of S1 or P2M extract (2 mg/ml) in Tris-citrate buffer (50 mm Tris-citrate, pH 7.0, 1 mmphenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium floride, and 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm AET, 0.2 mmPLP) was recirculated into 1 ml of anti-GAD65 or anti-GAD67 immunoaffinity column at 4 °C for 8 h. The columns were washed with 80 column volumes of the same Tris-citrate buffer, except that the concentration of Tris-citrate was increased to 500 mm. The columns were further eluted with eight column volumes (8 ml) of elution buffer containing 0.1 m citric acid, pH 3.0, at 4 °C. A titrated amount of 1 n NaOH solution was placed in the collecting tubes to neutralize and bring the pH up to 7.0 immediately after each collection. Protein concentration in each fraction was monitored at 280 nm. The fractions containing the highest protein concentration were then pooled (∼ 3 ml) and dialyzed twice with 1 liter of 5 mm Tris-citrate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm AET and 0.2 mm PLP at 4 °C. The dialyzed samples were concentrated with a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Inc.) to 500 μl and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots with anti-HSP70 as well as anti-CSP. Mixtures of 2 μl of highly purified HGAD65 (1 μg/μl), 2 μl of HSC70 (1 μg/μl), and/or 5 μl of highly purified synaptic vesicles were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with constant agitation. At the end of the incubation, the entire mixture was transferred to a test tube and GAD activity was determined. Unless mentioned otherwise, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gels) was carried out under reducing conditions with the presence of 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer. The running conditions of SDS-PAGE were followed as described by Laemmli (16.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting test was conducted as described (6.Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7.Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6464-6467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, blotting was carried out at 4 °C for 18 h in a LKB 2005 transfer unit containing 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.192 m glycine, 0.5% SDS, and 20% methanol followed by overnight incubation with primary antibody at 4 °C and 2 h of secondary antibody incubation in room temperature. Immunocomplex was visualized using Western-Light Plus or ECL reagents. Quantitative densitometry analyses of the Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands of SDS-polyacrylamide gels were made with the Quantity One™ imaging densitometer (model GS-700; Bio-Rad). Highly purified MGAD preparation was digested with trypsin, followed by separation of tryptic peptides on a C18 reverse column using high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (17.Gu Z.W. Xie Y.H. Yang M. Sparrow J.T. Wang K. Li Y. Li W.H. Gotto Jr., A.M. Yang C.Y. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Selected peptides were then sequenced for 10–15 Edman degradation cycles on a Precise Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Protein sequence alignment was performed using the BLAST program, with searches of the SwissProt data bank. The protein pattern of partially purified MGAD fractions after hydroxylapatite column chromatography is shown in Fig.1 A. During purification of MGAD, two proteins at the approximate molecular mass of 67 kDa were found to correlate with GAD activity (Fig. 1 B) throughout the purification steps as shown in the highlighted box of Fig. 1 A and lane 1 of Fig.2. Partial amino acid sequencing identified HSC70 as a major constituent of these protein bands with the following sequence: HWPFVVVNDAGRPK, which matched in 13 out of 14 amino acid residues to the 89HWPFMVVNDAGRPK102stretch of HSC70 amino acid sequence that is analogously present across species of murine, human, and bovine. In addition, immunoblotting tests with anti-HSP70 (Fig. 2, lane 2), GAD6 (Fig. 2,lane 3), and anti-GAD67 indicate that the higher band contained both HSP70 and GAD67, whereas the lower band contains GAD65. These immunoblots also illustrate that no cross-reactivity was detected between antibodies of HSC70 and GAD65. Thus, these results indicate that HSC70, GAD65, and GAD67 are membrane-associated and may constitute a protein complex in vitro.Figure 2Protein analysis of highly purified MGAD preparation by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots using specific antibodies to HSP70 and GAD65. The fraction containing the highest GAD activity was obtained after three columns, namely DEAE-52, ceramic hydroxylapatite, and Sephadex G-200. Lane 1, protein pattern showing the presence of dual bands at around the approximate molecular mass of 67 kDa, as indicated by Coomassie Blue staining on SDS-polyacrylamide gel; lane 2, immunoblotting with anti-HSP70 showing the presence of HSP70;lane 3, immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-GAD65 indicating the presence of GAD65;lane 4, immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-GAD67 indicating the presence of both GAD65 and GAD67. These results reveal co-purification of HSC70 and isoforms of GAD65 and GAD67, as identified by a polyclonal anti-HSP70 (lane 2), a monoclonal anti-GAD65antibody (lane 3), and a polyclonal anti-GAD67 (lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate the possible protein interaction between HSC70, GAD65, and GAD67, we utilized reconstitution assays using purified HGAD65, HGAD67, and purified HSC70 (∼90% pure). The HSC70·HGAD complexes were separated from free HSC70 and HGAD by NG-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot. Results in Fig. 3(lanes 2 and 3) show the formation of protein complex between HGAD65 and HSC70, as indicated by the parallel gel mobility shift of HSP70·HGAD complex, recognized by GAD6 and the biotin-labeled HSC70. Without HSC70, GAD65migrated to a lower molecular weight position in the gel (Fig. 3,lane 1). HGAD67 and HSC70 do not form a protein complex and thus do not share this parallel shift in gel mobility (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). Unlike GAD65, the mobility of GAD67 in the gel is unaffected by the addition of HSC70 (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). In addition, lack of immunostaining by anti-GAD67 at the position of HSC70 (Fig. 3,lane 5) indicates that no cross-reactivity was detected between anti-GAD67 and HSC70. These results suggest the possibility of protein complex formation specifically between HSC70 and HGAD65, but not between HSC70 and HGAD67. If GAD65 does indeed form a protein complex with HSC70, one would expect the antibodies recognizing GAD65 to also immunoprecipitate HSC70. Indeed, the GAD65-specific monoclonal antibody, GAD6 (18.Chang Y.C. Gottlieb D.I. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was able to immunoprecipitate GAD65 in a highly purified porcine brain MGAD preparation. Under stringent washing conditions, the presence of HSC70 in the GAD·anti-GAD65 immunoprecipitate was detected, as visualized by immunoreactivity to polyclonal anti-HSP70 (Fig. 4, lane C). To determine whether GAD65, GAD67, HSC70, and CSP are present on synaptic vesicles, highly purified synaptic vesicle preparations devoid of soluble proteins (15.Floor E. Feist B.E. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1433-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were probed with various antibodies on immunoblots. As shown in Fig. 5 (lane 1), a protein band at the position of CSP is strongly stained with anti-CSP polyclonal antibodies, although a few other protein bands are also visible. Anti-HSP70 identified a single protein band at the position corresponding to a molecular mass at about 67 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 2). Anti-GAD65 and anti-GAD67 preadsorbed by respective antigens recognized single bands representing specific isoforms of GAD65 and GAD67 (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and4), whereas the non-preadsorbed anti-GAD65 and GAD67 polyclonal antibodies revealed both bands as well as an occasional lower band at a molecular mass range of 60–67 kDa (results not shown). The identity of GAD65 was further confirmed by GAD6, which stained a protein band (Fig. 5,lane 5) at the same position as indicated by the preadsorbed GAD65 antibodies (Fig. 5, lane 3). These results clearly indicate the presence or association of GAD65, GAD67, HSC70, and CSP with synaptic vesicles. Since the E. coli system in general does not share similar posttranslational modifications with mammalian cells, it would be of interest to see whether recombinant HGAD65 and HGAD67 can also form protein complexes with the bacterial homologue of HSC70, DnaK (19.Boice J.A. Hightower L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24825-24831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, both GST-HGAD65 and GST-HGAD67 fusion proteins purified by GSH affinity columns (8.Davis K.M. Foos T. Bates C.S. Tucker E. Hsu C.C. Chen W.Q. Jin H. Tyburski J.B. Schloss J.V. Tobin A. Wu J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) contain GAD and DnaK as indicated by positive identification in immunoblotting tests using specific anti-HSP70 and anti-GAD sera. Because the difference of the molecular masses between GAD65, GAD67, and HSC70 is small, the larger proteins, namely GST-GAD65 and GST-GAD67 fusion proteins (91–93 kDa), were specifically used in immunoblots to show clear separation of these proteins and the lack of cross-reactivity between anti-HSC70 antibodies and GST-GADs. As shown in Fig. 6, no immunostaining was observed by anti-HSP70 at the gel position corresponding to GST-GAD67 (Fig. 6,lane 2) and GST-GAD65 (Fig. 6,lane 4), thus indicating the lack of cross-reactivity between either anti-HSP70 and GST-GAD67 or GST-GAD65. Protein complexes of GAD, HSC70, and CSP were isolated from crude brain subcellular extracts of S1 and P2M using anti-GAD65 and anti-GAD67 immunoaffinity columns. The conditions used were of high stringency to prevent nonspecific protein binding during the affinity column purification. The columns were washed extensively with high salt buffer solution after application of the brain extract. The results showed that the GAD preparations purified by anti-GAD immunoaffinity columns also contain HSC70 and CSP in addition to GAD (Fig. 7). This suggest that HSC70 and CSP form a protein complex with GAD and hence were co-purified by the anti-GAD immunoaffinity columns. Retention of HSC70 was observed in all S1 and P2M fractions, suggesting that GAD·HSC70 complex is soluble as well as membrane-anchored. Slight retention of GAD65 in the anti-GAD67 columns and GAD67 in the anti-GAD65 columns was observed in both S1 and P2M fractions as indicated by immunoblotting tests. 2C.-C. Hsu, K. M. Davis, H. Jin, T. Foos, E. Floor, W. Chen, J. B. Tyburski, C.-Y. Yang, J. V. Schloss, and J.-Y. Wu, unpublished results. These results showed that both GAD65 and GAD67 are present as soluble as well as the membrane-bound forms. Interestingly, quantitative analysis of these immunoblots indicated that GAD65 protein is roughly distributed equally between the soluble and membrane fractions, whereas GAD67 protein is present largely (∼80%) as soluble form. Although the crucial amino acid sequences involved in membrane anchoring of GAD65 have been determined (20.Shi Y. Veit B. Baekkeskov S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the nature of membrane association of GAD67 remains largely uncharacterized. One hypothesis is that the membrane association characteristic of GAD67 is due to the heterodimer formation of GAD67 to the membrane-associated GAD65 (21.Dirkx Jr., R. Thomas A. Li L. Lernmark A. Sherwin R.S. De Camilli P. Solimena M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2241-2246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22.Kanaani J. Lissin D. Kash S.F. Baekkeskov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37200-37209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Judging by the intensity of the CSP band on immunoblots, most CSP retained by the affinity columns is present in the membrane fractions (Fig. 7,lanes 2 and 4) with slight retention of CSP in the S1 fractions by anti-GAD65 affinity column (Fig. 7, lane 1). It is unlikely that anti-GAD65 and anti-GAD67 may cross-react with HSC70 or CSP, since the results shown in Figs. 5 and 6 clearly indicate the lack of immunostaining between anti-GAD65 as well as anti-GAD67 with either HSC70 or CSP. Therefore, the retention of HSC70 (Fig. 7, lanes 5–8) and CSP by anti-GAD immunoaffinity columns is the result of protein-protein interaction between GAD, HSC70, and CSP. To assess the effect of protein-protein interaction on GAD activity, reconstitution experiments were conducted using purified HGAD65, purified HSC70, and highly purified synaptic vesicle preparations, which have been shown to retain electrochemical proton gradient (23.Floor E. Leventhal P.S. Wang Y. Meng L. Chen W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24.Wang Y. Floor E. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 180: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Since synaptic vesicles and HSC70 alone do not contain detectable GAD activity (Fig.8, lanes 1 and2), it is interesting to note that GAD65activity is markedly increased by incubation with either HSC70 (Fig. 8,lane 6), or synaptic vesicles (Fig. 8,lane 5), as well as HSC70 together with synaptic vesicles (Fig. 8, lane 7). Bovine serum albumin, which was included as control protein, showed no effect on GAD activity (Fig. 8, lane 4). These observations are compatible with our hypothesis that GAD65 is anchored to synaptic vesicles through HSC70 and its activity is increased through an electrochemical proton gradient-mediated process (5.Hsu C.C. Thomas C. Chen W. Davis K.M. Foos T. Chen J.L. Wu E. Floor E. Schloss J.V. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24366-24371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the formation of protein complex between GAD65 and HSC70 as indicated by co-purification (Figs. 2 and 7), reconstitution assay (Fig. 3), and co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4) may induce conformational changes on the GAD65 favorable to its stability and catalytic activity. Since the structures of various isoforms of GAD have been determined (for review, see Ref. 2.Erlander M.G. Tobin A.J. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), it becomes clear that, in general, GAD is not an integral membrane protein due to lack of a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids long enough to span the membrane. Nevertheless, some populations of both GAD65 and GAD67 are still firmly anchored to membranes despite various ionic extraction methods (20.Shi Y. Veit B. Baekkeskov S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21.Dirkx Jr., R. Thomas A. Li L. Lernmark A. Sherwin R.S. De Camilli P. Solimena M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37200-37209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). GAD can interact with membranes by ionic or hydrophobic mechanisms. Fonnum (25.Fonnum F. Biochem. J. 1968; 106: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) reported that GAD could become associated with membrane in the presence of Ca2+. Martin and Martin (26.Martin D.L. Martin S.B. J. Neurochem. 1982; 39: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have shown that apoGAD has a strong affinity for polyanions, e.g. hexasulfate, and thus may be anchored to synaptic vesicles through ionic interactions, since the cytoplasmic face of synaptic vesicles is enriched in acidic phospholipids (27.Westhead E.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 493: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, Chang and Gottlieb (18.Chang Y.C. Gottlieb D.I. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that 60% of GAD is membrane bound and can be released only with detergent (e.g.0.2% Triton X-100) but not with high salt, e.g. 1m NaCl or 1 m KCl, suggesting that the interaction between GAD and membranes is predominantly hydrophobic. Subsequent studies attempting to characterize this hydrophobic interaction included studies in palmitoylation as a membrane anchorage mechanism of GAD65 (28.Christgau S. Aanstoot H.J. Schierbeck H. Begley K. Tullin S. Hejnaes K. Baekkeskov S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, a more recent study showed that palmitoylation is not required for anchoring GAD65 to membranes since mutation of amino acids involved in palmitoylation has no effect on membrane anchorage (20.Shi Y. Veit B. Baekkeskov S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recent efforts in elucidating the membrane association mechanism of GAD by protein phosphorylation (29.Namchuk M. Lindsay L. Turck C.W. Kanaani J. Baekkeskov S. J. Biol.

Still, the mechanism of GAD anchorage to membranes and synaptic vesicles and its effect on GAD activity remains unclear. Besides a direct interaction with membranes as discussed above, proteins can also become membrane-anchored through chaperone proteins. One example is the 70-kDa family of heat shock proteins (HSP70), which have been shown to serve as molecular chaperons in promoting protein folding and facilitating protein transport to intracellular organelles, including mitochondria, nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes (30.Kiang J.G. Tsokos G.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 31.Sriram M. Osipiuk J. Freeman B. Morimoto R. Joachimiak A.

The ubiquitous binding partners of HSP70 include a wide range of unfolded peptides as well as native proteins. Two native proteins found in the nerve terminal that bind with the constitutively expressed member of the heat shock protein 70 family, HSC70, are the clathrin triskelions of coated vesicles (33.Black M.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31420-31426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this study, several lines of evidence are presented to support the hypothesis that GAD can become membrane-associated or anchored to synaptic vesicles through protein complex formation first with HSC70, followed by protein-protein interaction involving GAD·HSC70 complex and CSP on synaptic vesicles. The first line of evidence comes from purification of MGAD in which HSC70, as identified from amino acid sequencing, co-purified with GAD. Second, in reconstitution studies, HSC70 was found to form a complex with GAD65 as shown in gel shift mobility in NG- PAGE. Third, in immunoprecipitation studies, again, HSC70 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with GAD by a GAD65-specific monoclonal antibody. Fourth, HSC70 and CSP were co-purified with GAD by specific anti-GAD immunoaffinity columns. In light of our previous findings that MGAD is activated by protein phosphorylation, which depends on the integrity of the proton gradient on synaptic vesicles and is inhibited by dephosphorylation (5.Hsu C.C. Thomas C. Chen W. Davis K.M. Foos T. Chen J.L. Wu E. Floor E. Schloss J.V. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24366-24371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas SGAD is activated by dephosphorylation and inhibited by phosphorylation (6.Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7.Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6464-6467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the physiological significance of GAD association to synaptic vesicles and its activation by interaction with HSC70 and synaptic vesicles can be summarized in Fig. 9. Once GABAergic neurons are stimulated, GABA is released by exocytosis (➁). Synaptic vesicles are then retrieved through coated vesicle formation. Clathrin-coated pits are then dissociated from vesicles through interaction with HSC70 (➀). The uncoated synaptic vesicles thus replenish their proton gradient through action of the vacuolar proton pump (V-ATPase) (③). Once the vesicular proton gradient is restored, MGAD, which is anchored to synaptic vesicles through HSC70 and CSP is activated by membrane-bound protein kinase (④). Newly synthesized GABA is then transported into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular GABA transporter to replenish vesicular GABA (⑤). In addition, activation of the GABA neurons triggers the influx of Ca2+ into the terminals (⑦), which activates calcineurin (PrP 2B) (⑧), and results in increased GABA synthesis by SGAD. GABA synthesized by SGAD may also be transported into synaptic vesicles (⑨) or be catabolized by GABA-transaminase to provide ATP (❶), which may be utilized by V-ATPase to maintain the proton gradient on synaptic vesicles, a condition favoring GABA synthesis by MGAD and GABA transport by vesicular GABA transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1987435789,"The sequences of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) flavin domains closely resemble that of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), with the exception of a few regions. One such region is the C terminus; all NOS isoforms are 20–40 amino acids longer than CPR, forming a ""tail"" that is absent in CPR. To investigate its function, we removed the 21-amino acid C-terminal tail from murine macrophage inducible NOS (iNOS) holoenzyme and from a flavin domain construct. Both the truncated holoenzyme and reductase domain exhibited cytochrome <i>c</i> reductase activities that were 7–10-fold higher than the nontruncated forms. The truncated holoenzyme catalyzed NO formation approximately 20% faster than the intact form. Using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, we demonstrated that electron transfer into and between the two flavins and from the flavin to the heme domain is 2–5-fold faster in the absence of the C-terminal tail. The heme-nitrosyl complex, formed in all NOS isoforms during NO catalysis, is 5-fold less stable in truncated iNOS. Although both CPR and intact NOS can exist in a stable, one electron-reduced semiquinone form, neither the truncated holoenzyme nor the truncated flavin domain demonstrate such a form. We propose that this C-terminal tail curls back to interact with the flavin domain in such a way as to modulate the interaction between the two flavin moieties."

The activator protein-1 and runt domain binding sites bind members of the activator protein-1 and core-binding factor family of transcription factors, respectively. We identified core-binding factor a1 binding to the runt domain binding site and JunD in addition to a Fos-related antigen binding to the activator protein-1 site.

Genomics. 1997; 40: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The expression of collagenase-3 is regulated by both bone-resorbing and bone-forming agents. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been shown to increase both collagenase-3 mRNA (18Scott D.K. Brakenhoff K.D. Clohisy J.C. Quinn C.O. Partridge N.C. Mol.

In contrast, agents that promote bone formation, such as bone morphogenetic proteins and insulin-like growth factors decrease collagenase-3 mRNA expression in rat osteoblast cultures (23Gazzerro E.

Although collagenase-3 has been implicated in processes involving both normal and pathological remodeling of bone, little is known about the mechanisms involved in the regulation of this gene during development. Earlier studies in rat osteoblasts showed that collagenase-3 gene expression is minimal in proliferating osteoblasts but continues to increase in basal expression as matrix maturation and mineralization of the extracellular matrix progresses (27Shalhoub V. Conlon D. Tassinari M. Quinn C. Partridge N. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 28Winchester S.K. Bloch S.R. Fiacco G.J.

In order to analyze the developmental expression of the collagenase-3 gene, we chose to use normal, differentiating osteoblasts. Our laboratory and others have shown that normal osteoblasts in culture follow a similar pattern of development as osteoblasts in vivo (27Shalhoub V. Conlon D. Tassinari M. Quinn C. Partridge N. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that the developmental increase in collagenase-3 gene expression is the result of an increase in collagenase-3 gene transcription, showing that the collagenase-3 gene is not transcribed until osteoblasts have ceased proliferation. Similar to studies in other systems (22Uria J.A. Jimenez M.G. Balbin M. Freije J.M.P. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol.

However, our studies suggest a new and different role in the regulation of collagenase-3 promoter activity by AP-1 transcription factors. Through overexpression studies, we show that although c-Fos and c-Jun can synergistically increase collagenase-3 promoter activity in the presence of Cbfa1, Fra-2 and JunD repress Cbfa1-induced collagenase-3 promoter activity. This suggests that AP-1 proteins can have both inductive and repressive effects on collagenase-3 promoter activity. Parathyroid hormone (rat PTH 1–34) was purchased from Sigma.

Osteoblasts were derived from postnatal day 1 rat calvariae by sequential digestions of 20, 40, and 90 min at 37 °C in 2 mg/ml collagenase A, 0.25% trypsin. Cells from digests one and two were discarded. Cells from the third digest were plated at 6.4 × 103 cells/cm2 and grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After reaching confluence (day 7), the medium was switched to BGJb with 10% FBS containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate to allow for initiation of mineralization. Medium changes were performed every 2 days. Osteoblasts at various stages of development were treated with either 2% FBS/MEM or 10−8m PTH in 2% FBS/MEM for 4 h. Cells were rinsed once with 10 ml of cold (4 °C) PBS, pH 7.4, and harvested. Total RNA was isolated using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini kit. Ten μg of each sample was electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel in 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA at 80 V. The gel was transferred overnight to a Nytran filter and UV-cross-linked using a Stratalinker. The filter was prehybridized overnight at 42 °C in 5× SSC, 10× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 0.05m NaPi, 1.25% salmon sperm DNA, 0.44% yeast tRNA, and 50% formamide and hybridized overnight in the same buffer containing 106 cpm/ml of random primed [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes. Filters were washed four times for 5 min each with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, followed by two 30-min washes at 55 °C with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Northern blots were analyzed by autoradiography and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The data were normalized to 18 S ribosomal RNA (LS2) levels. Nuclear run-on assays were performed as described previously (32Mitchell R.L. Henning-Chubb C. Huberman E. Verma I.M.

Subsequently, the cells were treated for 20 min at 37 °C with 0.1% collagenase to remove extracellular collagen and then released by trypsinization. Cells were resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and lysed for 20 min on ice, after which nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 5 min. Nuclei were aliquoted at 2 × 107 nuclei/reaction and washed once with cold reaction mix (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mmMgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 40% glycerol (v/v), and 0.5 mm each of ATP, GTP, and CTP). Nuclei were incubated in reaction buffer containing 100 μCi of [32P]UTP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 units of RNase-free DNase followed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature. The reaction mix was adjusted to 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 μg/ml proteinase-K and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The RNA was extracted twice with equal volumes of phenol and Sevag (24:1, chloroform/isoamyl alcohol) and precipitated at −70 °C for 1 h. Complementary DNAs were applied to Nytran filters using a slot blot manifold. Five μg of each cDNA was adjusted to 6× SSC and 0.3m NaOH, heated at 65 °C for 30 min, and then neutralized with 0.3 m sodium acetate and applied to presoaked filters by suction. The filter was washed several times with 6× SSC, dried, and UV-cross-linked using a Stratalinker. Prehybridization and hybridization of the filters were performed as described for Northern blots. The filters were hybridized for 3 days with labeled transcripts and then washed four times for 5 min each with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, followed by two 30-min washes at 55 °C with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS.

The mouse Cbfa1 cDNA clone was generously provided by Dr. Gerard Karsenty (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The Fra-2 expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Laura McCabe (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI). Osteoblasts were plated at 6.4 × 103 cells/cm2 in six-well plates. After 4 days of culture, proliferating osteoblasts were transfected with collagenase-3 promoter deletion and mutation constructs (see Fig. 3) using the Superfect transfection reagent (QIAGEN). DNA solutions were prepared maintaining a ratio of 5:1 Superfect:DNA. One μg of DNA/5 μl of Superfect was diluted into 100 μl of serum-free MEM. These solutions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS, pH 7.4, and 600 μl of 10% FBS/MEM was added to each well of a six-well plate. DNA solutions were added to each plate and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were then washed with PBS, pH 7.4, fresh medium was added, and cells were allowed to recover overnight. Cells were treated for 24 h with control medium or 10−8m PTH-containing medium. Cells were lysed in 100 μl of Reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 1 min) and assayed for CAT activity. CAT activity was measured by the method of Seed and Sheen (36Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Fifty μl of lysate was measured in a reaction mixture containing 250 μm n-butyryl-coenzyme A and 23 μm [14C]chloramphenicol (0.125 μCi/assay). The reaction volume was adjusted to 100 μl with 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of mixed xylenes, and the butylated chloramphenicol in the aqueous phase was pre-extracted to a fresh tube. The xylene phase was back-extracted with 100 μl of 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the final butylated chloramphenicol was quantitated by scintillation counting. The protein content was analyzed by the Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211739) Google Scholar) dye binding (Bio-Rad) assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of the method of Dignam et al.(38Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9129) Google Scholar). Proliferating or mineralizing osteoblasts were treated for 1–2 h with control or 10−8mPTH-containing medium. Cells were scraped in PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were then resuspended in 300 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were lysed by 30 strokes in a glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was checked to ensure complete lysis and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to pellet nuclei. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer C (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.20 m EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and homogenized with 10 strokes with a microhomogenizer. The resulting suspension was incubated in a shaking ice bath for 30 min. The solution was briefly centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and the supernatant was used in gel mobility shift assays. Approximately 5–10 μg of nuclear protein was incubated in a volume of 20 μl containing binding buffer (4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4), 100 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), and antisera or competitor DNA at room temperature for 15 min. 32P-Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was then added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 10× gel loading dye, applied to a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel in TGE buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.19 m glycine, 1.1 m EDTA, pH 8.5), and run at 4 °C at 100 V for approximately 2 h. The protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography.

Cell lysates were briefly centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and then equal amounts of total protein were determined by the Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211739) Google Scholar) dye binding (Bio-Rad reagent) method. SDS sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked for 4 h in 0.1% Tween-Tris-buffered saline (TTBS) (0.1% Tween 80, 138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris base) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Exposure to primary antibody diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk, 0.1% TTBS was overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times in 0.1% TTBS for 15 min and exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times in 0.1% TTBS for 15 min each. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In order to establish the expression of collagenase-3 in normal, differentiating osteoblasts, total RNA was collected from cultured osteoblasts at various stages through differentiation and examined for collagenase-3 expression. Previous work had shown that collagenase-3 was expressed as a late stage differentiation gene (27Shalhoub V. Conlon D. Tassinari M. Quinn C. Partridge N. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Our results confirm these findings (Fig. 1), demonstrating that collagenase-3 expression is low in proliferating osteoblasts (days 5 and 7) but begins to be expressed in differentiating cultures (day 14), reaching maximal levels of expression in mineralizing cultures (days 21 and 28). Collagenase-3 mRNA and protein expression had also been shown to be induced by treatment with PTH in osteoblastic cells (16Quinn C.O. Scott D.K. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Jeffrey J.J.

In our studies in normal, differentiating osteoblasts, the results indicate that collagenase-3 mRNA expression was inducible by PTH with a slight induction in collagenase-3 levels at days 5 and 7 but with the greatest PTH-induced increase seen after collagenase-3 is expressed at basal levels from day 14 onward. Analysis of collagenase-3 mRNA abundance showed that there is a developmental increase in collagenase-3 gene expression but does not indicate whether this is a result of a developmental increase in transcriptional activation of the gene. In order to determine if the increase in collagenase-3 gene expression is due to an increase in rate of transcription of the collagenase-3 gene, nuclear run-on analysis was performed in both proliferating (day 5) and mineralizing (day 21) osteoblasts, and results were compared. There is minimal transcription of the collagenase-3 gene occurring in proliferating osteoblasts; however, as osteoblasts differentiate and begin to mineralize the extracellular matrix there is a substantial increase in transcription (Fig.2 A). PhosphorImager analysis of PTH-treated osteoblasts indicated that the increase in collagenase-3 mRNA results from an increase in collagenase-3 transcription (Fig.2 B). These results demonstrate that the developmental increase in collagenase-3 mRNA is due to an increase in the rate of transcription of the collagenase-3 gene. Since results show that the increase in collagenase-3 mRNA is due to an increase in transcription of the gene, we next determined the upstream collagenase-3 promoter elements that are involved in developmental regulation (Fig. 3). The collagenase-3 promoter region contains consensus binding sites for several transcription factors including CCAAT enhancer-binding protein, RD, p53, polyomavirus enhancer activator-3, AP-2, and AP-1 (17Pendas A.M.

There are four consensus sites that are conserved between rat, mouse, and human collagenase-3 promoters, acute myelogenous leukemia-1/polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein-2/Cbfa/runtdomain (or osteoblast-specific element-2 or RD), p53, polyomavirus enhancer activator-3, and AP-1. Analysis of the collagenase-3 promoter in the rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line, UMR 106-01, had previously determined that the minimal PTH-responsive region in the collagenase-3 promoter was located within the first 148 base pairs of the transcriptional start site without a significant loss in collagenase-3 promoter activity (31Selvamurugan N.

Transient transfection studies in normal osteoblasts (day 5) using rat collagenase-3 promoter deletion constructs ranging from −6500 down to −148 indicated that as constructs were further deleted basal CAT activity remained similar to that of the −6500 construct (data not shown). These results suggest that 148 base pairs of upstream sequence is the minimal region required for transcriptional activity in normal, differentiating osteoblasts, and since this region contains the major known regulatory elements we focused on it. In order to further define the minimal region required for basal promoter activ"
https://openalex.org/W2080586428,"Abstract An early event of β2 integrin activation is the increased diffusion rate of this molecule on the cell surface, thereby providing integrin molecules with a better chance to meet the ligands. The activation of protein kinase C (PKC) stimulates integrin diffusion by releasing the cytoskeletal constraint on integrin molecules. We report here that macrophage-enriched myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MacMARCKS), a membrane-associated PKC substrate involved in integrin activation, is required for this PKC-stimulated diffusion of integrin molecules. Using the single-particle tracking technique, we observed that the activation of PKC stimulated an 11-fold increase in the diffusion rate of β2 integrins in wild type J774 macrophage cells but not in those expressing mutant MacMARCKS. Further evidence is provided from a MacMARCKS-deficient cell line in which phorbol esters failed to stimulate the diffusion of integrin. Transfection of wild type MacMARCKS into these cells restored the rapid diffusion rate of the β2 integrins. The phosphorylation of MacMARCKS is important because transfection of a nonphosphorylatable MacMARCKS mutant or the addition of staurosporine eliminates the rapid diffusion rate of integrin. Furthermore, adding cytochalasin D bypasses the MacMARCKS deficiency and stimulates β2 integrin diffusion, suggesting that MacMARCKS's involvement in integrin activation is prior or at the site of cytoskeleton. Therefore, we conclude that MacMARCKS is required for releasing the cytoskeletal constraint on integrin molecules during PKC-mediated integrin activation."

Since its discovery (1.Stenflo J. Fernlund P. Egan W. Roepstorff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2730-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), ten human proteins that contain Gla have been isolated and extensively characterized. These comprise four procoagulant (factors VII, IX, and X and prothrombin) and two anticoagulant (protein C and protein S) proteins, which are synthesized primarily in the liver, two proteins of bone and extracellular matrix (bone Gla protein or osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein), and two proteins with functions that have not been fully defined (growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6)1 and protein Z). Gla-containing proteins are synthesized in many tissues and, in addition to blood and bone, they occur in dentin, renal stones, atherosclerotic plaques, semen, lung surfactant, and urine (2.Vermeer C. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, in many instances the proteins have not been isolated and chemically characterized. In all known cases, the Gla residues function as ligands for Ca2+ and are crucial for the biological activity of the proteins. Gla-containing proteins have been purified from a wide range of vertebrates and also from molluscs of the genusConus. In the latter case, Gla is utilized in the synthesis of potent neurotoxic peptides that bear little structural resemblance to vertebrate Gla-containing proteins (3.Olivera B.M. Rivier J. Clark C. Ramilo C.A. Corpuz G.P. Abogadie F.C. Mena E.E. Woodward S.R. Hillyard D.R. Cruz L.J. Science. 1990; 249: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar).The biosynthesis of Gla is a post-translational modification catalyzed by γ-glutamyl carboxylase, a resident enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum (4.Wu S.-M. Cheung W.-F. Frazier D. Stafford D.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1634-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5.Rehemtulla A. Roth D.A. Wasley L.C. Kuliopulos A. Walsh C.T. Furie B. Furie B.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4611-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The nascent precursor polypeptides comprise a single chain with an N-terminal signal peptide that is cleaved off prior to the synthesis of Gla. An adjacent propeptide of 18–28 amino acids mediates binding of the substrate to the carboxylase and directly activates the enzyme, which then γ-carboxylates any glutamyl (Glu) residues located nearby in the primary structure of the substrate (6.Jorgensen M.J.

In the vitamin K-dependent hemostatic proteins and their homologues (Gas6 and protein Z), 9–13 Glu residues C-terminal to the propeptide are converted to Gla and all are located within a stretch of ∼45 amino acids known as the Gla domain. The conversion of these Glu residues to Gla is coupled to a vitamin K redox cyclein vivo (9.Suttie J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In a reaction that requires vitamin K dihydroquinone, CO2, and O2, the carboxylase abstracts a proton from the γ-carbon of a Glu residue, and CO2 is subsequently incorporated at the same position. The mechanism for proton abstraction has not been resolved, but it is assumed that the carboxylase converts vitamin K to a peroxide intermediate that reacts further to form a dialkoxide capable of abstracting the proton (10.Dowd P. Ham S.-W. Naganathan S. Hershline R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 419-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Following collapse to a 2,3-epoxide the vitamin is recycled to the dihydroquinone form in two enzyme-catalyzed steps. Coumarin-based vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin inhibit the enzyme catalyzing the first reductive step (vitamin-K-epoxide reductase).The propeptide is proteolytically removed from the γ-carboxylated proteins prior to their secretion, exposing the Gla domain at the N terminus of the mature molecule (matrix Gla protein is an exception in that the propeptide-like region contains a Gla residue and remains attached to the secreted protein). This allows the Gla domain to fold into a stabilized active form that is required for interaction with cell membranes and other proteins (11.Stenflo J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1999; 9: 59-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active conformation is induced by the cooperative binding of Ca2+ to Gla residues (12.Nelsestuen G.L. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8176-8182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Stenflo J. Ganrot P.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 50: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the structure has been observed by x-ray crystallography (14.Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. de Vos A.M. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Whereas individual dicarboxylic acids are weak chelators of Ca2+ (K d ∼30 mm for malonic acid), concerted binding allows the Gla domain to bind Ca2+ with an average K d of 0.3–0.7 mm (11.Stenflo J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1999; 9: 59-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the Ca2+-binding sites are essentially saturated at the concentration of free Ca2+ in extracellular fluids, i.e. ∼1.2 mm. Although neither osteocalcin nor matrix Gla protein possesses a Gla domain as such, the high affinity for hydroxyapatite crystals conferred by their Gla residues appears to be important for regulating mineralization in the skeletal extracellular matrix (15.Shanahan C.M. Proudfoot D. Farzaneh-Far A. Weissberg P.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).A wide variety of methods have been developed for the qualitative or quantitative identification of Gla, including specific stains, modified protein sequence analysis, isotopic labeling, mass spectrometry, and analysis of alkaline hydrolysates using capillary electrophoresis or anion-exchange, reversed-phase, gas, or thin layer methodologies (16.Fernlund P.

Recent developments, including the demonstration of vitamin K-dependent synthesis of Gla by marine snails (23.Bandyopadhyay P.K. Colledge C.J. Walker C.S. Zhou L.M. Hillyard D.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5447-5450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the isolation of human cDNAs encoding putative Gla-containing transmembrane receptors (24.Kulman J.D. Harris J.E. Haldeman B.A. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9058-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), indicate that vitamin K has a broader role in biology than previously thought. Progress in this field would benefit from access to simple methods for the identification and purification of vitamin K-dependent proteins. Here we describe a novel approach that allows the sensitive identification of Gla-containing proteins in complex biological samples by utilizing monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize γ-carboxyglutamyl residues. We also demonstrate the usefulness of such antibodies for the immunopurification of Gla-containing proteins.DISCUSSIONThe protocol used here to generate Gla-specific antibodies employed an ∼17-kDa branched immunogen comprising eight degenerate octodecapeptides attached to a lysine core matrix. The peptides each contained two single Gla residues and a tandem pair at fixed positions with variable amino acids encompassing them, achieved by using an equimolar mixture of 5–7 amino acids at appropriate cycles during peptide synthesis. Thus the theoretical number of different peptide sequences in the immunogenic pool exceeded 8 × 108. It was reasoned that the pool of peptide antigens would be unlikely to bear much, if any, resemblance to the Gla domains of known vitamin K-dependent proteins, increasing the chance of eliciting a response by Gla-specific antibodies. Furthermore, unlike the Gla domain in intact proteins or their fragments, the peptides would not be predicted to possess a defined secondary structure or to undergo any marked conformational change when exposed to plasma Ca2+, making it unlikely that antibodies specific for a Ca2+-dependent structure would be generated (individual dicarboxylic acid molecules such as Gla bind Ca2+ with a K d well above the ∼1.2 mm concentration of free plasma Ca2+). In this way, antibodies were obtained that were shown to be pan-specific for all or most of the vitamin K-dependent proteins tested.γ-Carboxylated PT F1 was recognized by all of the antibodies, localizing the epitope(s) to residues 1–156 of PT. Similarly, only the light chain subunit of the two-chain proteins (FVIIa, FIXa, FX, PC, and tiger snake FXa-LP), which contains the Gla domain, was recognized on Western blots. We have also observed that removal of the Gla domain (residues 1–41) from PT by digestion with chymotrypsin results in a complete loss of binding (data not shown). Decarboxylation, but not denaturation and reduction, caused a loss of the epitope(s) on PT F1, strongly implicating that Gla residues contributed to the antigenic site. Consistent with this, plasma from a patient undergoing treatment with warfarin, which inhibits γ-carboxylation, and from a patient with liver disease was markedly less inhibitory in competitive immunofluorescence assays than normal plasma. However, the nature of the antibody epitope was most clearly demonstrated by use of BSA-conjugated synthetic peptides. All seven antibodies bound short peptides (see JS44 and JS45 peptides, Table I) that contained only a single Gla residue or a tandem pair, although binding by antibodies M27 and M55 was relatively weak. Replacement of the dicarboxylic Gla residue(s) with monocarboxylic Glu resulted in a complete loss of the epitope. Thus, the antibodies were able to discern between peptides that differed only in the presence or absence of a carboxyl group on the γ-carbon of glutamic acid. More convincingly, binding was maintained when the sequence surrounding the Gla residue(s) was completely altered, clearly demonstrating the Gla-specific nature of the antibodies.However, most of the antibodies exhibited limitations in their ability to bind certain Gla-containing proteins or peptides. For example, four of the antibodies failed to produce a detectable response with reduced PC under Western blot conditions (although binding was observed in immunofluorescence assays), and antibody M55 only weakly bound to one Gla-containing synthetic peptide, although it was pan-specific with regard to the vitamin K-dependent proteins. Thus it appears that binding by at least some of the antibodies is subject to constraints imposed by the primary sequence surrounding the Gla residues, steric hindrances due to local structural elements, or local electrostatic forces incompatible with the antibody-binding site. This was indicated especially by surface plasmon resonance analyses, where marked differences in binding characteristics were observed for each of three different Gla-containing peptides, particularly during the dissociation phase. In most instances a higher affinity was apparent for tandem Gla residues than a single Gla residue. It should also be noted that we have observed that the free (tricarboxylic) form of Gla has no inhibitory effect on the binding of PT in competitive immunofluorescence assays, even when present at more than a 600-fold molar excess. This may not be surprising when it is considered that during immunization Gla was presented to the mice in a dicarboxylic peptidyl form. Likewise, efficient binding of free phosphoamino acids to anti-phosphoamino acid antibodies requires acylation of the amino acid to provide a structure more similar to that of the form used as the immunogen; binding is up to three orders of magnitude higher with the acylated derivatives (39.Levine L. Gjika H.B. Van Vunakis H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 124: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The Gla domain region is highly immunogenic (40.Lewis R.M. Furie B.C. Furie B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and previous studies employing site-directed mutagenesis have provided strong evidence that Gla residues can constitute part of an epitope (41.Cheung W.-F. Stafford D.W. Thromb. Res. 1995; 79: 199-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 42.Cheung W.F. Wolberg A.S. Stafford D.W. Smith K.J. Thromb.

Acta. 1998; 1382: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the defined specificity of the antibodies reported here is more akin to those recognizing the O-phosphorylated forms of tyrosine, serine, threonine, and histidine (39.Levine L. Gjika H.B. Van Vunakis H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 124: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 45.Frackelton Jr., A.R. Ross A.H. Eisen H.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The antibodies described here also appear to be unique in the breadth of their cross-reactivities, which in some cases includes BGP and conantokin G, both of which have structures very different from the Gla domain of hemostatic proteins. Monoclonal antibodies that are pan-specific for several of the hemostatic vitamin K-dependent proteins have been reported previously (46.Wakabayashi K. Sakata Y. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11097-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Church W.R. Messier T. Howard P.R. Amiral J. Meyer D. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1991; 65 (Abstr. 1819): 1199Google Scholar), but like the majority of antibodies raised against vitamin K-dependent proteins, they are specific for a metal ion-induced conformation (see Ref. 49.Yan S.B. J. Mol. Recognit. 1996; 9: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar for a review). In contrast, Ca2+ strongly inhibited binding of PT to the Gla-specific antibodies reported here. This effect is consistent with structural studies demonstrating that in the presence of Ca2+, PT adopts a conformation in which the Gla residues are folded into the interior of the Gla domain, largely inaccessible to the solvent (14.Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. de Vos A.M. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 50.Sunnerhagen M. Forsén S. Hoffrén A.M. Drakenberg T. Teleman O. Stenflo J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As far as we are aware, in only one other instance (47.Church W.R. Messier T. Howard P.R. Amiral J. Meyer D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6259-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has Ca2+ been reported to inhibit binding by an antibody with an epitope mapped to the Gla domain. This involved a monoclonal antibody pan-specific for the Ca2+-free forms of FVII, FX, PC, and PT (but not FIX or PS). The epitope, which was localized to the first 12 residues of the Gla domain, spanned two Gla residues, but binding was unaffected by the substitution of Gla with Glu (51.Mann K.G. Church W.R. Bovill E.G. Williams E.B. Krishnaswamy S. Tracy R.P. Saito H. Suttie J.W. Vitamin K-dependent Proteins and Their Metabolic Roles. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1990: 71-82Google Scholar). In addition, binding of certain FVII- and PS-specific monoclonal antibodies is inhibited by Ca2+ (52.Coppola R. Tombesi S.

Haemostasis. 1992; 67: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but the epitopes have not been clearly defined.The utility of one of the Gla-specific antibodies (M3B) for immunoaffinity chromatography was tested by using it to purify the FXa-LP (prothrombin activator) from venom of the tiger snake. This proved to be an efficient and mild method to isolate the protein in a highly purified state. The FXa-LP could be eluted with CaCl2, indicating that rearrangement of the Gla domain in the presence of Ca2+ provided sufficient energy to break the antibody-antigen interaction. In addition, a competitive immunofluorescence assay employing the Gla-specific antibodies was a sensitive method for detecting Gla-containing proteins or peptides. The lowest amounts tested of the mammalian vitamin K-dependent proteins (1.3–1.9 pmol or 10–100 ng) were easily detectable by the assay, and the sensitivity is probably considerably greater than this. Even so, the assay is more sensitive than methods based on routine protein sequencing or chromatographic analysis of alkaline hydrolysates; the most sensitive of the latter methods requires around 1 μg of protein (55.Britz-Mckibbin P. Vo H.C. MacGillivray R.T.A. Chen D.D.Y. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 1633-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We anticipate that the Gla-specific monoclonal antibodies described here will prove useful in several applications, including identifying and purifying Gla-containing proteins or peptides in biological fluids or tissues, studying the metal ion-dependence of Gla domains, and assessing the degree of carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins. γ-Carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) is derived from glutamate in a vitamin K-dependent enzymatic reaction and is unique among amino acids in possessing two side-chain carboxyl groups. Since its discovery (1.Stenflo J. Fernlund P. Egan W. Roepstorff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2730-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), ten human proteins that contain Gla have been isolated and extensively characterized. These comprise four procoagulant (factors VII, IX, and X and prothrombin) and two anticoagulant (protein C and protein S) proteins, which are synthesized primarily in the liver, two proteins of bone and extracellular matrix (bone Gla protein or osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein), and two proteins with functions that have not been fully defined (growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6)1 and protein Z). Gla-containing proteins are synthesized in many tissues and, in addition to blood and bone, they occur in dentin, renal stones, atherosclerotic plaques, semen, lung surfactant, and urine (2.Vermeer C. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, in many instances the proteins have not been isolated and chemically characterized. In all known cases, the Gla residues function as ligands for Ca2+ and are crucial for the biological activity of the proteins. Gla-containing proteins have been purified from a wide range of vertebrates and also from molluscs of the genusConus. In the latter case, Gla is utilized in the synthesis of potent neurotoxic peptides that bear little structural resemblance to vertebrate Gla-containing proteins (3.Olivera B.M. Rivier J. Clark C. Ramilo C.A. Corpuz G.P. Abogadie F.C. Mena E.E. Woodward S.R. Hillyard D.R. Cruz L.J. Science. 1990; 249: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of Gla is a post-translational modification catalyzed by γ-glutamyl carboxylase, a resident enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum (4.Wu S.-M. Cheung W.-F. Frazier D. Stafford D.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1634-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5.Rehemtulla A. Roth D.A. Wasley L.C. Kuliopulos A. Walsh C.T. Furie B. Furie B.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4611-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The nascent precursor polypeptides comprise a single chain with an N-terminal signal peptide that is cleaved off prior to the synthesis of Gla. An adjacent propeptide of 18–28 amino acids mediates binding of the substrate to the carboxylase and directly activates the enzyme, which then γ-carboxylates any glutamyl (Glu) residues located nearby in the primary structure of the substrate (6.Jorgensen M.J. Cantor A.B. Furie B.C. Brown C.L. Shoemaker C.B. Furie B. Cell. 1987; 48: 185-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 7.Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Furie B. Bouchard B.A. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the vitamin K-dependent hemostatic proteins and their homologues (Gas6 and protein Z), 9–13 Glu residues C-terminal to the propeptide are converted to Gla and all are located within a stretch of ∼45 amino acids known as the Gla domain. The conversion of these Glu residues to Gla is coupled to a vitamin K redox cyclein vivo (9.Suttie J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In a reaction that requires vitamin K dihydroquinone, CO2, and O2, the carboxylase abstracts a proton from the γ-carbon of a Glu residue, and CO2 is subsequently incorporated at the same position. The mechanism for proton abstraction has not been resolved, but it is assumed that the carboxylase converts vitamin K to a peroxide intermediate that reacts further to form a dialkoxide capable of abstracting the proton (10.Dowd P. Ham S.-W. Naganathan S. Hershline R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 419-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Following collapse to a 2,3-epoxide the vitamin is recycled to the dihydroquinone form in two enzyme-catalyzed steps. Coumarin-based vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin inhibit the enzyme catalyzing the first reductive step (vitamin-K-epoxide reductase). The propeptide is proteolytically removed from the γ-carboxylated proteins prior to their secretion, exposing the Gla domain at the N terminus of the mature molecule (matrix Gla protein is an exception in that the propeptide-like region contains a Gla residue and remains attached to the secreted protein). This allows the Gla domain to fold into a stabilized active form that is required for interaction with cell membranes and other proteins (11.Stenflo J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1999; 9: 59-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active conformation is induced by the cooperative binding of Ca2+ to Gla residues (12.Nelsestuen G.L. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8176-8182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Stenflo J. Ganrot P.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 50: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the structure has been observed by x-ray crystallography (14.Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. de Vos A.M. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Whereas individual dicarboxylic acids are weak chelators of Ca2+ (K d ∼30 mm for malonic acid), concerted binding allows the Gla domain to bind Ca2+ with an average K d of 0.3–0.7 mm (11.Stenflo J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1999; 9: 59-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the Ca2+-binding sites are essentially saturated at the concentration of free Ca2+ in extracellular fluids, i.e. ∼1.2 mm. Although neither osteocalcin nor matrix Gla protein possesses a Gla domain as such, the high affinity for hydroxyapatite crystals conferred by their Gla residues appears to be important for regulating mineralization in the skeletal extracellular matrix (15.Shanahan C.M. Proudfoot D. Farzaneh-Far A. Weissberg P.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A wide variety of methods have been developed for the qualitative or quantitative identification of Gla, including specific stains, modified protein sequence analysis, isotopic labeling, mass spectrometry, and analysis of alkaline hydrolysates using capillary electrophoresis or anion-exchange, reversed-phase, gas, or thin layer methodologies (16.Fernlund P.

In cells treated with IFN-γ, Nmi enhances the association of transcription co-activator CBP/p300 with signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins, and IFP35 forms a high molecular weight cytosolic complex of unknown constituents. Here we show that Nmi and IFP35 co-immunoprecipitate with an anti-keratin 19 antibody, which is due to cross-reaction of the antibody with Nmi, and suggests an Nmi-IFP35 physical association. In support of this, Nmi and IFP35 co-immunoprecipitate using anti-Nmi and anti-IFP35 antibodies, manifest enhanced colocalization as determined by immunofluorescence staining of IFN-treated cells, and form heterodimers as determined by chemical cross-linking. Nmi and IFP35 are primarily cytosolic proteins, and their interaction is increased after IFN-α treatment of cells as early as 1 h after exposure. Sucrose gradient sedimentation and size fractionation showed a shift of Nmi-IFP35 heterodimers toward a heavier fraction (100–200 kDa) in IFN-α-treated cells. This dynamic complex formation is reversed by pretreatment with okadaic acid. Two-dimensional gel analysis indicates that the IFN-induced complex formation correlates with IFP35 dephosphorylation. Our data demonstrate Nmi-IFP35 cytosolic localization and heterodimerization, and an IFN-α-regulated molecular event in which Nmi and IFP35 participate, reversibly and by a dephosphorylation dependent fashion, in a 100–200-kDa molecular complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1992279606,"The role of phosphoinositide signaling in olfactory transduction is still being resolved. Compelling functional evidence for the transduction of odor signals via phosphoinositide pathways in olfactory transduction comes from invertebrate olfactory systems, in particular lobster olfactory receptor neurons. We now provide molecular evidence for two components of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in lobster olfactory receptor neurons, a G protein α subunit of the Gq family and an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-gated channel or an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor.

A pervasive mechanism for mobilizing Ca2+ is the direct gating of a receptor ion channel (IP3R)1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the ubiquitous signaling molecule, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), thereby permitting release of the ion from ER stores (1.Mikoshiba K.

IP3-induced calcium release has been implicated in such diverse cellular processes as oogenesis (3.Kume S. Yamamoto A. Inoue T. Muto A. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Dev.

The enzyme phospholipase C liberates IP3, along with diacylglycerol, from the membrane phospholipid phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate. The phosphoinositide (PI) signaling pathway can be regulated by both intrinsic receptors and by ligand-activated seven transmembrane-domain external receptors that in turn activate both the α and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. The role of PI signaling is still being resolved in olfactory transduction (6.Brunet L.J. Gold G.H. Ngai J.

Compelling functional evidence for PI signaling in olfactory transduction comes from invertebrate olfactory systems, in particular spiny lobster olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that PI signaling mediates excitation in spiny lobster ORNs. Intracellular dialysis of IP3 mimics the odor-induced inward current in cultured lobster ORNs (12.Fadool D.A. Ache B.W. Neuron. 1992; 9: 907-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Odors elevate IP3 in biochemical preparations of the outer dendrites of lobster ORNs, the site of olfactory transduction in these cells (13.Boekhoff I. Michel W.C. Breer H. Ache B.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IP3 activates unitary currents in cell-free inside-out patches of outer dendritic membrane (14.Hatt H. Ache B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Antisera against PI pathway-specific Gαq/11 proteins block the excitatory odor response in these cells (15.Fadool D.A. Estey S.J. Ache B.W. Chem. Senses. 1995; 20: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, PIs regulate the activity of a sodium-activated channel that has been implicated in amplifying the transduction current in lobster ORNs (16.Zhainazarov A.B. Doolin R.E. Ache B.W. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1349-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17.Zhainazarov A.B. Ache B.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2929-2937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gq and phospholipase C proteins have been molecularly identified from the olfactory organ of clawed lobster (18.McClintock T.S. Xu F. Quintero J. Gress A.M. Landers T.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2248-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19.Xu F. McClintock T.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4881-4888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to characterize further the molecular substrate for PI signaling in lobster ORNs, we isolated cDNAs from spiny lobster olfactory organ that encode a protein conserved with IP3Rs, in addition to the Gαq/11 protein. Consistent with a role in olfactory transduction in this animal, both messages are expressed in neural tissue, including the olfactory organ, and both proteins are localized to ORN dendrites. Antisera directed against a unique region of the lobster IP3R localize the protein to the outer dendritic membrane of lobster ORNs. Furthermore, our studies avoid a major complication that has confounded attempts to localize unequivocally IP3Rs to the plasma membrane in neurons where ER and other membranous compartments are closely apposed to the plasma membrane; intracellular membranous compartments, including ER, are absent in the sub-micron diameter outer dendrites of lobster ORNs (20.Grünert U. Ache B.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 251: 95-103Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Therefore, our findings provide the first definitive evidence for plasma membrane association of an IP3R. Association of the IP3R with the plasma membrane may be a novel mechanism for regulating intracellular ions within restricted cellular compartments of neurons. Olfactory organs (lateral antennular filament, 100 per isolation) were harvested into a dry ice/ethanol bath from freshly caught specimens of the spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, and stored at −80 °C until used. The organs were homogenized by mortar and pestle and then by Polytron, and total RNA was extracted with guanidinium thiocyanate followed by centrifugation on a cesium chloride cushion. Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed against regions of conserved amino acid and nucleotide sequence corresponding to the final putative transmembrane region (TTCTTCATIGTCAT(C/T)ATCAT(C/T)GT, sense) and the carboxyl tail (TA(A/G)TGCCACATGTTGTG(C/T)TC, antisense) of vertebrate andDrosophila IP3Rs. Total olfactory organ RNA (10 μg) was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the antisense primer. The resulting cDNA served as template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The PCR cycling profile was as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min × 1 cycle; 94 °C for 1 min, 59 °C (−1 °C/cycle) for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min × 9 cycles; 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min × 30 cycles. The resulting 203-bp product (78/79-1) was fully sequenced. The cDNA was extended into the 3′-untranslated region by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE (21.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4340) Google Scholar)). A unidirectional cDNA minilibrary was constructed in the bacteriophage λgt22A vector system (Life Technologies, Inc.) from olfactory organ poly(A)+ RNA. cDNA ligated into the phage arms was reverse-transcribed from olfactory organ poly(A)+ RNA with the antisense degenerate primer. The library was screened by plaque hybridization at high stringency using clone 78/79-1 as probe. Several identical clones were isolated. Three more overlapping clones were also isolated from the library by PCR. 5′-RACE (Life Technologies, Inc. (21.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4340) Google Scholar)) was used to isolate the 5′ end of the cDNA, extending the contig into the 5′-untranslated region. Sequencing of cDNAs was done by standard chain termination methods (22.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52743) Google Scholar) or by the Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator and Dyeprimer Cycle sequencing protocols (Applied Biosystems) at the University of Florida's Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology DNA Sequencing Core Laboratory. cDNA sequences were translated, assembled, and analyzed with GeneRunner (Hastings Software, Inc.) and BioImage DNA Sequence Film Reader software (BioImage). To control for errors that may have resulted from the actions of the DNA polymerases, the coding region of the IP3R cDNA was re-amplified in duplicate, independent RT-PCRs; the consensus sequence is reported. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed against a common Gα sequence (amino acids KWIHCFE, sense primer (AA(AG)TGGAT(ATC)CA(CT)TG (TC)TT(TC)GA)) and to the common carboxyl tail of Gαq and Gα11(amino acids KEYNLV, antisense primer ((ACTG)ACIA(AG)(AG)TT(AG)TA(TC)TC(TC)TT, where I is inosine). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed, as described, using the antisense primer. The PCR cycling profile was as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, 50 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min × 1 cycle; 94 °C for 30 s, 49 °C (−1 °C/cycle) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min × 9 cycles; 94 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min × 30 cycles. The PCR product was diluted 1:1000 and served as template for a second, identical PCR. The resulting 435-bp product was gel-purified, ligated into the plasmid pGem-T, and transformed into JM109 Escherichia coli for subcloning. After colonies were screened by PCR for inserts of appropriate size, individual clones were selected for sequencing by standard chain termination methods. One clone (RTG-4) was fully sequenced. The 3′ and 5′ ends of the cDNA were isolated by 3′- and 5′-RACE. Again, two independent clones, which spanned the entire contig from the 5′- to the 3′-untranslated regions, were amplified in duplicate RT-PCRs, sequenced, and a consensus sequence translated for analysis. The RPA was done according to the RPA II kit (Ambion) protocols. RNA samples (1.5 and 3 μg of olfactory organ poly(A)+ RNA and 5 and 10 μg of brain total RNA, along with yeast RNA controls) were hybridized in solution to a32P-labeled antisense riboprobe transcribed from clone 78/79-1. The RNA samples were then subjected to RNase digestion (RNase A and T1) and separated on an 8 m urea, 5% acrylamide gel. For the Northern, 100 μg of total RNA from olfactory organ and brain (IP3R) or 150 μg from olfactory organ (Gq) were denatured with 15% glyoxal and run on 1.1% sodium phosphate/agarose gels. Gels were blotted to MagnaPlus membrane (Micron Separations) and hybridized with the 78/79-1 riboprobe at 65 °C (IP3R) or with a riboprobe transcribed from clone RTG-4 (Gq) at 60 °C (both in 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's, 1% SDS, 5× SSPE, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA), and washed twice for 15 min with 0.2× SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C. Rabbits were inoculated with the peptide CEDDALSKPKKPPAPK (corresponding to lobster IP3R amino acids 1170–1185) conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Inoculations, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay screenings, and affinity purifications to the antigenic peptide were performed by Coast Scientific (San Diego, CA). For Western blots, the olfactory sensilla (aesthetascs) of 20 olfactory organs were shaved onto a metal block cooled by liquid nitrogen. The organs minus the sensilla were cut in small segments into a tube cooled by liquid nitrogen. Both samples were homogenized by mortar and pestle, transferred to liquid nitrogen-cooled tubes, and resuspended in 3 ml of protease inhibitor mixture (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% sodium cholate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm benzethonium, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mm benzamidine). Samples were sonicated, centrifuged for 15 min at 500 rpm (4 °C), the supernatant removed, and the pellet resuspended in 2 ml of inhibitor mixture. The sonication, centrifugation, and resuspension procedure was repeated until the supernatant was clear. The pellets were resuspended, and the samples were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 40 min (4 °C). Pellets were resuspended in inhibitor mixture, with aliquots reserved for protein quantification. Samples were separated on a 3–12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gradient gel (12.3 μg of protein/lane). The gel was blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and the membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal goat serum in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (2 h, 37 °C), then incubated with primary antisera (1:1000) or preabsorbed antisera overnight in the cold. Labeled proteins were visualized with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a chemiluminescent substrate (NEN Life Science Products). Preabsorption of antisera was done with a 10-fold excess of antigenic peptide (w/w) overnight. Sections of the olfactory organ containing olfactory sensilla were dissected from intermolt lobsters and processed as follows: 1) fixed for 1 h at 22 °C in 0.1m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 2% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde, and 15% sucrose; 2) rinsed in cacodylate buffer (3 for 10 min); 3) dehydrated in 50% ethanol for 1 h at 0 °C and then at −18 °C for 1 h each in 75, 95, and 100% (2×) ethanol; 4) embedded in 30% Lowicryl HM-20 (in ethanol) for 12 h, followed by 70% for 48 h and 100% for 48 h at −18 °C; 5) changed to fresh 100% Lowicryl HM-20 and polymerized under UV light for 48 h at −20 °C; 6) continued polymerization under UV light at 22 °C for 48 h. Sections were cut with a diamond knife on an RMC MT-6000-XL ultramicrotome, collected on Formvar-coated nickel grids, and processed by standard immunogold protocol. After the grids were blocked with 1% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.145 m NaCl, 0.004 m KH2PO4, 0.006 mNa2HPO4, pH 7.2) for 15 min, they were floated overnight at 4 °C on primary antibody (or primary antibody pre-absorbed with the antigenic peptide (control condition)), diluted 1:10 in PBS, rinsed with high salt Tris/Tween buffer (HST, 0.5m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris/HCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.2) (2 × 10 min) followed by PBS (2× for 10 min), and reacted for 1 h at 22 °C with secondary antibody carrying a 12-nm gold label. After again rinsing with HST (2× for 10 min) and PBS (2× for 10 min), grids were floated on Trump's fixative (40.McDowell E.M. Trump B.F. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1976; 100: 405-415PubMed Google Scholar) for 10 min followed by gentle washing with deionized water. Finally, sections were lightly post-stained with 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate (1 min) and Reynolds lead citrate (30 s), washed with deionized water, and examined with a Zeiss EM-10CA transmission electron microscope. In pilot trials the density of gold labeling was found to be optimal for tissues fixed in 1 or 2% glutaraldehyde for 1 h and using a primary antibody dilution of 1:10. Longer fixation time (i.e. 2 h) or higher antibody dilution (i.e.1:100) resulted in considerably lower labeling densities. Degenerate oligonucleotides reflecting conserved amino acid residues of vertebrate and Drosophila IP3Rs were used in a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) against lobster olfactory organ total RNA. A 203-bp cDNA fragment similar to known IP3Rs was amplified. By using a combination of 3′-RACE, 5′-RACE, and screening of an olfactory organ-specific IP3R cDNA minilibrary, the entire coding region and partial 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions were isolated. The contiguous cDNA contains an 8349-bp open reading frame encoding a 2783-amino acid protein of 320,000 predicted molecular weight (Fig.2). The initiating methionine is proposed at the first methionine in the open reading frame; a consensus translation initiation sequence (23.Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is present at this point. The protein contains several residues predicted to be subject to post-translational modification as follows: one consensus site for extracellular N-glycosylation (Asn2310), three possible sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase A (Ser1001, Ser1051, and Ser2509), and one putative site for tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr1832), as well as numerous putative sites for phosphorylation by casein kinase II and protein kinase C. All sites require experimental confirmation of their relevance to the native protein. Unlike many vertebrate IP3Rs, there is no consensus sequence for ATP binding, consistent with the insensitivity of native lobster olfactory IP3Rs to ATP (12.Fadool D.A. Ache B.W. Neuron. 1992; 9: 907-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), although there is a related NAD/FAD consensus binding sequence (Gly2020-Gly2026) (24.Sternberg M.J. Taylor W.R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 175: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence for the full-length clone is similar to other IP3Rs and shows equivalent similarity to type 1 and type 2 IP3Rs but is less similar to type 3 IP3Rs (Fig. 3;Drosophila, 59% identity; rat (type 1), 57%; rat (type 2), 55%; and rat (type 3), 40%). Like other IP3Rs, it is clearly only distantly related to ryanodine receptors, with the greatest similarity seen in the channel domain. The lobster IP3R shows no similarity to the Drosophilaplasma membrane-localized calcium-selective channel TRP (25.Montell C. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) or related proteins. The entire lobster IP3R sequence seems to maintain the distribution of conserved and variable regions of IP3Rs (Fig. 3), except for one portion that is completely absent in the other IP3Rs identified to date, amino acids Thr1159–Leu1186 comprise a lysine-rich, hydrophilic stretch of the receptor (Fig. 3). Comparison of this stretch using a variety of search algorithms yielded no significant matches with any other sequences. A 435-bp cDNA product was amplified with RT-PCR and degenerate oligonucleotide primers; this product was subcloned, sequenced, and conceptually translated. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with sequences in the GenBankTM data base revealed that this product was similar to members of the Gq family of G proteins. This product was extended to the 5′-untranslated region by 5′-RACE and to the 3′-untranslated region by 3′-RACE. The assembled full-length clone has an open reading frame of 1059 bp coding for 353 amino acids (Fig. 4). The predicted protein has a calculated molecular mass of 41.5 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence for the full-length clone shows a high degree of identity to other known Gq proteins (Fig. 4,Drosophila, 84%; Limulus, 85%; and mouse, 82%) and is less similar to other Gα types (e.g. Drosophila Gαo, 51% (GenBankTMaccession number P16378)). The spiny lobster protein is 99% identical to the clawed lobster Gαq/11 (GenBankTMaccession number P91950). The position of the initiating methionine was selected for several reasons. It is the first methionine in the open reading frame. There is a well conserved consensus initiation sequence (23.Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initiating transcription at this position results in a protein of identical length to most Gq proteins (Fig. 4). Sequence analysis of the lobster Gαq/11 shows it to contain several motifs characteristic of other Gq proteins (Fig. 4 (26.Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 27.Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar, 28.Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar)) as follows: putative sites for palmitoylation, two N-terminal cysteines (Cys3, Cys4); an absence of N-terminal myristoylation sites (although putative myristoylation sites do exist at several sites in the middle of the protein); a putative cholera toxin ADP-ribosylation site (Arg177) but no cysteine at the C-terminal subject to pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation; and the G40TGES “GAG box” sequence that is present in the GTP-binding domain of other Gq proteins. A ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) using a 203-bp lobster IP3R probe highly conserved with other IP3Rs indicates that the lobster IP3R is expressed in olfactory organ and brain, although at much higher levels in brain (Fig.5 A). RT-PCR from olfactory organ, brain, muscle, hepatopancreas, and antennal gland indicates that a sequence containing the unique hydrophilic region (Thr1159–Leu1186) as well as flanking sequence is expressed in olfactory organ, brain, and muscle but not in the other tissues (Fig. 5 B). Northern blot analysis of brain RNA shows a single band, greater than 10 kb, when probed with the same conserved probe used for the RPA (Fig. 5 C). A Northern blot of olfactory organ total RNA was also probed with a riboprobe transcribed from the Gαq/11 clone RTG-4 (nucleotides 1049–1483 of the complete clone) at high stringency. A single band of 4.6 kb is seen (Fig. 6).Figure 6The lobster Gq is expressed in olfactory organ. Northern blot of 150 μg of total RNA from olfactory organ. A single band is seen at 4.2 kb (arrow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A polyclonal antibody (antibody 23341) was generated against a synthetic peptide (Glu1170–Lys1185; Fig. 3) contained within the unique hydrophilic region and affinity purified against the antigenic peptide (several commercially available antibodies to IP3Rs were unable to recognize the lobster protein, data not shown). The antisera recognize a single protein band much greater than 220 kDa on Western blots of dendritic membrane protein obtained by scraping the olfactory sensilla from the olfactory organ (Fig.7). This band is not detectable in a membrane protein preparation of the organ minus the sensilla and is abolished by preabsorption with the antigenic peptide. The presence of the high molecular weight band in the sensilla-only lane indicates that this protein is enriched in, if not specific to, the sensilla. The antisera (antibody 23341) were also immunoreactive with the cut tips of the sensilla in situ, and this immunolabeling could be abolished by preabsorption of the antisera with the antigenic peptide (data not shown). These results were corroborated by immunochemistry followed by electron microscopy (Fig.8, A and B). Grünert and Ache (20.Grünert U. Ache B.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 251: 95-103Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) previously showed that only the plasma membrane and microtubules of the outer dendritic segments are found in the tips of the olfactory sensilla. The immunogold labeling of putative IP3R protein observed in the present study appears to be associated with both of these ultrastructural features (Fig.8 A). Evidence for association with the plasma membrane, in particular, derives from the observation that a major portion of the gold label in most sections tends to be distributed at the perimeter of the outer dendritic segments. Polyclonal antisera C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that recognize Gαq/11 localize the antigen to the cut tips of dendritic cilia in situ but do not label the tissue upon preabsorption with the antigenic peptide (data not shown). These results are consistent with Western blot data reported earlier (15.Fadool D.A. Estey S.J. Ache B.W. Chem. Senses. 1995; 20: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have shown that the spiny lobster olfactory organ expresses two genes that are critical for PI signaling, a Gαq/11subunit and an IP3R. We confirmed that the encoded proteins are in the appropriate cells and the appropriate cellular compartment within those cells to play a role in olfactory transduction. ORNs in another species of lobster that express the gene for the Gαq/11 subunit (18.McClintock T.S. Xu F. Quintero J. Gress A.M. Landers T.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2248-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) also express a gene for a phospholipase Cβ, a protein that associates with the G protein in response to odors (19.Xu F. McClintock T.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4881-4888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lobster ORNs, therefore, appear to express the essential molecular elements of the PI signaling pathway. The Gαq/11 subunit we cloned has the sequence features characteristic of the Gq family (26.Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 27.Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar, 28.Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). These include a putative cholera toxin ADP-ribosylation site, N-terminal cysteines that are putative substrates for palmitoylation, and a “GAG box” sequence in the GTP-binding domain. The high degree of sequence identity between the spiny lobster Gαq/11 and homologues found in other species is expected in this conserved family of G protein α subunits. It is also consistent with the finding that antisera against mammalian Gαq/11 proteins block the excitatory odor response in these cells (15.Fadool D.A. Estey S.J. Ache B.W. Chem. Senses. 1995; 20: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The primary structure of the cloned IP3R reveals several putative functional motifs that are consistent with IP3Rs characterized electrophysiologically in cultured lobster ORNs. The cloned IP3R does not contain a complete ATP-binding motif, although it does contain a related NAD/FAD-binding motif (Fig. 2). Unlike mammalian IP3Rs, ATP does not modulate lobster IP3Rs (12.Fadool D.A. Ache B.W. Neuron. 1992; 9: 907-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). ATP insensitivity may be a feature of lobster calcium-release channels, as lobster ryanodine receptors are similarly insensitive to ATP (29.Seok J.H. Xu L. Kramarcy N.R. Sealock R. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15893-15901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cloned IP3R also contains putative sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase A and by protein kinase C. The single-channel open probabilities of lobster olfactory IP3Rs are sensitive to phosphorylation by both of these kinases. 2D. A. Fadool and B. W. Ache, unpublished observations. Lobster ORNs appear to express two functionally different types of IP3Rs based on their conductance and kinetic properties (12.Fadool D.A. Ache B.W. Neuron. 1992; 9: 907-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 14.Hatt H. Ache B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether these two IP3Rs, differentiated on the basis of electrophysiological properties, represent the products of different genes, alternative splicing of transcripts from the same gene, different states of posttranslational modification, or are heteromultimers with different subunit stoichiometry. Screening of olfactory organ cDNA libraries, olfactory organ and brain RNA, and genomic DNA yielded only the single cDNA reported in this study, and Northern blot analysis of brain RNA showed only a single band (Fig. 5 C), but the existence of one or more additional isoforms cannot be excluded. Interestingly, at least two alternative transcripts of a single IP3R gene have been observed in Drosophila (30.Sinha M. Hasan G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 233: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural evidence presented here and in an earlier study (20.Grünert U. Ache B.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 251: 95-103Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) shows that the outer dendritic compartment lacks intracellular membranous organelles. As the same fixation methods are sufficient to preserve mitochondria, ER, and related structure in the inner dendrite (20.Grünert U. Ache B.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 251: 95-103Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar), we assume that these structures would have been preserved in the outer dendrite if present. Immunogold label associated with the microtubules of the outer dendritic segments (Fig. 8 A) may reflect transport of the IP3R protein from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane via these cytoskeletal elements (31.Cid-Arregui A. Parton R.G. Simons K. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4259-4269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Aroeti B. Okhrimenko H. Reich V. Orzech E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 57-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33.Camus G. Jasmin B.J. Cartaud J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the absence of possible contamination from ER and other intracellular membranes, our results indicate that the lobster olfactory IP3R is associated with the plasmamembrane in this cellular compartment. The high homology of the lobster olfactory IP3R with mammalian IP3Rs argues that it is an integral membrane protein. Our data do not allow us to conclude that the receptor is integral in the plasma membrane per se, since we cannot exclude the possibility of submembranous cisternae or caveolae, which have been shown to contain IP3R-like proteins in non-neuronal cells (34.Fujimoto T. Nakade S. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Ogawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether the lobster IP3R contains a signal sequence that directs the receptor to the plasma membrane. An intriguing possibility is that the unique stretch of amino acids (Thr1159–Leu1186) might constitute such a signal, but whether these amino acids target this protein to the plasma membrane, or rather are involved in some other function perhaps specific to lobster IP3Rs, remains to be determined. Although IP3Rs typically are not associated with the plasma membrane in neurons, recent evidence localizes type I IP3Rs to the plasma membrane of the outer segments of mammalian retinal cone cells (35.Wang T.L. Sterling P. Vardi N. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier, IP3Rs were implicated in the plasma membrane of vertebrate olfactory cilia (36.Cunningham A.M. Ryugo D.K. Sharp A.H. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Ronnett G.V. Neuroscience. 1993; 57: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and pre-synaptic nerve terminals (37.Ueda H. Tamura S. Fukushima N. Katada T. Ui M. Satoh M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2891-2900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recruiting an IP3R to the plasma membrane may be related to the anatomy of the neuronal compartment. InDrosophila photoreceptors, for example, depletion of internal IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores leads to the activation of TRP channels on the nearby plasma membrane (38.Minke B. Selinger Z. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In lobster olfactory receptors, the extremely thin (0.1 μm diameter) and long (700–800 μm) outer dendrite (20.Grünert U. Ache B.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 251: 95-103Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) presumably would impede diffusion of either IP3 or Ca2+ between the site of olfactory transduction and the ER at the distal end of the inner dendrite (39.Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Thus, IP3Rs associated with the plasma membrane could regulate the levels of cations in spatially constrained cellular compartments, as do intracellular IP3Rs in larger cellular compartments.

Netherton for assistance with the illustrations."
https://openalex.org/W2009396174,"The cytochrome P450 2C1 N-terminal signal anchor sequence mediates direct retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and consists of a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, residues 3–20, followed by a hydrophilic linker, residues 21–28. Fusions of the N-terminal 21 or 28 amino acids of P450 2C1 to green fluorescent protein resulted in endoplasmic reticulum localization of the chimera in transfected cells. Disruption of microtubules by nocodazole treatment resulted in redistribution into a punctate pattern for the 1–21, but not for the 1–28, chimera indicating that the linker was preventing transport from the endoplasmic reticulum but was not required for retrieval to the endoplasmic reticulum from the pre-Golgi compartment. In the 1–28 chimera, mutations of residues 21–23 (KQS) in the linker resulted in redistribution of the chimera after nocodazole treatment. Mutations in the transmembrane domain affected both direct retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and retrieval from the pre-Golgi compartment, and although structural requirements for each process are distinct, in both cases the arrangement of amino acids and distribution of hydrophobicity are critical. In contrast, the linker region exhibits a sequence-specific requirement for direct retention in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1978751015,"We aimed to distinguish between the effects of mutations in apoA-I on the requirements for the secondary structure and a specific amino acid sequence for lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activation. Several mutants were constructed targeting region 140–150: (i) two mutations affecting α-helical structure, deletion of amino acids 140–150 and substitution of Ala143for proline; (ii) two mutations not affecting α-helical structure, substitution of Val149 for arginine and substitution of amino acids 63–73 for sequence 140–150; and (iii) a mutation in a similar region away from the target area, deletion of amino acids 63–73. All mutations affecting region 140–150 resulted in a 4–42-fold reduction in LCAT activation. Three mutations, apoA-I(Δ140–150), apoA-I(P143A), and apoA-I(140–150 → 63–73), affected both the apparent V max andK m, whereas the mutation apoA-I(R149V) affected only the V max. The mutation apoA-I(Δ63–73) caused only a 5-fold increase in the K m. All mutants, except apoA-I(P143A) and apoA-I(Δ63–73), were active in phospholipid binding assay. All mutants, except apoA-I(P143A), formed normal discoidal complexes with phospholipid. The mutation apoA-I(Δ63–73) caused a significant reduction in the stability of apoA-I·phospholipid complexes in denaturation experiments. Combined, our results strongly suggest that although the correct conformation and orientation of apoA-I in the complex with lipids are crucial for activation of LCAT, when these conditions are fulfilled, activation also strongly depends on the sequence that includes amino acids 140–150. We aimed to distinguish between the effects of mutations in apoA-I on the requirements for the secondary structure and a specific amino acid sequence for lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activation.

Combined, our results strongly suggest that although the correct conformation and orientation of apoA-I in the complex with lipids are crucial for activation of LCAT, when these conditions are fulfilled, activation also strongly depends on the sequence that includes amino acids 140–150. high density lipoprotein reconstituted HDL lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine guanidine hydrochloride ApoA-I is a key element of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. This pathway removes excess cholesterol from extrahepatic cells and thus protects the artery wall against developing atherosclerosis (1.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the apoA-I in the plasma is associated with high density lipoprotein (HDL),1 although apoA-I may dissociate from the major HDL subfraction, α-HDL (2.Liang H.-Q. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1187-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and up to 13% of apoA-I is present in lipid-poor form as pre-β1-HDL (3.Sasahara T. Yamashita T. Sviridov D. Fidge N.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Many of these activities are related to the unique secondary structure of apoA-I: when bound to lipid, apoA-I consists of nine 22-mer and two 11-mer amphipathic α-helices spanning almost the entire length of apoA-I (21.Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amphipathic α-helices are essential for the lipid binding properties of apoA-I and for those functions of apoA-I that rely on its interaction with lipids. This, however, creates a problem in analyzing the structure-function relationship of the protein: most mutations as well as monoclonal antibodies, which have been used to probe apoA-I, affect its secondary structure and lipid binding properties, masking the possible direct effect of a sequence alteration or the blocking of an active site. In this study, we describe a strategy to overcome this constraint. This approach involved designing a series of mutations, some that were predicted to affect or not the 22-mer α-helical repeat structure of apoA-I, and another mutation in which a selected region between amino acids 140 and 150 of apoA-I was substituted with another sequence of very similar structure. The sequence between amino acids 140 and 150 belongs to the central domain of apoA-I that is implicated in the ability of apoA-I to activate LCAT and that may also be involved in the stimulation of efflux of intracellular cholesterol (15.Sviridov D. Pyle L. Fidge N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the lipid binding and LCAT activation properties of these apoA-I mutants. We found that mutations within a segment of apoA-I between amino acids 140 and 150 reduce the ability of apoA-I to activate LCAT independently of their effect on the secondary structure of apoA-I. We also show that in addition to the carboxyl-terminal end sites, a lipid-binding domain of apoA-I might also reside between amino acids 63 and 73. The construction, expression, and verification of the recombinant apoA-I mutants were as described in detail previously(22). Briefly, three mutations, apoA-I(P143A), apoA-I(R149V), and apoA-I(Δ140–150), were constructed utilizing the U.S.E. mutagenesis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Boronia, Victoria, Australia) and the pGEX-KN proapoA-I plasmid made previously (23.Pyle L.E. Sawyer W.H. Fujiwara Y. Mitchell A. Fidge N.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12046-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mutated apoA-I fragments were subcloned into the BacPak8 plasmid containing pre-ΔproapoA-I (BacPak8ΔprohAI) (24.Pyle L.E. Fidge N.H. Barton P.A. Luong A. Sviridov D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using the restriction endonuclease sites MluNI and EcoRI. For the deletion of apoA-I residues 63–73, the Stratagene QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was utilized. For the apoA-I(140–150 → 63–73) substitution, a mutated DNA fragment of apoA-I was generated from pGEX-KN proapoA-I by polymerase chain reaction utilizing a 5′-mutagenic primer and a 3′-primer, both flanked with the restriction endonuclease sequence AlwNI. The polymerase chain reaction product was recloned into the original pGEX-KN proapoA-I plasmid using the AlwNI sites to give the complete and mutated apoA-I fragment, which was further subcloned into the BacPak8ΔprohAI plasmid using the restriction sites Bsu36I and EcoRI to give the final construct. All mutant construct plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing for their correct sequence. All apoA-I mutants were expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell expression system as described previously (24.Pyle L.E. Fidge N.H. Barton P.A. Luong A. Sviridov D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Human plasma apoA-I was isolated and purified as described previously (25.Morrison J.R. Fidge N.H. Grego B. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Concentration of the proteins was measured according to Bradford (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Reconstituted high density lipoprotein (rHDL) was prepared by the sodium cholate dialysis method according to Jonaset al. (27.Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Jonas A. Kezdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) (Sigma, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia), apoA-I, and sodium cholate (Sigma) in a molar ratio of 80:1:80. After the removal of sodium cholate by dialysis, the rHDL preparations were examined by electrophoresis on 3–30% nondenaturing gradient polyacrylamide gels (Gradipore, North Ryde, New South Wales, Australia) run at 2500 V-h. Following staining with Coomassie Blue, gels were scanned, and the size of the rHDL particles was calculated against high molecular weight calibration standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The chemical composition of the particles was determined by the Bradford protein assay (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) and the enzymatic/fluorometric phospholipid assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Castle Hill). To determine the number of apoA-I molecules in rHDL particles, rHDL preparations (final concentration of 15 μm protein) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (final concentration of 0.25 mm; BS3, Pierce). The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) and incubated a further 15 min at room temperature. Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting. LCAT was purified from human plasma by the method of Chen and Albers (29.Chen C.H. Albers J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 834: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the purification procedure involved the following steps: (i) precipitation with dextran sulfate/Mg2+ solution (final concentration of 1 g/liter); (ii) chromatography on a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); loading in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) and elution with H2O; (iii) removal of albumin by chromatography on an Affi-Gel blue column (Bio-Rad, Regents Park, New South Wales); (iv) chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluting with a linear Tris/NaCl gradient (1 mm Tris and 25 mm NaCl to 10 mmTris and 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)); (v) removal of contaminating apoA-I by chromatography on hydroxylapatite. The substrate particles were prepared by adding apolipoproteins to a solution containing egg phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol (Sigma), and [3H]cholesterol (specific radioactivity 1.81 TBq/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Castle Hill) in 12 mm sodium cholate in Tris buffer (10 mmTris, 140 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)); sodium cholate was then removed by dialysis (28.Jonas A. Kezdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4541-4546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/apoA-I ratio was 100:10:1 (mol/mol/mol). The complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on 3–30% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels as described above for rHDL. All complexes were of a similar size and represented by two populations of particles with the Stokes diameters of 10.1 and 8.4 nm. The apoA-I·phosphatidylcholine·cholesterol complexes were assayed in duplicate using 0–2 μm concentrations of each substrate in a final concentration of 10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.6% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty-acid free; Sigma) at pH 7.4. After a 15-min preincubation at 37 °C, β-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the reaction was initiated by addition of LCAT. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C and was arrested by addition of 1 ml of absolute ethanol. Lipids were extracted, and the cholesterol and cholesteryl esters were separated by thin-layer chromatography (14.Sviridov D. Fidge N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1887-1896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion rate was kept below 15% to maintain first-order kinetics. The apparentV max and K m were determined from plots of cholesterol concentration ([S]) against rate of cholesteryl ester formation (V), and data were fitted to Michaelis-Menten kinetics of V =V max[S]/K m + [S]. Dry dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC; Sigma) was sonicated in Tris buffer (pH 8.0) to form multilamellar liposomes. Apolipoproteins (final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml) were preincubated for 10 min at 24.5 °C, and the reaction was initiated by adding DMPC liposomes (final DMPC concentration of 0.5 mg/ml). The reduction of absorption at 325 nm (light scattering) was monitored for 1.5 h at 2-min intervals at 24.5 °C to assess formation of apoA-I·DMPC complexes. For each recombinant apoA-I, rate constants (k) and half-times (t 12) were determined from plots of fractional absorption at 325 nm (A) against time (minutes), and data were fitted to second-order kinetics of A = 1/(1 + kt). The stability of apoA-I rHDL was determined by measuring the ellipticity at 222 nm of rHDL in the presence of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl. Briefly, 60 μg of apoA-I rHDL was incubated with 0–6 m GdnHCl (final volume of 300 μl) for 50 h at 4 °C. The ellipticity of the samples and appropriate blanks was measured at 222 nm using a 0.5-mm quartz cell in an Aviv Model 62DS spectrometer. Twenty measurements of each sample were averaged, and the average ellipticity at 222 nm was determined. The ellipticity values (millidegrees) were converted to mean residue ellipticity after blank subtraction. The percentage of α-helical content of rHDL was calculated by the equation of Chenet al. (31.Chen Y. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). The concentration of GdnHCl at which denaturation of apoA-I was 50% completed (D 12) and the standard free energy of denaturation (ΔG d0) were calculated according to Sparks et al. (32.Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25839-25847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Predicted hydrophobicity (Kyte-Doolittle), average charge, and amphipathicity (Eisenberg) of the regions of apoA-I were calculated using Protean software (DNASTAR Inc.). Wheel diagrams and predicted orientations of α-helices were generated using Antheprot Version 4.0 (Microsoft). The predicted effects of the various mutations on the structure of apoA-I are schematically shown in Fig. 1. Deletion of the target sequence, amino acids 140–150 (apoA-I(Δ140–150)), slightly increases the overall hydrophobicity of the region. However, since the deleted area includes a proline residue (Pro143), which separates two α-helical repeats, this mutation is predicted to substitute two 22-mer α-helical repeats with one longer α-helical region (Fig. 1, A and B). Substituting alanine for proline 143 (apoA-I(P143A)) also slightly increases hydrophobicity, but results in a fusion of two α-helical repeats, and this is predicted to have a significant effect on the structure of apoA-I (Fig. 1, A and C). Substitution of valine for arginine 149 (apoA-I(R149V)) adds an extra hydrophobic domain, increasing the overall hydrophobicity and reducing the average charge of the region. This mutation, however, is predicted to have little effect on the secondary structure of the region: Arg149 is positioned on the border between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic faces of the helix, and the type, length, and orientation of the α-helix should be only minimally affected (Fig. 1,A and D). The region between amino acids 63 and 73 is predicted to have a secondary structure very similar to the target sequence 140–150, but it is located at the amino-terminal region of apoA-I. It has one additional hydrophobic domain (Trp72); consequently, deletion of amino acids 63–73 (apoA-I(Δ63–73)) will reduce hydrophobicity of the region, but its effect on the overall structure of apoA-I is predicted to be similar to the deletion of amino acids 140–150 (Fig. 1, A,B, and E). The substitution of region 140–150 with region 63–73 (apoA-I(140–150 → 63–73)) is predicted to have little effect on the overall structure of apoA-I. It adds an extra hydrophobic amino acid to the target region (Trp149); however, the length, type, and orientation of the helix are not predicted to change (Fig. 1, A and F). To investigate the ability of apoA-I mutants to activate LCAT, kinetic studies were conducted. Human plasma apoA-I was used as a control in these and other experiments, as we did not find any difference in the properties examined in this study between human plasma apoA-I and recombinant mature apoA-I. 2D. Sviridov, L. E. Pyle, and N. Fidge, submitted for publication. The dependence of LCAT activity on the apoA-I concentration is presented in Fig. 2, and the apparentK m and V max are summarized in Table I. Two mutations that were predicted to cause a significant impact on the structure of the target region, apoA-I(Δ140–150) and apoA-I(P143A), caused a 15–20-fold reduction in the ability of apoA-I to activate LCAT (V max/K m). This was due to both a lower apparent V max and higher apparentK m. Two other mutations predicted to have a limited effect on the structure of the target region, apoA-I(R149V) and apoA-I(140–150 → 63–73), caused 4- and 42-fold reductions, respectively, in the ability of apoA-I to activate LCAT. The effect of the mutation apoA-I(140–150 → 63–73) was due to both a lowerV max and higher K m, whereas the effect of the mutation apoA-I(R149V) was entirely due to a lower apparent V max. The mutation apoA-I(Δ63–73) caused a 5-fold reduction in LCAT activation, an effect entirely due to a higher apparent K m.Table ILCAT activation by apoA-I mutantsMutantApparent V maxApparentK mV max/K mnmol CE/h/ml LCATμmHuman apoA-I44 ± 1.50.14 ± 0.02314ApoA-I(Δ140–150)9.0 ± 1.0 ap < 0.001 (versus human apoA-I).0.6 ± 0.2 ap < 0.001 (versus human apoA-I).15ApoA-I(P143A)13 ± 1.0 ap < 0.001 (versus human apoA-I).0.6 ± 0.2 ap < 0.001 (versus human apoA-I).22ApoA-I(R149V)14 ± 1.0 ap < 0.001 (versus human apoA-I).0.16 ± 0.0687.5ApoA-I(Δ63–73)41 ± 3.00.7 ± 0.1 ap < 0.001 (versus human apoA-I).59ApoA-I(140–150 → 63–73)6.0 ± 0.9 ap < 0.001 (versus human apoA-I).0.8 ± 0.3 ap < 0.001 (versus human apoA-I).7.5Experiments were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2.

Thus, the ability of apoA-I mutants to bind DMPC was analyzed in time course experiments (Fig.3), and the rate constants andt 12 are presented in TableII. Wild-type human apoA-I, apoA-I(R149V), and apoA-I(140–150 → 63–73) showed very similar rates of lipid binding. The capacity of apoA-I(P143A) to bind DMPC was half that of human apoA-I (p < 0.01), and the rate was 30% slower. DMPC binding to apoA-I(Δ140–150) was faster, with at 12 almost 7-fold lower compared with its binding to human apoA-I. The capacity and the rate of DMPC binding to apoA-I(Δ63–73) were 4.5-fold lower than to human apoA-I.Table IIInteraction of DMPC with apoA-I mutantsMutantRate constantt 1/2min −1minHuman apoA-I0.09 ± 0.00411ApoA-I(Δ140–150)0.7 ± 0.02 ap < 0.001 (versus human apoA-I).1.4ApoA-I(P143A)0.07 ± 0.00414ApoA-I(R149V)0.13 ± 0.0037.7ApoA-I(Δ63–73)0.02 ± 0.001 ap < 0.001 (versus human apoA-I).50ApoA-I(140–150 → 63–73)0.15 ± 0.0066.7Experiments were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 3.

To study the properties of apoA-I·phospholipid complexes, we characterized reconstituted discoid HDL prepared from POPC and various mutants (initial POPC/apoA-I ratio of 80:1 (mol/mol)). Fig.4 shows densitometric analysis of nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and TableIII summarizes the size and composition of the particles. All particles contained two molecules of apoA-I/particle. Human apoA-I, apoA-I(Δ140–150), and apoA-I(R149V) formed single type particles with a diameter of ∼10 nm and a POPC/apoA-I ratio of 70–80:1. ApoA-I(Δ63–73) formed a single class of particles 0.5 nm larger compared with human apoA-I. ApoA-I(140–150 → 63–73) formed two overlapping populations of rHDL, one with the usual size of 10 nm and another slightly larger, 10.6 nm. The mutant apoA-I(P143A) formed a very heterogeneous population of particles with a size of 6–10.5 nm; the POPC/apoA-I ratio was 92:1, suggesting that not all of apoA-I was incorporated into rHDL particles. This is consistent with the major impact of this mutation on the 22-mer α-helical repeat structure of apoA-I.Table IIIComposition and size of rHDLMutantPC aPhosphatidylcholine. /apoA-I compositionStokes diameterNo. of apoA-I/particlemol/molnmHuman apoA-I69 :19.92ApoA-I(Δ140–150)82 :19.92ApoA-I(P143A)92 :16–10.52ApoA-I(R149V)81 :110.02ApoA-I(Δ63–73)75 :110.52ApoA-I(140–150 → 63–73)72 :110.0, 10.62a Phosphatidylcholine. Open table in a new tab The stability of apoA-I on the surface of rHDL particles was analyzed by incubating HDL with increasing concentrations of GdnHCl and by monitoring the decrease in ellipticity at 222 nm. Denaturation curves are shown in Fig. 5, and parameters are presented in Table IV. Mutations apoA-I(P143A) and apoA-I(140–150 → 63–73) resulted in no change in the midpoint of the denaturation curve (D 12), the free energy of denaturation at zero GdnHCl concentration (ΔG d0), and the percentage of α-helix in apoA-I. This indicates that these two mutations do not affect the stability of the α-helical structure of apoA-I in rHDL. Two other mutations, apoA-I(R149V) and apoA-I(Δ140–150), resulted in a slight, but statistically significant reduction in the stability of the α-helical structure of apoA-I rHDL: D 12, ΔG d0, and the proportion of α-helices were all reduced. Since both mutations are predicted to increase the hydrophobicity of the region, the most likely explanation for the lower stability of apoA-I(R149V) and apoA-I(Δ140–150) is an impaired helix-helix interaction. The biggest effect was, however, observed with the mutant apoA-I(Δ63–73): bothD 12 and ΔG d0 were significantly reduced. In view of the possibility that region 63–73 may belong to a second lipid-binding domain of apoA-I (see “Discussion”), the low stability of apoA-I(Δ63–73) rHDL could be related to the impaired interaction of an apoA-I mutant with lipids.Table IVEffect of mutations on apoA-I rHDL stabilityMutantD 1/2 aConcentration of GdnHCl needed to denature 50% of apoA-I.ΔG d0 bStandard change in free energy of denaturation at zero GdnHCl concentration.α-Helix cPercentage of α-helical content.mkJ/mol%Human apoA-I2.5 ± 0.37.5 ± 0.983ApoA-I(Δ140–150)1.5 ± 0.2 dp < 0.001 (versushuman apoA-I).4.2 ± 0.9 dp < 0.001 (versushuman apoA-I).72ApoA-I(P143A)2.5 ± 0.37.5 ± 0.984ApoA-I(R149V)1.4 ± 0.2 dp < 0.001 (versushuman apoA-I).3.8 ± 1.1 dp < 0.001 (versushuman apoA-I).72ApoA-I(Δ63–73)0.7 ± 0.1 dp < 0.001 (versushuman apoA-I).1.7 ± 1.1 dp < 0.001 (versushuman apoA-I).78ApoA-I(140–150 → 63–73)2.4 ± 0.27.4 ± 0.183Experiments were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 5.D 1/2 and ΔG d0 were calculated according to Sparks et al.

LCAT reacts with discoid and spherical HDLs, transferring the 2-acyl group of lecithin or phosphatidylethanolamine to the free hydroxyl residue of cholesterol (33.Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Esterified cholesterol is transferred to the core of the HDL particle, which precludes spontaneous cholesterol exchange with cells and other lipoproteins and vacates a space for more cellular cholesterol to be incorporated into the HDL particle (1.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In blood, LCAT is mainly associated with HDL particles (1.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and apoA-I is essential for the activation of LCAT (5.Fielding C.J. Shore V.G. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 270: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of LCAT activation by apoA-I is not known and may include proper organization of lipid substrates, mediation of binding of LCAT to the substrate, as well as a direct allosteric effect on the LCAT activity. Several reports published in recent years have examined the relationship between the structure of apoA-I and its ability to activate LCAT. Most data implicate the central region of apoA-I and include results of studies with monoclonal antibodies (34.Uboldi P. Spoladore M. Fantappie S. Marcovina S. Catapano A.L. J.

However, whereas these studies identify the region of apoA-I that is important for LCAT activation, they do not describe the sequence of apoA-I involved in the activation of LCAT or indicate a requirement for such a sequence. The most convincing results suggest a role for two α-helices, regions 143–164 and 165–186, as apoA-I “active sites” for LCAT activation (37.Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data were obtained, however, by deleting or substituting one or both 22-mer repeats. Considering the importance of the number, length, hydrophobic properties, and orientation of the α-helical repeats for the correct organization of the apoA-I·phosphatidylcholine complex, these types of mutations would almost certainly affect the structure of the apoA-I·phosphatidylcholine substrate, making it difficult to distinguish between the effects of mutations on the properties of the substrate and on the direct activation of LCAT. Sorci-Thomas et al. (45.Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W. Landrum M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have recently reported that inverting the sequence of domain 143–164 of apoA-I also reduces LCAT activation. This mutation, although changing the orientation of the hydrophobic face of the α-helix, has the least effect on the physical properties of the region, which indicates that a specific sequence of apoA-I may be involved in the direct activation of LCAT. In this study, we demonstrate that mutations in the region of apoA-I between amino acids 140 and 150 lead to a dramatic reduction in the ability of apoA-I to activate LCAT. Both mutations that potentially change the size and conformation of α-helical repeats, apoA-I(Δ140–150) and apoA-I(P143A), affected both the apparentV max and K m. The mutant apoA-I(P143A) showed a reduced ability to bind DMPC, failed to form homogeneous rHDL particles, and most likely is unable to organize the structure of the substrate needed for LCAT reaction. The natural mutant apoA-I(P143R)Giessen is also defective in LCAT activation (46.Utermann G. Haas J. Steinmetz A. Paetzold R. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Another mutation, apoA-I(Δ140–150), had an opposite effect on the structure of rHDL. This mutant formed the normal 9.9-nm rHDL particles and was more efficient than wild-type apoA-I in a DMPC binding assay, although the stability of apoA-I(Δ140–150) rHDL was slightly reduced. It is tempting to speculate that region 140–150 has a flexible and unstable conformation, a property consistent with its being a “receptor-binding” or an active site domain of an otherwise rigid molecule. However, this mutation can also affect the optimal alignment and flexibility of apoA-I on the surface of the particle, which may be an important determinant for the interaction of LCAT with the substrate. An interesting comparison for our data is that of the natural mutation apoA-I(Δ146–160)Seattle. Although this mutant forms larger rHDL particles than human apoA-I, the alignment of the carboxyl-terminal end of apoA-I, responsible for the lipid binding, is altered, and LCAT activation by this mutant is significantly reduced (43.Lindholm E.M. Bielicki J.K. Curtiss L.K. Rubin E.M. Forte T.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4863-4868Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Two mutations that potentially do not change the size and conformation of 22-mer α-helical repeats around the target area, apoA-I(R149V) and apoA-I(140–150 → 63–73), also reduced LCAT activation. The degree of reduction was disproportional to the effect of these mutations on the structure of the substrate particles; these mutants were similar to human apoA-I with respect to DMPC binding and formation of rHDL particles. The stability and α-helical content of apoA-I(R149V) rHDL were slightly reduced, which could contribute to the reduction in LCAT activation. Overall, however, it is unlikely that the lipid binding properties of apoA-I or the structure of the substrate particle was responsible for the decrease in catalytic efficiency of these two mutants. Rather, the region between amino acids 140 and 150 could be a part of the site of apoA-I that is involved in the activation of LCAT. Since the mutation apoA-I(R149V) affected only the apparentV max, we speculate that Arg149 could be a part of an active site without affecting the binding of LCAT. Although this position may be important for LCAT activation, substitution of the whole region further reduced theV max, which makes it more likely that other parts of the region are involved in the activation of LCAT. The mutation at the amino-terminal half of apoA-I, apoA-I(Δ63–73), also reduced LCAT activation, but to a much lesser extent. Moreover, this reduction was entirely attributable to the higher apparentK m, suggesting that reduced binding affinity of LCAT for the substrate was responsible for the effect. This reducedK m could be related to the lipid binding properties of the mutant (see below). Thus, two mutations that are likely to impose similar changes on the 22-mer α-helical repeat structure of apoA-I, but that are located in different α-helices, have very different impact on LCAT activation properties. This again suggests the requirement for a specific amino acid sequence in apoA-I for LCAT activation. The mutant apoA-I(Δ63–73) had a severely impaired ability to bind DMPC, and although it formed rHDL particles of the usual size, the stability of apoA-I in these particles was significantly reduced. We have previously suggested that in addition to the strong lipid-binding region at the carboxyl-terminal end, the amino-terminal half of apoA-I may also possess a lipid-binding domain (47.Sviridov D. Pyle L.E. Fidge N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33277-33283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The possibility of the presence of the second lipid-binding domain in this region of apoA-I was also indicated by Palgunachari et al. (48.Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and Mishraet al. (49.Mishra V.K. Palgunachari M.N. Datta G. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Adeyeye S.O. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10313-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) from the results of experiments with model synthetic peptides. We suggest that the region between amino acids 63 and 73 is a part of this second lipid-binding region of apoA-I. Combined, our results suggest that although the correct conformation and orientation of apoA-I in HDL are crucial for the binding of LCAT to the substrate and its activity, when this condition is fulfilled, the activation of LCAT may also depend on a specific sequence that includes amino acids 140–150.

The activity of CDK-cyclin complexes is in turn regulated by synthesis and degradation of cyclins, phosphoregulation of the CDK subunit, and binding of CDK inhibitors such as p21cip1 (1Morgan D.O.

The role of p21 in cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary has been well documented (reviewed in Refs. 3Funk J.O. Galloway D.A. Trends Biochem.

Recently, a number of studies have identified a role for p21 in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (8Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Initiation of DNA condensation and entry into mitosis is controlled at least partially by the Cdc2-cyclin B1 kinase complex. In addition to the mechanisms regulating the activity of Cdc2, cyclin B1 is also subject to control at the level of subcellular localization by the nuclear export protein CRM-1 (13Hagting A.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although supraphysiological levels of p21 can inhibit the activity of Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes in vitro (19Ball K.L. Lain S. Fahraeus R. Smythe C. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), it is unlikely to be the primary mechanism by which p21 regulates events in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The role of proliferating cell nuclear antigen is also difficult to reconcile in terms of affecting G2/M timing, although it has been proposed as a mechanism (9Cayrol C. Knibiehler M. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In addition, disruption of the p21/p53 pathway has been associated with mitotic spindle pole defects and the appearance of multiple centrosomes (20Fukasawa K. Choi T. Kuriyama R. Rulong S. Vande Woude G.F Science. 1996; 271: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 21Mantel C. Braun S.E. Reid S. Henegariu O. Liu L. Hangoc G. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1999; 93: 1390-1398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of any direct mechanistic link to the mitotic spindle poles and centrosome, recent evidence has suggested that these abnormalities may arise as a result of alterations in Cdk2-cyclin E activity at the time of centrosome duplication in S phase (22Meraldi P. Lukas J. Fry A.M. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We speculated that additional proteins might bind the critical carboxyl-terminal region of p21, previously identified as a target of the human papilloma virus E7 oncoprotein (23Funk J.O. Waga S. Harry J.B. Espling E. Stillman B. Galloway D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 24Jones D.L. Alani R.M. Munger K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2101-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and provide further insight into the activities and functions of p21. In this study, a novel protein that binds the C terminus of p21 has been identified and characterized. The protein is a component of the centrosome and associates with cyclin B1 in a p21-dependent fashion, thus providing a novel mechanism by which p21 can regulate cyclin B1 function and presumably transit through the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The cDNA sequence corresponding to amino acids 87–164 of human p21 was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain of the plasmid pAS2.1 and co-transformed with a human fetal brain cDNA library expressed from pACT2 into strain CG1945Saccharomyces cerevisiae as per the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Interacting clones were identified by growth on histidine-deficient media and the presence of β-galactosidase activity; the interaction was then rescreened in Y187 and Y190 strains. The 5′-end of human CARB was cloned by anchored, nested polymerase chain reaction of a fetal brain cDNA library using a primer provided to the upstream vector sequence (5′AD;CLONTECH) and three nested primers corresponding to the sequence of the clone in the reverse orientation. Sequence was also compared with sequences in dbEST at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and two homologous mouse clones were obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium. Full-length CARB was expressed as a His-tagged protein from pET16b (Novagen) in Escherichia coli (strain BL21 DE3), purified under denaturing conditions in 8m urea, and dialyzed into buffered saline for immunization or immunoprecipitation experiments. GST-p21, GST-p21C, and GST-p21N were purified as described (25Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (23Funk J.O. Waga S. Harry J.B. Espling E. Stillman B. Galloway D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared by brief sonication in lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 450 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmEGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1% Tween 20. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using 800 or 1500 μg of extract for CARB-p21 or the CARB-cyclin B1 interactions, respectively, and band intensity was compared with the signal obtained from 20 μg of crude extract. Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: anti-Cdc2 (Oncogene Science), anti-p21 (for immunoprecipitation) (D. Beach laboratory), anti-cyclin B1 (Pharmingen clone GNS-11), anti-p21 C-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (Babco clone 16B12), anti-γ-tubulin (Babco), and anti-pericentrin (Babco). HCT116 and 80S14, a p21−/− clone of HCT116 derived by homologous recombination, were a generous gift from T. Waldman and B. Vogelstein and were cultured as described (26Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length CARB or an N-terminally HA-tagged derivative of the cDNA clone (generated by polymerase chain reaction) were subcloned into pZeoSV2 (Invitrogen), and stable cell lines were derived by LipofectAMINE transfection (Life Technologies, Inc.) and zeocin selection. CARB and cyclin B1 were expressed from the LXSN vector for transient transfection experiments. Cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol/acetone (1:1) and stained according to standard protocols in 5% goat serum. Staining patterns were compared with those seen with 1% paraformaldehyde and Triton X-100 permeabilization to rule out fixation artifacts. Double immunofluorescence experiments were performed using anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-mouse-CY3 (Jackson immunochemicals) and recorded using a Nikon inverted microscope with Infinity optics (Meridian Instruments). Samples were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, stained with 100 μg/ml DAPI, and analyzed on a Becton Dickenson Vantage Turbosort with dual laser excitation (UV and 488 nm). Florescence resonance transfer measurements were essentially carried out on fixed cells as described (27Mittler R.S. Rankin B.M. Kiener P.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3434-3440PubMed Google Scholar) and compared with the results obtained with no donor or acceptor fluorochrome to control for spectral bleed-through and secondary excitation (data not shown). Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy, a human fetal brain cDNA library was screened with the carboxyl terminus of p21 (amino acids 87–164), which encompasses the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the second cyclin binding motif, and human papilloma virus E7 binding sites (23Funk J.O. Waga S. Harry J.B. Espling E. Stillman B. Galloway D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). A candidate cDNA was cloned, and the complete human and mouse sequences were obtained through a combination of 5′-anchored polymerase chain reaction and expressed sequence tag data base BLAST analyses (23Funk J.O. Waga S. Harry J.B. Espling E. Stillman B. Galloway D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar,28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60158) Google Scholar). Human and mouse sequences are highly conserved (92% identity at the amino acid level) and predict a protein of 27 kDa (data not shown). We named the protein CARB (CIP-1- associated regulator of cyclin B1; see below). During our investigation, another group designated this protein syntaxin-8 based on limited homology of hydrophobic residues of the C terminus of CARB to syntaxin-6 (30% identity, 58% similarity for residues 138–232) (29Steegmaier M. Yang B. Yoo J.S. Huang B. Shen M., Yu, S. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34171-34179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession no.AF115323). Further BLAST searches with the N terminus of CARB also revealed homology to the C-terminal region of centrosomal Nek2-associated protein-1 (30Fry A.M. Mayor T. Meraldi P. Stierhof Y.D. Tanaka K. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1563-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) (27% identity, 43% similarity for residues 22–158). No clear functional significance of these homologies has been described. Association of p21 and CARB was confirmed by binding assays in vitro using proteins translated in wheat germ extracts (Fig.1 A) and bacterially produced tagged proteins (Fig. 1 B) as well as coimmunoprecipitation of HA epitope-tagged CARB and p21 proteins expressed from plasmids transfected into either 293 or HCT116 cell lines (data not shown). No binding of in vitro translated p27kip1, p57kip2, or p16ink4a was observed in in vitro binding assays (data not shown). In order to study the endogenous CARB protein, a specific antiserum was raised in rabbits against hexahistidine-tagged protein expressed in E. coli. The antiserum was reactive with a protein band of 27–30 kDa in the p21 wild-type colorectal cancer cell line, HCT116, and a p21−/− cell line, 80S14, derived from HCT116 by homologous recombination (26Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and 3). The association of endogenous CARB and p21 in p21+/+ HCT116 cells was confirmed in a co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2 and 6). CARB was not immunoprecipitated with anti-p21 antiserum from lysates of p21−/− cells (lane 4). Taken together, this shows that endogenous p21 and CARB proteins associate in vivo. Northern blot analysis indicated that a 1.3-kilobase CARB mRNA was expressed in all human tissues tested (data not shown). Analysis of CARB protein expression by immunohistochemistry in tissue sections of a developing mouse embryo confirmed widespread expression in vivo (data not shown). Two-color fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of the expression levels of endogenous CARB proteinversus DNA content of HCT116 cells suggested that CARB levels remained constant throughout the cell cycle (data not shown). Expression of CARB was unaffected by DNA-damaging agents or cellular p21 status (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). Immunofluorescence analysis of exogenously expressed HA-CARB (Fig.2 A, left column) or the endogenous protein (Fig. 2 A,upper row, middle panel, and Fig. 2 B) indicated that the highest staining intensity associated with a perinuclear structure during interphase (Fig.2 A, blue arrows) and the spindle pole bodies during mitosis (Fig. 2 B, white arrow). The HA-tagged form of CARB overlapped well with endogenous CARB, although cells expressing high levels of HA-CARB had a more diffuse staining pattern throughout the cytoplasm (not shown). Double immunofluorescence experiments, with antisera against γ-tubulin or pericentrin, key proteins of the centrosome (31Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 32Stearns T. Evans L. Kirschner M. Cell. 1991; 65: 825-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), demonstrated that CARB remained centrosomally associated throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 2 A). To rule out fixation artifacts, this staining pattern was also compared with the staining pattern of live, unfixed, HCT116 cells transfected with a GFP-CARB fusion protein and was found to be identical (Fig. 2 B). Based on observations by others (33Bailly E. Pines J. Hunter T. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 529-545PubMed Google Scholar, 34Pines J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) that cyclin B1, a key regulator of mitosis, can share a similar association with the centrosome, we compared the localization of endogenous cyclin B1 and CARB in asynchronously growing HCT116 cells and their p21 null counterparts (Fig.3 A, left column). Cyclin B1 staining (red) was diffuse throughout the cytoplasm in interphase cells and only weakly associated with the centrosomal region in the p21 wild-type parental line. Surprisingly, cyclin B1 localization was altered in the p21−/− cells such that a much larger percentage of the cytoplasmic pool of cyclin B1 was associated with the CARB staining. The degree of co-localization was confirmed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the secondary antibody reagents (Fig.3 A, right column). Analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that approximately 10-fold more p21−/− cells had measurable FRET between CARB and cyclin B1 compared with p21 wild type HCT116 cells (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with the FRET observations, CARB only co-immunoprecipitated with detectable levels of cyclin B1 in lysates of asynchronously growing cells lacking p21 (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and 2), and conversely, cyclin B1 could only be detected in immunoprecipitates of CARB from p21 null cells (Fig.4 A, lanes 5 and 6). Of note, cyclin B1 steady state protein levels were 2–3-fold higher in p21−/− cells (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), although this difference was not enough to account for the increased level of cyclin B1 in the CARB immunoprecipitates from the p21 null cells, since Cdc2 was present in cyclin B1 immunoprecipitates irrespective of p21 status (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1 and 2). In accordance with the possibility that a novel C-terminal activity of p21 was regulating the association of cyclin B1 to CARB, the association was potently inhibited by the addition of either recombinant full-length GST-p21 or the C terminus of p21 fused to GST but not by the N-terminal half of p21 fused to GST (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7–10). This effect was specific for p21, since the related CDK inhibitor, p27kip1, did not inhibit the association of CARB and cyclin B1 (data not shown). Although there was clearly an association of cyclin B1 and CARB in 80S14 cells, CARB immunoprecipitates had negligible kinase activity as compared with immunoprecipitates of cyclin B1 from the same extract, although considerable amounts of cyclin B1 protein are present in CARB immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 B). However, this finding in extracts does not preclude the possibility that these complexes may have kinase activities dependent on their temporal and spatial regulation. We have not been able to show a direct interaction between CARB and cyclin B1, which could imply that additional proteins bridge the interaction. An association between CARB and cyclin B1 was not measurable in lysates harvested from asynchronous p21+/+ cells (Fig.4 A). However, the p21+/+ HCT116 cell line has measurable basal p21 protein levels, and immunofluorescence analysis suggested that a small fraction of the cells expressed significant p21 levels (data not shown). This raised the possibility that the p21 level in the cell lysate could be high enough to perturb the CARB-cyclin B1 interaction. However, in an aphidicolin-synchronized population of p21+/+ cells, a clear association of CARB and cyclin B1 was observed in a short period within middle to late G2 (data not shown) affecting protein complex formation and activity. So far, the exact stimulus for the reorganization of CARB protein complexes in G2 is unclear; however, given the proteins involved and the timing of the interactions, these observations suggest that this system may be involved in the regulation of the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In stark contrast to p21 wild-type HCT116, it was not possible to derive stable CARB-overexpressing p21 null clones (Fig.5 A). Zeocin-resistant colonies arose at nearly equal frequency in vector-transfected plates. Although some zeocin-resistant clones were obtained following transfection of pZeo-HA CARB into 80S14 cells, none had detectable HA expression as judged by immunofluorescence (not shown). To ascertain that this phenotype was not restricted to the 80S14 cell line, the effects of CARB overexpression were assayed in embryonic fibroblasts derived from p21 null mice. Consistent with the data derived from the cell lines, expression of GFP-CARB was lethal by 48 h post-transfection, in contrast to the minimal toxicity observed in p21−/− embryonic fibroblasts transfected with GFP alone (Fig. 5 B). In order to determine the effects of CARB overexpression, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding a GFP-CARB fusion protein or co-transfected with CARB and GFP on separate plasmids. Cells were analyzed at time points after transfection, and the percentage of GFP-expressing transfectants was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Populations were analyzed until at least 10,000 transfected (i.e. GFP-positive) events had been recorded. Cells were stained with DAPI prior to analysis to measure DNA content, and events were gated on the basis of having a DNA content between 2 and 4 n, being singlet events, and having forward and side scatter values indicative of intact cells. Since it was possible that the transfection efficiency might vary between HCT116 and 80S14 cells, each transfection of CARB and GFP was compared with a transfection with an equal concentration of GFP and the empty expression vector alone. To simplify data analysis, transfections were normalized to a control transfection of GFP and vector alone. At 18 h post-transfection, there was no significant difference between the percentage of transfectants expressing GFP and vector or GFP and CARB regardless of p21 status (data not shown). At 48 h post-transfection, high expression of GFP and empty vector in 80S14 cells was well tolerated (Fig.6 A), but co-transfection of CARB resulted in loss of over 75% of the transfectants. Direct fusion of GFP to the N terminus of the CARB gene produced a similar phenotype, resulting in a loss of transfectants approaching 90%. It is worth noting that although it was possible to generate stable CARB transfectants in the HCT116 line, cells expressing extremely high levels of CARB were also lost by 48 h post-transfection (data not shown). Observations from the FRET analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments implied that CARB may affect cellular trafficking of cyclin B1, possibly limiting bioavailability in p21 null cells. We tested whether overexpression of cyclin B1 could overcome the lethality of CARB overexpression in p21 null cells. In concordance with this model, overexpression of cyclin B1 prevented the death of cells expressing high levels of GFP-CARB (Fig. 6 B, right-hand columns). The rescue was not complete; however, this may be a function of lower expression from the cyclin B1 expression plasmid or uneven distribution of cyclin B1 and CARB plasmids into individual cells. Since expression of high levels of GFP-CARB completely prevented the formation of viable p21 null cell lines, we used the DAPI-based measurements to compare the ploidy of HCT116 and 80S14 cells at a time point prior to the onset of extensive cell death (Fig. 6 B). Regardless of p21 status, both lines tolerated the expression of GFP and empty vector alone with a ratio of 2N to 4N DNA content of 1.7 27 h after transfection. In contrast to cells expressing GFP alone, cells expressing GFP-CARB had a larger 4N population; this effect was most marked in cells lacking p21 with a 2N/4N ratio of 0.7, suggestive of an accumulation of cells with 4N DNA content. Subsequently, at later time points (48 h and beyond) there was a rapid loss of G2 cells, suggesting that cells died in G2. We have identified a novel p21 binding partner. A direct association of p21 and CARB is supported by our binding data obtainedin vitro (Fig. 1, A and B) and binding of endogenous proteins from cell lysates (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, consistent with a p21-related role for CARB, overexpression is ultimately lethal in p21 null embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 6 B) or in a p21−/− cell line (80S14) but is tolerated in p21 wild-type cells. We have also identified a spatial co-localization of cyclin B1 and CARB proximal to the centrosome that is most obvious in p21 null cells and confirmed the cyclin B1/CARB association by fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments (Fig.3, A and B). Whether cyclin B1 and CARB associate in a multiprotein complex or associate by a direct protein-protein interaction is not clear, although preliminary experiments with purified components suggest the former. It is also interesting to note that not all of the cyclin B1 was associated with CARB in these cells. It is difficult to determine whether this is an accurate reflection of events in vivo, or an artifact caused by differential extraction of CARB protein after fixation with methanol/acetone, given that methanol fixation alone did not preserve the CARB signal throughout the cell cycle (data not shown). At present, it is still unclear why cyclin B1 becomes associated with CARB at the centrosome in p21 null cells. However, the homology of CARB to members of the syntaxin family and the observations by others that cyclin B1 is subject to tight control of subcellular localization (12Winters Z.E. Ongkeko W.M. Harris A.L. Norbury C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E.

Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), suggests that CARB may be regulating cyclin B1 trafficking in the cytoplasm. Sequestration of cyclin B1 to CARB proximal to the nucleus may form a storage site for cyclin B1 from which it can be rapidly mobilized or protect cyclin B1 from proteolytic degradation. Association of CARB and cyclin B1 is also borne out by immunoprecipitation experiments of cell extracts (Fig. 4, Aand B), analyzing either cyclin B1 or CARB immunoisolates by Western blotting. Consistent for a role for p21 in CARB regulation, the cyclin B1-CARB association is potently inhibited by the C terminus of p21 (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that free p21 is able to dissociate this complex under certain conditions. Since CARB is either found associated to p21 or cyclin B1, but not both, it seems unlikely that the association of CARB and cyclin B1 is mediated by p21, although there is some evidence that high concentrations of p21 are able to weakly bind and inhibit cyclin B1-Cdc2 complexes in vitro(19Ball K.L. Lain S. Fahraeus R. Smythe C. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this new function of p21 is also in accordance with its recently described presence in large multiprotein complexes within centrosomes affecting the activity of apoptotic proteins before mitosis (35Li F. Ackermann E.J. Bennett F. Rothermel A.L. Plescia J. Tognin S. Villa A. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 461-466Crossref Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Based on our data, we propose that CARB sequesters cyclin B1 in the cytoplasm proximal to the nuclear membrane and thus may regulate the availability of cyclin B1 for nuclear import. A similar suggestion that cyclin B1 is retained in the cytoplasm by an active mechanism has been proposed previously (34Pines J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), but that study did not identify a candidate molecule to tether cyclin B1. Sequestration by CARB would complement the existing control mechanisms for the mitotic kinase: phosphoregulation of Cdc2 (12Winters Z.E. Ongkeko W.M. Harris A.L. Norbury C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), association of cyclin B1, and control of cyclin B1 subcellular transport across the nuclear membrane by the CRM-1 pathway (14Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 15Yang J. Bardes E.S. Moore J.D. Brennan J. Powers M.A. Kornbluth S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2131-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). CARB regulation of cyclin B1 bioavailability may regulate the onset of prophase, since availability of p21 for CARB-cyclin B1 complex disruption could only occur if p21 was not required for nucleotide excision repair or to bind other target proteins after growth arrest. This novel molecular mechanism could account for the activity of p21 in G2/M checkpoint timing (9Cayrol C. Knibiehler M. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 11Niculescu A.B. Chen X. Smeets M. Hengst L. Prives C. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 629-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, further experiments are warranted to confirm this idea. The identification of the p21/CARB association may also explain recent observations from fibroblasts derived from p21 knockout mice that fail to accumulate large amounts of nuclear cyclin B1 prior to mitosis (10Dulic V. Stein G.H. Far D.F. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 546-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an observation that fits with our hypothesis, since cells lacking p21 would be impaired in their ability to mobilize the pool of cyclin B1 bound to CARB in the cytoplasm. Thus, the lethality of CARB overexpression may arise from excessive sequestration of cyclin B1 or from titration of cyclin B1 away from other critical proteins. In accordance with this, lethality of CARB overexpression can be partially rescued by the addition of exogenous cyclin B1 (Fig. 6 A), and CARB-transfected cells have a larger 4N population (Fig.6 B). It is interesting to note that p21−/−80S14 cells have higher cyclin B1 levels (Fig. 4 A,lane 4), and HCT116 CARB stable transfectants also have elevated cyclin B1 levels (data not shown), again suggesting that CARB may not only affect subcellular trafficking of cyclin B1 in a p21-dependent manner but may also affect the steady state levels of cyclin B1. Our results suggest that the p21 carboxyl terminus can actually act in a manner to promote release of cyclin B1 from CARB. This function is distinct from the potent inhibitory activities of p21 described so far, and one interpretation of the data to date would be that p21 is actually promoting the progression into M phase, by increasing cyclin B1 bioavailability. As a consequence, the evolution of such bifunctionality would confer no selective advantage to cells that completely eliminate p21, since under DNA-damaged conditions they would be able to abrogate the G1/S damage checkpoint but be unable to efficiently initiate mitosis. Such a possibility may explain the lack of sporadic tumor formation in p21 null mice and the very low frequency of p21gene inactivations in human cancers (7Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar,36Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4984) Google Scholar).

However, based on the spinach Rubisco crystal structure (7.Andersson I. J. Mol.

Although the function of the small subunit is not well defined (reviewed in Ref. 9.Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it is apparent from the analysis of mutant L290F and its revertants that interactions between large and small subunits in the region of the small subunit βA/βB loop may contribute to both catalytic efficiency and thermal stability (8.Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11114-11117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previous studies with isolated pea chloroplasts indicated that the small subunit βA/βB loop, which is 12 residues longer in land plants than in cyanobacteria, may be required for holoenzyme assembly (10.Wasmann C.C. Ramage R.T. Bohnert H.J. Ostrem J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11.Flachmann R. Bohnert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10576-10582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chloroplast-localized Rubisco holoenzyme plays a central role in plant productivity because it catalyzes the rate-limiting step of photosynthesis. However, Rubisco is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes both the carboxylation and oxygenation of RuBP (reviewed in Refs. 9.Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar and 12.Hartman F.C. Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of carboxylation to oxygenation at any specified concentration of CO2 and O2 is determined by the CO2/O2 specificity factor, Ω =V c K o/V o K c, where V is the V max of carboxylation and oxygenation, and K is the K m for CO2 and O2, respectively (13.Laing W.A. Ogren W.L. Hageman R.H. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1974; 54: 678-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because oxygenation initiates a fruitless photorespiratory pathway that leads to the loss of CO2 (14.Ogren W.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 415-442Crossref Google Scholar), Rubisco remains the major potential target for engineering an increase in net photosynthetic CO2 fixation (reviewed in Ref. 9.Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic Rubisco does not assemble when its subunits are expressed inEscherichia coli (15.Cloney L.P. Bekkaoui D.R. Hemmingsen S.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16.Gatenby A.A. van der Vies S.M. Rothstein S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, directed mutations in the large subunit rbcL gene can be examined via chloroplast transformation of Chlamydomonas or tobacco (17.Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar, 18.Kanevski I. Maliga P.

(Rockv.). 1999; 121: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mutations that do not eliminate Rubisco function are particularly easy to recover in Chlamydomonas by selecting for photosynthetic ability (20.Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21.Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol.

No single mutant substitution is expected to substantially improve Rubisco (reviewed in Refs. 2.Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 411-434Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar and 9.Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, because the A222T and V262L large subunit substitutions increased the carboxylation k cat, CO2/O2 specificity, and thermal stability of L290F mutant Rubisco (8.Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11114-11117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and are relatively far from the active site (7.Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we were curious to see the effect of these substitutions on an otherwise wild-type enzyme. C. reinhardtiiwild-type 2137 mt + (23.Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rbcL mutant 25B1 mt + (24.Newman S.M. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11114-11117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) are maintained at 25 °C in darkness with 10 mm acetate medium containing 1.5% Bacto-agar (23.Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant 25B1 was the host for chloroplast transformation. It contains a 480-base pair yeast DNA insertion at a PstI site in the 3′-coding region of rbcL, which eliminates holoenzyme and produces a photosynthesis-deficient, acetate-requiring phenotype (24.Newman S.M. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H. Johnson A.M. Boynton J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For biochemical analysis, cells were grown on a rotary shaker with 250–500 ml of liquid acetate medium in darkness. A 2670-base pair HpaI DNA fragment (bases −742–1928), containing the entire rbcLgene (bases 1–1428) (25.Dron M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), was cloned into SmaI-digested pUC19 (26.Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 3: 103-119Crossref Scopus (11434) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with a kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (27.Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To create the A222T and V262L substitutions, therbcL gene sequences GCT (bases 664–666) and GTA (bases 784–786) were changed to ACA and TTA, respectively. This latter mutation eliminated an RsaI site and expedited the initial screening of transformants. The plasmids containing the A222T and V262LrbcL mutant genes were named pLS-A222T and pLS-V262L, respectively. The mutant plasmids (pLS-A222T and pLS-V262L) were transformed into the chloroplast of 25B1mt + by using a helium-driven biolistic device (20.Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28.Finer J.J. Vain P. Jones M.W. McMullen M.D. Plant Cell Rep. 1992; 11: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Photosynthesis-competent colonies were observed in both cases. DNA was extracted (29.Chen Z., Yu, W. Lee J.H. Diao R. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (30.Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13409) Google Scholar), and sequenced to confirm the rbcL mutations. Single-colony isolation was performed to ensure homoplasmicity of the mutant genes (20.Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31.Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Then, a Sau3A fragment (bases −33–1703), containing the complete rbcL gene, was cloned into pUC19 (26.Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 3: 103-119Crossref Scopus (11434) Google Scholar) and transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue (32.Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-379Google Scholar). Three independent E. coli transformants were screened for each mutant rbcL gene by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing (20.Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31.Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expected mutations were found in all cases. One rbcL gene from each mutant was completely sequenced to ensure that only the expected mutations were present. The mutant strains were named A222T and V262L. Rubisco holoenzyme was purified from cell extracts by sucrose gradient centrifugation (33.Spreitzer R.J. Chastain C.J. Curr. Genet. 1987; 11: 611-616Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and quantified by the dye-binding method (34.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214108) Google Scholar). RuBP carboxylase activity was measured as the incorporation of acid-stable 14C from NaH14CO3 (4.Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Ω of purified and activated Rubisco (20 μg/reaction) was determined by assaying carboxylase and oxygenase activities simultaneously with [1-3H]RuBP (7.2 Ci/mol) and NaH14CO3 (0.5 Ci/mol) in 30-min reactions at 25 °C (35.Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1981; 67: 237-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Spreitzer R.J. Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 117-121Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). [1-3H]RuBP and phosphoglycolate phosphatase were synthesized/purified by standard methods (35.Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1981; 67: 237-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Kuehn G.D. Hsu T.C. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To measure Rubisco thermal stability (6.Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1993; 101: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20.Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), purified enzyme (10 μg/ml) was incubated in 10 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Bicine, pH 8.0, at various temperatures for 10 min. The samples were then cooled on ice for 5 min, and carboxylase activity was assayed by adding 50 μl of the enzyme to 0.5 ml of assay buffer containing 10 mmNaH14CO3 (2 Ci/mol), 10 mmMgCl2, 0.4 mm RuBP, and 50 mmBicine, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated after 1 min by adding 0.5 ml of 3 m formic acid in methanol. When the rbcL-25B1 insertion mutant was transformed with either pLS-A222T or pLS-V262L, photosynthesis-competent colonies were recovered on minimal medium (without acetate) in the light at a frequency of 1.2 × 10−6 cells. Because this transformation frequency was comparable to the frequency obtained with wild-typerbcL (31.Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was evident that the A222T and V262L suppressor mutations alone had no substantial deleterious effect on Rubisco function. In fact, the A222T and V262L mutants grew as well as wild type and, like wild type, grew somewhat better than the L290F/A222T and L290F/V262L double mutants when spot tests (3.Spreitzer R.J. Al-Abed S.R. Huether M.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1988; 86: 773-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed on minimal medium at 35 °C. Sucrose gradient fractionation of extracts of cells grown at 35 °C confirmed that the levels of Rubisco holoenzyme in the A222T and V262L suppressor strains (38 ± 6 and 34 ± 6 S.D. μg/mg total protein, respectively) were similar to that of wild type (39 ± 6 S.D. μg/mg total protein), which was about four times greater than the level of holoenzyme in the L290F mutant (8 ± 1 S.D. μg/mg total protein) (4.Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5.Chen Z. Green D. Westhoff C. Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6.Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1993; 101: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The suppressor mutations appear to improve Ω of the L290F enzyme by increasing V crelative to K c (TableI, compare L290F with L290F/A222T and L290F/V262L) (8.Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11114-11117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the A222T and V262L suppressor-mutant enzymes revealed that they did not haveV c or V c/K cvalues greater than those of the wild-type enzyme. In fact, theirK o/K c values were substantially lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (Table I). The A222T and V262L Rubisco enzymes have wild-type Ω values due to increases inV c/V o relative to the wild-type enzyme. Because their V c andV c/K c values were lower or unchanged, the improvements inV c/V o must arise from decreases in V o (Table I, compare wild type with A222T and V262L). Despite their wild-type Ω values, the A222T and V262L enzymes are not as good as the wild-type enzyme with respect to net carboxylation. These mutant enzymes have decreases inV c and K o/K c(Table I). Although the A222T and V262L substitutions improve the L290F enzyme in similar ways (i.e. increasedV c, V c/K c, and Ω), they appear to do so by somewhat different mechanisms. A222T caused a small decrease in K c but V262L substantially increased both K c andK o (Table I).Table IKinetic properties of Rubisco purified from wild type, mutant L290F, revertants L290F/A222T and L290F/V262L, and suppressor mutants A222T and V262LEnzymesΩ aThe values are the means ± S.D. of three separate enzyme preparations.V c aThe values are the means ± S.D. of three separate enzyme preparations.K c aThe values are the means ± S.D. of three separate enzyme preparations.K o aThe values are the means ± S.D. of three separate enzyme preparations.V c/K c bCalculated values.K o/K c bCalculated values.V c/V o bCalculated values.VcKo/VoKcμmol/h/mgμmCO2μm O2Wild type63 ± 1139 ± 1532 ± 5559 ± 714.3173.7L290F57 ± 139 ± 144 ± 6770 ± 450.9183.2L290F/A222T63 ± 290 ± 1636 ± 3760 ± 172.5213.0L290F/V262L60 ± 176 ± 970 ± 191279 ± 471.1183.3A222T63 ± 1115 ± 2027 ± 3397 ± 224.3154.2V262L62 ± 3102 ± 2447 ± 2728 ± 1342.2154.1a The values are the means ± S.D. of three separate enzyme preparations.b Calculated values. Open table in a new tab Because increased levels of Rubisco protein were observed in L290F/A222T and L290F/V262L revertant cells grown at 35 °C relative to the amount of holoenzyme in L290F mutant cells (8.Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11114-11117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it was reasonable to consider that the A222T and V262L suppressor substitutions improved the thermal stability of the original L290F mutant enzyme (4.Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6.Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1993; 101: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When purified enzymes were preincubated at elevated temperatures, revertant L290F/A222T Rubisco retained slightly more RuBP carboxylase activity at 55 °C than did the L290F enzyme, but revertant L290F/V262L enzyme had a thermal stability comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1). For example, whereas wild-type and L290F/V262L Rubisco retained 41 and 61% of their initial activities, respectively, at 60 °C, the mutant L290F and revertant L290F/A222T enzymes were completely inactivated. Much to our surprise, enzymes containing only the A222T or V262L suppressor substitutions had thermal stabilities greater than that of the wild-type enzyme. For example, whereas A222T and V262L Rubisco retained 58 and 93% of their initial activities, respectively, at 65 °C, the mutant, revertant, and wild-type enzymes were completely inactivated (Fig. 1). One does not expect that a single amino acid substitution would improve the carboxylation efficiency of wild-type Rubisco, and the failure to select a better enzyme by using a variety of genetic approaches has illustrated this point (reviewed in Ref. 2.Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 411-434Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, we found that a single A222T or V262L substitution in the Rubisco large subunit, each recovered as a second-site suppressor of a deleterious L290F substitution (4.Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8.Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11114-11117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), could substantially improve the thermal stability of the otherwise wild-type holoenzyme (Fig. 1). This apparent inconsistency is explained by the fact that Chlamydomonas cannot grow at temperatures much above 35 °C, but its Rubisco enzyme is resistant to temperatures as high as 55 °C in vitro (6.Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1993; 101: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20.Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). There is no natural selection for mutant enzymes like A222T and V262L Rubisco, which are resistant to even higher temperatures, 60 and 65 °C, respectively (Fig. 1). Although the suppressors increase the amount of thermally unstable L290F Rubisco in vivo (8.Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11114-11117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that they fail to increase the level of wild-type Rubiscoin vivo. Wild-type Rubisco is already resistant to temperatures far exceeding those that Chlamydomonasencounters in nature. Mutant L290F is the only rbcL mutant recovered by screening for a temperature-conditional phenotype (reviewed in Ref. 17.Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar). The A222T and V262L suppressor substitutions, which improve the thermal stability of L290F Rubisco, are likewise unique. They increase Rubisco thermal stability even in the absence of the original L290F mutant substitution (Fig. 1). Furthermore, residues 222, 262, and 290 are highly conserved among land plants and green algae. There is some divergence at these residues among non-green algae and prokaryotes, but it is striking that the well studied Rubisco from the thermophilic red alga Galdieria partita (38.Uemura K. Anwaruzzaman Miyachi S. Yokota A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 39.Sugawara H. Yamamoto H. Shibata N. Inoue T. Okada S. Miyake C. Yokota A. Kai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15655-15661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) has different residues at every one of these positions (Met-222, Ser-262, and Ile-290 numbered relative to the Chlamydomonas and spinach large subunit sequences). Residues 222, 262, and 290 surround the loop between β-strands A and B of the Rubisco small subunit (Fig.2) (7.Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 8.Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11114-11117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which is 12–18 residues longer in the Rubisco of plants and green algae than in the Rubisco of prokaryotes and non-green algae (2.Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 411-434Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 9.Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Insertion of the land plant loop into the small subunit of the cyanobacteriumSynechococcus is sufficient for permitting the assembly of prokaryotic small subunits with eukaryotic large subunits in isolated chloroplasts (10.Wasmann C.C. Ramage R.T. Bohnert H.J. Ostrem J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and an R53E substitution in the eukaryotic small subunit blocks holoenzyme assembly (11.Flachmann R. Bohnert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10576-10582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, all of these observations indicate that holoenzyme stability (and thermal stability in particular) is substantially determined by the interface between the small subunit βA/βB loop and the large subunit region encompassing residues 222, 262, and 290. Because the changes in Rubisco thermal stability appear to be additive, with the L290F/A222T and L290F/V262L revertant enzymes being generally intermediate to the mutant and suppressor enzymes with regard to in vitro thermal stability (Fig. 1), a direct interaction between Phe-290 and Thr-222 or Leu-262 is not necessary to bring about an improvement in thermal stability. Thus, other substitutions at this small/large subunit interface might also be found to influence holoenzyme thermal stability. The L290F enzyme is unstable and degraded at 35 °C in vivo (3.Spreitzer R.J. Al-Abed S.R. Huether M.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1988; 86: 773-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Chen Z. Hong S.

Although the A222T and V262L substitutions increase the amount of L290F holoenzyme in cells grown at 35 °C, they do not increase the amount to the wild-type level (8.Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11114-11117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the improvements in Ω and V c, brought about by the A222T and V262L substitutions (Table I, compare L290F with L290F/A222T and L290F/V262L), are also necessary (and are selectable characteristics) to ensure sufficient carboxylation for growth at 35 °C. Whereas the suppressor substitutions increase V c andV c/K c of the original L290F mutant enzyme (Table I, compare L290F with L290F/A222T and L290F/V262L), they do not increase these values of the otherwise wild-type enzyme (Table I, compare wild type with A222T and V262L). In fact, the A222T and V262L enzymes have lowerK o/K c and higherV c/V o values than the wild-type, mutant L290F, and revertant enzymes. Unlike the effects on thermal stability, the effects on catalysis caused by the L290F mutant substitution and A222T and V262L suppressor substitutions alone are not simply additive. Therefore, one would infer that the substituted residues complement (i.e. cooperate) to improve catalysis in the L290F/A222T and L290F/V262L revertant enzymes via direct, physical interactions. According to the crystal structure of spinach Rubisco (7.Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), Leu-290 is the first residue of β-strand 5 at the bottom of the α/β-barrel (Fig. 2). Leu-290, Leu-162, Leu-169, and Leu-375 are in van der Waals contact with Glu-158, which participates in a hydrogen bond network, along with His-292 and His-325, that terminates at the active-site residue His-327 (7.Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). His-327, in β-strand 6 at the base of flexible loop 6, coordinates with one of the phosphate groups of the transition state analog CABP (Fig. 2) (7.Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions at His-327 inRhodospirillum rubrum and Synechococcus Rubisco decrease but do not eliminate carboxylation (40.Harpel M.R. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24734-24740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Haining R.L. McFadden B.A. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 41: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Because of its proximity to CABP and loop 6 Lys-334, which discriminates between CO2 and O2 (29.Chen Z., Yu, W. Lee J.H. Diao R. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 42.Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3051-3053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Lorimer G.H. Chen Y.R. Hartman F.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9018-9024Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), His-327 may provide the means by which subtle alterations could be propagated to influence Ω. It was previously proposed that the L290F substitution caused thermal instability by disrupting the hydrogen bond network within the hydrophobic core of the α/β-barrel (2.Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 411-434Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Based on the work presented here, it would seem to be more likely that L290F and the A222T and V262L suppressor substitutions influence thermal stability by altering interactions at the small/large subunit interface. The L290F mutant and A222T and V262L suppressor-substituted residues may interact to influence catalysis via compensatory deflections of the small subunit βA/βB loop or by displacing a similar set of residues in the hydrophobic core of the large subunit α/β-barrel. However, to influence catalysis, and Ω in particular (Table I), the effects of the substitutions must be propagated to the active site. Directed mutagenesis of other residues along the hydrogen bond network may identify residues that mimic the effect of L290F on catalysis without necessarily affecting thermal stability.

It consists of GroEL, a tetradecameric double-ring cylinder of identical 57-kDa subunits (4.Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachminiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar) and its cochaperone GroES, a heptameric dome-shaped ring structure of 10-kDa subunits (5.Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The GroEL double ring itself contains two binding sites for unfolded polypeptides on the inner rims of its two rings and an ATP binding site in each subunit (4.Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachminiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). ATP binding induces large structural changes in GroEL, resulting in the out- and upward movement of the apical domains (6.Saibil H.R. Zheng D. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Watson G.M.F.

As a consequence, hydrophobic residues, which are responsible for polypeptide binding, move away from the interior of the ring. This leads to the ejection of bound substrates into the central channel of the GroEL cylinder and the concomitant binding of the cochaperone GroES. Thus, substrate polypeptides are encapsulated in a hydrophilic folding cage (8.Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R.

Importantly, the ATP-induced domain movements in GroEL lead to the doubling in volume of the central channel (7.Chen S. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Wood S.P. Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clark A.R.

Therefore, the bound substrate can fold only for a short period of time in the protected environment of the central cavity before it is ejected into the bulk solution independent of its folded state (11.Weissman J.S.

Binding of non-native polypeptides by GroEL decreases the concentration of aggregation-prone intermediates in solution, and sequestration of polypeptide chains inside the GroE cage allows folding in an unique folding environment without interaction with other folding intermediates (10.Mayhew M. da Silva A.C.R. Martin J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In addition to this passive role, the GroE machinery is able to accelerate protein folding (20.Sparrer H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,21.Ranson A.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), possibly by active unfolding of kinetically trapped intermediates, which gives them a new chance to fold (22.Shtilerman M. Lorimer G.H. Englander W.S. Science. 1999; 284: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A key question remaining in this scenario is whether folding inside GroE always leads to committed intermediates or whether unfavorable folding reactions can occur inside GroE complexes. To address this question, we analyzed folding reactions occurring under stringent conditions. As a model substrate protein, we used dimeric citrate synthase (CS)1 (23.Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We had shown previously that GroE binds monomeric unfolding intermediates of CS (24.Grallert H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33305-33310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A folding reaction inside the central cavity of the GroE complexes leads to an intermediate that is committed to associate to the native dimer, even under nonpermissive conditions. Thus, the GroE system shifts the kinetic partitioning between irreversible aggregation, which is the favored folding pathway in the absence of GroE, toward a productive folding reaction (25.Grallert H. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20171-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Using this experimental system, we show here that CS can undergo folding reactions inside GroE complexes that lead to irreversibly misfolded proteins. GroEL and GroES were purified from the E. coli strain JM 109 TZ 136 bearing the multicopy plasmid DHαpOF 39 as described previously (26.Schmidt M. Bücheler U. Kaluza B. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27964-27972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similary, the GroEL single ring mutant SR1 (9.Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S.X. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) was purified from the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS bearing the plasmid pTrc99a. The concentrations of these proteins were determined spectrophotometrically using the following extinction coefficients: E2760.1% = 0.142 for GroES, E2800.1% = 0.173 for GroEL, and E2760.1% = 0.193 for SR1 (calculated according to Gill and von Hippel (27.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar)). The extinction coefficients used for the calculation of GroEL and SR1 concentrations were corrected for minor tryptophan impurities present in the solution of the purified proteins, as determined by a titration of the tryptophan fluorescence (28.Pajot J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, the GroEL and the SR1 absorbance spectra were corrected for intrinsic light scattering of the solution due to the particle size of the protein complexes. Mitochondrial CS from porcine heart (EC 4.1.3.7), ATP, and ATPγS were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and treated as described (23.Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). CS concentration refers to dimers, concentrations of GroEL, SR1, and GroES in the text refer to the 14-mer and 7-mer, respectively. Apyrase from potato (grade IV) was from Sigma. CS was diluted 1:100 to a final concentration of 0.075 μm into 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0 (25 °C), 10 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol in the presence of ATP (2 mm) or 0.3 μm GroEL, 0.6 μm GroES, and 2 mm ATP at 25 °C. Inactivation was initiated by a temperature shift to the indicated temperatures. To determine the inactivation kinetics, aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time points, and CS activity was measured at 25 °C according to Srere (29.Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2157-2165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To form SR1 complexes with bound monomeric CS, CS (0.075 μm) was incubated at 43 °C in the presence of SR1 (0.2 μm) for 90 min (24.Grallert H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33305-33310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After shifting the temperature to 45 °C SR17·GroES7·ATP7 complexes were formed by the addition of GroES (0.3 μm) and ATP (2 mm). To dissociate these cis complexes, the samples were incubated on ice for 30 min (30.Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Reactivation was then measured at 25 °C. To determine the amount of intermediates that lack any affinity to GroEL after folding inside of SR1·GroES complexes, 1 μm of SR1 was added upon reactivation. This excess of SR1 ensures that all intermediates that did not fold to the committed state are immediately trapped (25.Grallert H. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20171-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To determine the overall amount of reactivatable intermediates, GroEL (0.3 μm) and GroES (0.6 μm) were added to ensure a GroE-assisted folding. Additionally, 40 mm GdmCl were added immediately after the start of reactivation at 25 °C, because GdmCl destabilizes SR1·GroES-substrate complexes (data not shown). This ensures that all CS intermediates have been dissociated from SR1 and have the chance to fold in a reaction mediated by wtGroE. To bind monomeric CS intermediates to wtGroEL, CS (0.075 μm) was incubated at 43 °C in the presence of GroEL (0.3 μm) and GroES (0.7 μm) for 90 min (24.Grallert H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33305-33310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After adjusting the temperature to 45 °C, ATP (2 mm) was added. ATP hydrolysis was stopped by the addition of 25 mm EDTA. To bind monomeric CS intermediates to wtGroEL, CS (0.15 μm) was incubated at 43 °C in the presence of GroEL (0.2 μm) and GroES (0.4 μm) for 90 min. After adjusting the temperature to 45 °C, ATP (200 μm) was added to allow binding of GroES. After a further 10 s, apyrase (10 units) was added to hydrolyze the ATP to ADP and AMP. To dissociate the GroEL14·GroES7·CS complexes, the samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. The end points of reactivation were determined after 120 min of incubation at 25 °C. This procedure only led to the formation of stable wtGroEL14·GroES7·CS cis complexes (31.Beiβinger M. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1075-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Due to this we used twice the amount of CS for this experiment, because statistically only 50% of the GroEL bound CS monomers are sequestered underneath GroES. The other portion of CS monomers are bound to the GroEL ring opposite to GroES and cannot fold during the experiment. We plotted the time in cis complex against activity gained from CS monomers folded in GroEL·GroES·CS cis complexes. CS-SR1 experiments were performed as described above. After incubation of SR1·CS·GroES complexes at 45 °C, aliquots were withdrawn and injected onto a TosoHaas TSK 4000 PW gel filtration column (30 cm in length). The column was operated at 25 °C with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Elution of the proteins was detected on-line with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Uvicord VW 2251 UV detector at 280 nm. The peak areas for SR1·CS·GroES complexes were calculated from the data points using the Peakfit software (Jandel Scientific). ATP hydrolysis was measured using a coupled enzymatic assay (32.Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The measurements were carried out in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 25 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase. GroEL (75 nm) or SR1 (100 nm) were added and preincubated for 5 min. To measure the effect of GroES on the ATPase of GroEL, 150 nm GroES was added to GroEL or SR1. Then ATP (2 mm) was added, and after a further 2-min preincubation period, the change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured over 10 min in a thermostatted Ultrospec 3000 Amersham Pharmacia Biotech spectrophotometer. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated as described (32.Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The rate of ATPγS hydrolysis, a very slowly hydrolyzable ATP analog, was determined at 45 °C in the presence of 1 μm GroEL and 2 μm GroES. CS (50 nm) was denatured in the presence of GroEL (40 nm) at 43 °C for 80 min in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithioerythritol. After a shift to the indicated temperatures, GroES (120 nm) and ATP (2 mm) were added. After 5 min, the samples were applied to carbon-coated grids and negatively stained with 3% uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were recorded at 120 kV and a magnification of 45,000 with a Philips CM12 electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Digitized images were aligned, averaged, and subjected to a classification procedure based on eigenvector-eigenvalue analysis (26.Schmidt M. Bücheler U. Kaluza B. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27964-27972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Hegerl R. Altbauer A. Ultramicroscopy. 1982; 9: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Rate constants for the unfolding and refolding kinetics of CS were obtained from non-linear fits using Sigma plot 4.0 (Jandel Scientific). Rate constants and equilibrium constants for association or for association followed by an unimolecular folding reactions were determined with the corresponding models using the program Scientist (Micromath). Simulations of the determined folding steps were also performed with Scientist. Having analyzed previously how the GroE chaperone system stabilizes CS during thermal unfolding (25.Grallert H. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20171-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we were now interested in determining the limitations of folding inside GroE complexes using this assay. To test the temperature range in which GroE is able to fold CS, we inactivated native CS in the presence or absence of GroEL, GroES, and ATP at different temperatures. As shown in Fig.1, the ability of GroE to stabilize CS during heat denaturation decreased with increasing temperatures. Interestingly, even at physiological temperatures (37 °C), CS is inactivated slowly but completely in the absence of the chaperone system. The reaction can be described with two exponential kinetics with rate constants of k 1 = 0.09 min−1 and k 2 = 0.0015 min−1, respectively. In the presence of GroE, the level of native CS can be held constant at approximately 75%, and the initial loss of activity follows a single exponential reaction (k = 0.1 min−1). At 45 °C, a stabilizing effect of GroE is no longer detectable (Fig.1 C). The inactivation kinetics can be described by a single exponential function with a rate constant of 0.2 min−1. The inability of GroE to stabilize CS at 45 °C could be either due to a change in the functional mechanism of GroE at higher temperatures or it could represent a folding defect of CS that GroE cannot rescue. To discriminate between these possibilities, we analyzed functional features of GroE and the GroE-assisted folding of CS at different temperatures. First, we determined the ATPase activity of GroEL and SR1, a single ring mutant of GroEL (9.Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S.X. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), in the absence or presence of GroES between 25 °C and 45 °C. Changes in the GroE ATPase mechanism would result in a kink in the temperature dependence. The Arrhenius plot of the GroEL-ATPase in Fig. 2 A shows clearly that there is a linear relationship between ATPase activity and temperature in the investigated temperature range. As expected, in the presence of GroES the rate of the GroEL ATPase activity was approximately half that observed in the absence of GroES due to its inhibition of the ATPase. These results clearly demonstrate that the ATPase mechanism of the GroE chaperone machinery does not change at higher temperatures. Furthermore, the ATPase rates per subunit are very similar for SR1 and wtGroEL (Fig. 2 A). This shows that SR1 has similar ATPase properties as wt GroEL under the conditions used. As expected, the rate of ATP hydrolysis for SR1 in the presence of GroES decreased to almost zero. The inhibition of ATPase function is due to the fact that SR1 binds GroES in the presence of ATP and hydrolyses the bound ATP but cannot release GroES and ADP (9.Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O.

This result also demonstrates that the SR1·GroES complexes are stable in the investigated temperature range. Since there are indications that the association between GroEL and GroES is perturbed at elevated temperatures (34.Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 35.Llorca O. Galan A. Carrascosa J.L. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32587-32594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we investigated potential changes in structure of GroEL·GroES complexes formed at different temperatures. We used electron microscopy and image processing to visualize and classify asymmetric GroEL14·GroES7 complexes, so called “bullets,” and symmetric GroEL14·GroES14complexes, so called “footballs,” at different temperatures. Furthermore, we prepared GroE complexes in the presence of CS to investigate potential substrate-induced changes in complex formation. At all temperatures investigated, GroEL bullets and footballs could be detected (Fig. 2 B). However, no temperature-dependent differences in the distribution of the three species were observed. Also, the binding of CS had no influence on the complex formation at the investigated temperatures. Having shown that the inability of GroE to stabilize native CS at higher temperatures is not due to mechanistic changes in the ATPase or the association of GroEL and GroES itself, we now focused on the folding of CS inside GroE at higher temperatures. As described previously (25.Grallert H. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20171-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), monomeric CS intermediates (M1) fold inside GroE cis complexes to a state (M2), which is committed to associate to native dimers. This reaction is responsible for the apparent stabilization of CS at 40 °C (see Fig. 1 B). Now we tested whether this folding step occurs also at 45 °C. To this end, complexes between monomeric CS unfolding intermediates, SR1, and GroES were formed in the presence of ATP. HPLC size exclusion chromatography confirmed that the SR1·GroES·CS complexes were stable for at least 90 min at 45 °C (data not shown). After different incubation times at 45 °C, aliquots were withdrawn and dissociated on ice (30.Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and the number of CS molecules that reached the committed state was determined. Additional SR1 was added to trap all CS folding intermediates that could still be recognized by the chaperone (cf. the scheme in Fig. 3 A). We found that after short term incubation in the cis complexes at 45 °C, about 30% of the CS molecules fold to the committed state (Fig.3 A). Upon further incubation, these committed intermediates disappear rapidly. The kinetic trace can be described by two consecutive reactions with rate constants of 1.9 min−1 and 0.06 min−1, respectively. Taken together, these results show that monomeric CS intermediates (M1) fold inside of SR1·GroES complexes to an association-competent state (M2) also at 45 °C. Prolonged incubation leads to a misfolding reaction, resulting in the formation of the CS intermediate (M3), which in contrast to M2, is not association-competent anymore: M1↔ M2 ↔ M3. The “overfolding” reaction (M2 → M3) could reflect a specific property of SR1. In this case, M3 would not be formed in wtGroE. To test this possibility, we inactivated CS in the presence of GroEL and GroES as described for SR1. Then ATP was added to form GroEL·GroES·CS complexes, and 10 s later, the ATP cycle was quenched by apyrase. Under the conditions used, apyrase hydrolyzed the ATP free in solution within 3–4 s to ADP and within 10 s to AMP (data not shown). Following the apyrase quench, we investigated the folding of monomeric intermediates of CS inside the GroEL·GroES complexes as described for SR1 (Fig. 3 B). The analysis clearly showed that monomeric CS intermediates fold with approximately the same rate constants to an association-competent monomer (M2) as observed for SR1·ES complexes (k 1 = 2.1 min−1). After prolonged incubation, M2 disappeared in a subsequent slower folding reaction (k 2 = 0.08 min−1), as observed in SR1. Thus, folding inside SR1·GroES complexes is a valid model for GroE cis-folding even at higher temperatures. Due to the apyrase treatment, CS became artificially locked inside wtGroE complexes. To test whether the disappearance of the committed intermediate (M2) also occurs in the presence of a completely active, ATP-hydrolyzing GroE system, we analyzed the time course of the appearance and disappearance of M2 in the presence of wtGroE and ATP at 45 °C (Fig. 3 C). At different time points, aliquots were withdrawn and incubated at 25 °C with EDTA to stop the GroE ATPase cycle rapidly and to dissociate the GroEL·GroES complexes. Interestingly, the formation and disappearance of association-competent CS intermediates is comparable with that observed in SR1·GroES complexes and can be well described by two consecutive reactions with rate constants of 0.65 min−1 and 0.05 min−1, respectively. This implicates a kinetic partitioning between the productive association of M2 to native dimers and the unproductive conversion of M2 to M3. To rule out the possibility that the committed and association-competent intermediate (M2) can no longer associate to native dimers at higher temperatures, we populated M2 inside SR1·GroES complexes at 25 °C, released them, and followed the dimerization at 45 °C. As shown in Fig.4, the activity of CS increased rapidly and decreased in a subsequent reaction. The first reaction represents the association of the monomeric intermediate (M2) to the active dimer (k = 18 600m−1min−1), and the second subsequent reaction corresponds to the unfolding of the native dimer (DN) to the inactive dimer (DI; k = 0.18 min−1) (cf. Ref. 24.Grallert H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33305-33310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This experiment clearly shows that the association-competent intermediate (M2) can still associate to the native dimer at 45 °C. This together with kinetic simulations confirms that the conversion of M2 to M3 is essential to explain the complete loss of CS activity in the presence of GroE at temperatures higher than 37 °C (see Figs. 1 and 6).Figure 6Model for the GroE-assisted folding at elevated temperatures. Native CS dimers (DN) unfold under nonpermissive conditions to inactive dimers (DI). These dimers interact with the GroE chaperone system but are not stabilized (cf. Ref. 24.Grallert H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33305-33310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For reasons of simplicity, this interaction is not included in the scheme. Subsequently, dissociation of the inactive dimer leads to monomeric intermediates (M1). These monomers preferably undergo irreversible reactions with subsequent aggregation (Agg.), but a small part can fold to association-competent monomers (M2). However, GroE shifts the equilibrium between these reactions toward the intermediate M2 by decreasing the concentration of M1 in solution and allowing folding inside of cis complexes. Thus, association-competent monomers (M2) are populated. After release from GroE complexes these monomers are able to associate to native dimers (DN) even under nonpermissive conditions. At temperatures above 37 °C, the association-competent intermediates can also “overfold” inside of GroE complexes toward an intermediate M3, which is still reactivatable at lower temperatures, and subsequently to an irreversibly “overfolded” intermediate M4. The slow conversion of the intermediate M3 to M4 is only relevant at long term incubation inside of cis complexes. However, in the presence of an ATP-hydrolyzing GroE system, this reaction is prevented. Rate constants for the single reactions at 45 °C are indicated on thereaction arrows. The rate constant for the conversion from DI to M1 was determined at 43 °C (24.Grallert H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33305-33310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having shown that in GroE complexes a misfolding reaction of monomeric CS intermediates occurs, we were now interested in determining whether the resulting CS species (M3) can be reactivated by GroE. We incubated monomeric CS in stable SR1·GroES complexes or in the presence of wtGroEL·GroES at 45 °C as described above. Reactivation was started in the case of wtGroEL·GroES by a temperature shift to 25 °C and the addition of ATP. In the case of SR1·GroES complexes, we first dissociated the complexes on ice, then wtGroEL, GroES, ATP, and a small amount of GdmCl were added for reactivation. Fig.5 A shows the reactivation kinetics of CS intermediates after a 150-min incubation at 45 °C either with wtGroEL·GroES or in SR1·GroES. Interestingly, only 42% of CS activity can be recovered after incubation in SR1·GroES complexes. In contrast, after incubation of CS in the presence of the wtGroE system, up to 80% of CS activity can be recovered. This leads to the conclusion that CS monomers misfold irreversibly inside stable SR1·GroES complexes to a monomeric intermediate M4: M1 ↔ M2 ↔ M3 → M4. To determine the kinetics of this folding reaction, we investigated the change in yield of reactivatable CS intermediates with increasing incubation times in SR1·GroES complexes at 45 °C (Fig. 5 B). We found that the number of reactivatable intermediates decreased constantly with a rate constant of 0.0038 min−1. After 180 min at 45 °C, less than 40% activity could be recovered. However, in the presence of an ATP cycling GroE system, even after prolonged incubation at 45 °C, no irreversible loss of CS activity could be detected. This result clearly demonstrates that long time sequestration in stable cis complexes can lead to irreversible folding reactions. The above-mentioned results implicate that the time of encapsulation inside cis complexes is critical and that even in functional GroE complexes, the kinetic competition between productive folding steps and misfolding exists. Based on the preceding results we predicted that increasing the time of encapsulation in wtGroE complexes by slowing down the GroE ATPase should lead to irreversible misfolding even in the presence of an ATP-hydrolyzing GroE system. To test this hypothesis we aimed to artificially decrease the rate of ATP hydrolysis by GroEL. To this end we made use of the ATP analog ATPγS, which is hydrolyzed 100-fold more slowly than ATP by GroEL at 45 °C (data not shown). This allowed monitoring of the influence of a drastically decelerated GroE system on the folding of CS under nonpermissive conditions. We incubated CS in the presence of wtGroEL·GroES with ATPγS at 45 °C, as described above. Reactivation was started by a temperature shift to 25 °C and the addition of ATP. As shown in Fig.5 B, the amount of reactivatable intermediates decreased (k = 0.002 min−1), with a slightly slower kinetic as in the case of SR1. In this experiment only 50% of the CS activity could be regained after 180 min at 45 °C. This experiment clearly demonstrates the importance of the GroE timer and folding kinetics for productive folding. We show here that an irreversible misfolding reaction can occur in GroE complexes. This gives insight into the general mechanism of folding inside GroE, since no specific temperature-induced changes in GroE function were detected. Because the encapsulated CS intermediates are monomeric (24.Grallert H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33305-33310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we suggest the following model for their GroE-assisted folding (Fig. 6 and TableI). The unfolding intermediate, M1, folds inside GroE complexes to the association-competent intermediate, M2. One round of ATP hydrolysis is sufficient for this reaction to occur. This intermediate, which can be populated up to 80% in cis complexes, lacks any affinity for GroEL and is committed to associate to the native dimer even under nonpermissive conditions. Under nonpermissive conditions, M2 undergoes a further folding reaction to a state M3, which does not fold directly to the native state and can be trapped again by GroEL. In the absence of a binding and release cycle, the intermediate M3 misfolds irreversibly inside GroE to the conformation M4 in a subsequent reaction. Even after restoration of ATP cycling conditions, M4 cannot be refolded, and CS activity cannot be restored. The conversion of M3 to the irreversibly misfolded intermediate M4 inside GroE is slow and, thus, highlights the critical importance of the timer function of the ATPase for productive folding.Table IRate constants of CS folding in the presence of GroE complexesSR1 · GroES complexStable GroEL · ES bullets awtGroEL/GroES cis bullets were created by an apyrase treatment (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 3).GroEL · ES, ATPmin −1min −1min −1M1 → M21.92.10.65M2 → M30.060.080.05M3→ M40.0038Not determined0.002 bRate constant for the conversion of M3 to M4 in the presence of a wtGroE system with an 100-fold decelerated ATPase (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.5).The CS folding reactions were measured at 45 °C in stable SR1 · GroES complexes, in stable wtGroEL · GroES bullets, or in the presence of an ATP-cycling GroE system.a wtGroEL/GroES cis bullets were created by an apyrase treatment (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 3).b Rate constant for the conversion of M3 to M4 in the presence of a wtGroE system with an 100-fold decelerated ATPase (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.5). Open table in a new tab The CS folding reactions were measured at 45 °C in stable SR1 · GroES complexes, in stable wtGroEL · GroES bullets, or in the presence of an ATP-cycling GroE system. Kinetic simulations using the reaction scheme presented in Fig. 6showed that the conversion of intermediate M2 to intermediate M3 is sufficient to explain the complete loss of CS activity in the presence of GroE at temperatures higher than 37 °C. At physiological temperature (37 °C), CS inactivates slowly but steadily in the absence of the GroE chaperone system. In the presence of GroE, CS is stabilized at a constant level of activity. The fast decrease in activity at the beginning of inactivation reflects the fact that only monomeric and not dimeric CS intermediates fold productively in GroE cis complexes. This folding event leads to association-competent monomers (M2) that associate again to the native dimer. The overfolding reaction (M2→M3) is not significant at this temperature. Thus, in this case, GroE modulates the kinetic partitioning between productive and unproductive folding steps as described for bacterial luciferase (36.Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 712-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since the irreversible conversion of M3 to the intermediate M4 occurred only in stable cis complexes, the ATP-hydrolyzing GroE system is able to actively shift the intermediate M3 back toward the productive folding pathway, most likely by disrupting incorrect intramolecular interactions in CS. Such an unfolding activity of GroE was directly demonstrated for Rubisco by tritium exchange experiments (22.Shtilerman M. Lorimer G.H. Englander W.S. Science. 1999; 284: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of CS (37.Remington S. Wiegand G. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 158: 111-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) gives a hint on the potential structural basis of the overfolding reaction. It could well be that the loop/helix extension of the monomer, which is normally intertwined with the other monomer, folds back on the dimer interface, thus blocking the correct dimer formation. Irreversible misfolding occurs when the protein is encapsulated for extended periods of time in GroE. This argues strongly against a passive role of GroE in which sequestration is the key element for folding under nonpermissive conditions. Analysis of a strongly decelerated GroE system confirmed this. Here, one round of ATPγS hydrolysis took approximately 10 to 15 min. During this time, the CS intermediates were sequestered in GroE, and in agreement with our hypothesis, the amount of reactivatable CS intermediates decreased as in SR1. At longer incubation times the loss of folding competence is slower compared with SR1, due to the hydrolysis of ATPγS. Under nonpermissive conditions, the continuous binding, encapsulation, and release of nonnative proteins is required for GroE to allow folding (cf. Refs. 1.Fenton A.F. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 2.Sigler P.B. Xu Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Annu. Rev.

Fold Design. 1997; 2: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). GroEL is a slow ATPase that is able to direct the energy from substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis to the promotion of the folding process (22.Shtilerman M. Lorimer G.H. Englander W.S. Science. 1999; 284: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 39.Nieba-Axmann S.E. Ottiger M. Wuthrich K. Pluckthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 803-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). What determines the rate of hydrolysis remained elusive. Based on our results we like to propose that the decisive factor for the evolution of the rate of ATP hydrolysis by GroEL is the competition between productive and aberrant folding inside the GroE complex.

However, despite a large array of complexities and diversities, DNA polymerases from different sources and origins share some common mechanistic characteristics and appear to follow broadly similar rules for DNA synthesis. For example, mammalian DNA polymerase β, bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase, human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase, and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (pol I)1 employ a similar two-metal ion mechanism for polymerization (1.Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6468-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 2.Steitz T.A. J. Biol.

In the proposed catalytic mechanism, one of the two metals (metal A) lowers the affinity of the primer 3′-OH for hydrogen, facilitating the 3′-O− attack on the α-phosphate of the incoming dNTP. The other metal (metal B) assists in the leaving of the pyrophosphate moiety. Together these metal ions stabilize the structure and charge of the resulting pentacovalent transition state (3.Steitz T.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In fact, a two-metal ion mechanism of this type appears to be a recurrent theme in many phosphoryl transfer reactions (4.Freemont P.S. Friedman J.M. Beese L.S. Sanderson M.R. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl.

In these analyses, a triad comprising of one carboxylate in motif A and two successive carboxylates in motif C has been used for superposition in the comparison of polymerase structures (15.Yadav P.N.S.

Differential superposition of the carboxylates has also been used to propose a unified DNA- and dNTP-binding mode for various polymerases (18.Singh K. Modak M.J. Trends Biochem.

In pol I, for example, substitutions at either of the two aspartates, Asp705 (motif A) or Asp882 (motif C), have been shown to result in a catalytically inactive phenotype, with a severe reduction in k cat for DNA synthesis. Mutations at two vicinal glutamates, Glu710(motif A) and Glu883 (motif C), have been found to affect catalysis, albeit less severely than the substitutions at 705 and 882 (11.Polesky A.A. Dahlberg M.E. Benkovic S.J. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8417-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the pol I family of enzymes, all four carboxylates are found in the “palm” subdomain, where the catalytic center of the enzyme resides (reviewed by Joyce and Steitz (19.Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar); Ref. 2.Steitz T.A. J. Biol.

The two aspartates have been shown to be involved in the coordination of metal ions in the active site (3.Steitz T.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and are therefore absolutely essential for the nucleotidyl transfer activity of the enzyme. As far as the individual roles of glutamates are concerned, Glu710 has been proposed to play a secondary role in the selection of dNTP substrates over dideoxy analogues (20.Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and has been shown to participate in the exclusion of ribonucleotides by steric hindrance (21.Joyce C.M. Proc.

A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The involvement of Glu883 in the reaction mechanism has remained rather obscure. In this study, we have investigated the overall effect of conserved (Glu → Asp) and nonconserved (Glu → Ala) substitutions at Glu710 and Glu883 on the polymerase activity of Klenow fragment (KF). Besides individual single mutations, conserved and nonconserved double mutations of Glu710 and Glu883 have been generated, and their properties have been investigated, in an attempt to pinpoint the effects of side chain alterations at these two sites. Results clearly indicate that in addition to the essential aspartates, the presence of at least one glutamate, at 710 or 883, is obligatory for DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the presence of this glutamate appears to be necessary for the processive mode of DNA synthesis. Pfu Turbo polymerase for PCR amplification was purchased from Stratagene. PCR grade dNTPs, restriction endonucleases, and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Radiolabeled dNTPs were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Biorex 70 cation-exchange resin was from Bio-Rad. The QIAquick PCR purification kit and QIAprep miniprep kit were from Qiagen. Poly(dA) and poly(rA) with average lengths of 300–350 residues were purchased from P-L Biochemicals, Inc. Synthetic oligomers used for PCR amplification, DNA sequencing, and activity assays (Sequences 1 and 2) were synthesized at the Molecular Biology Resource Facility at NJMS-UMDNJ (Newark, NJ) and were purified by preparative electrophoresis on a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide-urea gel. 49/18­mer3′­CAGGGACAAGCCCGCGGTGACGATCTCTAAAAGGTGTGACTGATTTTCC­5′5′­GTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCA­3′63/21­mer3′­GCAATCGGTGAGGCTTCACGCATATTGCGCGTGCGGCCGCCTGAA...­5′5′­CGTTAGCCACTCCGAAGTGCG­3′ SEQUENCES 1 AND 2 A high level expression plasmid, pCJ141, which carries the KF insert with a D424A substitution to abolish the 3′, 5′ exonuclease activity (23.Derbyshire V.

Synthetic oligomers, carrying the desired substitutions, were used as primers for PCR amplification of pCJ141 by Pfu Turbo polymerase, in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The amplified product was purified using Qiagen's PCR purification kit and treated with 10 units of DpnI (37 °C, 2 h) in order to digest the parental DNA. A 5-μl aliquot was then used to transfect the maintenance cell line, E. coli CJ406, as described by Sambrook et al. (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.82-1.83Google Scholar). The desired site-directed mutations in the transformed clones were confirmed using Sanger's dideoxytermination method for DNA sequencing (25.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing mutations D705A, D705S, D882A, D882E, E710A, E710D, and E883A were a kind gift from Catherine Joyce (Yale University; see Ref. 11.Polesky A.A. Dahlberg M.E. Benkovic S.J. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8417-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA from mutant clones was used to transfect E. coli CJ376, an expression strain used for this study (10.Polesky A.A. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol.

A. 1983; 80: 1830-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Overexpression and purification of WT KF and its mutant derivatives was carried out with slight modifications of methods described previously (26.Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1830-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27.Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13259-13265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, an overnight inoculum of the expression strain was used to initiate a 500-ml cell culture at 30 °C, in an incubator shaker. At A 595 = 0.3, the incubation temperature was raised to 42 °C in order to heat-induce overproduction of the enzyme. After 4–5 h of incubation, cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 2 mg/ml lysozyme. Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the cell suspension was sonicated and centrifuged (14,000 rpm for 30 min), and the supernatant was passed through a DEAE column to remove DNA. The flow-through was fractionated with ammonium sulfate, using 35, 60, and 85% saturations. The pellet obtained with 85% ammonium sulfate was resuspended in 5 ml of Buffer I (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA), dialyzed for 12–16 h against 800 ml of the same buffer, and applied to a Biorex 70 column (prewashed with Buffer I). A 50–500 mm linear gradient of NaCl in Buffer I was used to elute the bound protein. Peak fractions (representing a 68-kDa protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled, protein was precipitated with 75% ammonium sulfate, redissolved in Buffer II (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl), and dialyzed against the same buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford colorimetric assay (28.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and enzyme stocks (typically 1 mg/ml Buffer II with 50% glycerol) were stored at −20 °C. Template-directed DNA polymerization activity of WT and mutant enzymes was determined by two methods as follows. The assay was performed with heteropolymeric 63/21-mer (Sequence 2) as well as homopolymeric (poly(dA)-(dT)18, (dC)60-(dG)18, or poly(rA)-(dT)18) template-primers. A 100-μl reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.8), 1 mm DTT, 40 μm respective substrate dNTP (mixed with 0.5 μCi/assay of α-32P-labeled dTTP or dGTP depending on the template-primer), 300 nm template-primer, and 7.5 nm WT/mutant enzyme. The reaction was initiated with MgCl2 (at 5 mm final concentration), allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C, and quenched with 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm Na-PPi. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitable DNA was collected on Whatman glass fiber filters, washed with 70% ethanol, and dried, and radioactivity incorporated was determined by scintillation spectroscopy. The ability of WT and mutant enzymes to extend a template-annealed primer was assessed on 63/21-mer heteropolymeric template-primer. The 21-mer primer was 5′-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP, gel-purified, and annealed to its corresponding 63-mer template in a 1:1 molar ratio. The assay mixture (8 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.8), 1 mmDTT, 0.01% BSA, 5 mm MgCl2, a 100 μm concentration of each dNTP, and 150 nmannealed template-primer. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 180 nm WT/mutant enzyme, allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 30 and 60 s, and quenched by adding an equal volume of Sanger's gel-loading dye (25.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Five microliters of the quenched mix (approximately 6000 cpm/μl) was electrophoresed on a 16% (w/v) polyacrylamide-urea gel. Autoradiography of the gel and subsequent analysis were performed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Steady-state kinetic parameters, k cat andK m(dNTP), of the mutant enzymes were compared with those of WT, using conditions similar to the trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay. Heteropolymeric 63/21-mer template-primer (2 μm) was used, with 7.5 nmWT or 22.5–180 nm mutant enzyme. For each enzyme assay, a series of seven concentrations of a mixture of all four dNTPs was used, in order to bracket an expected K m range. Data analysis was essentially as described by Polesky et al. (10.Polesky A.A. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme-DNA binding was examined by a gel shift assay, in which the differential electrophoretic migration of enzyme-bound DNA compared with uncomplexed DNA was used to assess enzyme-DNA binding, with slight modifications of previously described methods (29.Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30.Rechkoblit O. Amin S. Geacintov N.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11834-11843Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 5′-32P-labeled self-annealing 37-mer DNA or a 21-mer heteropolymeric primer annealed to its corresponding 63-mer template was used at a final concentration of 3 nm (3′-OH termini). Enzyme/DNA mixtures, prepared in buffer containing 10 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol, were incubated on ice for 15 min. For each enzyme, 8–10 enzyme concentrations were chosen in order to bracket the expected K D(DNA) range. The mixture was electrophoresed under nondenaturing conditions on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel prepared in 90 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.2) and prerun for 1 h at 120 V at 4 °C. Electrophoresis was carried out with 45 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.2) at 150 V for 4–5 h at 4 °C. Following electrophoresis, the gels were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis, and the distribution of radiolabeled DNA (free versuscomplexed) was assessed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using ImageQuant. The optimal NaCl and Mg2+ ion concentrations required for DNA-directed DNA synthesis by the WT enzyme and its mutant derivatives were determined by the trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay. Homopolymeric poly(dA)-(dT)18 (annealed in a molar ratio of 1:2) was used at a final concentration of 300 nm. For determination of salt optima, polymerase activity of WT and mutant enzymes was determined using NaCl concentrations in the range of 0–240 mm. For Mg2+ optima, MgCl2concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 20 mm. For both studies, WT enzyme was used at a concentration of 7.5 nm, while mutant enzymes were in the range of 22.5–180 nm, in order to obtain a comparable activity range for WT and mutant enzymes. In order to examine the mode of DNA synthesis, homopolymeric poly(dA) template was annealed to a 5′-32P-labeled (dT)18 primer, in a molar ratio of 1:2. The assay mix (12 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.8), 1 mmDTT, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 nm poly(dA)-(dT)18, and the desired quantity of WT or mutant enzyme. The final concentrations of the enzymes were as follows: WT, 18 nm; Glu → Asp mutants, 54 nm; Glu → Ala mutants, 108 nm; E710D/E883D mutant, 54 nm. In order to restrict enzyme-template-primer binding to a single encounter, a ”trap“ consisting of 30 μm each of poly(rA)-(dT)18 (annealed in a 1:2 molar ratio) and 49/18-mer (annealed in a 1:1 molar ratio), with 0.25 μg/μl heparin, was used. To determine the extent of processive DNA synthesis, individual enzyme-template-primer complexes were incubated for 1 min at 25 °C, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of a trap/dTTP mix (final concentration of dTTP was 100 μm). At the desired time points, 4-μl aliquots were withdrawn and mixed with an equal volume of Sanger's gel-loading dye (25.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) to quench the reaction. The effectiveness of the trap was assessed in a control reaction where the enzyme was preincubated with the template-primer together with the trap for 1 min, prior to the addition of dTTP. Uncontrolled synthesis was assessed in the absence of the trap. The aliquots were electrophoresed on a 16% (w/v) polyacrylamide-urea gel, and products synthesized by various enzyme species were analyzed by autoradiography. The pyrophosphorolytic activity of WT and mutant enzymes was determined on poly(dA)-(dT)18, as described previously (29.Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar,13.Kaushik N. Rege N. Yadav P.N.S. Sarafianos S.G. Modak M.J. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11536-11546Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture in a final volume of 6 μl contained 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.8), 1 mm DTT, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na-PPi, and 25 nm 5′-32P-labeled dT18 primer annealed to the poly(dA) template in a 2:1 ratio. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 12.5 nm (WT) or 125 nm (mutant) enzyme, incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, and quenched with an equal volume of Sanger's gel-loading buffer (25.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The mixture was electrophoresed on a 16% (w/v) polyacrylamide-urea gel and analyzed by autoradiography. Of the four carboxylate residues at the polymerase active site ofE. coli DNA polymerase I, two aspartates at positions 705 and 882 are known to be absolutely essential for catalysis (3.Steitz T.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The other two carboxylates are glutamates at positions 710 and 883, which are the major focus of this investigation. We used site-directed mutagenesis to generate three types of mutant enzymes resulting from amino acid substitutions of these carboxylates. In the first type, an individual carboxylate was replaced by an alanine (D705A, D882A, E710A, or E883A); in the second type a single conserved substitution (D705S, D882E, E710D, or E883D) was effected; and the third type represented a double change, where two residues were simultaneously replaced with either an alanine or an aspartate (E710A/E883A or E710D/E883D). While the single mutants served to clarify the role of individual amino acids, the double mutants for Glu710 and Glu883were aimed at the elucidation of a combined role of these amino acids. Since single, conserved and nonconserved, mutations at Asp705 and Asp882 severely reduce polymerase activity, double mutations at these sites were not generated. Since the focus of this study is on the polymerase active site, the WT enzyme and its mutant derivatives used in the investigation also contain the D424A substitution, which renders the WT/mutant enzyme exonuclease-deficient (23.Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L.S. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Hence, WT represents an enzyme with the D424A mutation, while the E710A species contains both E710A and D424A substitutions. All enzymes used in this study have been purified and quantified under identical conditions, and mutant derivatives described are similar to the WT in terms of yield, purity (∼95% pure, as judged by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels) and solubility. A primer extension assay was used as a qualitative measure to compare the DNA-directed DNA polymerase activity of mutant enzymes with that of the WT, using a heteropolymeric 63/21-mer template primer. Mutant enzymes containing substitutions at Asp705 and Asp882 failed to show any extension of the labeled primer (Fig.1). On the other hand, single mutants of Glu710 and Glu883 appear to possess normal primer extension activity. For the WT enzyme, maximum accumulation of the 63-mer product was seen within 30 s of incubation, while the Glu710 and Glu883 mutants showed progressive accumulation of the full-length product requiring up to 60 s. Moreover, products shorter than 63-mer were clearly visible in all of the Glu710 and Glu883 lanes, implying an increased frequency of enzyme-DNA dissociation during catalysis. The E710D/E883D double mutant was more defective than individual single mutations, as judged by the accumulation of smaller length products (Fig. 1, lane DD). The E710A/E883A double mutant enzyme showed a complete loss of activity (Fig. 1, lane AA), similar to that seen with D705A and D882A mutants. A standard acid precipitation assay was used to quantify the polymerase activity of mutant enzymes using homopolymeric and heteropolymeric template-primers, with appropriate substrate dNTPs. Both Glu → Asp and Glu → Ala substitutions of Glu710 and Glu883 showed a 30–70% decrease in catalytic activity on homo- as well as heteropolymeric DNA templates (Fig.2). At both the 710- and 883-positions, the alanine substitution resulted in a more pronounced decrease in activity than the conserved aspartate substitution. The E710D/E883D double mutation of these residues resulted in about 60–70% loss of activity, while the E710A/E883A double mutation had less than 1% of WT activity. Interestingly, RNA-directed DNA synthesis (using poly(rA)-(dT)) by single as well as double mutants of Glu710 and Glu883 showed less than 2% of the WT activity (data not shown). In order to gain further insight into the role of these glutamates, we determined the kinetic parameters of enzyme species containing single and double mutations at 710 and 883. The homologous (Glu → Asp) and heterologous (Glu → Ala) single mutations at Glu710 and Glu883 showed a 2–4-fold increase in K m(dNTP). The double mutants, E710D/E883D and E710A/E883A, exhibited 2.5- and 11-fold increments in K m(dNTP), respectively (Table I). Thek cat values for all of the single Glu → Asp and Glu → Ala substitutions were in the range of a 2–8-fold decrease compared with the k cat for WT (Table I). The E710D/E883D double mutant showed a 3.5-fold decrease, whereas the E710A/E883A double mutant was down by about 115-fold. This decrease ink cat for the E710A/E883A mutant was by far the most pronounced defect seen in single/double mutants of Glu710 and Glu883 (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of wild-type Klenow fragment and carboxylate mutantsEnzymeK m(dNTP) aDetermined by the trichloroacetic acid-precipitation assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A heteropolymeric 63/21-mer template-primer was used at a final concentration of 2 μm.

Lipophosphoglycan and gp63, for example, participate in (i) binding the macrophages, (ii) phagocytosis by macrophages, and (iii) protecting Leishmania from lysis by complement factors, from damages caused by reactive oxygen species, and from proteolysis by hydrolytic enzymes in macrophage phagolysosomes (1.Chang K.-P.

These altered cytokine expressions involve the response of T helper lymphocyte 2 (Th2) and inactivate the Th1 response, leading to the suppression of the inflammatory response of macrophages during the leishmanial infection (9.Huang F.P.

It is, however, not known what gene expressions initiate to trigger these immune responses in the establishment of leishmanial infection.This study shows that B1-containing RNAs in mouse macrophages are regulated in the early phase of Leishmania-macrophage interaction. The mammalian genome commonly contains smallinterspersed repetitive elements (SINEs) such as the B1 sequence in rodents and the Alu sequence in primates (14.Krayev A.S. Kramerov D.A. Skryabin K.G.

In rodent chromosomes, B1 sequences are about 150 base pairs (bp), consist of around 80,000 repetitive transposable elements (14.Krayev A.S. Kramerov D.A. Skryabin K.G. Ryskov A.P. Bayev A.A. Georgiev G.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 1201-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and are highly homologous with the Alu sequence in primates (15.Jelinek W.R. Toomey T.P. Leinwand L. Duncan C.H. Biro P.A. Choudary P.V. Weissman S.M. Rubin C.M. Houck C.M. Deininger P.L. Schmid C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1398-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). SINEs emerged about 60 million years ago, which is also considered the time when mammals emerged, and have rapidly diverged in each mammalian species (18.Labuda D. Sinnett D. Richer C. Deregon J.-M. Striker G. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 32: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The ancestor sequence of SINEs is known as the 7SL-RNA, which is the RNA component in the signal recognition particle participating in the transport of newly synthesized proteins from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum (19.Labuda D. Zietkiewicz E. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 506-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20.Zietkiewicz E. Labuda D. J. Mol.

A. 1993; 90: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The small SINE-RNAs are known to be synthesized by polymerase III (pol III), which recognizes the internal promoter elements inside the SINE sequence. The small SINE-RNAs usually contain many sizes of 5′-flanking regions (22.Deininger P.L. Batzer M.A. Hutchison III, C.A. Edgell M.H. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 307-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), so that the sizes of pol III-directed small B1-RNAs, for example, range from 0.2 to 0.4 kilobases (23.Ryskov A.P. Ivanov P.L. Tokarskaya O.N. Kremerov D.A. Grigoryan M.S. Georgiev G.P. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since these SINE-RNAs are associated with polyadenylated nuclear RNAs and heterogeneous nuclear RNAs, their role is thought to be related to the processing of other RNAs (24.Harada F. Kato N. Hoshino H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25.Balmain A. Frew L. Cole G. Krumlauf R. Ritchie A. Birnie G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 163-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Small SINE-RNAs are not only transcribed, but are also processed as small cytoplasmic poly(A)+ SINE-RNAs (23.Ryskov A.P. Ivanov P.L. Tokarskaya O.N. Kremerov D.A. Grigoryan M.S. Georgiev G.P. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,26.Liu W.M. Maraia R.J. Rubin C.M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The expression of the poly(A)+ small Alu-RNAs are known to increase in cells after such stresses as heat shock (27.Liu W.M. Chu W.M. Choudary P.V. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1758-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), inhibition of protein synthesis (27.Liu W.M. Chu W.M. Choudary P.V. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1758-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), viral infection (28.Panning B. Smiley J.R. Virology. 1994; 202: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29.Russanova V.R. Driscoll C.T. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and UV irradiation (30.Englander E.W. Howard B.H. Mutat. Res. 1997; 385: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These poly(A)+ small Alu-RNAs are also shown as inhibitors of RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (31.Chu W.M. Ballard R. Carpick B.W. Williams B.R. Schmid C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The activated PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2, leading to the inhibition of translation; it also phosphorylates inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB, leading to activation of the transcription of many genes (32.Gale M. Blakely C.M. Hopkins D.A. Melville M.W. Wambach M. Romano P.R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Despite these studies, the role of small B1-RNAs is not clearly defined. SINEs also exist at the 3′-UTR of some pol II transcripts such as large B1-RNAs and large Alu-RNAs (33.Gallagher P.M. D'Amore M. Lund S.D. Ganschow R.E. Genomics. 1988; 2: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34.Coggins L.W. Vass J.K. Stinson M.A. Lanyon W.G. Paul J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 17: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35.Heard E. Avner P. Rothstein R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1830-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36.Vidal F. Mougneu E. Glaichenhaus N. Vaigot P. Darmon M. Cuzin F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The role of the SINEs in the 3′-UTR is also not clear, although some evidence suggests that B1 sequences enhance the stability of pol II transcripts (36.Vidal F. Mougneu E. Glaichenhaus N. Vaigot P. Darmon M. Cuzin F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).The extent to which early gene expression leads to the establishment of leishmanial infection is poorly understood. In the present study, the expression of B1-containing RNAs was studied inLeishmania-exposed macrophages in an attempt to understand the role of differential macrophage gene expression in the establishment of leishmanial infection.DISCUSSIONIt has been thought that the many repeats of SINEs such as B1 and Alu sequences serve some physiological roles, but this has not been proven (49.Schmid C.W. Maraia R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Two important findings were established by this study relating to the SINE-RNAs. First, the pool size of small B1-RNAs is down-regulated in Leishmania-exposed mouse macrophages. Second, the pool size of the pol II-directed large B1-RNAs is up-regulated in Leishmania-exposed macrophages. The down-regulation of small B1-RNAs preceeds the up-regulation of large B1-RNAs, and this alteration occurs within a short period (1–6 h) ofLeishmania-macrophage co-incubation. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of small and large B1-RNAs were not explored in this study. However, the stabilization of SINE-RNAs has been reported to result from the functional alteration of chromatin structure (50.Chu W.M. Liu W.M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1750-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), strength of the internal promoter (26.Liu W.M. Maraia R.J. Rubin C.M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), DNA methylation (51.Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and posttranscriptional stabilization (52.Chesnokov I. Chu W.M. Botchan R. Schmid C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The rapid and transient macrophage gene expressions during the early phase of leishmanial infection have not been extensively reported.There is evidence that the pool size of small SINE-RNAs is altered when cells are treated with specific conditions (28.Panning B. Smiley J.R. Virology. 1994; 202: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29.Russanova V.R. Driscoll C.T. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 52.Chesnokov I. Chu W.M. Botchan R. Schmid C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In virus-infected cells, for example, small Alu-RNAs are up-regulated in human cells (28.Panning B. Smiley J.R. Virology. 1994; 202: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29.Russanova V.R. Driscoll C.T. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When cells are incubated with wild type p53 (a tumor suppresser protein), the small Alu-RNAs are down-regulated (52.Chesnokov I. Chu W.M. Botchan R. Schmid C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Chu et al. (31.Chu W.M. Ballard R. Carpick B.W. Williams B.R. Schmid C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) also showed evidence indicating that small Alu-RNAs have a potential to be inhibitors for PKR. PKR is known to be induced in stressed cells by such factors as UV irradiation and viral infection (32.Gale M. Blakely C.M. Hopkins D.A. Melville M.W. Wambach M. Romano P.R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 53.Clements M.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The activated PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor and inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (32.Gale M. Blakely C.M. Hopkins D.A. Melville M.W. Wambach M. Romano P.R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this manner, the activated PKR inhibits translation and stimulates the transcription in host cells. The activation of PKR seems to be needed for the inhibition of the viral protein translation for host survival, and viruses indeed possess the mechanism to inhibit the activation of PKR for their survival (54.Gale M. Blakely C.M. Kwieciszewski B. Tan S.L. Dossett M. Tang N.M. Korth M.J. Polyak S.J. Gretch D.R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5208-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The transient increase of the small Alu-RNAs after viral infection seems to inhibit the PKR, which may bring the cells back to their normal state. It is intriguing to speculate that the increase in small SINE-RNAs may be related to the recovery of “damaged cells” to “normal cells.” For example, the decrease in small B1-RNAs during leishmanial interaction may be a signal for damaged cells, such that the decrease of the small B1-RNAs may inhibit the recovery from damaged cells to normal cells. Leishmanial interaction may inhibit the induction of the small B1-RNAs in macrophages; this would keep macrophages in a non-viable state while leishmanial infection is established. However, not much detail is known about how leishmanial interaction affects the down-regulation of these pol III-directed synthesis of small B1-RNAs in macrophages. The knowledge of this mechanism will be helpful in our understanding of howLeishmania sends signals to macrophages at the initial phase of infection.Concerning pol II-directed transcripts, many have the B1 sequence mainly at the 3′-UTR (33.Gallagher P.M. D'Amore M. Lund S.D. Ganschow R.E. Genomics. 1988; 2: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34.Coggins L.W. Vass J.K. Stinson M.A. Lanyon W.G. Paul J.

The role of the B1 sequence at the 3′-UTR is not clear, although some evidence suggests that it enhances the stability of pol II transcripts (36.Vidal F. Mougneu E. Glaichenhaus N. Vaigot P. Darmon M. Cuzin F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We selected TFIIS as a representative of the large B1-RNAs because TFIIS is general transcription factor (43.Hirashima S. Hirai H. Nakanishi Y. Natori S. J. Biol.

It has been reported that the families of SINE-RNAs have conserved secondary structures (18.Labuda D. Sinnett D. Richer C. Deregon J.-M. Striker G. J. Mol.

In our experimental system, the expression of the small B1-RNAs was abundant in the control macrophages compared with that in Leishmania-exposed macrophages. This observation may indicate that most of B1-binding proteins are occupied on the small B1-RNAs in control macrophages. Hypothetically, a decrease of small B1-RNAs inLeishmania-exposed macrophages may make more B1-binding proteins available in the macrophage cytoplasm; these could then bind to the B1 sequence at the 3′-UTR of pol II transcripts and stabilize them in Leishmania-exposed macrophages. Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania cause a diverse group of human diseases designated leishmaniasis, which affects over 12 million individuals annually in over 80 countries (1.Chang K.-P.

Such deficiency of CD4+ T cells stems from the affinity of an HIV envelope protein, gp120, to the human CD4 molecule (1.McDougal J.S. Kennedy M. Sligh J. Cort S. Mowle A. Nicholson J. Science. 1986; 231: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Several etiological mechanisms causing the functional deficiency of CD4+ T cells are involved; 1) targeted infection of CD4+ cells initiated by the binding of the virus to CD4, 2) cell fusion induced by binding of HIV viruses resulting in apoptosis of CD4+ T cells, and 3) inhibition of the specific recognition of antigenic peptide/class II major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) by soluble gp120. Extensive mutational analyses on the human CD4 molecule have identified a C′-C“ ridge of the D1 domain as the gp120 binding area (2.Clayton L.K. Hussey R.E. Steinbrich R. Ramachandran H. Husain Y.

The murine CD4 molecule has no affinity to gp120, although it shares 55% sequence homology of the extracellular portion with its human counterpart. Segmental as well as single amino acid substitutions of the human CD4 molecule with murine sequences confirmed the crucial role played by an aromatic ring of Phe-43 in gp120 binding (5.Siddiqi M.A. Tachibana M.

Several reports have claimed that the loss of gp120 binding ability of the human CD4 molecule is unavoidably accompanied by the loss of its affinity to class II MHC molecules, which is essential for its coreceptor function (6.Clayton L.K.

Nevertheless, these studies employed adhesion assays that did not involve specific recognition of MHC molecules by T cell receptor (TCR). The CD4 molecule plays an important role as a coreceptor upon specific recognition of a class II MHC molecule complexed with an antigenic peptide by the TCR. The CD4 molecule has been shown to perform its coreceptor function by forming a TCR·MHC·CD4 ternary complex contacting with a highly conserved portion of the β2 domain of the target class II MHC molecule (8.Gay D.

Today. 1995; 16: 581-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The formation of the ternary complex is believed to raise the total avidity of the TCR·MHC interaction and to trigger cytoplasmic signal transduction by bringing a tyrosine kinase p56lck associated with the cytoplasmic portion of the CD4 into the vicinity of the TCR·CD3 complex for phosphorylation of CD3 chains (12.Staus D.

In this report, we have examined coreceptor functions of the mutant human CD4 molecules. The coreceptor function was evaluated as the ability of the CD4 molecule to assist the recognition of murine class II MHC antigen (I-Ak) by murine allo-specific T cell hybridoma. The study confirmed that the mutations causing the loss of gp120 binding, including the substitution of Phe-43 to Val, simultaneously resulted in the loss of the coreceptor function. Further studies, however, revealed that the basis for the roles played by Phe-43 in gp120 binding and in the coreceptor function assessed in the murine system are different. Mutagenesis of human CD4 using single stranded DNA and synthetic oligonucleotides with mutant sequences was performed according to Kunkel's method as described previously (5.Siddiqi M.A. Tachibana M.

The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm HEPES buffer. Antibody inhibition studies were performed using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to I-Ak β chain (10-2-6, mouse IgG2b), to the mouse CD4 (GK1.5, rat IgG2b) (17.Dialynas D.P. Wilde D.B. Marrack P.

TCR expression of mutant CD4 transfectant 4QBW cell lines was determined using biotinylated mAb specific for the idiotype of QM11 (ID11, mouse IgG1) (15.Suzuki H. Eshima K. Takagaki Y. Hanaoka S. Katsuki M. Yokoyama M. Hasegawa T. Yamazaki S. Shinohara N. J. Immunol. 1994; 15: 4496-4507Google Scholar) followed by addition of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated avidin. PE-labeled anti-mouse CD4 (RM4–5, rat IgG2a) and unconjugated Leu3a were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems (San Jose, CA). FITC-labeled as well as nonlabeled OKT4 and OKT4A were purchased from Ortho Diagnostic Systems (Raritan, NJ). FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG Fc portion (Organon Teknika, PA) was used for secondary staining. Biotin-conjugated gp120 was prepared in our laboratory and used with PE-avidin as a secondary reagent. For negative controls, cells were stained with the FITC-labeled goat antibody to mouse IgG Fc portion alone or PE-avidin alone. The gp120 binding capacity of mutant CD4 molecules was determined as relative binding index (RBI) as described previously (5.Siddiqi M.A. Tachibana M. Ohta S. Ikegami Y. Tahara-Hanaoka S. Huang Y.-Y. Shinohara N. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1997; 14: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, BW5147 cells expressing transfected mutant CD4 were stained with FITC-OKT4 and biotin-gp120+PE-avidin separately. RBI was calculated as: RBI (%)=(MeFL1−McFL1) mutant/(MeFL2−McFL2) mutant(MeFL1−McFL1) wild/(MeFL2−McFL2) wild×100Equation 1 where M e and M cstand for mean fluorescence values of experimental and control staining, respectively, FL1 for staining with OKT4, and FL2 for staining with gp120. The staining of wild type CD4 was included in every set of experiments for the calculation. In the coreceptor function assay, responder cells (2 × 104) were cocultured with 5 × 104 TA3 cells in a total volume of 200 μl on 96-well U-bottomed microtiter plates. After 14 h of incubation, culture supernatants were harvested. The harvested supernatants were serially diluted with fresh culture medium, and the concentration of murine IL-2 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For murine IL-2 ELISA, capturing mAb (JES6–1A12, rat IgG2a), biotinylated detecting mAb (JES6–5H4, rat IgG2b), and peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Sigma) were used. As a coloring substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine was used. Sensitivity of mutant CD4 molecules to HIV infection was assessed on CXCR4-positive HeLa cells expressing mutant CD4 generated by calcium phosphate transfection and G418 selection. The expression of the transfected CD4 was determined by staining with FITC-OKT4. A T cell-tropic HIV-1SF2 had been molecularly cloned as previously reported (20.Luciv P.A. Potter S.J. Steimer K. Dina D. Levy J.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). HeLa transfectants were treated with 2 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C and exposed to 1 ml of culture supernatant containing viruses (p24 antigen at 5 ng/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed and cultured. The levels of p24 core antigen in the culture fluids were determined by ELISA (Abbott, Wiesbaden-Delkenheim, Germany) at 4-day intervals. Several reports have indicated that the human CD4 molecule could substitute the murine CD4 in restoring the class II MHC-restricted specific recognition of murine T cells. (21.Sleckman B.P.

Med. 1994; 179: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, attempts were made to develop a murine recognition system in which the coreceptor function of the human CD4 could be assessed. Human wild type CD4 cDNA, in expression vector pMkit, was transfected into a murine CD4+ T cell hybridoma, 4QBW, specific for an allogeneic class II MHC antigen. 4QBW recognized I-Ak in a CD4-dependent manner and secreted interleukin-2 (IL-2) in response to the recognition. Several human CD4-expressing clones, simultaneously expressing murine CD4 and TCR in comparable amounts with those of the mother line 4QBW, were isolated. Fig. 1 shows the expression of TCR, murine, and human CD4 by 4Q/wild, which is one of such transfectant clones. 4Q/wild as well as 4QBW produced IL-2 when cocultured with a B cell hybridoma TA3, which expressed I-Ak. As shown in Fig.2 A, these responses were inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to I-Ak, 10-2-16, confirming the specificity of the response. The efficiencies of the recognition by 4Q/wild and that by 4QBW appeared comparable as judged from the inhibition curves of the responses by graded concentrations of the antibody. Fig. 2 B shows the inhibitory effect of GK1.5, an anti-murine CD4 monoclonal antibody, on the recognition of I-Ak by 4QBW or by 4Q/wild. The complete inhibition of the IL-2 production response of 4QBW by GK1.5 confirmed the coreceptor dependence of the recognition by TCR of this hybridoma. On the contrary, the recognition of I-Ak by 4Q/wild was only partially inhibitable by this antibody. Therefore, in the presence of an excessive amount of GK1.5 (1:104), graded amounts of monoclonal antibody to D1 domain of human CD4, OKT4A, or Leu3a were added to the mixed cultures of 4Q/wild and TA3. As shown in Fig.2 C, the GK1.5-resistant component of the response of 4Q/wild was inhibitable by these anti-human CD4 antibodies, indicating that wild type human CD4 molecules compensated for the coreceptor function of murine CD4 molecules when they were blocked. These anti-human CD4 antibodies did not have a detectable inhibitory effect on the response in the absence of GK1.5. Similar experiments were performed on three other independently cloned human CD4 transfectant hybridomas with essentially the same results. These results confirmed the earlier reports that the human CD4 could function as a coreceptor in the recognition of murine class II MHC molecules by murine TCR (21.Sleckman B.P. Peterson A.

Therefore, this assay system was employed for evaluating the coreceptor function of mutant human CD4 molecules.Figure 2Compatibility of human CD4 as a coreceptor in murine recognition system. 4QBW and 4Q/wild were stimulated with an I-Ak-positive B cell line, TA3. The amount of secreted IL-2 in 14-h culture supernatant was determined by ELISA. The amount of IL-2 is expressed as the percentage of the amount produced by the respective cell line stimulated in the absence of inhibitory antibodies. A, IL-2 production responses of 4QBW (squares) and 4Q/wild (triangles). The cell lines were cocultured with TA3 in the presence or absence of serially diluted ascites of anti-I-Ak mAb (10-2-6). Average amounts of IL-2 produced in the absence of the antibody were 14 and 9.5 ng/ml for 4QBW and 4Q/wild, respectively. B, failure of anti-mouse CD4 antibody to completely inhibit the specific recognition of 4Q/wild. Serial dilutions of an ascites of GK1.5 (anti-murine CD4 mAb) were added to mixed cultures of 4QBW (squares) or 4Q/wild (triangles) and TA3. C, sensitivity of the GK1.5-resistant component of response of 4Q/wild to antibodies to human CD4. 4Q/wild was cultured with TA3 in the presence of an excessive amount of GK1.5 and serially diluted with Leu3a or OKT4A. These antibodies completely blocked the GK1.5-resistant component of the response of 4Q/wild.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutants 1–5 and 18 were examined for their coreceptor function. Mutants 1–5 have segmental replacement of the C′ β strand, the C′-C“ loop, the C” β strand, the C“-D loop, and the D β strand, respectively, by murine homologous segments. Mutant CD4 cDNA cloned in an expression vector, pMkit, was transfected into 4QBW, and at least three independent clones with reasonable expression levels of the transgenic CD4, endogenous CD4, and TCR were established for each mutant (data not shown). Antigen-induced IL-2 production responses of these clones were examined, and representative results are summarized in Fig.3. In these graphs, the relative amount of IL-2 produced by a given transfectant is expressed as the percentage of the amount produced by the same clone in response to antigenic stimulation by TA3 in the absence of inhibitory antibodies (see Fig. 3legend). The transfectants expressing mutant CD4 molecules showed variable sensitivities to the blocking effect of an excessive amount of GK1.5, whereas the response of the mother hybridoma line 4QBW was almost completely inhibitable. The responses of mutants 1 and 5 (4Q/M1 and 4Q/M5) showed GK1.5-resistant components comparable to those of 4Q/wild, which were inhibitable by additional anti-human CD4 antibodies. Therefore, it was concluded that the coreceptor function of these mutant molecules was not impaired by these mutations. Mutants 2 and 4 showed somewhat reduced coreceptor activities. Mutants 3 and 18 did not show significant GK1.5-resistant responses. The same experiments were repeated with 10 (mutant 3) and 3 (mutant 18) independent clones with essentially the same results. Based on these observations, it was concluded that mutants 3 and 18 were nonfunctional as a coreceptor. A salient correlation between the coreceptor function and gp120 binding ability (Table II and Ref. 5.Siddiqi M.A. Tachibana M. Ohta S. Ikegami Y. Tahara-Hanaoka S. Huang Y.-Y. Shinohara N. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1997; 14: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) of these mutant CD4 molecules was observed. Because mutant 3 had three amino acid substitutions within the C“ strand, contributions of the individual substitutions were studied. As shown in Fig. 4, Phe-43 was the crucial amino acid for the coreceptor function (mutant 6) and other two amino acid substitutions had no obvious effects (mutant 7 and 8). Phe-43 had also been shown to be the key amino acid in gp120 binding (Table II and Ref. 5.Siddiqi M.A. Tachibana M. Ohta S. Ikegami Y. Tahara-Hanaoka S. Huang Y.-Y. Shinohara N. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1997; 14: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The results of the two experiments apparently confirmed the general correlation between gp120 binding and affinity to class II MHC observed with mutant CD4 molecules (6.Clayton L.K. Sieh M. Pious D.A. Reinherz E.L. Nature. 1989; 339: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7.Moebius U. Clayton L.K. Abraham S. Diener A. Yunis J.J. Harrison S.C. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12008-12012Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because the wild type human CD4 molecule functioned as a coreceptor in the murine recognition system, it was rather puzzling that the substitution of the C“ strand of a functional human CD4 by the sequence of a fully functional murine CD4 resulted in a functionless molecule. Thus, we speculated that this substitution might have generated a certain structural incompatibility between the murine C” strand and surrounding structures of the human CD4 molecule, causing certain local distortion of the ternary structure. Therefore, three additional mutants were produced to test this possibility. In mutant 19, the C′-C“ loop along with the C” strand were replaced by the murine counterpart. Mutant 20 has murine sequences in the C“ strand and the C”-D loop. In mutant 21, C“ and the two flanking loops were replaced by murine counterparts altogether. The gp120 binding capacities of the three mutants were examined by cell surface staining assay on murine thymoma cell BW5147 transfected by the respective mutant CD4 cDNA (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 5.Siddiqi M.A. Tachibana M. Ohta S. Ikegami Y. Tahara-Hanaoka S. Huang Y.-Y. Shinohara N. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1997; 14: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). All three mutant molecules had completely lost gp120 binding ability as indicated by the relative binding index in Table II. The IL-2 production assays were carried out on 3 to 10 transfectant clones for each mutant, and representative results are shown in Fig.5. Mutants 19 and 21 had coreceptor activities comparable to that of the wild type human CD4 despite their loss of affinity to gp120. Because these three mutants had lost the Leu3a epitope as mutant 3 did, their GK1.5-resistant IL-2 production was not inhibitable by this antibody. Mutant 20 did not function as a coreceptor. These results suggest a requirement of compatibility between C′-C“ loop and C” β strand for the coreceptor function. To investigate possible contributions of the length of the murine C′-C“ loop and the charged amino acid within the loop in compensating the function, Gly-41 was replaced by Lys (mutant 22) or Lys was inserted between Gly-41 and Ser-42 (mutant 23) along with the Phe-43 → Val substitution (Fig. 6). The insertion of Lys between positions 41 and 42 (mutant 23) partially restored the coreceptor function, whereas mutant 22 (Gly-41 → Lys, Phe-43 → Val) had marginal activity. The results indicated that both the length of the loop and lysine did contribute to, but were not sufficient for, the restoration of the coreceptor function. To examine the sensitivity of the mutant CD4 molecules to HIV infection, the mutant genes were transfected into a chemokine receptor (CXCR4)-positive human cell line, HeLa. The transfected cells were exposed to a T cell-tropic HIV-1 strain, SF2, and cultured. Fig.7 shows the relative amounts of HIV core antigen p24 in the culture supernatants determined on indicated culture days. The transfectant-expressing wild type human CD4 was sensitive to the infection by SF2. The cells expressing Mutants 2 and 4 were also infectable despite their significant loss of gp120 binding ability, indicating that the residual weak binding activities were sufficient for HIV infection. This conclusion was enforced by another mutant with residual gp120 binding activity, i.e. mutant 6 (Phe-43 → Val), which also showed sensitivity to the infection (data not shown). On the contrary, mutant 3, which had completely lost the binding activity, did not confer the sensitivity to HIV infection to the transfectant. Mutants 19 and 21, as expected from the total loss of gp120 binding capacity, did not succumb to the infection either. The consensus constructed through extensive mutational analyses of the CD4 molecule has been that all mutations resulting in the loss of gp120 binding capacity were unavoidably accompanied by the loss of their affinity to the class II MHC molecule and consequently the loss of the coreceptor function (6.Clayton L.K. Sieh M. Pious D.A. Reinherz E.L. Nature. 1989; 339: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7.Moebius U. Clayton L.K. Abraham S. Diener A. Yunis J.J. Harrison S.C. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12008-12012Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The present report largely confirmed the observations by showing that mutations on the human CD4 molecule causing the loss of the affinity to gp120 simultaneously resulted in the loss of the coreceptor function and that Phe-43 played crucial roles in both situations. However, more careful analysis revealed that the bases for the roles played by Phe-43 in the two functions of the CD4 molecule might be different. Chen et al. (24.Chen S. Chrusciel R.A. Nakanishi H. Raktabutr A. Johnson M.E. Sato A. Weiner D. Hoxie J. Saragovi H.U. Greene M.I. Kahn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5872-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) reported that a synthetic mimetic of the β-turn formed by amino acid residues 40–43 of the human CD4 was capable of inhibiting the binding of gp120 to human CD4, indicating that this portion of the molecule has direct involvement in binding to gp120. In our previous reports, it was shown that the presence of an aromatic side chain at position 43 was essential for gp120 binding and, therefore, it was speculated that π electrons might be involved in the binding (5.Siddiqi M.A. Tachibana M. Ohta S. Ikegami Y. Tahara-Hanaoka S. Huang Y.-Y. Shinohara N. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1997; 14: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It is known that the murine CD4 molecule does not function as a coreceptor in the human TCR/class II MHC recognition system. On the other hand, the fact that the wild type human CD4 molecule functioned as a coreceptor in the murine recognition system indicates that differences in amino acid sequences between human and murine CD4 molecules are not critical in the other direction. Therefore, the loss of the coreceptor function in the murine system, resulting from the substitution of the C“ strand of a functional human CD4 by the sequence of a fully functional murine CD4, suggests that this substitution generated a certain structural incompatibility between the murine C” strand and surrounding structures of the human CD4 molecule, and thereby, generated a local distortion of the ternary structure. The C′-C“ loop of the human CD4 consists of only two amino acids forming a hairpin loop (β-turn) (Fig.8). It was speculated that the maintenance of such a structure might somehow be dependent on surrounding structures (25.Lewis P.N. Momany F.A. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The homologous loop of the murine CD4 molecule consists of three amino acids with two glycines at both ends making the loop more flexible than the human counterpart. Thus the structure of the murine C′-C” loop is likely to be much less dependent on surrounding structures. If this is the case, the combination of murine C“ and human C′-C” loop might not reconstitute the right ternary structure. The results obtained in this report are consistent with this model. Another possibility, nevertheless, can also be envisioned. There might be certain differences in the basis of CD4/class II MHC interaction between human and murine molecular pairs, i.e. Phe-43 playing a decisive role in the human pair, whereas, in the murine pair, the interaction being largely determined by the charged side chains of the C′-C“ loop. In fact, the insertion of lysine between Gly-41 and Ser-42 (mutant 23) partially restored the coreceptor function lost in the Phe-43 → Val mutation. However, the restoration by this insertion was merely partial. The difference between mutants 19 and 23 indicates the involvement of not only the lysine residue but also glycine at position 42, suggesting a requirement for more flexibility at this position. Thus it appears that three factors, i.e. lysine in the middle of the C′-C” loop, the length of the loop, and serine at position 42, contributed to the restoration of the coreceptor function. Structural analyses are necessary to elucidate the actual structural changes introduced by these mutations. More importantly, coreceptor functions of the mutant molecules have to be assessed in a human TCR/class II MHC recognition system to see whether or not the observations are reproducible in the human system. It may be argued that they wouldn't, because the murine CD4 molecule fails to function in the human system mainly because of the substitution of Phe-43 to Val. However, it is also possible that the failure observed in such experiments was due to the putative structural change resulting from the incompatibility between the amino acid in the 43rd position and surrounding structures rather than to the direct effect. There has been only a limited number of studies examining the coreceptor function of mutant CD4 molecules. The majority of the studies employed adhesion assays in which binding between CD4-expressing transfectants and class II MHC antigen-expressing cells was measured. We have not been able to develop reliable adhesion assay systems mainly because of the subjectiveness of the assay and the highly variable background of the adhesions. Although the assay system employed in the present report does not allow us to extract pure information on the affinity between MHC class II molecules and mutant CD4 molecules, it provides more comprehensive information concerning the coreceptor function of the CD4 molecule. The CD4 molecule has been shown to perform its coreceptor function by forming a TCR·MHC·CD4 ternary complex in contact with a highly conserved portion of the β2 domain of the target class II MHC molecule (8.Gay D.

Nature. 1992; 356: 799-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and probably laterally with the TCR·CD3 complex (11.Sakihama T. Smolyar A. Reinherz E.L. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 581-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The formation of the ternary complex is believed to raise the total avidity of the TCR·MHC interaction and to trigger cytoplasmic signal transduction by bringing a tyrosine kinase p56lck associated with the cytoplasmic portion of the CD4 into the vicinity of the TCR·CD3 complex for phosphorylation of the ζ chain (12.Staus D. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 13.Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C.

In one series of studies, the ability of mutant CD4 molecules to assist the recognition of class I MHC molecules by class I-restricted TCR was studied (26.Fleury S. Lamarre D. Moloche S. Ryu S.-E. Cantin C. Hendrickson W.A. Sekaly R.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1037-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27.Fleury S. Huang B. Zerbib A. Croteau G. Long E.O. Sekaly R.P. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1848-1855PubMed Google Scholar). In this situation, TCR·MHC·CD4 ternary complexes should not have been formed. The significance and actual existence of TCR-independent interactions between coreceptor molecules and MHC molecules in physiological cellular interactions is not clear. 2K. Eshima, H. Suzuki, M. Tachibana, M. Iwashima, and N. Shinohara, submitted for publication. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the function of coreceptor molecules in systems involving specific recognition of MHC molecules by TCR. We had to compromise and utilize a murine recognition system for evaluating coreceptor functions of the mutant human CD4 molecules, because our repeated long-lasting efforts to develop human systems have not been successful so far. The focused insults on CD4+ T cells by HIV would be avoided if CD4 molecules did not have affinity to gp120. Attempts to block the binding of gp120 to CD4 molecules in vivo by soluble CD4 molecules or peptides were hampered by the development of a CD4-independent variant of HIV-1 in patients and by tactical difficulties in maintaining high levels of soluble inhibitors in vivo. The advancement of the gene targeting technology has opened a path to a novel strategy for the reconstitution of the HIV-resistant immune system. If CD4 structural genes of innocent hematopoietic stem cells of an HIV-infected patient were replaced (knock-in) by a CD4 gene encoding a gp120 nonbinding yet functional mutant molecule, the progeny mature CD4+ T cells arising from the engineered stem cells would be resistant to T cell-tropic HIV-1 infection. Although this strategy may not eradicate viruses in the patient's body, particularly those of the CD4-independent variants, it is expected to reconstitute a functional CD4+ T cell subpopulation and to correct the most serious consequence, i.e. immunodeficiency. Needless to say, this approach requires the developments of a technology for massive propagation of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro and an efficient method for replacing a gene in somatic cells. The recent development of human embryonic stem (ES) cell lines (28.Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12003) Google Scholar) might provide another less difficult approach. Replacement of genes in ES cells is a routine technology now. In addition, the manipulated ES cells can differentiate in vitro into cells of hematopoietic lineage, including lymphoid precursors, but are devoid of mature immunocompetent cells. Such cells may well be taken by patients with severe immunodeficiency without causing graft versus host reactions. Efforts are being made along these lines.
